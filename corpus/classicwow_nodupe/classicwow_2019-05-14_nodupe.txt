Huh? I'm just tired of the unoriginality, half the Reddit in the past week or so has just been recycled office memes maybe with different words sometimes it's just lame
---

---
Leave it to the circle jerkers of Reddit to downvote cuz they like unoriginality, which is why they circle jerk in their echo chamber
---
---
---
Lol omg. 10 hours of my childhood I’ll never get back 😂
---
Genius!
---
I'm gonna agree. Some blacksmithing and engineering recipes have 90 second casts. If you're making items to skill up, that's 7.5 minutes just to gain 5 skill. You could totally take a shower in that time.
---
Auctioneer also tells you the vendor price, which is what I've been using
---
The White Bandit Mask /u/thomcapital is often made to level up enchanting because of the frequency it supposedly provides essences instead of dust. 50-60 in one go isn't out of the question, though I imagine that'd be broken up over several periods of afk time.
---
The trinkets are tailored to each classes' strengths and weaknesses. Warrior and Shaman trinket doesn't break Fear because they have Berserker Rage / Tremor Totem. Etc.
---
Warlocks are the only ones who get shafted IMO. They really want their trinket to break slows and stuns and roots so they can actually get away from a melee, but nope. Rogues get an honorable mention for not being able to break stuns either.
---
How will I follow the streamer around and donate all my materials?
---
auto-correct is funny some times.
---
Winner winner
---
Finally.
---
A meme that isn't from the office.
---
Yep. I mostly PVP'd up to season 2 in arena and Cyclone was the most busted thing in the game. That was a huge change for moves like Sap and Blind, too.
---
I mean, if you interpret thought out formatted responses to be salt I guess that's on you.
---
I can feel the eye strain from here
---
I think you're seriously over estimating the time investment. As a paladin, you're killing a mob every ~60 seconds, the extra three seconds isn't that much, especially when you consider passive regen, or the fact that you save more time by repositioning during a fight near your next fight.
---
Sure, I was not trying to tell people not to level an alt, I was trying to tell people that levelling an alt to sixty *to make gold* is probably not worth it unless you plan to spend a huge amount of time farming.
---
In lots of ways the levelling game is the best part of vanilla WoW, I can easily see how people might enjoy it more than farming five dungeons over and over again for pre-raid gear so they can farm the same raid every week for months.
---
No to Beta! Just release as is!
---
I like the info you bringing to the table man. I believe!
---
I think you mean vanilla, not classic.
---
There is a way
---
I think that's kind of meaningless.  The 8~m or so people that played vanilla includes people that are still playing retail, are focused on that, and have no interest in classic. It includes people who stopped playing not because of changes to the game, but because they just got too busy doing other things and now they don't play anything.  You can't assume that even a moderate amount of vanilla players want to come back. Out of all the people on my friends list who stopped playing, only one stopped because she didn't like the direction of the game and has expressed interest in classic. Everyone else has just entirely moved on from gaming in general or mmo's specifically. I know anecdotes aren't data, but you can't assume that everyone that played classic is champing at the bit to come back.
---
I also think the amount of players on pservers is irrelevant too though.  Lots of them are people who don't want to give a cent to Blizzard. And there's going to be people who didn't play Classic at the time who will want to try it out.
---
There's no way we can know the numbers before it releases.
---
Damn. Hate much?
---
Surprise.  Narcissistic shitty streamers are narcissistic.
---
At lease Towelliee has tits, I guess.
---
As I recall, there are approx. 720 hrs in a month... qq
---
\#nobeta
---
wack. didn't realize that happened.
---
what was the scope of the NDA? How restrictive was it?
---
If you qualify as a full time employee it is against the law to not pay the 1 hour of sick time for every 30 hours worked.  A new labor law went into effect in March for the states that didnt follow this prior.  Does that mean your employer follows the law?  Who knows. I see it happen all the time
---
How restrictive was the NDA?
---
From your criteria I'd go Pally.
---
Tanaris, yes, it was an amazing zone, and an example of what I loved about Kalimdor (the rugged, openness and savage feel). Desolace was just too desolate IMO and there was just no real overarching quest narrative, too much grey, too much damn centaurs, and I couldn't wait to just move on and only revisit for my top 5 classic dungeon (Mara). Actually much of Kalimdor was just so fucking epic and untamed, like Azshara, Ferelas, Winterspring, etc. Just places where civilization just sorta abandoned the land to the native creatures. The zones were somewhat broken in their design even by vanilla conventions, but they were just so epic in scope and full of opportunities to invent your own narrative and assign meaning to the things you encountered.
---
He can duel and PvE that's it
---
He does do his best in PvE (beyond hte basic flaw of wrong spec), he makes no attempt to properly play ret in PvP it's like he doesn't have raid frames.
---
And literally anyone could frame perfect ret pala with enough practice in vanilla raids.
---
When he enters a BG and starts cleansing and freedoming the proper targets maybe he'd be a passable player.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In a real guild he would be the butt of all the jokes, eh raids with plebs solely so they don't kick him out for wasting their time.
---
edit - again we are all on the private server scene. stahp lol. What a joke
---
Guy doesn't even play cuz he thinks blizzard giving him attention will give him patreon subs or something IDK
---
There are tons of items that give you speed increases in vanilla. 2xboots, skull, watch etc. You won't have FAPS and prep for every fight. If you do have all your cooldowns you're talking a 1v1 tournament or duel where Rogues don't always win. Just look up some tournament/duel videos. I can theorize what cooldown beats what cooldown with you forever or you can just watch some videos.
---
Hunter shaman warrior best trinkets
---
No shit.
---
Your probability increases. Your statistics do not.
---
What a braindead comment. I was obviously being hyperbolic.
---
I'm not going to continue into this conversation where we play a fucking moronic game of semantics whack-a-mole where we try and lecture each other over grade school definitions.
---
How about you start trying to read between the lines a little and understand the nuance of conversation and that when someone says something is statistically impossible in this context they obviously mean it is so god damned unlikely that they should be buying lottery tickets.
---
People might like you more if you just go with the flow. I don't like you right now.
---
That looks a lot more cleaner and neater than my setup I have in my basement.
---
Definitely that one little area of Silverpine. I think it's called the Skittering Dark? The amount of time I spent just grinding there to level was ridiculous. Granted I don't suck at leveling nearly as much as back then so I'll probably spend all of ten minutes there on Classic.
---
How do you set up kbm? Where do they rest?
---
skinning/herb, sell everything you pick up, and don't buy anything from the auction house.  Level as frost, figure out what spells suit your playstyle the best, and skip buying ranks of spells you don't use.
---
Sorry to hear, thats more than double what I’ve paid.  May Elune guide you to some cheap finds.
---
I have crafted myself so much gear on my mage with tailoring, leather working for my Hunter, and blacksmithing on my paladin back in classic. I don't know what you guys are smoking LOL
---
Couple = 2
---
Few = 3
---
Some = 4
---
;)
---
Are you sure that's not state law? In any case give me a link to the law, I'd love to read it in its entirety.
---
One of the reasons Hunters are so strong in PvP
---
I remember hitting 60 in a yeti have somewhere. So it must've been winterspring
---
Not a veteran, but have done a lot of research recently. PvE rotation is almost identical in raids, just substitute the Sinister Strike a sword spec would use with Backstab. You may start the fight with Ambush, but that's once per fight. Both play as Combat in early progression.
---
I think from a pure DPS standpoint playing daggers makes humans a less attractive choice. Gnomes and Dwarves have better PvP racials I believe. The builds seem pretty agreed upon from the different sources I've seen, but it does look like with higher gear you can go more into Assassination.
---
In PvP you'll typically want to go deeper into subtlety which is not optimal for PvE. I'd speculate with a good healer you could do good damage in your PvE spec, but you'd probably be a poor duelist.
---
I first dinged 60 grinding undead in eastern plague lands :)
---
Each state has a variation. Just Google x sick leave law and you'll get yours
---
Keep that one down home cuz.
---
No videos/streaming/screenshots, no talking about anything that wasn't in Proletariat released content
---
I did, federal law is 0 days pto, state law here is 0 days pto. Thus, the USA, with some exceptions, requires 0 days of pto given.
---
I'm 29 now and played wow where was 14. My reflexes are absolutely better than they were back then
---
Winterspring, but instead of the Yeti cave like the top post, I grinded the elite frost giants at the southern cliff. I was a warlock so it was easy to get my voidwalker to tank it.
---
got a 36" beanbag desk thingy. beanbag under a thin piece of wood.
---
You didn't really "play" retail vanilla if you were 7-8 lol. You wandered around and didn't do much of anything
---
Boosts were done for WoD, so I wouldn't pin those on Mists especially if you're pinning LFR on Mists as well.

Bro tanaris was one of the best! Zul farak!
---
Edit: HOW YOU GONNA DO WESTFALL LIKE THAT?!?!
---
Hypothetically for the sake of curiosity with those restrictions in place for this closed friends and family beta would we have any more or less information?
---
Alenya alliance guide is perfect though
---
Yeah, Legion was solid. A really different game from WoW of old, but good in its own right. And then BfA took all of Legion and made it significantly worse in most regards, nearly *impressively.*
---
&gt; As a paladin, you're killing a mob every ~60 seconds
---
Who the fuck is that slow? 20-30 I'm averaging 2.5 - 3 kills a minute.
---
It definitely was Blizzard, I mean, they *do have phones.*
---
I have found it worth it to buy green weapons particularly 10-16 ones from vendors.
---
Just depends on your play style. If you are speed running I would imagine it is a giant waste of resources. If you are a slower leveler who likes keeping your profs up, and just being lazy while playing; It can definitely be worth it to buy a green weapon.
---
Can we talk how similiar was Dany to bfa sylvanas in recent episode?
---
&gt;As a former vanilla player, the most "vanilla Blizzard" move would be to announce the game is now live.
---
The fuck you smoking, and can I have some?
---
Add Kargoz to the list
---
I agree, however I'm gonna do all the necessary actions and chores tomorrow morning just to be on the safe side.
---
MC in 40 minutes is easily doable in gear from MC
---
BWL in just over an hour easily doable in BWL gear
---
Instances are right next to each other.
---
By your 20th clear of MC you should be pretty good at it
---
I'm curious about add-ons for launch. How many of them are going to work? Maybe that's already been discussed &amp; I missed it though.
---
what the fuck is a band wagon streamer.
---
Fuck man... I put that part of my life behind me.

Such a great idea

---
Thank you for what? Lol
---
Man, you must be playing with some serious mongos. The Boom Mics are really sweet, I got mine because I've had terrible luck with gaming headset/mics giving out.  However, after using a boom mic I understand why you see more and more people using them with higher up set ups. They are surprising unintrusive, I often forget the thing is right in front of me. And you can wanna get fancy you position the mic up and away so you can still have freedom of movement with your hands. The Sound quality is great but your position to the mic is important, I.E. Joe rogan pulling the mic closer to talk about DMT. 
---
As for the background noise that has more to do with the capture settings then the design of the mic. The mic I have is the MXL Midnight and can be adjusted to capture wide or narrow on the hardware itself, addition to the settings on whatever software you are using. With the Mic being attached to a Boom apposed to just your head you can can position it further way from the keyboard then traditional headset mics . I type rather hard and don't have any problems with key clicks while using open mic on discord once I got the capture settings right. I also play in room shared only with a small rabbit that doesn't make any noise.
---
When it comes to price. I paid 75cent more for my entire mic set up then the cost of the Sennhesier Game Zero($123.99 - Red)  on amazon as me writing this and  $26.72 less if you count the Sennhesier Zero special addition($151.19 - Black). 
---
Price Break down
---
$79.96 MXL 770 Midnight(Came with Shock Mount)
---
$13.99 Neewer Adjustable Mic Boom scissor arm
---
$21.99 Nady SMPS-1X 1-Channel 48V Phatom Power Supply(comes with Cable to connect mic to PPS)
---
$8.80 XLR to Right Angle 3.5(cable from PPS to PC)
---
Total=$124.74
---
I high recommend the boom mics if you have the desk space and the patience to get it all set up. I had a hell of a time getting mic to attach to the boom but after some colorful letter words I was able to prevail.
---
I think there are downranking rules in place so they are not as good if used at a high level? https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Downranking
---
Sorry I didn't mean to come off as overly aggressive. My point was that there's a lot of details we don't know and are based off inaccurate private servers that a lot of people like me are very curious about. Then there's a lot of people like you that don't really care too which is perfectly fine.
---
Private servers have scoured the internet looking for Vanilla information and yes there's a lot of information about vanilla they've used, but there's also a lot that's missing or guesswork (Ony's breath for example).
---
And yea things can definitely change between beta and launch as well so the Beta won't be definitive, but it will give us a better answer than we have now.
---
And in regards to sharding I'd love to see a blue post that clarified sharding. I've been pretty tuned into Classic info and I don't recall any sharding clarification

People still play counterstrike religiously as well, way longer then 5 years straight
---
Except Reddit is users talking to users, and there's no real benefit for someone sharing it. It's all for the betterment of the internet. 
---
Whereas individual people using Reddit to monetize their own content is like someone using a free park to sell stuff.
---
It's not a big deal, I don't sleep over it, but it's douchy as all hell.
---
literally why I am rolling a horde rogue, cause got to be in my happy place when the gankin' begins
---
Towliee did a pretty big 180 though. He didn't just say "no I won't play it's not for me" or something to that effect. He straight up shat on the idea of it constantly. He's clearly a blizzard shill, and because blizzard are now doing it he loves it.
---
If classic got cancelled tomorrow I reckon he'd go back to shitting on it.
---
I did full ubrs on retail on 55. Grp was pretty desperate for a resurrection healer tho (2x resto drood). Got devout chest on this run but never equipped it as i got truefaith vestments ready asap i hit lvl for it
---
[deleted]
---
Yeah, I'm aware.
---
In 2005, people did not know how to raid, and it was a grind to clear even the trash.  Addons were barely a thing.
---
It’s actually a great way to discuss things on a specific subject with a group of people who are interested in the subject. Many of these subjects are not something you can easily churn discussion among regular social circles, sometimes discussing stuff is more fun than watching people play games
---
Vanilla classes WERE balanced in a very loose sense of the word. What I mean is that they were not balanced around equal performance in given scenarios, but around a holistic look at the whole class's journey and experience. For example, hunters had pretty high QoL and general great utility and high skill cap potential, but they had raw limits to their dps potential -- the "balance" is that they will start to lack on the meters around full t2/t2.5, but they level and farm very quickly, have good utility, and start off dealing solid DPS early on. 
---
Feral Druids etc did crap DPS, but they had a lot of nifty utility and buffs that generally justified taking 1 in the raid (innervate and b-rez, ability to pick up adds with bear, pinch healing, etc). Basically, it's not that Blizzard was just straight up braindead and built totally defunct specs, it's just that balance was not thought of as "balanced raid performance" or "balanced pvp performance". It's more like balanced overall experience in the various facets of the game. 
---
The plan was that most players would not really be raiding or pvping at a high end, but rather, doing a variety of emergent gameplay. To this end, most classes will have their moments, and their anti-moments. 
---
In short, the decision process for players should be this - do I want do a variety of stuff, and am I OK not being the best at everything? Yes? Pick the class that seems most badass to you. 
---
Do I want to be the best at something? Most raid DPS? Most pvp pwnage? Fastest leveling and farming? Best raw throughput healer? Most annoying ganker? Etc -- if yes, then pick the class that's first class for that specific thing.
---
A lot of this just sounds petty to me. Reading this thread has given me no reason to stop watching these guys. With that said, i don't go out of my way to watch all their videos either.
---
Druid trinket doesn't break Sap, Hunter traps or Hibernate (which can only be cast on Druids in the first place). They are immune to Sap while in animal form, but not in caster form.
---
They're also vulnerable to Scare Beast, another CC that can only be cast on them, although their trinket does break it.
---
ENFJ-t -- Alliance -- Warrior or Rogue -- DPS -- PvE &amp; PvP
---
I used to travel and play Magic the gathering. The large pictures are signed prints from the Artist RK Post. The pictures on the bottom left are of the wifey and the top is the painting my wifey painted for me. I mainly play resto shaman so she painted the class symbol with the old healing animation leafs behind it.
---
Because you made me think I was fucking crazy I talked to a GM and confirmed my Warrior has been with this account from the beginning.  And the date could be from a merger bug.  If you'd like me to open a ticket to further investigate my viability as a vanilla player let me know and I can give you updates
---
There might be an auto accept add on. There was one in Legion called Legioncon I think?
---
This is one of the most relatable pieces of media I think I've ever seen.
---
Ah yeah, the monetization aspect makes it a whole different beast.
---
I was talking about the "who don't know how to find their own dank content." part, reddit is already for people who don't want to trawl through the sea of shit to find the diamonds.
---
Yea that's a stupid idea.
---
I think there's a big selection effect going on here -- you're only seeing the people who are so obsessed that they're losing sleep redditing about the game 2 months before it comes out, and stuff like that. I imagine (though I could be wrong - classic is a weird thing) that once the game starts, that group will be a pretty small minority of all of the players.
---
Aka Throat Testes

D3 RoS is a good game and D4 is all but confirmed at this point. The fucking mobile game was a slap in the face, I get it, but it wasn't on the level of 'You think you do, but you don't'.

You can't delay something you haven't announced. If they tacked an extra month on it would really make no difference at all.

I never actually done the DM E farming in vanilla so might do that change. But not taking the golden cereal bowl that is the Lightwell, nah I need that hit.
---
Sheeet mayne I was around where every meme came from 4chan and "stumbleupon" was still a thing.

Hell, stumbleupon is how I even found reddit.

To us not but streamers who were told about it yes
---
Wasnt it a wod preorder bonus during the prepatch?
---
No regrowth spec isn't a thing. You can go moonglow/resto to maximise efficiency (and moonglow is a nice side bonus of that spec when your HT crits) but there's no case where spamming regrowth is a good idea, unless you're speed running and the fight only lasts 40 seconds or you're on vael.
---
That LaCroix sparkling water cracked me up
---
From what I've gathered from these comments, somewhere between 10-20% of it is justified reasoning for not liking content creators and the rest is just hate bandwagoning. It is what it is because it's part of the culture in this subreddit now, I just think it's sad that there's so much unnecessary hate that can be bred out of thoughtless bandwagoning. People like conflict I guess.

I did kinda assume that it was only for when MC/BWL are on farm and boss fights last &lt;2 min.
---
But even so, I had to use Rank 3 Regrowth to get any kind of decent healing, and that shit costs 280 mana, so it would OOM me really fast unless I innervated myself and used potion/rune. Definitely a meme spec.

Conveyor-belt grinding was what I imagine snorting a mountain of coke would be like. Keep migrating the pack of 3-5 mobs you're melting simultaneously to make your next pull just as the oldest remaining target dies off. Literally zero downtime... it was better than AoE farming, and was less risky/prone to failure. Nobody talked about or even seemed to know about it. Madness
---
And low effort posts about low effort posts
---
Just like yours. /woosh
---
Thanks!
---
Because Lightwell is really bad in vanilla unfortunately. It doesn't scale with +healing, has a huge cooldown and worst of all the HoT disappears when you take damage. Spirit of Redemption is kinda nice on progress, especially in AQ and Naxx where you frequently wipe on 1-2%. Power Infuse is such a huge buff though that imo every priest should have it. Also the 10% more mana and cheaper renew/PW:shield/holy nova is really nice.
---
Low effort shit misleading post.  I guess you sucked spearmints cock to not get it deleted.
---
Awesome now I know where to gank with my rogue.
---
By the time you can craft something for yourself you are already half past the window of it being good.
---
Consider "Spidersilk Boots", blue boots that require level 20 to use and 150 tailoring to craft. Optimally you would want to start wearing them at level 20 to get the full use of them. Unless you are forgoing leveling for grinding Wool, or spending all of your spell money on Wool on the AH, then you are not going to be past the Wool phase of Tailoring until mid 20s. But lets say you're the luckiest person in WoW and all the Wool you needed actually dropped for you between level 15-20, now you need to get those iridescent pearls. There is only a 3% chance for them to come out of clams that drop off of level 20+ mobs, and only about a 30% chance of the clams dropping from those mobs. So you're looking at grinding 200+ mobs. If you started grinding for pearls at level 20 and did nothing else then you're already 22 by the time you get 2 pearls. You're probably closer to 26 though because you probably didn't drop everything just to grind for pearls, and even if you made it a high priority there are still quests along the way. But maybe you're rich and can afford to just buy the pearls off the AH.
---
So you finally make that pair of Spidersilk Boots at level 25, or 22, or 28 or whatever. Now you have to ask yourself: is it worth putting them on? You could sell those boots for 2-3g on the AH instead. That's a lot of money at level 25. You are going to have a long grind ahead of you for your 100g level 40 mount, especially since you're dumping all of your spare cash into Tailoring.
---
But wait, what's this. A super simple level 30 quest in Desolace that doesn't even require any killing will give you green "Kodo Rustler Boots" that have BETTER stats than the Spidersilk Boots? MANNNN you are going to regret not selling those boots for 3g since you just replaced them with a quest green just a few hours later.

&gt;you wont be playing very long if everything you do results in you getting your ass kicked or failing to get consistent spots in raids to gear up.
---
I mean, that's the thing though, most casual guilds don't really need to kick or care enough to kick some underperforming members. If they have a good attitude, show up on time, do their best, it really wasn't a big deal. We cleared half of AQ40 / a few bosses in Naxx as a casual guild and we had baddies and retadins and all kinds of shenanigans going on. If you want to play a memespec, you will be OK as long as you don't care about being in a serious guild.

Definitely all the big streamers coming together creating some memetastic rumours
---
Get outta here Steve Buscemi!
---
he wont play the beta tomorrow... because there is none xDd
---
Ayyy
---
Yeah, would also love a source as well. Just curious about the whole situation.
---
Heeheeeyyyy It took me ages to find out how to cut out a head and paste it on something m8. Ive put more work in this than most of my studies
---
Well, it is though isnt it?
---
I was in a guild that raided 2-3 nights a week and we were 5 bosses deep into Naxx40 by the time 2.0 was released. As long as everyone showed up, it wasn't nearly that hard. It was hard enough at the time, but not THAT hard. Not even close.
---
I really don't know much about you(Toweliee) at all, but you seem to be doing something right getting all this hate. Keep it up.
---
People are retards, be happy when they don't like you. And hey, you are relevant it seems :P
---
If you’re actually curious: there’s a ton of people that only recently started streaming/creating classic content. Whether you think they’re doing it for easy publicity or not is up to you, but much of the community dislikes TipsOut for this. 
---
I personally think people need to chill out over a 15 year old game
---
A purple man who can shapeshift into animals and is controlled by a man behind a computer
---
Did you reserve big ticket items like Dal'Rends or Truestrike?
---
The office lives forever
---
And how exacly you did your research? I mean, since vendor prices were inflated in somewhere around patch 6.0, there is no way to know the real 1.12 vendor price of a item.
---
lirik definitely the kind of guy to use the rumors to fuck with chat. ppl probably wouldn’t stfu about it in his chat today.
---
Tips out is a noob at vanilla wow. He jumped on the band wagon once he saw the hype and what kind of money was to be made. Let me tell you a quick story. There’s plenty of them trust me but let me tell you one that I WITNESSED myself on stream. Tips invited the best Warrior in vanilla wow into his stream one day called Monkey News (MN) for short. Not only did him and Tips go over a BiS list for warriors, but Tips had no idea which items released in earlier patches or which ones released in later patches. He brings on these people to do the research for him. Ok there’s no example. So after the stream was over and for the next few days Monkey News did not stream and his reason for not streaming for a few days AFTER being on Tips out stream I’d because he didn’t want a bunch of fucking noob ass people being associated with his stream and having people think his name was in anyway tied to Tips. MN is a professional in vanilla wow and Tips is a scrub. So MN didn’t stream for a couple of days because it was like he was almost embarrassed at the fact that he was brought on to Tips stream and Tips had no knowledge what so ever of what they were talking about. 
---
Now let’s talk about Towelliee... I have no problem with anyone by the way, what I DO have a problem with is people being FAKE AS FUCK and jumping on the band wagon for things. I used to watch Towelliee some back in the day a few years ago and ANY mention of either private servers or the thought of Blizzard coming out with Classic realms or anything on the subject NOT ONLY would Towelliee bash and make fun of ANYONE who brought up things like this he would ban people and mock anyone who said anything about it. THAT is what people don’t like and it’s truly sick how these are the type of people who have been invited to these summits, who have inside info on Classic WoW and the list goes on and on... I can only hope that the ONLY reason they have been invited to these things or have any info is for hype ONLY and nothing else. Let’s hope they have no influence what so ever on game design or future plans for classic wow because these are the absolute last people you want. This is why people are upset. There’s so much history and depth behind this stuff so people have every right to be mad and raging.
---
"Hey, there's a rogue in here."
---
"Oh, he's always here. Leave him alone."
---
"You sure?"
---
"Yea, he doesn't cause any trouble. Mostly just hangs around the bar and chats with the dwarves through Discord. After a while they stopped trying to kill him."
---
Off topic, but does Mind Control from priests count as charm, stun, or fear? I assume charm. But does that mean Fear Ward can't remove it then?
---
You are one of the lucky ones, you get to play this masterpiece for the first time
---
Careful! They might downvote you too! lol
---
I"m gonna be honest with ya:
---
I thought  those were all regular plain old vodka. That's what I get for doing this at work.
---
With Ghost Wolf you can run off and leave the warrior to die.
---
Mind Control is pretty fun though.
---
Plenty of people. Frostadamus, StaySafe, Esfand, Alexensual even though he’s a bit of a joke to the community he DOES know his stuff the list could go on.
---
Yeah but what if you're sick for like 2-3 weeks and you dont have enough sick time? 
---
You dont get paid anymore? What kind of stone age thing is that lmao.
---
Oooh yeeeeeeeeah!!
---
If I'm correct Warriors had a way out of fear.
---
i wouldnt say i am "Triggered" but i find them vacuous narcissists and avoid them
---
Alliance scum will never understand
---
It is doable. You will be very gear dependant tho relying on eagle or pure int/stam in your slots.
---
It's probably not worth exclusively for the gp/hr unless you end up farming on the alt for an insane amount of time, but I meant more that if you enjoy playing alts and will have an alt anyway, having a farming alt makes sense for knocking out two purposes with one character.
---
&gt;You won't have FAPS and prep for every fight.
---
Will a mage have all his cooldowns and consumables for every fight? Is there any point to having a conversation if we say "well x class can beat rogues who doesn't have y ability on cooldown"? Sure, I mean, a rogue won't have full health every fight, so I guess any class can 1 shot a rogue who has 1 health?
---
Also, a rogue doesn't need all his cooldowns for every fight, I'm giving you just a few of rogue's cooldowns that are unbeatable for a mage who doesn't get lucky crits. 
---
And of course rogues don't win all 1v1's, but I think the fact we even need to say that they don't win "all" of them testifies to how much better they are in 1v1 than every other class. Even specs and classes that can stand a chance to win in a duel will have far less chances in open world pvp because a rogue can pick when to fight. So he can watch you blow a cooldown on a devilsaur before striking, but if you do the same, the rogue still has a million ways to get away and reset the fight.
---
Used old databases. Are those not accurate?
---
no sense of humor and \*has\* to be right? definitely an alliance player lol
---
Yes. The boosts were included with buying Warlords of Draenor. To pin that on Mists instead of just on WoD, that you bought to get the boost, seems silly.
---
Isn’t it all the same sub anyway, why would it really matter in the long term when they release it if everyone needs a sub anyway to play either retail or classic?
---
I really don't think so, and here's why it isn't plausible:
---
1. The main demographic is 22-30+ year old males, likely with full time jobs that they are available to take vacation days for. Blizzard would want to give their major demographic a reasonable heads-up so they can adjust real life situations based on this information. Which leads us into:
---
2. Whether it's justified or not, Blizzard-Activation is walking on eggshells since BFA release, and Blizzcon did not help at all in the public eye. The thing that Blizzard-Activation would absolutely want to stay away from is negative reactions. The demographic that would be affected the most are the ones that would cause the most ripples and ruckus if they were sleighted in the least. They're attempting to garner good will with each and every move possible, otherwise, what's the point in spending resources in recreating Vanilla wow.
---
3. Blizzard wouldn't use influencers as a marketing pawn for such major news (specifically to unveil the release of classic at the end of the countdown on Towellie's stream or w.e) we're talking about a major release in the gaming community that has people stirring around like crazy, aside from all my friends, my developers at work are all abuzz about this. It isn't a small release that would go under the radar and just be 'dropped' out of the blue. Blizzard would bring out the fanfare, trumpets, marketing team and fireworks if they could. I know this might shatter some egos, but the content creators and influencers that we have, or specially, that were sent out to Irvine are **very. small. fish.** in a much greater pond. If we were talking about streamers that have already mentioned wanting to play WoW Classic, we have Lirik, Summit1g, Shroud, Sodapoppin, Moonmoon, and a slew of other very big name influencers that Blizzard has worked with in the past (from other IPs) and would rather utilize if the news were something as crazy as "okay lol, the game is launched right now, go ahead and download and play it" This lines up with points 1. and 2. 
---
**tl;dr: Tomorrow will be at best, release date and beta, NOT actual classic.**
---
Basically before you get to heavy leather, only skin to get skill ups. After things are green and they don't give you heavy leather they are not worth the time. Once you get to mobs that are dropping heavy leather every time and sometimes dropping 2 heavy leather you should be skinning every mobs (around 33+). Once you reach the beasts level 35-40, you can make roughly 11g an hour grinding with skinning. It will take about 140-160 minutes per level of just grinding with no rest per level to give you a rough estimate. So you can safely make 25g\~ a level. So having 0g at 36 you can still get your mount and all of your needed skills.
---
Night elf hunter - grinding mobs in Silithus. Probably 2006 I reckon.
---
Absolutley do not sell any valuable mats or items for the first 2-3 months. Scan the auction house for people that dont know any better. Buy items that will appreciate in value.
---
Wait required time = profit. Going to make a fucking killing with all the noobs coming in lol
---
Desolace and STV were spot on, although I love Tanaris and un’goro :(
---
I play both factions, but Ashenvale specifically was always more fun as a Night Elf. Totally agree, though; no hate for the horde here.
---
Exactly! I think I have found my calling.
---
I’d bet that if I knew you and could actually give you 5 bucks.
---
No humor in 50000 office memes per day lol it's just cringe, but y'all continue to prove my point
---
31, I never found watching streams to be my thing. I do enjoy people talking about things on Youtube though, and sometimes gameplays (though not an entire session of gaming, so no "VODs" as I think they are called?). I have watched one or two Kripp streams for an hour or so maybe, but only because he is (was) a god.  
---
Your comment made me realize (more) that I've probably grown a bit old.
---
if he blinked with one eye three times it'd be half life, since he blinked with 0 eyes, it's no life in 3 days.
---
Actually the sample size is enough to extrapolate into the millions of people accurately. [See here](https://www.surveysystem.com/sscalc.htm).
---
Or it would be, if there were no other issues.
---
The real issue of this poll is that the population answering it are not average/random/representative of the total population of players.
---
This poll only gives you the accurate spread of classes within the knowledgeable/hardcore players.
---
But within that kind of player, the poll is good enough to assume 99% accuracy, for +- 1.5% on each class, for over 10,000,000 players.

Your Reddit circle jerk lives forever

That'd be tough with an enhancement shaman

On a fresh server the stuff you get will be no use in terms of gold prior to about two weeks into the server. He will hit level 40 on the third day. He can't be using the AH to make any money.
---
I am not even sure this is actually gonna go live. Blizzard now is not the Blizzard of 10+ years ago.
---
Rekt
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/WarCry_Network
---
I’ve always been horde myself but I agree. Westfall is truly a classic, although not as amazing as duskwood. Man I’m kinda jelly at alliance they get some cool ass zones.
---
I definitely have more memories of getting ganked in ashenvale, than the other way around.
---
Agreed I was just throwing out random numbers
---
And an 8 or so hour difference in start time will somehow impede that? On a timeline of about 240 hours playtime average to get to 60 starting later in the day is not that big a deal. It may even be better since you just know the servers are going to be destroyed at first, and likely take some time to stabilize.
---
Warrior can't lose to a Rogue unless you are retarded. I had a Rank11 Warrior and Rank11 Rogue and I never lost against a Rogue. Overpower GG. 
---
You really need to have a near perfect Stunlock to beat a Warrior and most Rogues were way too retarded to be able to do that.
---
here b4 2k upvotes
---
I think it counts as charm.
---
for UBRS items specifically it's a lot harder because you can't just stack a 5 man with casters/a hunter and call it a day, which is what I did for most of my 5 mans and all of my lava runs for HoJ, but specifically for Truestrikes and Dal'Rends I just joined groups as offtank under the agreement I could roll as DPS
---
They're still a massive pain to get because of low droprate and 10-15 man groups but doable. You can also just hard-reserve it one drop at a time and won't have that much trouble filling because even the melee dps will flock to get the other 2/3 drops between 2 Dal'Rends drops and Truestrikes. My friend also paid 25g on drop per party member per piece and advertised his groups that way, which I guess didn't cost too disgusting of an amount for how insane the items are (specifically the shoulders) and saved him a lot of time, but i dunno if paying will be worth it depending how far along in the game it is/how rich you are/etc.
---
Hol’ up. You have to farm Crowd Pummeler constantly because it had charges? Also how long is that BiS for?
---
Warlocks not being able to break stuns is silly, it's probably their biggest weakness.
---
Retaining a sub is easier than acquiring new ones. So keeping subs going because of a spread launch is a better business decision
---
One of the big problems I have is that you won’t even ADMIT that you were wrong in the past. Like I’ve already said before. Any time in the past few years if people in your chat mentioned Classic WoW or private servers or any of that you would bash them, mock them and even ban people. Now all of a sudden you’re pro Classic and all this shit. It’s so fucking fake. I read another one of your comments that if you were in it to make money you would corner yourself as a retail wow streamer. What a joke! No one is going to watch retail or play it when classic comes out so it just goes to show that once again you are only in it for the money. I just can’t stand the fake shit man I think that’s the issue a lot of people have.
---
Yes, although I barely remember it. I became a pro at running dire maul though.
---
Whats wrong with enh shaman while leveling? I plan on going resto at 60 but leveling as enh makes the most sense; especially for 5mans
---
Its my understanding
---
War rogue rogue shaman healer is best setup for 5mans
---
Vanilla Westfall was amazing though
---
&gt;Druids would just trinket it and they can go to bear form to charge at them 
---
I think I already talked about this:
---
&gt;I don't understand what faerie fire is going to do to a rogue if he decides to run away. Just FAP and sprint. Gouge/blind if necessary.
---
Charge doesn't stop a FAP rogue. Even without FAP and no other cooldown, then you can just apply crippling poison and run away from a bear. The bear will have to shapeshift to break snare, but you can blind them when they are in humanoid form or just apply another crippling poison if they get to you again. It's not like bears can dps down a rogue and you can only shapeshift a few times before you oom.
---
&gt;cat form to catch up with them
---
Just gouge the cat. And a cat does not have an answer for 30 second sprints. Don't forget that a rogue can just easily kill a cat who doesn't shapeshift or heal. So I'm not sure what your plan is if you do catch up to the rogue in cat form.
---
&gt;They also have entangling roots if they are outside. 
---
FAPs don't get entangled. And a rogue can blind you or use a number of gadgets/grenades to interrupt you if you try to cast.
---
&gt;Rogues can not get away from a druid.
---
Rogues easily get away from a druid, and in most cases, they can just flat out kill the druid so they don't need to run away. You can only survive in bear form, in which case, rogues can just apply crippling poison to you and run away, forcing you to spend mana shapeshifting until you oom or just running away if you don't break your snare.
---
Prices for stuff bought from vendor will most likely be accurate.
---
Sell prices might be something that changed with the vanilla world nerf TBC got.
---
But you're probably safe.
---
Key and Peele have direct lines to my funny bone. Love this
---
if you’re willing to brag about making money, tell us your yearly take in from streaming
---
Idk why people want a beta so bad... we already played the beta 15 years ago
---
Yeah I talked shit about it when Nost got banned sure. But when it became official It was different?  Put yourself in my shoes.  You got Kungen, Soda streaming and Nost gets axed.  I get a barrage of sperg bats bringing retail hostility to my channel.  Spamming memeing.  Yeah I told them to fuck off and blow me.  Yeah I said I didn't think Legacy would happen.  But then it happened.  But I did say at that time I WOULD PLAY ON LEGACY SERVERS IF THEY WERE LEGIT.  Was I part of the movement? No I never claimed to be.  Was I shitting on people who shit on retail with legacy talk in my channel in a trollish manner? Yeah I did.  Have to realize how many streamers had to go Sub Only mode during that time cause of the viewers of those channels.  It was worse then when Swifty got banned.
---
Sure, but we were also server first guild so we had no guides and we were making the strategies.
---
10 wouldn't get me hooked; 20 definitely would
---
You will get a beta. On mobile lol! Wow immortals!
---
Fresh
---
Ya unless progress from the beta will be kept I won't be playing it to much.  Honestly with how much time is left before the end of summer I wouldn't be surprised if they just do open beta(or soft launch as EA would call it) and skip a true beta.
---
I liked azshara but it definitely feels incomplete/unfinished
---
Stv favors horde slightly because they have three solid quest hubs.
---
South shore favors alliance due the lvl30 alliance versus lvl19 horde.
---
Redeidge will probably the first zone to see PVP.
---
Pvp past lvl 40 changes a lot due to mounts.
---
why is every 'good zone' in this vid a super early level zone lol
---
However much I'd love to hear this tomorrow. I'd be shocked if it wasn't beta and or release date.
---
this is the boomerest shit i’ve read on a sub full of boomers.
---
Jesus Christ I thought I was a cynical prick who hates the world. 
---
I hope they find what ails you friend because that’s no way to be living.
---
Zerker rage
---
Until what level is retial free?
---
Yeah just pop Lichborne when you're low and have everyone Death Coil you back to full, good times!
---
Bc it literally was. The dev team realized too close to launch that the geography was too extreme for it to be questable. It's pretty but there's nothing to do! (although it apparently became a hub for gold farmers)
---
Good cause i spent like 6 hours doing that
---
I agree with this. 
---
Remember when Tips put out that video about how everything will ruins classic lol.
---
Specifically right click reporting. But just overzealous trash most times.
---
I really can't stand that guy. I've watched him a couple of times and every single time he just seems like the biggest poser.
---
Remarkable is such a funny adjective because we know it to mean incredible, but by definition it sounds more like "it's worth mentioning"
---
Horde rogues on my sever used to sit at the bridge between the mage and trade district. If you ported in and were still flagged, you’d be running into the trade district, you get sapped and then 6 rogues would cheap shot you and you were dead in an instant. It was hilarious.
---
I am very uninformed about this whole topic, I don't watch streamers so I have nothing to contribute to the main topic. 
---
With that being said, and this is going to come off as a little preachy, but you come off as way more of a butthole than the guy you replying to up top, not because he's wrong or you're wrong, but because of how you approach it.  Your whole post is basically "NUH-UH!" And you stooped to name calling and swearing at OP, and making analogies that are kind of hard to relate to the main topic that are intentionally extreme to make them hard to refute.  
---
Try and make a rebuttal without doing these kinds of things and generally it will be received as less salty and people will take it more seriously, even if they don't agree with you.  Or you know, get mad, call me an asshole and downvote me.
---
No, but there is medical leave and vacation time. Sadly we can't all be state-sponsored euroneets
---
Where’s the joy ?  UBU right?
---
Don't buy every spell at trainer, only the ones you need to level. Spells start to cost 1g each at level 32. You can save quite a bit this way.
---
i cant even picture this or how it would work with you on a couch or something. im intrigued though
---
Stone cold sober. As a test to my memory I used wayback machine on the world of wacraft site to confirm that for every patch up to 1.11 there was no forward marketing until the patch was released.
---
Lmao that's hilarious about tips if true. I just remember him using sharpening stone on his horde warrior weapon in raids when they had windfury lmao. Not that it's a big deal but acting as if you know everything about the game but you don't even know that....just lol
---
That used to be the old MC attunement entrance when it was introduced in patch 1.3.0. Because of issues such as Tauren not fitting in the window, they changed the teleporter to be a crystal instead in patch 1.4.
---
This lasted for almost entire vanilla until patch 1.11 when the crystal was removed and replaced with the option to teleport when talking to Lothos. If I remember correctly the crystal teleporter was removed because you couldn't use it while dead.
---
The Hunter in the video was just attempting to use the old entrance.
---
In this day and age theres no reason for any guild to not do a PUBLIC point system with literally everything outlined for everyone to see. 
---
That said, there should be discussions if someone with enough points want a minor upgrade someone with the same amount of points having the item be a bigger upgrade
---
Ie
---
5 pts for a 5% vs 5 pts for a 30%
---
Dude has been crying about blizzard having the right click report in classic because he's worried people will do it to him and threaten his revenue, but he does it to other people himself.
---
These streamers are parasites feeding of the hype they generate with rumours.
---
Used to sit outside org as an alliance rogue and wait for people that were still flagged to duel someone, when they finish the duel with 1hp, one shot them and vanish away and see if you could avoid getting aoe’d
---
&gt;  Every time you kill a beast you get 5s more than other people.
---
Heavy leather vendors for 1.5s each so how are you getting 5s extra per kill? Keep in mind that is on level 30 beasts that are already dropping gray junk that vendors for 7s.
---
5s is a HUGE overstatement. Most leather sells for 15c-50c before higher levels.
---
Pick any 2 years besides 2017/2018 from 2010. After Taxes or before? After deductions or before?
---
Note not for bragging just for information.
---
At least they can seduce or silence while stunned... unless I'm totally misremembering
---
I just want to know how xQc gets an invite to beta but ogjeffrey doesnt
---
Has that ever happened in the history of mmorpg betas?
---
Well that explains it!
---
*If* you are Undead SP you do have an insane advantage in all 1v1s. But if you're any other race, your win rate drops dramatically. I've spent maybe 30 hours in the past week dueling Rogues as SP and the difference between UD vs any other race is enormous.
---
If you PM Me your FB id there is a Req old SB thread I can add you too.  I know I am playing Classic full force.  There are a few other old SB folks who will.  I plan to just post on there a few days before release about getting a few folks together.
---
An amazing job? More like bare minimum. A non accurate DB (yes beta will upgrade it) and rushed, outdated guides. Oh yeah a crappy thottbot skin that only works if you make an account on their spyware infested site. Oh yes, top notch!
---
Guess i always play rogue &amp; hunter, which at that level is super good in this area (Stealth for rogue &amp; more movement speed then any other class &amp; pet stun helps too to escape/chase) :D
---
Who?
---
My love for orcs and heavy metal vs my love for original lohan. 
---
Sigh, my penis may win out this time.
---
The frost/shadow/fire spell damage gear from tailoring is amazing and very easy to craft. With vanillas extremely shitty itemization early game for casters it more than makes it worth it.
---
Of course you can have others craft it for you optimally but not everyone is going that route.
---
I would definatly go aoe build, there's no real downside. There are a disgusting amount of resources on where and how to aoe farm while leveling. A lot of them might be more geared towards pservers with higher spawn rates but there's still plenty of spots with good mob coverage to keep you busy. If your raiding mythic in retail then you'll be able to handle the mechanics no problem. For the most part it's just grouping up mobs -&gt; frost nova -&gt; blink -&gt; blizzardx2, cone of cold kite, nova again for another blizz if needed, maybe some cheeky arcane explosions instead if the mobs are low enough. Being ahead of the curve gives you better access to the good spots and it's hands down the best gold/hr to xp/hr ratio any class has access to while leveling. Skinning would be icing on the cake.
---
this seems so unprofessional lol. how does he not have a script?
---
what is your twitch or somewhere where i can support your financially? this is freaking sweet and looks like it took a lot of time and effort to make
---
I am currently testing out stuff in classic. Its notlike this is a new game and progress will be lost d:\^)
---
People not using PTO during launch week is the *best* reason I have heard in support of launching Classic without prior announcement.

Ah gotcha. I don't watch him or any other pserver streamers, tbh. But it always is the ones who project which cry the loudest.

Does any trinket break sap in vanilla? I forget. It’s not a stun effect.
---
Used to sneak into the Stormwind Park District's Tavern on my mage back in WOTLK. They got used to me eventually. I just had to be careful where in the Tavern I stood or I'd get too close to an NPC and they'd call cards.
---
ISTP Horde Warlock (obviously dps :p ) - should be lil bit of both pvp and pve
---
Fear ward definitely has no effect on mind control.
---
Username checks out
---
You get my updoot
---
Shit, I got nothing...
---
... Commotion if ocean? Idk man.
---
You're right, there's no women on horde side
---
Tanaris is one of my favorite zones. The only bad part about it is it's basically STV 2.0 on PvP servers.
---
Wow I totally forgot about the WC3 remake
---
Puck off
---
Nor should they be. I give this prediction a rating of solid.
---
Thorium brotherhood has a rep turn in that uses heavy leather. :)
---
Its blizzards way of giving the good boys a treat, the good boys being retail streamers who look down on playing pservers.
---
I dont think people know what's the numbers are. I'm thinking they are all broke as fuck right now. Not even asmongokds assertonin channel or whTever makes enough to survive. But his stream is another story.
---
I'm right there with you, especially Tanaris, where Zul'Farrak was my first real 5-man challenge. I'll never forget my first time healing the steps event there.
---
Oh no!  It'll forever be left to our imaginations...
---
might be why its called a rare

Yeah, I know what you mean, but if I made this even today I'd be damn proud. I'd show my grandparents xD
---
You can profit while leveling engineering, the dynamite and bombs (mostly dynamite) will sell to a vendor for more then AH mat price for a long time on fresh. There's heaps of things like this for eg x20 silk cloth = 30 s to vendor or 45 silver if you make them into silk bandages. You can find silk on ah for vendor price, some items will be listed on ah for less then vendor to as people won't be bothered to get a price checker addon.
---
Edit x20 silk bandage = 40 s

I played horde only in wrath and felt dirty killing horde scouts in ashenvale as night Elf warrior when I played recently. Did not touch peons.

**&lt;After Dark&gt; Alliance NA - PvE**
---
**Raid Time:** Monday &amp; Wednesday 12:00 AM CT (midnight) and Sunday 7:00 PM CT. **Subject to change upon discussion.**
---
**About:** &lt;After Dark&gt; is a semi-hardcore raiding guild. It will be on a PvP server, because what is vanilla without PvP. It is open to everyone. English is the primary language. I am a busy adult that works 2nd shift. It has been hard to find a raiding guild on current WoW with my schedule. I'm sure a lot of you are in this same boat. This is our chance to experience Classic WoW, while still holding a second shift job. We may be few and far between, so we must come together as **night owls!**
---
**Goal:** My goal is to bring everyone together with a late night schedule. We will be able to **form dungeon groups, raid, and PvP, late at night.**
---
**Expectations:** I expect **you** to be somewhat respectful. But, there is still room to poke fun. And, we **will** be downing **Kel' Thuzad**.
---
**Extra Info:** I am not expecting to be the guild leader, but I can be. I will organize raids and other events, if so. I will promote a select number of **officers**. I do not have extreme Vanilla WoW knowledge, as I only hit level 30 in vanilla. I have played private servers and know the mechanics up through BWL. Again, it was hard to raid with my late night schedule. **If you have excessive Vanilla experience, or raiding leading experience in general, then DM me.**
---
**Discord:** https://discord.gg/fua5p6f
---
**Update:** We are growing! I have multiple pledges from current guild members on V.G. There are also 10 or so members in the discord. Feel free to P.M. me with any questions! **Come join us!**
---
Oh, I totally appreciate it but I can assure you it didn’t take too long! If you’d really like to check me out then just check out my podcast, if you check my post history :) Thanks!
---
That's a great one too! I knew I was forgetting a major FPS, just couldn't quite place my finger on it.
---
It's not gut busting laughter that these gifs bring. It's the relation.
---
 Most of us have watched the office. And we like the subtitle memes. Combine the two and add the context of classic wow and it's very enjoyable. 
---
And the fact that a single person is making these memes daily brings us all together to enjoy and relate together.
---
 He's making a small community by creating these memes for us. We're excited when he releases them. 
---
He is passing the time waiting for classic like the rest of us. But he's providing something in the process. What are you providing to the community?
---
I am a witness
---
How much harder do you think the grind was as a paladin?
---
This checks out
---
I’m not even sure which one is supposed to be the joke
---
I'm 36, played WoW heavily in vanilla, tbc, and wrath.  Classic youtubers actually inspired me to make my own channel and start making videos.  It's been a ton of fun.  It's hard to make original content in a 15 year old game so I think that's where a lot of people's gripes are.  Plus everyone is pretty much ready to lose their shit over the lack of any release date, so I'm sure that doesn't help.  Streaming is definitely something that's more targeted to a younger audience, so a lot of the folks that played back in the day don't like the idea of people that were 8 when the game came out getting a lot of the limelight.  I think it's amazing exposure for the game.  It's going to provide people with a glimpse of the glory days and I'm super excited to see how it plays out.
---
Im hoping it’s a 2 week beta followed by a memorial day launch. I’m working full time through my Masters degree and it’s finals week this week. Just gimme til Sunday Blizzard so I don’t fail my exam!
---
Joining in Burning Crusade was awesome too &lt;3
---
I think you mistake ban and make fun of for actual people breaking rules and friendly banter when someone says "hey Towelliee ahaha Classic run backs were super fun dude am I right?" and "Hey towelliee fat fuckface fucker Legacy &gt; retail #riseup"  The first will start a logical conversation.  The later will get you banned.  Yeah did I go on a ban spree when Nost went down?  Fuck yeah I did it was a fucking cesspool of Kungen and Sodas spergbat children running a muck in my channel.  I said fuck them and their private servers leave us the fuck alone.  If you wanna VOD hunt by all means.
---
Now did i say things like "You crazy legacy will never happen." Yeah I did because at the time speaking with people within there was no notion of the idea until a few months before the Con announcement.  Would you say I am anti- legacy?  I was I am a move forward kind of guy.  I love new content new raids new worlds new expansions.  The idea of being stuck in a loop in one version of the game forever never made sense to me. Then i watched more people like MrGm who I got to know, Staysafe, Esfand, Tipsout basically Classiccast and they definitely made me see the fun in just playing without going all out.  And I thanked them this past Blizzcon (SS &amp; Tips) in person for changing my mind.
---
Blizzard absolutely comes to us for feedback.  If you don't think they talk to all the Classiccast guys then you are crazy.  I mean Classic doesn't need much feedback it will run itself pretty well.
---
So yeah hate me like me, People can change, ideals can change, and I will be going hard until retail becomes active in 8.3.  I still won't paint classic as the mecca of WoW gameplay and I always give valid conversations to the dark side of that era of WoW as well as the light side.
---
Dwarf Hunter in BRD I believe, helping a guildie out.  Was having such a great time didn't even realize how close I was and dinged 60 right before the golem rooms.  Everyone was just as excited as I was because there really weren't that many 60s at that time
---
F

The gooch.
---
If I’d had more bites at the cherry with the template I would have made burning steppes and EPL more of the good ones for sure
---
A quick google search brought up this reddit thread: https://old.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/7bek2t/retail_streamer_towelliee_advocating_separate/
---
You seem fun.
---
&gt;I wasn't even prot spec'd
---
I understand you are telling a humorous story, but it's worth mentioning to anyone that doesn't know, you should not be prot specced tanking in leveling dungeons. Literally put a shield on and you're fine. For the vast majority of not-raid content your problem is going to be threat, not mitigation.
---
Lets say it's going to take you 5d of /played time to get to level 60 which is incredible if you haven't practiced it at all. Lets say you can play 5 hours on average per night (maybe like 10 hours on saturday, 10 hours on sunday, then 15 hours during the week). It will take you 24 days in real time to level up to level 60.
---
It's a huge time investment to level up the appropriate character, class and race.
---
I played prot warrior in Vanilla and I'm going to finish leveling as prot after 50 or so when I shift towards dungeons. You can still quest as prot but it will be slower and you will never die. I strangely enjoy pulling multiple mobs and slowly killing them while not dying. _block-block-shield-slam-crit-to-the-face_
---
In 5 mans you will need to set the pace so be sure to watch your group's mana. Protect your healer. Watch for mobs that get away and attack the healer or ranged DPS. Thunderclap and demo shout are good for quickly getting some agro on multiple mobs at the start of a pull. You might need to rotate through targets to keep holding agro. The rough priority is shield slam, shield block, revenge, and sunder if I remember right. Heroic strike if you have extra rage to dump. My memory is old but those are really important abilities.
---
Tanking can make you feel really good or really bad like after you screw up and wipe the group/raid. Don't beat yourself up over it. No other class has given me the satisfaction of that full range of emotions.
---
I'm 23 and played with my older brother growing up (29). Neither of us watch Twitch regularly, but we know who the popular streamers are. 
---
The only thing that rubs me the wrong way is streamers getting preferential treatment when it comes to beta events, especially when they either never played Vanilla or complained about people campaigning for Classic (e.g. Towelliee).
---
I'd love to get your thoughts on that one. It was pretty much the only zone in Classic WoW that I felt was a complete let-down. It had so much potential too due to Theramore.
---
I mean I was a serious noob at this point. Low 20's. I didn't even have a shield, lol. I rolled up with a two-handed sword and they just pushed me into a pile of mobs. I don't remember how far we made it.
---
Shadoweave will be worth wearing for longer than most crafted greens but it falls into a similar boat when considering crafting it for yourself. It's best if you can wear it as soon as you hit the level requirement, which is going to be well before you're able to craft it yourself.
---
The pants are the earliest piece at level 37 and 225 Tailoring. You'll be lucky if you loot enough Mageweave to craft even 1 bolt by level 37, and it's going to take you a fair bit of Mageweave to get to 225 Tailoring in the first place.
---
But again Shadoweave is greens, not blues, which is what OP posted about.
---
&gt; 3: tips out is a legitimate noob, he has a lack of basic understanding of vanilla and people have found PROOF he put it in writing that he started in cataclysm but now refutes and says he played all of Vanilla as a young boy.
---
can't it be both? as in he goofed around but really started playing in cata?
---
I'm pretty sure I would shit myself with glee.

I’m not falling for the bait. I’m not falling for the bait. I’m not falling for the bait. I’m not falling for the bait.
---
🎵 I’ll be your number one with a bullet 🎵
---
That sounds simple and fair. Doesn't include raid attendance tho. Someone can roll on 10 pieces and never win, while little timmy walks in and gets it first. 
---
I see DKP as a reward for attendance (raid now, get good stuff later with enough points), loot council considers performance and attendance more (at least i did back when i was raid leading) and random rolls are just random. 
---
Why do you consider your version to be a good one? I guess it distributes loot over all players but you could end up in a suboptimal situation where everyone has 3 set pieces and noone has a 4 set bonus (if there is a 4set bonus, didnt raid in vanilla)
---
You would not do that right? You don't like money? Everyone likes money. When you get much money and find a way to get more you go that way. Do not say you would not go that way. Then you would be a liar.

Same with Erwin Rommel. A parasite that feeded from the hype that Germany would be the biggest continent in Europe.

I kinda hope the beta is closed only to current top end retail guilds, community figures with the right credentials and handpicked players by Blizzard staff, and there is an NDA and no streaming of it is allowed. 
---
It sounds like I'm a masochist but I really think its going to take wind out of the sails if a bunch of people start playing and streaming the beta
---
Sounds good, thanks for the reply. I expect I will not be raiding as a dmg slot, even if specced for ele. Not even based on expectations from others, I think I will feel like I will not be contributing DPS-wise. Which is mostly true if you think about most raid mobs (don't have any citations, other than what I remember reading) having uber nature resistance with no/minimal way of decreasing it.
---
No, I fully expect to raid as resto.
---
Looks good! I can see we had a lot of the same ideas on the layout. Luna's not bad by any means, it's more it goes with a cleaner modern style compared to the rest of the WoW UI which i find clashes, but that's me.
---
If I can suggest a change, it might be the DoT timer bars. I used to use chronometer but I found that they used to clutter up my screen way too much. As soon as I switched to a mod that displays dots as icons directly on the nameplates, like [Threat Plates](https://willitclassic.com/view/f9CkwcYtUWf9MNxhb7ti) (retail) or [customnameplates](https://github.com/laytya/CustomNameplates) (vanilla) I've never looked back. It feels much more intuitive to be able to see it while I'm looking at the nameplate.
---
Brah you forgot the part on the left where the Chad teddy bear is destroying the emo teddy bears in the bum.
---
Cuz that's how 1.12 is. Alliance bends horde over
---
I was with you till you got to Nazis......
---
I tried this on a pserver with decent gear in AQ and it really underperformed :( Sounds so good in theory though!
---
I followed up right after that comment with if it's a duel/ tournaments or not. This is a thread about what counters rogue. You're talking about theoretical nonsense about having low HP and everything beating you? What? Ya if any other class jumps you on a rogue you're pretty much screwed.
---
There's tons of high end videos or rogue vs X. They have a good chance of winning 1v1s yes but it's not this 100% win chance you're making it out to be.
---
Yea but knowing that and mapping all of it out to share with everyone are 2 different things
---
I mean crafting your own epics is up there.
---
I'm at work. Saw his name and it got into me... I'm bored...
---
I know I find streams like that absolutely insufferable.  Honestly I don’t like watching wow streams at all unless it was some really good pvper that I was trying to get tips from.  I don’t find someone else playing wow enjoyable in the first place,  but if there just sitting there going “LOL BARRENS CHAT AMIRITE” I literally cringe.
---
Spidersilk Boots! One of the first crafted rares for casters and the mats are incredibly cheap, those boots will last you all the way to the mid-30s!
---
Can we do world pvp?
---
There isn't a huge amount of point in warlock in trying to get away from melee anyway, you have a terrible slow, no root and no movement abilities. You're better of spending any spare seconds casting something that will actually help. Warlocks would like to break stun to help with rogues for sure, but that's about it. You'd never waste it on a slow or snare even if you could.

**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
Nothing is solidified just yet but we’re thinking a single organized raid night either Fridays or Saturdays, starting around 8-9 EST, for targeting 40 player content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Class needs:**
---
We currently could use mages, warlocks, rogues, and maybe a druid or priest or two while hunters seem pretty good. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message @Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
I am also sick of these streamers
---
You have got to be fucking joking me.  Honestly what streamer was even advocating for legacy servers?  The only ones really pushing for them all got banned for playing on private servers.  Not to mention towlie was AGAINST legacy servers even when they were announced. 
---
What a fuckin joke of a person.
---
shipping to canada from the us has been dumb for along time now, doesnt matter what it is.
---
33 and don't see any problem with streamers / youtubers.  Been playing mmorpgs since like 1996.
---
Unpopular opinion, but I hate Teldrassil. Ban'ethil Barrow Den can suck my ass.
---
Comparing streamers to Nazi Germany isn't helping your case of defending what streamers do to generate clicks lmao
---
As far as I know people are sick of low effort hacks piggybacking of the classic hype to build their youtube channels. It wouldn't be as offensive if a couple of the biggest of these channels weren't proven to be full of shit when it comes to their background with the game.
---
If you go onto youtube and search Classic WoW you get a million videos stating the exact same information, you have people reading class guides from 2006 and quoting them word for word in a 10 minute monetized youtube video, and it's genuinely harmful because a lot of the information these people have is either incorrect, based off of incorrect private server parameters or is straight up stolen from a more credible source than themselves with no credit given.
---
No no no. I’m not ready, I still can’t decide on a class!
---
If this could be true, sure I'll take it. Consider no notice and they release late August without any notice. That would be total madness! I'd pull all my hair out, transform into saitama and slap some blizz bois
---
Don't you people read? Read the name of the guy I first commented.... Geez...its not about the streamers.... I love lirik BTW.
---
They can but generally succy is a bad idea for most pvp situations. If you set up succy for a rogue duel a rogue can just skull it off anyway and will still save trinket for fear.
---
Sounds unsurprisingly familiar to any retail player

Yeah I saw it. My point stands
---
Silverpine is dope, WTF do you mean?
---
That's the most fun thing to do with a guild in Vanilla
---
MadSeason, Frostadamous and Ohhgee are the three people I've found who make legit content with legit research and knowledge behind it. Not stolen ideas or reiterating what everyone else is saying.
---
OG is tight too
---
And Deathwish if specced.
---
Silverpine is amazing, I don’t think the meme insinuates that the normal handshakes indicate hate in any way?
---
A point you totally don't understand and twisting to your likings. Great job
---
Nope. Last name starts with Con.
---
You're actually only the second person to ask me that in almost 10 years.
---
As long as there is a beta, the developers of the add ons will have them ready for launch day.
---
already quit bfa. blizz can have my sub back when they launch classic
---
This chart is very useful.
---
Am I correct that Sleep falls under the Charm category?
---
I feel bad for everyone that's going to follow Jaina's Horde Guide. Desolace is HORRIBLE even if it might the most efficient.
---
Josh I’m ashamed of you. No Dun Morogh? You’re better than this. If I didn’t love your podcast I might be upset or something!
---
appreciate the advice!
---
It returns to the sender.
---
Nice, glad to be proved wrong on this one. Probably not as efficient as some of the other spots, but seems like a good alternative if you're not ahead of the crowd.
---
Many content creators are all lumped together with the ones that just milk content.    People lack the mental capacity to distinguish the difference between the two.  Ones who make videos from actual updates and the ones that just make repetitive content, for the sake of having new videos.
---
Multiple earnings meetings that have said Q3. However, they can go back on their word to investors if they feel they’ll make more money by doing this.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s outside the realm of possibility to happen though.
---
Right?
---
How many G apps are you up to these days. I saw you check a few weeks ago and it was over 400 iirc.
---
You're defending something while comparing it to Nazi Germany
---
I mean. uh... Whatever point you're originally trying to make gets lost in that one
---
I normally see this meme as fondness vs melancholy when used like this. while leveling in silverpine is meh, the aesthetic and lore is really cool
---
Haha I apologise! I can’t please all the zones with this one, but for what it’s worth, I’m all good with Dun Morogh ;)
---
I’m neither cynical nor do I hate the world, but classic is a niche game with hardcore appeal
---
I know Desolace sucks ass but it’ll always have a place in my heart for where I first got to level 40.
---
Cool story

Go tell r/wow who might give a shit
---
It will be closed, then you will look and not have access, all the streamers will have access, and this board will be spammed with beta invite memes.
---
I love Frost so much.  Frost, Platinum WoW, Classic Winds, and MadSeason are all a "stop what you're doing and watch" for me when I get notifications.  So entertaining.
---
I always keep dat thang on me
---
Keep dreaming lol. As much as I wish it was true, don't count on it
---
Do we have confirmation if you need any version of wow or not? So is it free to play? Aww shit, here we go again! Another cheap f2p mmo x')
---
ok
---
If you have one really bad DPS and he's causing problems then just let him keep agro and die. Problem solved. Usually when it gets to that point the whole group is glad he died. 
---
Pre-healing isn't likely to cause any problem. Run in and thunderclap, shield slam the skull. Now you got just enough to hang on. Rotate through your targets, shield slam the skull again. If a priest puts power world shield on you at the start ask them to stop. You want to take damage to generate rage especially at the start of a fight.
---
Also sometimes you just gotta ask the hunter to turn off taunt because the pet is stealing your rage!
---
Still true though. It's one of like 2 sites doing something with classic right now, so it's technically the best.
---
I played on a fresh private server where a guy showed me 50g in trade on Day 2. He had only been skinning, crafting green items, and then disenchanting them to make Wands.
---
All his gold he invested back into buying cheap greens which he disenchanted to make more Wands. A genius plan actually when you think about it. 100 casters all buying their 50s wands.
---
I would actually argue that they’d want to release Classic before 8.2. You get a bunch of tourists and returning players and attempt to capture them back into retail after they’ve burned out on Classic for 1-1.1/2 months. Give them free trials for BFA and the such.
---
Classic is just an attempt to make a quick buck and capture players with the hype.
---
I just tried to smack talk that ErwinRommel guy that is probably laughing right now. 😊
---
Pretty sure no one cares...
---
Is this a troll? I am rolling bear tank but most weapons i've seen a kinda useless on bear tanks so you might be serious here. I'm really not sure.
---
k
---
I believe they announced that you don't need to buy the current version of the game, so you should be able to access Classic with just the base game + subscription.
---
I would switch Hillsbrad with Westfall, but otherwise this is pretty good.
---
You’re telling me this simple integration test doesn’t cover all the potential issues?
---
test(“it works”, () =&gt; {
---
  const game = WorldOfWarcraft;
---
  game.makeGoodAgain();
---
  expect(game.broken).toBe(false);
---
});

For when you want your entire neighborhood to witness your guild wipe on Onyxia
---
Your view is reasonable, I mean you played alliance....
---
Lok'tar ogar
---
Nah for real now, I like some aspects from newer expansions aswell therefor I can kinda symphatize.
---
If you were here to give people a real situation as a painting, then how come you never talk about how shit retail is?
---
Tips and Esfand are the worst. Literally nothing original ever. Want to watch some cool classic content? Watch madseasonshow, platinum wow, ohgee, countdown to classic, etc. The guys on classicast regurgitate the same thing for hours and hours and hours of media and idiots eat it up.   No one likes you tips.
---
I want to check what you're supposed to do in what order once you hit level 60.
---
Which Dungeons would you rank in Order of difficulty? I've tried joining a group for Stratholme but we didnt have a key to enter and disbanded again(I think we just tried to enter via a entrance that is only accessible via key). No clue where to get the keys/which dungeon/raid needs what attunement. I know the attunement for MC but that's it.
---
First 60 was a Night Elf Druid, dinged level 60 killing Dragonkin in the Burning Steppes
---
Yeah I definitely expected Westfall to get a warmer response, but overall the whole thing is pretty humorous
---
Good for you, man. 
---
Since you're obviously interested, let me link you to my post in r/BikiniBottomTwitter about why I don't like Sponge Bob.
---
Thanks for posting, I thought they all did the same!
---
Boom!
---
Warrior is so weapon dependent it may be worth it but you'll likely find a decent weapon for much cheaper on the AH.
---
It is definitely worth buying a white vendor weapon though at level 5 after you leave the starting area as it trumps the one you will already have.
---
yes
---
I’m not OP but I’m also pretty disappointed with the overall feel of Dustwallow Marsh. I feel like a lot more could have been done with the Wyrmbog and quests leading up to Onyxia. And like you said, the alliance gets a grand port town in Theramore but it’s just wasted. In my opinion, this could have been a great PvP opportunity between Theramore and Brackenwall Village.
---
It gets mailed back to the sender. If the sender then leaves it in the mail for 30 days it gets deleted. The same goes for auctions, if you leave them in the mail for 30 days they’ll get deleted. On retail you can open a ticket and get deleted mail restored though.
---
LOL WHAT. I have tons of issues with it but I don't shit on it Asmongold style lol.  You have to understand I raid Mythic and have a guild for last 7 years they are my family.  I have shit to do all the time.  I have content to do that I like.  Do I agree with their ideals on certain things? No but I don't fucking watch OTHER content creators videos to justify why an expansion fell short.  I can put that time into leveling alts, raiding, and playing with my viewers.  We just spoke about today how bad ML system is and how shit M+ has become without rewards.
---
Just got a smoker this weekend and will play undead. 
---
It’s settled.
---
Life lesson:
---
If you dont want to do something a large population of people do, there's literally no reason for you to waste your time telling them why you won't be participating. They wont care; why should they?
---
I feel the same way and both sides have valid points. My first ever character was a protection paladin because he was awesome and I never got past 45 cause it was so tedious. Knowing more about classes and help you from investing a ton of time into a very difficult character. But I am thinking of being a warrior and I will definitely be undead and not the orc master race, simply cause I like the idea of an undead warrior more. There is a middle ground between min/max and just truly terrible class choices
---
So Ally Warrior, Shaman, and Hunters can't have a trinket? And same with Horde Rogues and Warlocks?
---
I also love this spot... so shhhh.
---
&gt;Finals week
---
This reason right here is why they will not release. No one is out for summer yet, which means a good portion of their player base will not be able to play for another month.
---
STV is da homie
---
Beta for a game that came out in 2005... good joke.
---
Thanks for sharing. I think this new classic will offer a better experiance than a 1.12  pserver.  I'd give it a go before writing it off permanently. Well wishes to you also.
---
ok......
---
Perfect thanks
---
no, sap is an incapacitate effect which no trinkets can break
---
*realizes he won’t get any viewers once classic launches*
---
*gets called out for flip flopping sides to get some viewers*
---
You: “LOL you think I’m trying to get money, look all these streamers are better than me so how am I going to make any money off of it”
---
Do you realize how fucking stupid you are dude?  
---
You are an actual adult and you just said that.  Jesus Christ good luck finding a job when streaming comes to an end.
---
Awesome thanks
---
Classic Lohan. Way better than Retail Lohan.
---
Crafting helm of fire with that 1 minute craft time got my juices flowing back in the day
---
rogue / mage was good against warrior healer teams generally but had real problems with warlock/druid and hunter/druid.
---
 Warlock especially because you have 0 chance of killing an sl/sl warlock through a druid so you are forced to chase the druid, but to do this u need to stack winter's chill on the warlock because if u just poly him he will either stop it with his felhunter's spell lock or dispel it with his felhunter's dispel magic, if you can't cc him immediately and aren't 2x undead you pretty much lost
---
Or the Beta could be 60s, with T1 so you could decide on which class you wanted to endgame.
---
What is skull?

the fuck out of here carebear

Once my plans to win the lottery pan out, you can count me in.
---
I'll be fucked because I have no time to play
---
Yeh, seemed like it would be good for sniping other healers when you have the T2 5-piece, throwing out 1.3 second Regrowths to snipe lots of healing. But guess not.
---
Them being able to start every fight with a sheep and negate our charge, heal up, drink up, write a sci-fi novel and start a long ass cast on us is grade A bullshit.
---
Good for you dude (or dudette?)
---
Yeah but you have that time into shit talking classic and calling it a joke?  Lol get the fuck out of here.  You can’t shit talk a community and the game they enjoy and then come back and act like you are just part of the squad now because the hype is getting bigger.  
---
You’re such a fucking moron for acting like we are bashing you because you’re not ‘speaking of classic as all rainbows’,  plenty of streamers have actually talked and regarded classic in this light but they did it in a real way.  You talked about classic as a joke and you talked shit on the community for only liking it for rose tinted glasses.  You didn’t just ‘tell the truth’ about classic, we know it has inconveniences.  You straight up shit on it and it’s community.  Then you come back acting like no one remembers?  Get the fuck out of here.
---
Ok
---
I get it bro. You’re too lazy to find a group and would rather click a button and play with random people and have everything handed to you instead of a challenge.
---
Totally. And Theramore is the Alliance city in Kalimdor that arguably had the most significance coming into WoW. Of course they quickly fleshed out Darnassus after that, but at the end of TFT, Theramore became the place I most wanted to see in Kalimdor (it would've been Hyjal if that zone had been available to the public). Theramore itself was okayish, but it could have been so much more. Like you said, it could've been a great PvP opportunity, the Kalimdor equivalent of Tarren Mill vs SS, or STV but even moreso since this would have been somewhere where the friction between Alliance and Horde would be the most noticeable, or where Jaina and Thrall would have been putting in the most effort to keep the peace... Instead there wasn't really any of that except for a few alliance quests. Although indeed the Onyxia attunement quest chain WAS amazing.

You sound like a pissed off kid from 2010 when I was told "DUDE WATCH STREAMING GO DOWN AND YOU BE IRRELEVANT CAUSE WOW BEN DYING"
---
Broooooooooo come on mang.  It's just metrics and predictions based on the sheer amount of people playing.  I have my own community I will always have viewers, I will always be here streaming until I decide I want to stop and retire.  (hoping 6 years) 
---
DO you realize how stupid YOU sound saying "when streaming comes to an end?"  
---
lol
---
What does the timer mean? What kind of timer?
---
Just want to point out that you aren't being flamed for not liking vanilla  
---
You're being flamed because this was a pointless post
---
If you get stunned, then you're also going to get slowed (see: Crippling Poison and Hamstring). Dispelling stuns without dispelling slows still leaves you vulnerable. TBC trinkets work on both effects and it's a noticeable difference.
---
It's an incapacitate. Only Berserker Rage (Warrior) breaks it.
---
Yes I love chicken tenders, and occasionally enjoy a creed song. I am the Alliance.

And the base game is free, just to clarify. All it should cost is $15/month for the sub.

Undead rogue, problem solved.

I don’t know what expected from talking to a man child such as yourself,  I honestly didn’t, but this should have been at the top of the list.

You do you dude.  Stay fuckin dumb.
---
How you gonna do Westfall like that?
---
Seriously though, love what you do. I changed my class based on some of the calls you took. Keep up the good work. Your show gets me through my week!

What type of reputation and what for exactly?
---
Is that a tv series??
---
It's not uploaded yet, they filmed it on twitch last week.
---
It's probably just NDA dropping so then he can release the videos he has been recording in the closed beta.
---
Exactly, so why can't Towellie be excited for Classic WoW now when he used to not be? Blizzard was just as obnoxious about it never happening as he was.
---
Im leaning toward the entire thing being a tease.
---
If not, maybe a release date. 
---
If Classic legit releases tomorrow, I will delete my account . No bullshit.
---
Thats what I thought at first, but then he replied to a comment that said " wow towellie the biggest anti classic guy getting into a beta first. Nice one blizzard" by saying "I am in no beta"
---
Gonna play a new class (warlock) and do everything I didn't do but wanted to in vanilla. New professions and cooking and fishing and raiding. Everything is going to be completely new to me, except race. Duo leveling with an unreliable friend so I'll probably make some healer bros along the way to replace him. Still going to pvp the absolute shit out of alliance. They are NOT prepared. . .
---
imagine being such a dysfunctional human that you berate and condemn people for daring to ask if newer classes will be available in the classic version of a video game
---
not as a casual bear tank lmao
---
Wraith of the Lich.... Chicken?
---
this isnt in terms of agreeing on a topic its a matter of opinion lol jesus fucking christ good thing your job is to stream because youd probably still be pushing carts or bagging
---
i just cant see this much STREAMER hype over a fuckin release date announcement, what are they going to be streaming if its just an announcement?
---
Even though i want classic ASAP releasing it tomorrow with no warning would fuck over a large amount of the Classic audience IMO, with people having jobs, wanting to secure some leave for release
---
Yes, I’m off work tomorrow. So I think it will release.
---
Saved for future reference
---
I don't think they will announce anything. Just about something, like they were invited to blizzard to play the beta client and it's so nice bla bla. But I doubt it will be an announcement. I hope it will be. 😊

dude cmon give yourself some credit!!!
---
you had to figure out which zones were the coolest and the not coolest (ugh!!! desolace...), add some text, thats a lot of freakin work
---
I don’t hate you and I appreciate you responding to my criticisms. Just understand a lot of us are skeptical when these types of things happen especially when you’ve had a history of bashing classic in the past and are now suddenly doing “hype up” streams and are ok with it. Not just you though, same thing goes with Tips, this guy literally came out of nowhere and has tried around every corner to make a buck on click bait Classic WoW themed YT videos and inviting experienced players on to carry his streams. It’s pathetic and fake and we all see right through it.
---
farming pummelers is super tryhard tacts for feral dps, you dont need them
---
I like this theory also. The streamers are very specific in saying 'Videos/Streams tomorrow have nothing to do with classic BETA', hearing this over and over makes me think a full release could be dropped. But I really hope that isn't the case. I need time to prepare and arrange time off.
---
Why is it so common to conflate disagreement with the psychological phenomenon of being triggered?
---
Here's to hoping you're correct!

I'm 99% sure this won't happen but I also don't care about my account.
---
At they're better than the 10millionth box/game guide or "battle station".
---
If it straight launches tomorrow call off work as early as you can. Gotta get the good excuses early.
---
This is exactly what theyre aiming for IMO, they wanted an authentic experience so here it is, we get a random fuckin launch to reduce the amount of people in starting zones and no sharding
---
Warlock/Paladin was the real terror in S1. And Spriest/Warlock before they nerfed Shadow Weaving.

I have mine set up on our big living room TV. I watch The Office with my wife lately until she falls asleep before I play retail.

Ah that guy must also be from CT

Also, the clip of LIRIK saying "OH YEAH CLASSIC WOW BETA TOMORROW IM PROBLY NOT GUNNA PLAY THAT" even though literally nobody in his chat said anytthing about classic, makes me feel like its a bait
---
I'm REALLY torn about playing a druid. It's the class I feel I would enjoy the most, I LOVE the flexibility and self-sufficiency of the class and I want to be a healer at endgame, so I have no problems with that aspect. But I hear so many people talking about how bad druids are and I hear horror stories about druids (of any spec) being refused groups, there only being 1-2 raid spots for druids, the list goes on and it makes me afraid to play one. Would I really be setting myself up to get turned down for groups/raids purely because of my class choice if I go Druid?
---
Originally I mained a priest, then switched to a mage, so I don't have any personal experience with druids in Vanilla. That said, I can't ever remember refusing a druid for a group or a raid spot just because they were a druid. In fact, I remember one of our guild's best healers being a druid. Is it really as bad as everyone says? I like the class and I'm certain I would be good at it, but I don't want to be turned down without being given a chance just because of my class.
---
Edit: Just to clear things up, I'm talking about PvE only. I know it's a different story and druids are much better/more desirable in PvP.
---
dungeons sure, raids not so much
---
its pretty obvious if youre living paycheck to paycheck youre in a rough spot.....
---
Cringe
---
Take the upvote you bag of shit.
---
poor fucking classes that can't break a fear lol
---
I'd rather see those tbh but they aren't exactly something to write home about either.
---
seriously lol all i was surprised about is that the op didn't have any way of obtaining $15 wasnt trying to be a dick or mean to op just kinda crazy to me that someone doesnt have any way to pay $15
---
You raised my hopes and dashed them quite expertly, sir.  Bravo.
---
&gt; "I am in no beta"
---
That can be 100% if he plans on being in beta **tomorrow**
---
I worked out the key to it. Do it last before you leave Teldrassil.  Make sure to do the Spinarets and the Harpies, and the Furbolg Leader and all the rest, before you do the barrow.  If you're 11 or 12 its not so bad.

---
It's not that we thought it was perfect.
---
It's that we loved the imperfections.
---
you right!
---
Anyone who thinks theyre going to aoe farm anything in the first 6 months of classic is delusional. Youre going to be standing there with 7 other mages sniping single mobs as they respawn.
---
Authentic? Vanilla wow had a release date. How is randomly dropping it more authentic? Dont be obtuse.
---
I don't agree with them doing it, but that actually makes sense honestly, especially considering launch is a one and done deal,
---
You're gonna be real upset when they save Classic WoW to be released right when people are feeling the 8.2 content drought.
---
That'll be a couple months after 8.2 comes out and people are considering unsubbing, then boom, Classic drops so they keep their sub and net Blizzard an extra $45 due to timing Classic to be right when 8.2 fatigue hits.
---
If I were a Blizzard exec, there is no way I'm launching Classic before 8.2
---
True, but you have to look at all the streamers who keep saying "tomorrows stream has nothing to do with classic BETA" and following that up with YALL SHOULD WATCH ITS GUNNA BE A HYPE STREAM
---
You obviously have no idea how streamers make money. They create hype for the simplest things to attain viewers to give themselves money dude.
---
It's not even summer yet
---
Wasn’t Soda all in on Classic?
---
Hahaha now I’m with you :P
---
Bro, a lot of streamers are hyping shit then going "lolol jk"
---
StaySafe did that shit for 10 minutes then I closed his stream. "You'll want to watch my stream tomorrow. Call in sick. BUT I AINT AFFILIATED WITH THAT TOWELLIE/OTHER SHIT SPECULATION GOING ON. IM JUST SAYIN YOU WANNA BE ON MY STREAM THE SAME TIME THEIR STREAM IS GOING."
---
Surprised no one talks about "Defcamp and Melderon TV". They do anything from really in-depth analysis on the dps differences in shaman weapon buffs to lore and guides on how to manage inventory space.
---
I mean, odds are it's beta tomorrow.
---
You're legit on some Hillsbrad mushrooms if you think Classic WoW is getting ninja released tomorrow.. Literally the classic release date would be better than beta launching tomorrow, but we are likely just getting beta tomorrow.
---
Authentic as in, there wont be any sharding. To be honest, with possibly millions of people trying to get in the  servers on launch day (if they did do a launch day announcement) it would be pretty much IMPOSSIBLE to get out of the starting zones. Launching the game ninja style would allow for a much more authentic experience.
---
I wouldn’t doubt it.  I just remember going on the wow forums and people constantly linking vods of streamers shitting on legacy servers.  Including towlie.  
---
I wouldn’t doubt soda would be all for it because everytime I would watch him (rarely) he would always talk about how shit retail was.
---
How does anyone understand that guy
---

---
RemindMe! 1 Day
---
For the Alliance, my ass!
---
...It's clearly the beta releasing. Why do you keep saying so adamantly it's release and not beta?
---
Beta makes a million times more sense than a ninja release of WoW.
---
For me I really felt a need to log in everyday to do dailies, weeklies, whatever in retail.  I was pressured to play and missing a day felt like I was missing out and being bad.  In classic, if I don't play for a week, nothing really has changed. I didn't miss dailies, I didn't fall behind in a way that couldn't be caught up by playing a little more on a different day.  Retail wow and many other MMOs today will do everything they can to get you to log in every day, and I think that structured forced play time they push is really casual unfriendly.  I would much rather not play for 4 days, and then when I get a day off to play. Start off where I left off
---
dude i mean like really
---
putting TEXT, on a VIDEO??? are you freakin crazy? how do you have the time for this?? somebody get this guy a monsta or a 5 hour energy! hes gonna need it!
---
That's what I thought. Stay frosty
---
Of course I know how they make money, but do you honestly think that all these streamers and youtubers got together to randomly hype up a fuckin tuesday morning? be real with me here
---
So pretty much confirmed friends&amp;family beta only or else the normies would say they received a beta email.
---
Oh god, that is just embarrassing for gamers all over the world.
---
With no advertising, no cross promotion with retail, nothing expert a few lame ass fuck streamers click baiting people? 
---
That would be the worst possible move by blizzard.
---
Uh why? To screw those with actual jobs?
---
This makes total sense, would suck but makes sense. I just think the game is so beyond dead right now and classic wow hype is at an all time high that they WOULD consider releasing it before 8.2
---
Vanilla mobile... gods, don't give me nightmares.
---
I've owned two optoma projectors that I got on Amazon for about $550. Absolutely no input lag on either. Fwiw, I've gotten diamond on rocket league, smite, and overwatch playing on my projector.
---
I too am interested in a Dad guild. I have seen a few in the recruitment threads, but I have yet to find a US Alliance PVE guild. I'm also a little worried that none of us are going to have the time to run a guild, even if it a casual one. :)
---
It's one of the most effective items for Feral as it adds more DPS and threat generation. It's legit. That said, if you're talking casual-casual that doesn't sound like effort you'd want to put in as they have charges so you'll have to farm them constantly (I think on average you can get 2 per hour due to the instance lock and droprate).
---
If you're serious about raid tanking, you're probably looking at farming those though. But it'll highly depend on what (casual) guild you'll join. Chances are a guild that isn't remotely fussed will be fine either way. Just don't expect to progress remotely fast. But similarly, most guild/raid leaders are probably looking at more optimal guilds for inspiration and might as a result decide on warrior tanks.
---
As for dungeons, you definitely don't need them there and will do absolutely fine guaranteed.
---
This isn't a patch.
---
That’s what you thought?  That it’s a waste of time talking to someone as fucking dumb as you are?  Lol Jesus man you have to make it at least a little challenging.
---
Yeah, there’s a quest in Mulgore that I like that generally needs a group to complete. That green mace usually lasts until Zhevra Axe from killing harpies in the Barrens at 14. I might spam generally chat for white weapons instead of buying them from vendor before that. And Crescent Staff is pretty nice at level 20. It’s be nice to keep Axe skill up though for when weapon skill actually matters.
---

Gonna get casually killed pretty quick in STV
---
It has been live this whole time and we never even knew
---
Because when they said "if we do even do a beta for classic it would only be for a short amount of time, a week maybe 2 weeks." These content providers HAVE been beta testing it already, and they don't need to stress test it because its using the same damn severs as retail is.
---
Female Tauren is BiS
---
do you actually think this millionaire benefits from spreading an already 99% confirmed rumor seconds before he ENDS his stream?
---
I think priest slightly edges out shaman due to being able to dispel your warrior buddy.
---
Play what you want though. If you're gravitati g towards shaman, do it. They're both offensive healers, with shaman maybe casting more damage spells than a priest would. Both need to focus on mana conservation and casting smart, regening when it makes sense, and kicking ass.
---
The crazy windfury totem instakills that will happen sometimes would definitely be worth it
---
Idk anyone that's saying release is tomorrow, just a big announcement is likely coming in the next two days
---
Theyre hyping an announcement or a beta... theyre not hyping a release.
---
Really makes me wonder why you spend time on a classic wow subreddit if you have no intentions of playing the game.
---
I was wondering why people always threw extra salt his way, it makes me laugh that it's this unnecessary lol
---
No.
---
PVE exists.
---
Hey thanks man :) id be the newbie scrub, but Im sure Ill find a good fit somewhere
---
I appreciate it!
---
It will be fun to se if this is true I have a sneaky suspicion that aoe grinding will be alot worse than ppl think. The mob concentration will be lower then on pserver and whit no dynamic respawn and the possibility to spawn different mobs (mele/casters) it will be fun to see

Absolutely go for it. Ultimately, play what you think you'll enjoy most. If you're open to healing, you've surpassed the main obstacle druids have.

They're one of the best for leveling (beyond the egregiously slow 1-10). You can do any role in dungeons with one and the same spec and dungeon groups will love druid tanks (and healers if you got someone to cover resurrecting). They're fantastic in PvP if you get good enough (bit of a skill ladder to climb though). Druid healers will definitely have raid spots.
---
&gt; Is it really as bad as everyone says? I like the class and I'm certain I would be good at it, but I don't want to be turned down without being given a chance just because of my class.
---
Not at all, they're genuinely a great class. There's a big stigma against taking Ferals for raids which is partially correct and partially unfounded. As a result, it can be very challenging finding a spot as feral dps/tanks in raids and balance druids virtually don't exist in PvE at all. Everything else though, you'll 100% be fine and have a very competent class without question.
---
No we will be rolling on PVP server. Raiding will not be taking a lot of time to finish probably so all other days we will have that world PVP fun. Cant miss it!!
---
I can't tell if you are being serious. Is this really what people want?
---
The trinket for Paladins is outstanding.
---
Dropping Fear, Poly, and Stun is excellent when paired with Blessing of Freedom, which removes everything else except Charm.
---
I need to remember to pick one up!
---
Skull of impending doom
---
No idea where you're getting the from. Not what this chart says at all.
---
My reason is that it isn't out yet
---
False. Druid trinket is best.
---
Oh I thought you ended the conversation you want to continue?  What's up?
---
Why would anyone want to see videos of a closed beta of a game that’s already been released?
---
Plenty of time to use paid sick days, though.
---
&gt;I followed up right after that comment with if it's a duel/ tournaments or not.
---
So go reply to that comment.
---
&gt;This is a thread about what counters rogue. 
---
And this is a comment chain talking specifically about mages.
---
&gt;You're talking about theoretical nonsense about having low HP and everything beating you?
---
You were going off on a tangent about how rogues could be beatable without xyz cool down, I made an analogy to tell you that randomly handicapping a rogue does not prove a class can counter it.
---
&gt;Ya if any other class jumps you on a rogue you're pretty much screwed.
---
Wait did you say if any other class jumps a rogue, he's screwed? First of all, rogues can reset any fight and run away if you don't arbitrarily take away their cooldowns. Second of all, we are talking about classes countering the rogue, not setting up perfect scenarios for other classes to have a chance to beat the rogue.
---
&gt;There's tons of high end videos or rogue vs X. They have a good chance of winning 1v1s yes but it's not this 100% win chance you're making it out to be.
---
PvP highlight videos are almost all highlights. Either they out skill, out gear, or out cool down the rogues they kill. In addition to getting the jump on them. If a mage and a rogue plays at the same level and have all their cooldowns and consumables, mages would get destroyed outside of a few instances where crits stack up. Again, FAP and sprint is pretty much all that's needed to shut down 99% of mages. Add in just a few more cool downs like reflect frost spell, absorb damage, health pot, blind, trinket stun, vanish, and a mage is just pretty much helpless.
---
What kind of content do they even make? Is it like guides and informational videos mostly or what?
---
Yeah man I’m with you. Watch me... what? Watch you tell me a release date? Watch you play a beta that’s of a game that’s been out forever now?
---
I played in 2006, I was 9 or 10.  Sure, I was really young and garbage at the game but I was still old enough to enjoy it. Also this is besides the point, I'm just pointing out that the playerbase isn't just 30+ year olds. While that may be the primary demographic, wow fans of all ages will play.
---
No, sleep is it’s own effect
---
Exactly....
---
&gt; You're being flamed because this was a pointless post
---
Why I won't be buying a dildo for my wife to peg me
---
posted in /r/pegging.
---
It would ef over people wanting to take vacation days? I mean that’s not really not effing them over. They can’t cater to people taking time off. They have to release it when it’s best for them
---
Hmmm
---
Restoration shaman is the worst PvP healer in the game, especially for premades and world PvP. Bad single target healing, horrible mana, totems out of range all the time in world PvP. They only have purge which priests have also.  Priest is 100% the better choice.
---
Yeah there will be so many people planning time off and planning to play that the servers will be too crazy
---
Relax it's not even summer yet.
---
It is very likely that they are opening up the beta client to streamers tomorrow.
---
Nope, trinkets dont break traps
---
LOL @ STV
---
It is a streamer conspiracy to make us look crazy
---
This is why Gnome Rogues are better than people are thinking they were in vanilla. Escape Artist!
---
I don’t know, it’s just a gift. I didn’t ask for it, but I’ll use it for the advancement of humanity. Don’t forget to like, subscribe and follow #sellout

Ah I see. Good to know! What is the goal of gaining rep for them? An exclusive item/recipe?
---
Aw I like Loch Modan
---
He was replying to someone asking about Classic in chat. Watch the VOD again, go back a few minutes before the start cut of the clip. He is replying to this comment in chat (posted 8 sec before you hear his reply to them) [https://imgur.com/cWxoYCh](https://imgur.com/cWxoYCh)
---
That honestly fits for me since I'd love to just level at a relaxed pace and immerse myself on an RP server. 
---
The rp is helped by my character leveling and progressively learning new stuff in d&amp;d fashion rather than having a full kit by 20, haha.
---
What you guys don’t have phones?
---
Lol this is going to age well when it doesn’t launch tomorrow.
---
Kidding....
---
[Something like this works](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01C785EJ4/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) for couch gaming.  A 10-keyless wireless keyboard *or* a compact keyboard like a Logitech K360 fits perfectly.
---
If they ninja launch it, that would be the shittiest thing they can do. The main people that wanted Classic are most likely working class adults now. 
---
It would be super fun for the people without responsibilities but for the rest that need to take out Vacation it would be such a fuck you.
---
This subreddits new posts are saying it will be a surprise launch tomorrow and I can’t handle this kind of optimism.
---
lmao well see
---
No, you just need a steady premade that you can hit the top standing with. The "mafia" element from private servers only blacklists people who exceed the agreed-upon honor cap (which can't really be done by accident, anyone who could possibly break it knows what it's about). This honor cap is set to something low enough that a good premade can get there in, say, 8h/day or 12h/day with weekends off. When there's no such unofficial honor cap, getting standing 1 will require playing just as much as whomever plays the most, so like 18h/day 24/7. The purpose of the "mafia" is to keep the necessary amount of grinding low, and everyone who's actively trying to rank up past 11 becomes part of that deal sort of automatically.
---
Millions of people logged into bfa for the launch and it went smoothly for a large majority of players. Some of the massive servers had login issues but for the most part millions of players had no problems.
---
They've already said its releasing later this summer at their Q2 earnings. It's not even summer lol
---
i watched a house mate ding 60 in epl off mobs. he was a hunter, name was jobo. first placed i lived at after high school, there were 10 of us and a requirement to live there was having a WoW account. 
---
i dinged 60 off a boar in hellfire, i joined too late.
---
Wait, was there an actually a blue post???
---
Damn....
---
Similar sentiment, the fatigue is already well and truly here - excitement for 8.2 is at an all time low
---
I'm hoping after naxx we get fresh server. Like a year or something after.
---
Gives us 2 more years again of content. And most guilds can progress through naxx to the end and rape some pvp dick. Then maybe something like wow2.
---
The phone thing. Nehhh. Just my opinion. I dont wanna have to play on my phone. Reminds me of garrison's. Just trash
---
It’s already tomorrow in Australia and I can tell you there is no Classic. Also, Summer isn’t till November.
---
he also tweeted it https://twitter.com/hotted89/status/1128020859589877766
---
Yea you’re right, but what if you wake up tomorrow and you find out that classic is already out and Azeroth is beckoning. The small % chance of that being a possibility is killing me.
---
Ya seriously is there one or what?
---
This is a solid argument I've seen a lot and I buy it. 
---
HOWEVER, hear me out. What if they're banking on "tourists" burning out on classic in 2 months. Right then - they release 8.2. All those who didn't know what they were getting into with classic hop back to retail. Suddenly all the QoL features and changed gameplay feel fresh and desirable to them. 
---
Classic maintains a steady playerbase from all the diehard classic players (myself included), and BoA gets a psychological refresh for those who tried Classic but couldn't get into the grind. As a bonus, some of the culture and community from Classic drifts into retail.
---
 It's a crackpot theory, but it brings me joy.
---
Tanaris is magical, Westfall was awesome. Durator should not be getting so much love, there's no real "magic" about starting out there.
---
nice photoshop /u/definitelyqualified
---
That’s crazy man nice haha wanna queue up for lfr with me?? :) I want a gigaforged socketed leech weapon but I don’t wanna put in the time to  learn how to play or join a community of players :(
---
Where were you during Pearl Harbor
---
I just know on Human at least, when you get to Goldshire there's a white weapon at the vendor that cost like 4s or something but it speeds things up quite a bit until your next upgrade.
---
Shamans had some good tools as well. Tremor, grounding and interrupt.  Ugh
---
I would be incredibly pissed if they randomly surprise dropped it.. can't use vacation time for a few weeks out at least
---
Exactly no one is going to want to see that garbage
---
I would be mad for my work shift then get home and be happy. Its not like the world is over because you didnt start at the same time as everyone else
---
In duskwood you can get the mats at 20 if you're lucky
---
Vanilla lets  you play at your own pace and do whatever is most fun for you. Some people like leveling, or BGS, or wPvP, some like Raiding, dungeons, crafting, playing the AH, etc. 
---
The biggest different is there are no daily quests and the like. There is nothing that compels you to log in due to the fear of missing out on optimal progression. You can play this game NEET style, or just whenever you feel like man
---
It’s because you hate our troops isn’t it Josh?
---
Why would they send to someone who streams an illegal server?
---
im looking for people to play with. i plan to go tank or healer (warrior or priest), i played to lvl 51 back before TBC launched and was end game progression tbc-wotlk and into cata. looking for a full leveling experience and decent raid progression.
---
im mostly pve, probably will play on a rp/pvp server and for the horde!
---
Winterspring Yeti cave on mage, then Silithus on my rogue
---
It's an off-hand item that inflicts a DOT onto yourself, which can remove any CC that breaks on damage. (It also increases run speed when used.)
---
No that says it better not come out tomorrow not 'it is coming out tomorrow'
---
At the same time, though, I don't think the hype will last that long. It's already been losing steam imo. This subreddit used to have like 10 new threads every time I refreshed new with people commenting, and now I see maybe 1 new thread every like half an hour. It's still being hyped but give it another 3-4 months and people will just bleed the hype out. 
---
People are playing private servers to get their fix and if they can get to 60 and get their fix before classic even comes out, even if they play, they may be too burnt out or have already gotten the fix they want to make it to 60.
---
Why would you be crushed. I don’t get people not being hopeful. Just being hopeful/optimistic won’t end you if that thing doesn’t happen. It’s better than being realistic/negative all the time.
---
Personally I just want to get a character to 60 as fast as possible, especially if I decide to roll on a PvP server. The harder I NEET the further ahead I am of everyone; the further ahead I get the more likely it is that everyone in the zone is also NEETing and doesn't really want to pvp yet.
---
We're always happy to hear feedback and if you have anything specific you can send it to feedback@wowhead.com. There's always room for improvement but the linked article highlights a lot of things we've been working on like Thottbot/Allakazham comments, model viewer, tooltips for 3rd party sites, Discord news alerts, and some other stuff :) We pushed out an improvement to spell tooltips and damage displays today, for example, and this past month we developed tech to separately update BFA and Classic articles on the same page, so the irrelevant information at the top of race and faction pages should be mostly cleaned up.
---
Lots to go and we know that some NPC/Quest information will require beta access with a working site client for more accuracy, but the team has been working on many things besides the Thottbot skin.
---
These aren't blizzard employees.
---
if they had info to leak, which they don't, their asses would get sued.

Yeah so I’m thinking it’s bigger than that
---
Priest is the only really viable pvp healer I'm. Shamans don't have enough kit. Sure chain heal is cool, but range limits make it spotty at best. Totems have some utility, but not for healing all that much.
---
Nice.
---
Would they really make a closed beta, invite all kinds of variety streamers but not invite the allcraft guys who have had several classic centric episodes? Seems sketchy. These guys eat straight out of the hands of blizz devs too.
---
Yes
---
This probably isn't a good subreddit for this post...
---
Also, your cons of Classic are all minor af while retail's cons are far more degrading to the gameplay.
---
The world wouldn't be over but there would be panic. Being a week late or more to the launch would fucking suck on a fresh server. There is an edge to be had, such as picking your name. Not to mention early items are valued more so that's very fun to be a part of.
---
I for one am abroad and have irl stuff when I get home next week. No time to plan anything and processing vacation, time off, canceling certain appointments etc wouldnt exactly happen in a second. I want to play as soon as possible, but that's not exactly how real life works.
---
I would very much appreciate if Blizzard could give us a small window so we can plan our IRL to give us a gap to No Life with the rest at launch. :D
---
I think he's looking at the trinket icons at the top and confusing everything on the left as being Alliance only, and everything on the right as being Horde only.
---
Mountain dew aesthetic is by far the best word to describe all the gaming setups. I can‘t stand this stuff because it looks like it is designed for 12 year old gamer kids with too much money
---
If I think that the announcement is classic wow for the IPhone and it turns out to be live servers secretly launched I’ll become happy for the rest of the week. If I expect the game to be full released and I get classic wow mobile I won’t even play retail vanilla out of pure disappointment. I would rather not be optimistic and be surprised.
---
No, its not just a tiny easy to navigate circle!
---
Its super confusing and no one should go there ever.
---
^^^^^^You ^^^^^^almost ^^^^^^blew ^^^^^^our ^^^^^^cover! ^^^^^^The ^^^^^^Alliance ^^^^^^players ^^^^^^still ^^^^^^have ^^^^^^no ^^^^^^idea.
---
The fuck is a hotted?
---
Kinda confused..
---
Last time I checked people were defending this news like it was fact, now we're just dismissing it? 
---
What happened?
---
I know "leaks" are "hard" to listen to fake or not, but when more than one person starts claiming the same thing it gets hard to ignore.
---
Not going to happen.  They said on the last earnings call for investors that it was coming in 2nd half of the year.  You can't blatantly lie to shareholders in that venue.
---
There’s one at your starter area weapon vendor. Should be a level 1 white weapon of every type.
---
Robert De Niro's mole, has gotta be 10 feet wide
---
Typical.
---
The great filter strikes again.
---
Yes! Killing chimeras for me though
---
Tendies man, you make the alliance hard to say no too
---
Shit happens when you don't give a fuck about your health eh..
---
Because you are easily insulted by stupid garbage like this.
---
Enjoy the Alliance!
---
Listen to Kevin Jordan (vanilla dev who worked on class design) interviews on Countdown to Classic Podcast. He's gone through just about all the classes at this point. It's wrong to say that the designers were satisfied with the class balance in raids. There were big problems they saw, but didn't get around to addressing them until TBC.
---
Nope.
---
Deal with it.
---
No, otherwise Horde would be the obvious pick.
---
Sick meme bro
---
Paladin
---
If you don't win.... idk what to tell you.
---
alright
---
That would be horde, but not until tbc comes out and they get blood elves.
---
Finally a place where the unemployed can get ahead in life! xD
---
I love this, Clean and simple setups make me happy
---
That's because I was out of work for a while. So I had been dumping ever dollar of my paycheck (instead of just minimal payment) I didn't spend on food or whatever into my credit cards.  
---
I'm caught up now 😁
---
Die die die
---
[Smooth Operator](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyq4IVm0cl5_IxNSJHmbK9A) is pretty entertaining, too.  Hoping to see him upload more!
---
There's a 0 % chance of that happening do don't worry 😀
---
lol at the triggered streamers
---
I can't use 2 anymore because my gpu is dying and i miss it so much..
---
Exactly man, so happy other people are going to be collecting stuff this time around. 
---
I was too young and straight vendored all my gear after I upgraded it
---
Okay that’s quite the ultimatum
---
Whatever you say, Javert.
---
Ye cause BFA didnt have 100% sharding/servercrossing what so ever right? :p (Just might be the reason for it being smooth).
---
On behalf of the Horde we would like to draft hot Linsay Lohan in exchange for South Park. Our women are robust and fertile, but not the most easy on the eyes.
---
Unless you solo PvP, then it's about as fun as AIDS
---
memes aside this skit makes me so fucking uncomfortable lol.
---
Remindme! Tomorrow
---
Then don’t read it?
---
I meant this one and others like it.

Level 4 weapon purchasable in major cities or vendors in the first town you visit.
---
A classic server isn't the same as a normal progression MMO
---
There is always a chance the devs swoop in and save your spec. You only start cutting if you can't clear content.
---
Without that you have to choose what's good for your role and the raid to maintain standards. If everyone knows your spec sucks how can you convince some one who will do more damage than you anyway they should full buff? You can't
---
Welcome to the horde, brother.
---
They will have sharding in the starting zones, they already stated they would. And there will be a lot of servers to spread people out on. The streamer servers will get hit the hardest. Also 6 different starting zones instead of everyone being in the same location. If they could do it back in actual vanilla retail I’m sure it won’t be a big problem.
---
Honestly pre and post cata desolace honestly suck. And I like most pre AND post cata zones. Desolace has a super interesting backstory but the game never took a good enough advantage of it :(
---
Wait, did you just photoshop another picture in there? Everything is the same, even the clock lmao
---
LMFAO how does this not have more views/upvotes 
---
Get this to the top
---
The ClassicWoW community is honestly the most awesome thing in online gaming to happen for me since... well... vanilla! This is just great.
---
What's the wall of no?
---
I hope Hotted is okay and that people use him as a reminder that you should take care of your body before it's too late.
---
You don't want your warning sign to be a hospital visit. Especially in the United States financially..
---
It's all fun and games, but man, take care of yourself too. You don't gotta be Bajheera levels of healthy. You can just spend 1-2 hours a week exercising even, eating a little cleaner and you'll feel a lot better even when gaming.
---
Seeing the excuse "I can't work out because I'm tired so I just game and let my health get worse" is so frustrating because it isn't true.
---
I had a friend who used to run track around the time WoW came out. He got addicted to it and spiraled into a huge obesity. It was stunning to see, and I remember partially feeling bad for leading him to WoW.
---
Yes, because it's a legit gaming setup, but I can't be assed to retake the picture after booting up wow and switching inputs. We're watching Last Week Tonight right now.
---
You think throwing insults in still having a conversation LOL,  keep proving to me over and over again just how worthless you are friend lol
---
We want to make great games --&gt; We want to make games that will get us the most money
---
beta is wednesday not tomorrow, ya'll getting jebaited
---
I guess so If you must click all your spells
---
Hell yeah it is. It's honestly so genuine and friendly. And the couple calls I've done to the show, Josh has only propositioned sex to me 3 times. A real gentleman.
---
so having a "classic summer" would mean the entire summer being classic would be true.
---
Okay no offense but what's the point of posting a photoshoped image then? :D That doesn't show real quality anyway haha
---
He's the host of allcraft podcast. Featuring big streamers and hard core raiders who talk about wow. It's actually a really good podcast. But the host is pretty ignorant of... Everything wow related... He doesn't bring anything to the table of conversation and asks really  short answer questions. Everyone else brings in a lot of insight though.
---
30 copper bag space homie
---
Ok you are right. rogues are god mode. Faerie fire does nothing and you can just reset "any fight" just blind the druid and ignore abolish poison. Just use restorative pots and gamble on the dispel. It could work so it always works!
---
ESFJ-A  - horde,  undead rogue, back in vanilla server first rag kill and high warlord achieved during bwl
---
Ashenvale being slighted hurt my soul but the lack of human contact accurately describes that empty-ass zone.
---
players will also run the engineer reflect(shadow?) trinket  against  warlocks in a 1v1 situation as well for that little extra  since locks can be so deadly if they get even the slightest chance.
---
The thing about these questions is we have no idea how close the private servers are to the correct loot tables, drop rates, mob patrol patterns, etc. Due to the shortage of guides and videos from 2005, and the absolute tsunami of Classic "content" coming out in the last year, it has become almost impossible to find sources from retail vanilla. You can't just search for "vanilla dire maul farming" because you'll get a hundred results of private server and youtuber content.
---
So we have absolutely no idea if lashers in DM even drop the shit they drop on pservers, or if some farming strategy doesn't work at all because it turns out there's an elite mob walking right through a spot that was safe on a pserver. We don't know if solo tribute runs are mechanically possible. People recently found that the original mobs in BRD make it impossible to do a farm run that was so much taken for granted that nobody even thought to look it up for ages.
---
But if it turns out that all the usual farming methods work the way people are used to from pservers, solo tribute runs will be the most effective. Mara pretty much has a capped potential of about 50g/hour. DM lashers are probably about the same, but they depend so much on trash loot and random BoEs that we know are pure guesswork, so this could be anywhere from worthless to 100g/h for all we know. It's easier to estimate boss runs because we know what they can drop.
---
One key difference between pservers and Classic is the fact that we won't be able to just teleport to the instance exit with the reset trick. This means that if you're farming an instance and the run doesn't happen to end near the exit, you either have a long run back through the dungeon or you need to strip your gear off and die. The latter is only useful if the graveyard is nearby, which it sort of is for DM but certainly not for BRD. It also requires keeping bag space for your equipment. 
---
On the other hand, the run back from King Gordok is like four solid minutes, and you can't run back from DM lashers and Mara princess at all. I think farming instances will be a lot less common in Classic than it has been on pservers just because there's no convenient solution to the issue of getting back out of a dungeon. Stripping naked and dying is a huge nuisance even if it saves a lot of time, and running back out is usually a nightmare.
---
Street Trash, nice.
---
Laughed out loud accidentally
---
Good shit
---
Me too brotha they just want all the $$$ and don't give a damn about World of Warcraft
---
It's over almost 15 years late, what the fuck &gt;:(
---
Aktually summer isn't till December here.
---
As someone who plays a Warrior Tank and levels relatively quickly, I usually dive straight into Blackrock Depths whenever there are enough people at an appropriate level to form a group (55+), especially with the inclusion of some of the more powerful 1.12 items, BRD is going to give you a substantial power increase and will be worth going in before level 60 even. From there most people continue to dive deeper into Blackrock Mountain and do LBRS to farm the key for UBRS. The Plagueland dungeons are a notch harder than the rest but, once you get the foundation of BRD gear established anything is fair game.
---
Like the best edit
---
Depends.  Roll with a warrior buddy and he can keep you pretty clean. 
---
Tons of utility with totems that have good range, especially as resto.
---
A good resto shaman is pretty tough to kill
---
If this is neither a Beta nor release date you should all take a break from these streamers.

Which everyone is free to either not watch or skip over.

*Quick Info*  
---
NA / EST / 30's Semi-functioning adult seeking people to play with. Working weekdays and school in the evenings. Would like to find a group of friends to play classic with and maybe raid a little bit. **unavailable Tues/Thurs nights, hard no on that.** but am free on weekends.
---
*History*  
---
Have played WoW since Vanilla (still remember my orc warlock HarryDotter and getting the Private title.) Always been a hardcore raider (have a few US top 50 kills, world 100 but thats irrelevant now.) Quit raiding seriously after MoP and played on and off with Carebears on Azgalor until Legion/BfA where I decided to just take a break and focus on school.
---
*Preferred Roles*  
---
- Tanking / Healing.  
---
- Alliance or Horde, doesn't matter to me.  
---
- Leadership roles of some kind. I am organized and can help with external guild activities.  
---
*Discord*  
---
CyberSecGuy # 8560
---
Would love to find a guild!
---
I didn't even think of this! I need time to prepare! I don't think they would do that though.
---
He meant fireball, which does leave a dot if memory serves (played rogue in vanilla and dueled a lot of mages)
---
Why tomorrow?
---
which is why Skull of Impending Doom is op
---
Makes sense
---
Yea but when you have that many slots you can give the oomkin a pity slot and just give him no loot
---
Source: done this before
---
he was an alright guy, gave him t1 helm hahaha (which has beyond terrible stats)
---
It felt like a good deed and he was happy, i always offer shit specs spots in empty slotted pugs with low loot prio after that. Yea he coulda wiped us. But he didn't. Never had anyone take me up on it tho with no loot prio past that
---
What about everybody else that didnt put time out yet? It can revolve around us if theres enough bodies in close proximity to create gravity. It would only take maybe a few octillion people
---
I am simultaneously impressed and cracking up rn
---
General tips: if you’re spending the money to get a custom laptop, it’s probably going to run at 60 FPS+ on high pretty well. Wow likes a good cpu, where as other games might be more gpu dependent.
---
Oh yees! Watched it so often as a kid and now seeing it I think wtf did I watch back in the days?!
---
I hate you.
---
Horde looks fun...but I wanna play Paladin :(
---
Nothing. Wasn't talking about 'em for lvling. Just raiding
---
How common is it to have class leaders in a guild for the heavy stacked classes like warrior, mage, rogue, etc? Would specific classes have leaders, or would it be more role based with the tanking, dps, and healing roles each having a leader?

So the processor might be more significant in this case? I can imagine because of the large player volume

I fucking love duskwood haha I just remember seeing a locked chest in a camp of worgens and as I rogue I was determined to get to it. I had my friend fly in to help me clear them. I opened the chest and got my very first blue BoE. The highlight of my wow experience.
---
Holy shit i got one too, thank god
---
I believe so, yes. You don’t need an i9 or i7 though, an i5 or Ryzen 5/7 would probably be plenty for WoW.

Wait, so you're saying Blizzard told his mom that she's not a father? I don't get it

Can mages blink out of roots?

I just realized. If I say can or can't in this sentance it means the same thing. Fuck me

You are technically correct, the best kind of correct.

Are you tight on space and that's why you are getting a laptop for gaming? If you aren't on a budget then your best bet is a laptop with a thunderbolt3 port so you can plugin an external GPU.

If you aren't tight on space then a dedicated desktop + cheap ultrabook is an option as well.

It’s running on the modern engine so it will likely be the same as Legion/BFA.

Shaman isn't a very strong PvP healer, especially compared to priest. However, with a focus on PvP you can go with a 30/0/21 elemental build, you can wreck face yourself and have some mana to toss a heal at your warrior buddy. If you *just* want to heal and you're solely focusing on what is "better", then I'd say go priest. 
---
But don't underestimate how important it is to simply like your class. If you're feeling shaman, go shaman.

I wonder how many times I can die inside.

While not Classic, I first dinged 60 in Hellfire Penninsula. I spent all my time playing in TBC taking my sweet time. I only got 30 before Wrath launched. As I was on my mom's account back then I was able to make a Death Knight when wrath launched. I wanted to explore and was so bad at progressing, but I got so into the DK during the introduction questline and played it for years as my main

It can be pretty helpful to have each class / role to have someone to look to as an example, I don't really know how to answer the "how common" part of your question but, it's definitely a decent idea and you can use class leaders or role leaders depending on how much you want to micro-manage your raid.

It is an old desktop theme for Windows XP. Don't think you're going to find it working for Windows 10 hahaha. Your best bet is to create a custom rainmeter desktop as someone else said, but that's a lot of work.
---
To be honest though that desktop theme was not that nice, I remember I had it for like a day as an 8 year old kid. I didn't even find it cool, I think it says something if an 8 year old kid thinks it's ugly.

No, bad fake

I'm torn. On the one hand, LaCroix and Tendies. On the other hand, Randy Savage and Robocop. I've never been more conflicted.

I'm not tight on space so much as Classic is really the only game i'd play so far as i can see, and i do other things with my laptop as well so i thought i'd be nice to combine both worlds and have a laptop that could watch youtube, keep track of different files, perhaps write papers, and also play classic wow. I am usually on the go and like to go to cafes and also have a computer so having a laptop is perfect for that. I've had a dedicated gaming desktop before though and played WoW on it (during the WoD days) and really enjoyed it but i also played other games on it as well that probably demanded more than WoW did

**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
We have a few names in mind, which we are discussing on Discord.
---
I am hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay the 10s for the guild charter.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
I see, thanks. When they "engine" what do they mean? Like ability to process information? Because i noticed that the graphics in Classic as they were before, it appears
---
Oh damn didn’t even notice it was a projector my bad dude. Thought it was a fat ass tv lol
---
I got multiple meetings that I have to be present for tomorrow. Have fun in Azeroth if shit goes down tomorrow.
---
Don’t you forget about me!
---
Paladin is the best pvp healer
---
That's cool about the external GPU port btw i was hoping something like that existed, thanks for mentioning that
---
Thanks a bunch! One more question...  
---
What are the mini silver legs in-between the Karlby and drawer?  
---
I saw some folks who made monitor stands with them as well, but wasn't sure the name. Thanks!

Working from home is da best 😬

For the first long while, most mages will be 17/0/34 which is a great PvP spec that also gets every PvE DPS talent except Winter's Chill. This is why it's called being the Winter's Chill Bitch if you get asked to spec into it. So if you can avoid being the guild's designated bitch, you can just stay in the same spec all the way up until AQ40 when mages begin to go fire. It's a huge luxury never having to respec.
---
Spec looks more or less like [this](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#orxV0obZZVAGcobtho) and the points in Imp CoC are optional, you can also go Imp Blizzard, Permafrost or Frost Channelling if you want those more. CoC is best for world PvP, Blizzard is best for BGs and Permafrost is best for 1v1 against melee but isn't something people usually go for. Frost Channelling makes you a bit more efficient in PvE.

You’re right. Simple mistake in identity. Sorry op

I hate to put it as bluntly as needed but you are recruiting for guide writing. You don't even understand classic or its mechanics. So how can you possibly vet the information for accuracy? It's a pointless exercise and will do nothing to make the site a source of accurate information. I'm not sure what to say. You guys are the biggest but you can't just buy accurate knowledge as proven by your atrocious class overviews. Good luck.

**&lt;Resilience&gt; | Alliance | NA | PVP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**About**
---
We are a group of competitive players looking to make our mark in Classic. 
---
Most of us have played since Vanilla and still actively play retail. 
---
Our leadership and core consist of cutting edge mythic raiders, multi-season gladiators, and experienced vanilla veterans.
---
**Raids**
---
Schedule: Tues &amp; Thurs 7-10 PM PST
---
Loot Rules: Loot Council
---
**Goals**
---
- Compete with top 3+ day guilds on a 2 day raiding schedule.
---
- Clear MC 1-2 months after launch.
---
- Be a competitive guild on the server for each phase
---
- Create a strong PVP team for non-raid nights with a focus on ranking
---
**What kind of players are we looking for?**
---
We believe skilled players in any version of WoW can be successful in Classic. We will consider anyone with knowledge of high end raiding or PVP.
---
Attitude is very important. We want people who can listen, take criticism. and understand that Classic is a team based game.
---
*Any documented recent experience, whether in retail or private servers, is a huge plus.*
---
**What do we expect from raiders?**
---
- **Be Reliable:** Show to raid on time and notify the guild ahead of time if you can't make it.
---
- **Be Efficient:** Show up to prepared with proper consumables. Be respectful of everyone else's time.
---
- **Be Knowledgable:** Know how to play your class, know fight mechanics, and know what loot is best for your class.
---
- **Have fun!**

I'm in the same boat. I work 3rd shift and by the time raids start in NA I'm leaving for work or have to leave like an hour in. 
---
Because of this, I've decided to roll on EU. I was very sceptical at first, but I found a great group of players already and will be playing with them.
---
Blizzard doesn't send beta emails anymore
---
The voice is really bad as well
---
Yeah,  my brother actually played SL/SL and basically face rolled his way to 2k with a priest healing him. 
---
Yeah even if you down the pet twice,  you're still fighting the lock now lol.

I used to stream on arenajunkies with him playing feral druid and me elemental shaman 2300+.

They’re not serious. It’s all speculation for now.

Hunter traps are always fun -- if you get the growl off in time on their pet when you see them kneel down, you're free, and they're on cooldown.  Continue the face-maulings!
---
Fake :o
---
I don’t know why Hillsbrad isn’t mentioned more here. I encountered many more 60s in Hillsbrad than STV.
---
Especially gun skill is absolutely useless in the later part of the game because there are no good guns with the required slow weapon speed. The possibilities for SM plays are endless in pvp on a hunter. Stoneform helps against one class that a hunter should win against 80% of situations anyways

Could be second half of the fiscal year, which is technically true. Talking to shareholders about fiscal year is pretty likely no?

Imagine coming to a place where people enjoy something to tell them you don't enjoy that thing, what was the point of this post?

It would be immensely stupid as it would mean they misled and lied to shareholders by not releasing during Summer. I dont think that would be smart

Bad Photoshop, check out the font lol
---
I plan not to learn all spells at the trainer. I wait until level 32-34 if i see i will not have enough gold with 40 i go grinding. I read somewhere that grinding level 35 mobs can bring 5-7 gold per hour. Not sure if this is correct.
---
And i will skinning/vendor from beginning.No AH items
---
How would you cook them?
---
I'd probabaly use my shoes in a recipe or something. Like maybe cut into chunks and marinate overnight in yogurt. Then batter them up with my favorite flavour of chips and deep fry like fried chicken. That would be a delicious crispy skin, juicy interior and with a squirt of lime or lemon give it some zesty zing. Cause honestly who doesnt like zest? You like zest dont you?
---
I’m not saying it’s happening, but it’d be a good way to get around sharding. Ninja drop and you have people logging on at all times in the day to play, instead of that initial surge.
---
At the end of the day, I dk what the fuck is going to happen. This is a B-level game and frankly Blizzard doesn’t release B-level games very often. They could totally blindside us.
---
&gt;Faerie fire does nothing 
---
It removes a rogue's ability to stealth, but a rogue has ways to run away.
---
&gt;you can just reset "any fight" 
---
Against a druid or mage, you can.
---
&gt;just blind the druid and ignore abolish poison. 
---
You don't need to abolish if you are going to shapeshift out of bear form. But shapeshifting out gets you blinded, trinket stunned, etc, and then the rogue can just stun lock you and dps you down.
---
&gt;Just use restorative pots and gamble on the dispel. It could work so it always works!
---
Restorative pots? You mean health potion? What dispel?
---
You still gave no way for a druid to stop a rogue from escaping. And it's not like a rogue needs to escape when they can just kill a druid anyway. But if they do need to escape, a faerie fire is not going to stop them.
---
By the way, did you just completely give up the case of a mage countering a rogue?
---
As a Retail player, it is VERY DIFFICULT. Oceanic is your best bet but I struggle to find those aswell. I am worried about finding a guild with raid times in daytime. I want to start my own guild, and recruiting is gonna be a problem. Sure you're flooded with people at first, but how many are gonna stick around?
---
EU is the easiest option but no way am I playing on an entirely different region with worse latency than I already have
---
The more I think about the more I feel they are releasing it tomorrow. Staysafe said he knows nothing about a Classic Beta, but has content tomorrow that is a "deep dive into classic wow". 
---
I don't know why there would be this much hype for a beta, it's really not that exciting.
---
Keep up the amazing work Perc :)
---
I for one is incredible thankful for the classic version of wowhead!
---
Yes, they can.
---
This right here. Fresh servers are something that everyone wants to experience and “screwing” people over by just randomly dropping it would take away from the experience for everyone.
---
I’ll still play, but will be frustrated if they don’t at least give us a 1-2 week heads up.
---
How many raiding at 60 though? Yes they will exist, but mark my words and burn me if I'm wrong: it will be a pain in the rear
---
Accurate
---
idc about a beta, (of course do one if needed) but i dont want to level a character thats going to be deleted in a few months, thats just another private server lol

**[NA - Alliance] [PvE Server] [Hardcore] [Pacific Time Zone]**
---
Raid Times/Days: Tues-Thurs 7:30-11PM PST. We will drop days from the end of the week as we clear raids more quickly.
---
About Us (TL;DR at the bottom)
---
&lt;Eye of Insanity&gt; is a guild formed for the specific purpose of pushing as hard as we can to be the realm first and best on our server. We are looking for all competitive-minded players who want to make the most out of the time they put into raiding. This means each player will be held to high expectations, and must come prepared each raid night. Be respectful of the time that everyone puts into getting together. Have consumables ready, do your research of the expected fights, be online and ready to enter the raid at raid time, and be willing to change and adapt as needed during raids. 
---
During raids it is expected that during any strat explanation or boss pull, chatter is kept to a minimum and everyone will be focused on the task at hand. It is expected that everyone raiding understands that the good of the guild is priority number one, and loot will be used to help us succeed as a whole, not just individuals. 
---
We will use a loot council system comprised of raid role/guild officers, guild master, and rotating core raiders. Any issues regarding loot, leadership, strat changes, or issues with other members should come directly to officers during raid to keep things running smoothly. We want an open door, and everyone's opinion to be heard, but don't want to take away from the time that 39 other people have set aside to raid.
---
All that having been said, Classic WoW is very much a game based around community, and having fun, and we want to keep that atmosphere in this guild. You can both be committed to efficient raiding and still like the people you play with. 
---
We expect members to be respectful of each other and the fact that people come from a variety of walks of life. ANY racism, sexism, homophobia, etc will not be tolerated. Basically put, if you think it will offend someone (whether or not you think they should be offended), then don't say it. There's no ban on talking about controversial subjects, but try not to get divisive over politics, religion, etc. We all share a common interest in Classic WoW, and the golden rule applies here. We are all adults, and there may be people you just don't get along with. We expect people to be able to handle themselves in a mature way. Help each other out when you can, being the best at what we do is a team effort and we're only as strong as our weakest link.
---
We are looking for especially committed individuals who are interested in taking on a leadership role in the guild to help keep all the moving pieces of a large guild going. If you have previous experience in a leadership role in WoW, that's a huge bonus but not a requirement.
---
TL;DR: We intend to be #1 for our realm and have high expectations. Come prepared, and don't be a dick.

I mean, investors will understand if they saw an opportunity and capitalized on it. However, it’s not good to lie to your investors.....
---
Makes sense in a very, very cynical way.
---
They're targeting "content creators".  Not people who are creating things for classic, mods, databases, etc, but people who are streamers with following.  Streamers aren't content creators, they're just shills.  Those retail streamers will have non-classic followers.  By giving access to those streamers they're getting free advertisement to one of their two target consumer bases: Current retail players.   No need to advertise to people who are already planning to play.
---
The cynical view (based on the shared sub) has long been that they're trying to make classic pull double duty both as a tool for getting older players to come back and for smoothing over gaps in retail.  This would more or less validate that.
---
Edit: It's honestly not fair to call them shills, because shills get paid.  I don't know what you call someone who advertises something, for free, in exchange for attention.

Healer. Technically priest since cloth is cheaper to repair, but that's pretty irrelevant. There aren't very many consumables for healers and it's generally the archetype that dies the least in PvE. Not many expensive BoE items for healers, either. If you're into PvP, healers don't really get anything out of their rank sets (unless you plan to respec into shadow or whatever) so you don't have to rank up in order to "stay optimal."

Well, WoW was popular but didn’t explode until much later after its initial release. If they agreed for nochanges and don’t do sharding, then this would in essence be more like Vanilla WoW. It’s randomly dropped and reflects the 14 years ago of players slowly joining the first day, second, week after, etc.
---
I’m not saying it’s happening, just playing devil’s advocate.
---
INFJ - Fem Dwarf Paladin - Healer - PvE server
---
How?
---
While it's true that there's less healer druid spots in raids than some other classes, you have to take into account also that druid is one of the least popular classes in vanilla. So you actually have way less competition too, especially when you also take away the people who want to play feral. If you're competent I don't think there will be a problem finding a raiding guild willing to take you as resto.
---
Business wise this does make sense and is the only reason why a soon release would make sense to me.
---
I've been skeptical the last couple of days, but I'm starting to think that a surprise open-beta tomorrow might actually happen.
---
Agreed. I think 1-2 weeks heads up isn't too much to ask for. I would want to cancel certain appointments I have, it wouldn't be responsible of me to not at least give a week or more heads up, otherwise I'd still have to attend and lose out even more of the launch party.
---
Not to mention I'll be rolling Priest on a PvP server and the less people in STV the better! ;P 
---
I get that a lot of people on this sub have nothing to do IRL that is keeping them locked from playing but I think the people that do should get to be part of the chaos that is Launch. Waiting another week or two wouldnt exactly kill them!
---
nobody cares.
---
Thanks for such a full answer! Greatly appreciated. :) I think I'll commit myself to prot afterall. It was a tossup for me between prot and a warlock. But I've mained lock for the past 7 years. Time for something new.
---
Oh... you can just go and eat **ALL** the dicks. 
---
Upvoted so others share my shame.
---
I can tell from the pixels
---
i mean its hella useful to make an alt while leveling just to mail stuff to so u dont have to take ur char out of the way to go to the bank or ah
---
I’m guessing that isn’t his doctor and he's just assuming. While it might be a bit rude at the same time it’s a pretty safe assumption in the scheme of things.
---
Or be a fucking adult and say, "I won't be there today," and if probed tell them it's for personal reasons.
---
I just need a damn date. If it’s 48 hours from tomorrow or 48 days....just give me a date to work around.
---
Disc is not that amazing, bad damage and worse healing than holy. Shadow is great for PvP and you can find a raid spot if you're good (meaning you can chug major mana pots). All of the healing classes are decent in PvP with offspecs too.

Okay, but for real. Is there a blue post with release date or not?

Maybe they should use some of their  money they're trying to pay to hire people with.... to remove some of the ads bogging down their website so bad that people like me refuse to go there.

If you just want to raidlog and do big dps then warr &gt;&gt; hunt. I prefer hunter for how they pvp and farm instances, but warriors are more fun to raid with imo.

So the best way to aoe level is to level to 60 first then start. Got it.

This is what I'm looking for. I'm EST with a toddler and another one on the way. I expect 2000-0000 to be my hours.  Experienced corpse runner interested in questing, pvp shenanigans, lite rp and face pulling.
---
So if we don't have the data, it would be a brilliant idea to collate it.  Perhaps on a website like this?
---
I've settled on August 27th as the release date. Sounds late enough to be annoying but also everyone's June and July fake dates make the later more realistic date feel better.
---
Un'Goro definitely falls in with this theme as well.
---
Even though only a few people might post on social media, there's a wide variety of contributors on the dev and content teams that players don't really know about, each with a unique interest in WoW. With other guide sections we spin up, not everyone on the site is an expert at that topic but through research and reviewing credentials, we can bring pretty solid people into the team to vet accuracy. For example, I personally don't manage the BFA class guides, but theorycrafters from Discord/SimC oversee those guide submissions, and vet their accuracy and presentation. Not always perfect, but we have a pretty good track record and guide/news traffic has blown up in the last few years as we've refined our process.
---
Every guide has a 'report' option at the top right where feedback can be left, which we do read and review, and we're actively working on improving and expanding some of the previously-published overviews into full-blown detailed guides. We deemed the BFA info on Classic wiki pages to be a more-pressing issue, and now that it's mostly under control, we are looking to refine guides as we move into summer. By making a post like this, we hope to show we're interested in continuing to grow, and we'd like to reimburse players for their work at industry rates :)
---
Is this even the real Towelie? This account seems too braindead to be true.

+1 is usually for 100% pug raids. My guild in classic will use epgp if an addon is created, I really don’t want to use DKP ever again.

Ive started reporting everything with asmongold for actually everything. Eventually the youtube bots that control everything will get enough flags to delete everything with him on it and i can finally go 2 fucking days without seeing that guy react to literally everything exactly the same. Then he'll get his channel back and can post a reaction video to all of his twitch disciples channels getting deleted.

&gt;It removes a rogue's ability to stealth, but a rogue has ways to run away.
---
Run from a druid? oO
---
&gt;Restorative pots? You mean health potion? What dispel?
---
Seriously?
---
&gt;By the way, did you just completely give up the case of a mage countering a rogue?
---
No. I already mentioned tournaments. Theres a tournament you can watch from a private server where a mage won, not a rogue.
---
I'm done. Sorry I've gone far enough down this rabbit hole. And a hole it definitely is.
---
Keep it up these are great!
---
BiS absolutely existed in vanilla, I don't know where the meme that everyone who played vanilla was a knuckle dragging retard comes from but it's so fucking bizarre to see. Maybe it's from people that never played or only played super casually?
---

# NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE
---
Yup. At least all the hyper-obese youtubers/streamers can save lives by showing people what it looks like to eat yourself to death.
---
I agree with both even if you were just being facetious.
---
Look at Retail Wowhead for an idea of the quality to expect imo. Classic isn’t out yet so their Classic site is a work in progress.
---
Yes but from what source??? We got no real source so how can we deem if the data is accurate or just made up.
---
Once classic is out you could do as thottbot did create a add on that reports drops to a service and pars out the data live once it hit.  After a month or two the drop rate would reach its true value.
---
I'm interested in buying a set!
---
I don't know man. I said something dumb, and apparently people found it funny.
---
I'm already sick so I dont have to
---
I played a Warlock in Vanilla, but now I am thinking to go Priest and Mage. However, I cannot decide which one to be my main. Benediction makes me lean towards Priest, while all the good utility and dps the Mage brings make me lean towards Mage.
---
Ah man. Who gives a shit. Fat people dont wanna be fat. It's a disease. They cant help feeding thier fat fucking faces all day.
---
I didn't throw an insult I asked if we still going.  Cause at this point it seems like you are just talking and laughing by yourself.
---
Redridge, Tanariz, and Westfall...... you monster
---
Login Queue (if that exist), Server Lags (due the mass on ppl following the streamer), Higher Pop (can be good or bad depending on your view) and good luck doing anything at all when the streamer is near you.
---
I mean of course a streamer on your server will effect you.
---
2-3 times a year? That's a lot... I hope they recommend a doctor every time.
---
&gt; Run from a druid? oO
---
Yep.
---
&gt;Seriously?
---
I don't even know what point you were making, bring up dispel in a conversation about mages. So, yes? What were you even talking about?
---
&gt;No. I already mentioned tournaments. Theres a tournament you can watch from a private server where a mage won, not a rogue.
---
You saw a mage won, so mages counter rogue. Makes sense.
---
PS, I've already said this: mages can get lucky crits and win some percentage of the time. Otherwise, assuming equal skill, gear, and cool downs, they can't beat a rogue.
---
&gt;I'm done. Sorry I've gone far enough down this rabbit hole. And a hole it definitely is.
---
You didn't make any points that stuck at all, you started talking about druids for some reason in a conversation about mages countering rogue.
---
Please just don’t go apeshit on reddit on Thursday when your theory is wrong and you blame Blizzard instead of yourself for getting your hopes up.
---
changing plan is not lying.
---
Dont use too much mana ;)
---
I'm not a Druid expert but if you look up Stormx(Druid) and Perplexity(Rogue) who are some of the best vanilla wow PVP players right now. They both agree Druid will always win 1v1 against a Rogue. You can find more details upon the matchup in this video at around the 35th minute?

I think should start an entire guild that hangs out in the opposing factions tavern.

we'll call it Cheers.

Skeletal Warhorse is metal af what are you talking about?
---
oh yea, you identified with the Shooter McGavin side.
---
dont get hyped. Beta might launch tomorrow/wednesday but you probably dont get to play it anyway lol.
---
My original point was that rogues can't reset or run away from faerie fire:
---
&gt;And even if Rogues try to escape and reset fights. They can't. Druids Faerie Fire. GG from there. 
---
With my reply:
---
&gt; Rogues can reset/run away at any time. Especially prep rogues. It's just that faerie fire lasts a long time so the reset takes much longer.
---
Rogues can get away from any fight against a druid unless we handicap what cooldowns they can use.
---
Druids in shapeshifting forms can't be poly so it makes sense.
---
What are you? Depressed? I was depressed as I had bereavment when a loved one died. I lost interest in most things for a few weeks after the initial greif. But eventually it ends so you can know you have that to look forward to.
---
If you are not depressed then what the fuck? Come on here to tell us some weird shit man.

fuck

I told my boss the truth and he said "hey, me too!"

Yeah, but the stories are awesome, each zone feels distinct yet interconnected, and if you did pug it successfully it felt awesome. But yeah it was a nightmare to pug, I mean, most of the time I'd fly all the way out to desolace and someone would leave.
---
classic confirmed today
---
Well let me add to that point exactly than. Even with full tools/consumables and cooldowns. Which Druid and Rogues both have access too like FAPS. Druid will catch up eventually to a Rogue that's already Faerie Fire. While Rogues also are cooldown depended and they are longer cooldown than Druids ones unless spec heavily to that one talent that reduces their sprints. It is all depending on the Druid and the Rogue and how they play out the chase it self. I would still think the Druid itself will eventually catch the rogue if you are saying if they both go on a chase and run situation to reset a fight.
---
Well I figured Robocop would have been nonsensical enough. :D

No one wants to talk to you about it and they just get off the phone as fast as they can.
---
Also I want you to note that Abolish Poison for Druids which is an instant cast with no cooldown takes out all poisons of the Rogue. Including Crippling poisons.
---
I asked a guy (Cadet) who can play all classes in the best premade on pservers about healers, he said pally &gt; priest &gt; shaman. Shaman is more of an hybrid since the pvp spec of choice is 30 elem 21 resto. It's not just dispel and healing output that make priest better, psychic scream can turn a battle around.

In mose cases yes but not in WSG, priests are the most needed. Premades tend to run with 2 priests and 1 shaman/pally.

Wasn't the throwing animation faster? And I remember switching aspects during the rogues animation was too late... Perhaps my connection then? Also, it's been a while
---
Robe of Power! I love that while leveling clothies.
---
It will be a huge deal. Unless you're able to start on day 1, at launch, you will never get ahead of the pack. And then it will take you forever to get to 60. The only way to get ahead is to start at launch, do lvl 1-15 as quickly and efficient as possible, and then follow your levelling route.
---
should also keep in mind we wont have trinkets in the first phase. which makes mages literal gods.
---
I see what your saying, and yes, the OP is obviously playing horde. 
---
That said, your statement is technically false as Paladin is considered the best PvP healer. In context, though, I think people could assume you meant "on horde" but the person who replied to you isn't wrong. 
---
However, I think your response is a little off-putting and you could be more friendly and just explain clearly that, while they are technically right, you are speaking in the context of the post and meant "on horde."
---
Bajheera ain't healthy either though...

Alliance 📷 Oceanic PVP  Raid times: New Zealand!!, to be decided. (likely in the evening on either Thurs/Fri/Sat night)
---
Who we are: A bunch of buddies from a long-running New Zealand social discord server who are keen to play Classic together. Some WoW retail veterans, some newbies.  I'm an experienced ex-raid leader who has played every retail expansion and ran multiple guilds, including one with 1k members. I've also cleared up to Molten Core on a classic private server.  Our vision: a competent yet semi-casual PvE and world PVP guild,  putting fun, friendship and fully immersing ourselves in the game as priority, with efficient grinding min/maxing and lack of sleep being optional! We intend to stay small enough to retain a close-knit identity, while also raiding with a sister guild to down 40man content.
---
What sets us apart: We will allow people to raid as any spec/race/class, including sub-optimal ones (within reason) Yes - you can raid as ret or boomkin and we will gear you! We are also looking for experienced people to be our officers and help lead the guild - you could be part of something new and great!  Until classic releases our discord server is going to be for general/social discussion.
---
Come introduce yourself!  [https://discord.gg/NMrEEvm](https://discord.gg/NMrEEvm)
---
I am so tired of seeing asmonass face everywhere on youtube uh oh he reacts reeeee
---
Came here to defend my sparkling water!
---
I honestly believe most people who will play classic don't play current wow anymore anyway. But regardless, you're probably right.
---
He's not shitting on classic in that link, here are his quotes about it
---
&gt; Congratulations, it's really cool that you guys are going to get your classic servers
---
and
---
&gt; I don't hate classic, I just don't want to play it
---
That thread mainly goes on about some twitch streaming bullshit that's irrelevant to this topic but I don't see Towelliee being anti-Classic in that video
---
And stay safe was defending this guy lol
---
Alcaz Island.
---
Rich is way worse though... I can't watch it because of him.
---
That's what I'm betting on atm. It seems a bit too hyped for just an announcement of when beta will be. And if it was a public beta they would have announced it already. Also since everyone is on the same page after being invited to Irvine it really makes sense that it's some kind of streamer only thing.
---
They did my boy Loch Modan dirty!!
---
That's the way to roll
---
Yeah, same boat here. I will need a late night guild since I am pst, though I work from home; I can farm during the day but gotta raid/pvp at night.
---
They have been but this seems different in the sense that I think only streamers will be able to play tommorow.
---
Abolish poison triggers global cooldown. This means there's a large window for rogues to do a number of things. First, they can just cc the druid in humanoid form. They can decide to continue running away while the druid is blind or just simply start killing the druid and force him back into bear form.
---
Secondly, druids do not need to use abolish poison to break crippling poison, their shapeshift out of bear form does that for them. They may be wasting mana or giving the rogue a longer opportunity to kill them if they cast unnecessary spells.
---
Same age and Agreed. Although I go through phases. There’s not much classic wow YouTube content I watch the past few months. There’s never anything to learn that I haven’t learnt from here or blue posts.
---
Actually thinking Bajheera is any healthier because he lifts weight?
---
Wel fak U , Karma whore
---
Yes a lot of people want to roll warrior, but a lot of them will give up on the way to 60 and reroll.  Even then at 60 a lot of warriors are just bad.  And on top of that, most of them don't want to tank.  If you're dedicated enough, warrior is the best class to pick.  If you're lazy, it's probably the worst.
---
I actually did sort by new. 
---
It wasn't here at the time of my posting, and I still don't see it now.
---
It's not that they hate every stteamer / content creator. they are  triggered by the low effort 11 minute long video of these "creators" analyzing a blue post that could be done in 1 min.
---
theyre also tired of seeing the same content within these videos being pushed as if its just found or if its a hot new take on it.
---
lastly alot of the time the info in these videos triggers quite a few is because it will be like "im playing rogue because they are the only class that can sprint!" then they read off the tooltip to sprint.
---
So I think it just comes down to a hatred for low effort "content" that these creators are pushing.
---
It's the greatest excuse. No need to see a doctor, they really don't want to to come in and you can feel better the next day.
---
It’s (mostly) all in good fun, and blizzard likely knows it. They’re not going to be peer pressured into releasing it.
---
Karma whores are too late
---
I would love to play as a unicorn. The heal spec is pretty op. it plays rly unique because you have to face away from your target to apply rainbow heals 🦄😏
---
we had an amarican player who worked graveyard shift on live. lag wasn't horrible for raiding, but not the best for pvp. might give you the authentic classic exp =P

It's a weird dichotomy. If they are that hard up that they can't accept that a singular employee might be unavailable for a single shift, will they really fire you? Maybe, but isn't that just more time for classic?
---
Would you say that's a vaiable option? Are my heals going to be strong enough even when spec 30/0/21 if so I'd much more prefer to run dmg with off heals. I also agree that the one thing putting me off to priest is their play style. Imo they seem so bland with very little situation play style. I'm not saying that's the case I just don't know the class and am looking in from the outside. Im sure I would enjoy both if that wasn't the case
---
Is this a meme or something that I'm missing out on? but yes, you would have to be pretty fucking delusional to think that he's not healthier than hotted.
---
The Lich Cing !

Even at the highest skill It's still Mage favored.

Yep you and me both

My favorite is - I don't have time.

No, you have time, you don't work 12h per day (at least most of you), most people are just ashamed to go to the gym or something like this. But other people will watch me hur-dur, I have a surprise for you, you aren't the center of the freaking Universe and no one gives a shit about you.

How about no?

He strikes me as the sort of guy that would start a fight IRL then call the police immediately after losing.
---
Deargodpleaseno
---
&gt;Well let me add to that point exactly than. Even with full tools/consumables and cooldowns. Which Druid and Rogues both have access too like FAPS. Druid will catch up eventually to a Rogue that's already Faerie Fire. 
---
It's impossible for two equally prepared and skilled opponents for the druid to catch a rogue who wants to run away. Rogues get two sprints, druid has one. Druids don't have any answer for FAPs. So in the simplest terms, a rogue who gets faerie fired can FAP and sprint 2x to get distance and then mount up and run.
---
But a rogue has a million ways to destroy a druid in addition to this. Things like using magic dust to put druids to sleep in animal form. Using slows to force druids to oom shape shifting (remember this is vanilla where mp5 is hard to get). They can just flat out kill a druid who spends all his mana trying to chase him or gets careless and get caught out of bear form.
---
Switching forms removes slows too and if you get polyd in caster you can shift to get out.
---
Why would it release on an eu schedule and not a tuesday for US like every other major blizzard event does
---
Look at all the nerds in here getting triggered so hard because an older guy doesn't know every detail of Classic WoW.. lmao

Tanaris is is one of my favorite zones. I’ve always loved the desert zones, so I’m currently taking my Velf monk through there!

It's happening. 
---
Announcement tomorrow.
---
but who is gonna buy that if everyone is busy leveling and saving up for their own mount.
---
I suggest you don't play Priest so you don't fight over gear!
---
Oh moving from an arms and prot warrior to a fury and prot warrior in TBC was Amazing! Finally I had an amazingly viable dps spec I could use that was addictingly awesome in trying to always out dps rogues and having hilarious epeen fights in vent about on boss single target damage meters
---
Has anyone done an analysis of what mobs have the most valuable grey items in the 35-45 range? If the AH isn't an option then grinding and selling greys seems the best bet.

this is really happening?

Confirmed by Blizzard Insider 2019 
---
release 2020 Q3 or Q4.
---
Have fun grouping with someone who only has access to like 5 of their abilities.
---
I eat the caloric/nutritional equivalent of hot garbage and I've still got a flat stomach (my cholesterol/bp is probably horrific though).
---
The reason for this is because I game on an exercycle I modified to hold my mouse/keyboard, I ride on an incline 3-5 hours a day, and when I do start to fatten up, I throw on heavy sweatpants and a thick hoodie every day and stop drinking soda until I thin back down. Gotta work smart, not hard.
---
As long as it doesn’t effect pc and pc is still coming I don’t really care, probably play it on my iPad just to see. Seems like it would be trash tho
---
Unless you want to play alliance, you could consider rolling orc for the stun resist. That way stun isnt such a big weakness.
---
Do people still think classic wow is only about the endgame? If so, this isn't the game for you.
---
I'm just going to say that even if this is true and it does come out tomorrow... this has been the most fucking annoying circlejerk around these streamers this entire week. There's no reason to be clinging to every word they say, and I truly hope that this isn't how Blizzard actually intended to release this info.
---
Idk man as someone who started in wrath as a kid and going back to play private servers, my wrath experience felt like vanilla even though I did hit 80 and raid/arena. I guess it's just the old world feel.
---
Alterac Valley with a pocket priest as a prot warrior was beyond joyous. Yeah I couldn't really kill much but I could annoy the shit out of them while they got killed by everyone else as they focused on me or my priest.
---
I thought it was winter 2017
---
Eastern Plagues. Burning Crusade had just dropped and I was on my character who was my main for the entire game (Rillik, Zul'Jin, NElf Druid). I was so excited because I couldn't believe that my character, \*my\* real character was in that high level zone, instead of me just watching over my Dad's shoulder. You'd think after all that I would be champing at the bit for Outland, and I was... but, funnily enough, I took a break shortly thereafter at 62 to play LotRO with friends and family and loved that, too. Played a Dwarf Hunter in that game (I guess some WoW combos just don't leave you ;) )
---
I got overly excited about this..
---
That's 4 more spells  than most people use on Classic WoW! (or current wow)
---
Human Rogue on Sunstrider. Dinged 60 in EPL.
---
Expansion betas since MoP. Also got early beta for Hots, HS and OW. They do have some algorithms to decide the earlier betas, you can count on that. High end players and streamers get them usually for obvious reason. But i also think that loyal players who have been supporting blizzard for long time get bumped up in the priority.
---
wow i mean, they shouldnt be able to play with pc clients in raids and definitely not pvp lol, i think that would be a horrible experience for the mobile gamer and pc player
---
You've... Never met Gamon, have you?
---
Not how I would use the specc.
---
“Sorry guys, can’t finish the dungeon, left my phone charger at home.” “I’m running out of mana cause I can’t downrank my heals”. “My bad I should have went d stance, used my sword and shield macro and taunted that mob off you but I have no macros and my thumb got in the way”.  Fuck That.
---
the memes we deserve
---
Proof or gtfo
---
this is great!! haha well done
---
oh shit fam good to hear! didnt mean to come off as a douche who doesnt understand money problem. just make sure youre good at saving gold in classic thats what really matters lol
---
The problem is they're all speed levelers that only do the most exp efficient things. 
---
So they quickly out level their professions and the mobs/nodes that drop things for them.
---
Because EU is far superior. Duh.
---
ill scour the internet for you dude lol
---
It's usually jobs where is isn't just one employee and 80% of the employees are abusing any system they can to get more days off. 
---
Another reason might be is that they have to find a replacement for you. If you're a supervisor or have a specialty position where they may have to schedule someone else to take over for you or at least give them a 24 hour notice then i can see not being able to call off willy nilly without it being an emergency.
---
Proof coming tomorrow, from Blizzard. Be patient.
---
Or it would leave a bunch of mobile players running around in a BG,  while you're using superior PC controls and completely raping.
---
Technically incorrect though. That was the vanilla release date, classic doesn't have one yet.
---
At least frost reflector and dispels can.

DVT

Cyberpunk kids are just undead rogues, only the really bad undead rogues.

Unless this was announced in the last 20 minutes or so, I can say with absolute confidence that this is not true. There are rumors that we will get a big announcement tomorrow and something else on Wednesday though. I will do some research and get back to you.

The feralas/hinterlands/tanaris triangle is my favorite set of zones in wow. They all lead to each other eventually for the alliance and it just flows well especially with ZF/ST quests.
---
Pallies already have blessing of sac which gets them out of poly for free as well.
---
Magic and in its own category
---
Nice but the color of text makes it difficult to read.
---
And so, about this release date? Soon? :D
---
I’ve heard rumors that this could be true. Just because the final fantasy expansion launches that week. And Blizz loves dropping stuff when others do.
---
No doubt its the better choice when talking Sound quality. Problem is not many people take the time to set it up and configure the damn thing. 3/3 i know has not done it and Its terrible. 
---
I just dont see any reason going for something like this, if u just wanna talk with guildies over Discord. If ur one of those youtubers that want their Voice all over the internet and dont wanna wear a headset while talking, sure i understand you then.
---
big yikes :C
---
Fuck off
---
You shouldnt have included the cinematic.
---
Oh no lmao

It's real.
---
I don't remember a single darn pally healing pvp in vanilla, not a single darn one on the way to hwl. Where this notion of "best" due to bubble and plate confuses me. 
---
I stand by my statement, even out of context.

That aside, sure I'm being churlish, but I I no way was insulting.
---
Edit: maybe saw em in av, but not a lot did av for ranks
---
He said to just let it out.
---
as a lock and getting the shadow damage plus gear... (i mean greens yeah but still...)
---
so nice
---
A few of the allcraft guys (such as asmon) are reviled by Blizzard PR staff, who've advised against them being 'Blizzard Supported Influencers'
---
Kinda depends what you want out of the game. If you're pretty casual, you can play whatever you want and it doesn't matter. If you're thinking of raiding competitively or being part of high-end PvP, it's hard to get an invite if you're playing a spec that people look down on. Feral druid is actually one of the better "bad specs" but it still has no strong role in vanilla. I can't imagine many guilds with dreams of competing for the record MC speedrun will want to take a feral druid, but most players have no reason to care about that.
---
I created a topic about this and it got immediately removed.
---
Aside from that I do remember pallies rocking pvp heals in tbc, but never vanilla
---
 Not that I’m of the belief the game launches tomorrow.  But I do need to point out that apex launched like this a few months ago and drew rave reviews.  Saying there’s no chance this happens is pretty ignorant.
---
Agreed just want the release date, don't care about the beta whatsoever... we aren't expecting a polished classic product. Fix that shit as we go along.
---
Yeah, most likely. I cant see Blizzard just dropping a beta out of nowhere.
---
You also gotta spend an extra second or two to skin and loot. 
---
That may seem short for one mob, but do that a few hundred times and that is *minutes* that you could have been killing mobs and probably could have just gotten the same amount of money from all of the skinning you did on a few grey items or a green item.
---
If u are in a pug, then yes, it’s normally just a /roll with another skinner.
---
I was “lucky” enough to get this once on my main......3 days before tBC was released.....so it was pretty much worthless! 😢
---
Am I the only one who fucking hates this guy?
---
Beta tomorrow sure but not launch... would like a release date though.
---
I understood op rather referring to twink items rather than any green
---
The quiet "aaaaaaaaargh" at the end kills me.
---
I was a video once that sunned it up pretty well.
---
"I don't have enough time" is a bad excuse, we all have the same amount of time, it's cants be bought or sold or given away, how you chose to prioritize it is your own choice.
---
Must be a horde scam who made this!
---
Ah ok that's pretty cool
---
Please tell me you’re joking
---
Anyone think they would time it with Elder Scrolls Online big expansion release? as that is also a summer release, seems like their biggest competition.
---
It’s not, but you know who’s coming? YOUR MOM! GOTEM

Loot council with a guild leader that knows his stuff. I dislike DKP or other point systems. There are times where people will not spend DKP on an upgrade just so they dont lose too much DKP so they still can go all in on one of the more precious items like weapons/trinkets etc... 
---
Different players of the same classes will talk to each other just to play the system so they only spend the minimum of DKP. 
---
All these tricks people do just defeat the purpose of a DKP system.
---
As a guild that tries to progress through content DKP is just not the best in my opinion.
---
For random PUGs either GDKP or just /roll what you need.
---
Oov-u-lay for those wondering.
---
sorry figured some ppl dont know wow very well
---
Id be down for Vanilla on mobile phones if it was 100% connected to legit classic wow. How else am I going to snipe auctions from the toilet?
---
sorry was trying to give some background information to those who have never played WoW
---
Ik ik, not supposed to be that serious
---
true lol, there would  be a lot more rank 14's I guess XD
---
I'm probably going to be stuck rolling alliance because there has been a grand total of 1 pve horde raiding guild recruiting, and they're LC =/
---
Yikes, I don't know who this guy is but you get dvt this side of 80 by either appalling luck or gross negligence.
---
It's a thing that in healthy people becomes likely only after hours of complete immobility. It's a risk in 8 hour surgeries, for people bedbound, that kinda thing. Pretty much all you gotta do avoid it is get up and walk every couple of hours for a few minutes. Hell even just standing might be enough.
---
Stormblaster I recall seing, same for Lasso (rings a bell), but thats pretty much it.
---
On SH I played Vanilla (hc), TBC (hc), MoP, WoD, Legion and Bfa (after Cata I quit WoW and was coming back for a bit and then quitting again till next expac was out). During WotLK played on 2 or 3 different servers.
---
Yeah he must be a fake australian.
---
That is if you are shadow specced. Even as disc a priest stands tall against rogues. If they cant kill me in time. If you raid and are decked in current raid gear epics, you usually have 10-20% hp left when you get out of the rogue stuns and they are on CD. After that you can just shield &amp; flash heal back up, and keep the rogue dotted.
---
&gt; Just don't use it more than, oh, say, 2-3 times per year.
---
Unless you frequent Taco Bell
---
If Bajheera had an identical twin who was exactly the same in every way except he didn't gym, bahjeera would be healthier yeah...
---
The game has been released 15 years ago, it's just a re-launch. So it doesn't make sense to compare it to no man's sky.
---
AQ 40 gun beats bwl crossbow so for a short while...
---
And wotf if UD
---
I am also very interested in this guild!
---
In all cases I'd recommend checking with the party to know if anything is reserved before you head to the instance.
---
Otherwise, yeah, typically a roll.
---
Damn bruh even the TLDR was too long
---
human female with the angry face confirmed
---
It'll likely be 200-250ms to OCE servers. That's what I get in reverse. It's not that bad, but certainly noticable. Having said that we all raided for 8 years with pings of 400+ back when the infrastructure was worse to the states and it wasn't unplayable.
---
"I'm staying home to watch streamers who may or may not get into the wow classic beta"?
---
ESO's xpack releases on the 20th for PC and June 4th for PS4 and Xbox.
---
You check, before you engage, who's a skinner. You then random if there are multiple skinners. Whoever wins the random, skins the beast. No matter if it's Pristine or not, they get it if they won the roll. Simple as that. Hope this helps.
---
I just bottle it up. That's why I keep a couple of empty bottles next to my bed
---
No dude. If I have to see another picture of someone's ugly ass red and blue leds I'm gonna puke. And yet, these office memes are actually funny and original so you lose by being uncultured.
---
I’m expecting a polished product.. why the fuck would you not?
---
Desolace &gt; all. Killing Centaurs was my shit back in the day with my buddy. lol
---
Unless I gain access to the game myself I'm not going to take a sick day. I sure as hell have no interest in watching someone else play it.
---
I envy your ability to play Tauren females lol. Wish any other race could be Druids on horde side
---
Ahhh that sucks!!! I'm hoping to get one on my Druid so that I can craft that nice chestpiece in winterspring. Would take a lot of dungeons, but maybe by the time I'm done getting my pre-raid BIS I'd be close enough for it to be worth finishing it out :)
---
Didn't think about possible reserves. Thanks :)!
---
Probably not but you're definitely in a minority.
---
Wowhead. Click the classic toggle at the top.
---
Both
---
I wonder about retail streamers. I thought Preach hinted something about classic news recently.
---
Good for you bud
---
If you're playing on a PvP server, the stuff you can do with Shadowmeld is amazing. I feel like its useful in some niche interesting way for just about every class. 
---
I'm tempted to roll Alliance just so I can make a Night Elf Priest at some point just to shadowmeld some where dangerous and Mind Control fools to their death.
---
Because we had dungeon finder in the blizzcon beta build.
---
Anyone who thinks it's going to be like vanilla but polished like bfa is in for it :)
---
The thumb nail pic looks like someone else grabbin you chin. Because is the mic, makes it look like it come from different angel as a sleeve.
---
Kind of funny cause the look on you face make it seem like you dont wan ya chin grabbin ya gettin. and you wan them stop it, but you jus take chin grabbin anyways
---
Aww, I was really excited when I clicked this.
---
Blizzard have never released a game or major expansion on any other day then a Tuesday.
---
They do it for hearthstone, doesn't surprise me.
---
oh okay thanks a lot, will do for the next video!
---
I always saw him as making fun of the community and not the actual game. You know the private server extremists like myself who use #nochanges in almost every sentence and view any request for change as a personal attack.
---
&gt; Do you think it's because we're basically an ancient crowd compared to the crowd streaming normally caters to?
---
Absolutely. It's a tale as old as time, older people being annoyed by "kids these days". If you're between 30 and 45 like many Classic enthusiasts are then chances are you don't understand the point of streaming and streamers.
---
this is why blizzard hates him and for good reason https://streamable.com/t2emt
---
Listen to Jordan Peterson and “Clean your room!”
---
But seriously, it’s nice to see a candid battlestation photo
---
yeah it's sad how people have been eating it up and fanning the flames for this stuff, it's cringe as fuck
---
I believe the tram was added in patch 1.11 though, and the game will be starting on a patch earlier than that with their spelled out 4 phase system, no?
---
Monday July 1st would be amazing but I doubt it. I'm guessing late August early / mid September. 
---
Don't care about beta tomorrow unless it comes paired with a release date :)
---
dude kinda had it coming considering his csgo history
---
Obviously Mage doesn't need their trinket to break stuns, and Rogues can definitely live without it. What always was strange to me was that Warlocks couldn't break stun with their trinket. I get that they are immensely powerful in the later gear levels, but it just seemed so strange considering how desperately they need it.
---
Yes my son
---
While he tried to give some creds to Elwyn Forrest, you can clearly see that this guy is a hordeplayer.
---
I think I would like to see others grabbin you chin. Maybe even 2 hand doing chin grabbin. Grab with forefinger and thumb.
---
Maybe some grabbin with chop sticks.
---
Cresent wrench grab, maybe a BBQ tongs grab. You do a double feet grab on the 2 sides of chin
---
there is no way they would randomly launch it like that but it knowing blizzard and their massive fuckups with diablo it makes sense considering its mostly kids and teenagers that worship streamers and """content creators"""
---
no reasonable adult is getting giddy over a twitter personality and their tweets
---
I saw that a few days ago aswell, wanted to make the same post ... then I thought "nah People will just be disappointed".
---
Should have done it.
---
&gt;Also seeing as 8.2 is set to launch later this summer it only makes sense that classic launches now, as I don't think blizzard wants 8.2 launch to be THAT close to classic launch.
---
This is the depressing truth and why I believe late August / mid September is release... so they can pretend they released something close to blizzcon, then release WC3 reforgex in November/ December
---
Okay, I'll draw comparisons between the two, and you can respond and let me know your take on my points.  
---
1. Apex Legends had absolutely no hype going into it, there was no leaks, no announcements, the only information that was given was Respawn was working on a project, and people assumed it was the new star wars game (which it also is). Classic WoW has been hyped for more than two years, with a LOT of intimate knowledge being passed to the fans, content creators and press. 
---
2. There also wasn't a single influencer, let alone an entire room full, that was brought on a plane to Respawn HQ to feed information to unveil the game. We have seen Blizzard giving influencers the say-so and special privledge to influencers that they have brought on to help increase the hype of the game, in anticipation of a huge release announcement. 
---
3. The week prior to Apex launching, Anthem had just launched to very very mediocre reviews, and people were bashing not only Bioware, but also EA. While it doesn't matter if the blame was justified or not, what is relevant is EA was able to leverage a launch of a polished game (Apex) as a scapegoat to draw away some of the backlash. This is not the case for World of Warcraft, even if they're a bit of a meme at the moment, the gravity of the situation is very different. Blizzard hadn't released a game in the last week, month, or let alone several quarters. They do not need to rely on a shock drop announcement to **deter** hate, they want to draw as **many** eyes as possible to what they presume will be a successful launch of classic. 
---
4. This is less of a comparison, and more of a point, but I never said there was **no chance** of this happening. To be clear, I said it wasn't plausible. In essence, I'm saying that people are going with a 'feeling' and not logic, as I've used the bullet points to describe. There's a very big difference between impossibility and improbability. I don't work at Blizzard, I don't know their marketing team, the budgeting they have invested into Classic, nor their release cadence, but I can extrapolate situations based on previous iterations of their products, and how the industry (software) as a whole functions. 
---
When we use the word "like this" we need to understand that we're attempting to compare two things, and yes, they're definitely two games, and yes, they're games that were being developed, an apple and an orange are both fruits, and yet the idiom stays true:
---
**Comparing Apex to WoW Classic is akin to Apples to Oranges.**
---
Dude,  this made my night XD
---
My Wife was planning on taking our kids to her mothers for a week starting on the 1st as it coincides with the school holidays here. If this is true, I would be so happy!!!!!!!
---
Haha so based on the fact my luck isn't this good, i'm going to assume it isn't true.
---
You didn't know that social groups of humans may have predetermined rules for sharing resources?
---
Wow.
---
You know that even monkeys understand the concept of feeding the young first, right?
---
Macho Man Randy Savage is a CLEAR and easy winner.  If you can’t base a decision off this, I don’t know what’s real anymore.
---
This is actually really smart man, kudos to you.
---
I personally don't have any issues with my weight or health at all, but I'm inclined to set this up just because it seems like such a good idea.
---
No its not, and your post, as well as the video, are just a pathetic trollbait.
---
How do you figure lol?
---
Even if they make you come in you can always go for a power move and shit your pants.
---
I'd play the hell out of Vanilla mobile if were an actual mobile port linked to your Classic WoW account

I hope they don't. It would compeletely ruin the launch for probably half the playerbase. We didn't wait YEARS just to get robbed of the Launch... 
---
Not to mention people without responsibilites already have a huge advantage in how much they can play. At least let us start at equal footing and then they can get ahead!
---
A suprise launch would just screw so many people over. Working people and students alike. Even the people that just happen to be abroad or booked something for next week.
---
Same
---
Go aoe if you are going to play that much
---
&gt;It's coming.
---
According to exactly no one but yourself and the guy who made that pathetic video (aka. most likely yourself).
---
Yeah man I take your points. Maybe distilled wisdom is used on a few fights in naxx, it's not what I've heard but some people might do it. One or two of them ain't gonna set you back though, especially when most alchs have the recipe so you are never really buying it straight out (you would make yourself or get a guildy to do it). 
---
I've never run naxx, I can imagine popping that many runes would be crazy. But do you really think each healer is buying those 10 runes per run straight from AH? You'd have to be retarded to do that. If you and your guildys are decked in end game loot you really think that scholo run is gonna take you 90 mins? As a healer they probs just ask their buds and run it 3 or 4 times over a few hours. That way they are making gold while getting 15+ dark runes. 
---
Your points are that it's expensive if you just buy everything off AH, but in reality no one does that. You can't afford to. You might try and say not everyone has the time to farm. To which I would respond if you are buying off AH you would have need to farm the gold anyway so you may as well just get the items yourself. So, back to my original point. If you plan it out you don't have to pay much at all. I do concede that the difference in costs might be smaller then I think though.
---
You gotta get to a baker's dozen. Time is money friend!

in 9 hours from now, we may be getting either a large info drop, a release date, a beta release date / schedule, beta footage, streamers playing a beta. We dont know exactly what, but streamers have hinted at something big happening in approximately 9 hours so be ready !
---
You're spamming and brigading.
---
Reported.
---
It's not misinformation, you're just very impatient.
---
what do you mean Ashenvale?
---
Ah thanks, you gave me my morning lol :-)
---
FFXIV Shadowbringers xpac is set up for July 2nd. IMHO that's corporate dick move instead of "soon" or "when it's ready". Imagine for a second the servers are unstable at launch because they lack those few extra weeks to tune everything fine.
---
More like knew him, as I havent spoken with him for years. Not sure if he changed his nicks on bnet or steam - over years lost track who was who (as nicks changed/differed). Was a cool guy, was fun playing with him.
---
Do you think i can offtank without farming so many? @
---

---
Lol. No
---
Cry more rivers.
---
Lol, have an upvote for the chuckle
---
I wouldn’t mind watching platinumWoW, madseason, or Frostadamus play. I enjoy those streamers/content creators. But of course I’d rather play myself.
---
I honestly don’t know. For the type of player I am in video games I feel like it fit my personality well but the only other character I leveled to 60 was a warrior. The grind itself was brutal no matter the class.
---
I am already in a guild kinda, they seem friendly and they understand the different playstyles and lyfestyles players have nowadays. They do not seem to focus on making the members farm machines to clear raids in a blink of an eye. Do you think they might take me as a offtank? I do not have experience with guild so i might be naive
---
&gt;tomorrow, SOMETHING is coming.
---
Of course there is.
---
At about 7:30am after I had my morning Coffee, and am sitting comfortably on the toilet, something is definitely going to come out.
---
There was quite a few good combos. I played druid/warr but the mirror and pally/warrior matchups were so painful, it was basically whoever went to sleep first - 28 min match for 4 pts no ty. If i did it again *cough Classic TBC* I'll play double dps for sure, fast and brutal.
---
Pretty sure its just Bear Form
---
You know that humans understand the concept of not acting like an ass to people asking questions, right?
---
Really? That's my birthday!
---
There's just too many ifs and buts to really say. Are we including weird shit like being in the "devilsaur mafia"? What are server the caps? Which runs work and which don't? 
---
If the instances don't work, the best solo farm is probably gonna be something open-world that you can never hope to get to yourself, like a whole area of fire elementals. Maybe if you can farm in the middle of the night.
---
If all the instances work, solo tribute should still be the best even though you have to die and run back in to reset. The DM graveyard is pretty close. Lashers would be awkward because they drop a large volume of items and you'd need to keep 10-12 open bag slots for your equipment when you die to reset.
---
Maraudon will most likely work since it's limited how different that can be from private server data, but it's capped at like 40-50g/hour just based on the hourly instance reset limit. And that's only if you kill the goblin, princess *and* croc which I recall some classes having trouble with. I've only done it with hunter and warlock.
---
My personal blind guess is that lashers will drop poorly, tribute won't be possible for some mechanical reason, Mara will work the way it does in pservers, and DM N guard/dogs will be the go-to farm run for mages. It requires skinning which is annoying, but it's right next to the entrance so you don't have any trouble resetting.
---
The devilsaur mafia, if it exists in Classic (probably will), will be the most profitable repeatable thing you can do. The second best is gonna be tanking instances and reserving all loot except need rolls. Farming comes in third with whatever happens to be the best farming method, and then double gathering professions comes in fourth.
---
If they have to play on the regular servers im all for it. 
---
Would love to juice some phone turning scrubs.
---
That fucking dwarf gunshot scene was too good
---
I so hope they don’t have a Beta. What would a real classic experience be without server roll backs for the first 3 months!
---
Alliance has a nice beer culture ran by dwarves, and Ironforge is the best city. Horde looks like a metal festival that lasts forever.
---
I guess I ask my friends which side they are gonna roll and go with that.

---
Do you think i can find a spot in a casual guild as a feral offtank casual for raids? 5mans wont be a problem
---
Total Alliance lean in the beginning there and then the rest just seemed randomly picked. I spent a month or more leveling through Tirisfal to Silverpine to Hillsbrad  on my Forsaken warlock back in the day and they'll always be my bros. Also, who was iffy on Stranglethorn? Pretty sure that was a universally loved brother on both sides.
---
The internet has taught me the opposite.
---
Humans also understand the concept of being condescending to people whos level of intellect they find amusing.
---
Sorry I trampled all over your feel-good-fantasy. Or actually, no I am not.
---
Er that's kinda the point. It's probably going to be a pretty closed beta for at least a couple of weeks but with the NDA down we will learn a ton about how the 1.12 content and mechanics work int the new engine.
---
There will most likely be enough servers for this to not even be an issue anyway.
---
I want to go alliance because i want to like how my toon looks, but horde have better pvp racials. So idk.
---
https://i.imgur.com/TPlvkPR.png
---
It depends, some guilds will have class leaders, some role leaders, some just officers in general. I would say having a class leader for each class is most common one.
---
So you didn't trust anyone back then.
---
To which Towlee replied "you good dawg" implying that beta will not be out for at least another 3 days. So what happens at 9am PST? An announcement?
---
That's my thought on it too. 
---
Way too many nerds in here freaking out thinking it's going to ruin the game (blizzard wouldn't let that happen), and so many people not realizing the good potential of it.
---
Don't worry. It happens to the best of us.
---
Jesus. How long did that take.
---
What's your budget and resolution preference? 1080p, 1440p, or 4k? 60hz or 120/144hz? Need that info before we can recommend a laptop. I'd say for 1080p a GTX 1060 or better laptop would suffice. 1440p or high refresh rate shoot for a GTX 1070 or RTX 2060 or greater. 4K is hard af to run even on the wow engine, would honestly recommend desktop at that point due to price constraints. Plus very few laptops have 4k panels anyways so that's a moot point. Hope this helps.
---
Should be renamed "Withered Jim reacts" instead
---
I highly doubt it - 8.2 is expected to be released early July based on Blizzard comments, analysing past content cycles and that it coincides with FFXIV's new expansion release (July 2nd?). I would be incredibly surprised if Blizzard were to stack Classic release with release of a major patch on BFA servers.
---
Given the little information we have about Classic, that there has been next to no marketing for it and no external testing has been made available (Blizzcon demo was not testing, it was purely to sell passes), it's highly unlikely Classic will be released any earlier than the very end of Summer. And to be honest, any earlier would be cause for concern - there just wouldn't be enough time to implement feedback on bugs/exploits/reverting changes etc.
---
I did this. I could only raid from like 5-8 but most raids started at 7-8 so I joined an East coast server. Worked great.
---
Literally 0% chance it launches tomorrow. When has Blizzard released a game without a release date? Tomorrow will either be release date or closed/open beta or both possibly. More likely I'm betting on closed beta.
---
I'd estimate it to about one hour.
---
There was a YT video recently where the guy ran each continent from south to north, and it took him about that time.
---
... okay
---
Not even summer brah. No chance this will happen but would be cool.
---
I didn't even trus myself at the beginig, it was a hard time.
---
Same with those who call other people autists for no reason
---
That's not related to the PvP trinkets at all.
---
Female orc looks fine as hunter
---
If you grind mobs for greys at around 35, and assuming you dont waste gold, yes 100%. If you only quest.. maybe, a bit hrder to answer
---
You should seriously look into AoEing though, its not tht hard

I'm guessing he thinks that Bajheera is on the same amount of roids/HGH/insulin as Olympia level bodybuilders, which he certainly isn't.

“Something has come up” - makes it sound somewhat serious and implies you don’t want to talk about it.  Also technically not a lie 🤷‍♂️

I agree with you for what it's worth. It's a categorization system.

is your brain actually so fucked that you can only imagine someone would call you out on your freak comment if they were a diehard fan of the guy? LOL that confirms exactly what kind of person you are
---
???
---
It doesn't work, there seem to be some random channels about this guy popping every week.
---
I systematically tells YouTube I don't care about Asmonshit related videos, yet their super AI algorithm has yet to understand ...
---
Im not sure but i think i had to go through Desolace and Feralas because i couldn't kite down the elevator from Barren to Needles. So it might be more like one and a half or even up to two hours.
---
&gt;How does the holy paladin deal with fears from level 55+ 5mans and raids?
---
Bubble
---
My heart...
---
That‘d be cool. Trap them all on one server then don‘t let them change it.
---
Just gonna say you sound like you've never tried to drag a pre-bis group through Scholo for your dark runes, or tried to farm Satyrs in Felwood for demonics on a PVP server. Sometimes buying the runes is actually the more time efficient farm. 
---
I digress; doesn't sound like you can be convinced otherwise.
---
Fact is that many people mistakenly believe that weight directly correlates with exercise.
---
It doesn't - your weight fluctuation is determined solely by your caloric intake and expenditure. Count calories, and you'll be able to stay lean while nolifing and eating shit food (even if it's still not healthy, you at the very least won't become obese)
---
To lose weight, you literally just have to put less food in your mouth - the discipline to do so is the only requirement.
---
Gold and black on gold and black...
---
You chose like the one color combo that wouldnt work.
---
Most of them didn't even know about private servers before Nostalrius and none of them have ever played vanilla when it was a thing back in '05-'06. They're just leeches and entrepreneurs that saw a way to make an easy living, read a couple of forum posts, spoke to some private server heroes to learn some niche things, and jumped right on it. This also explains why they're actually getting a lot of stuff wrong in their videos, because their baseline is a buggy mess. They have no real knowledge or experience of the original.
---
Unless you're gnome
---
My dad woroks for blizard he said july 1st also
---
There's no 5 mans where fear ward makes a big difference. It's nice for raids but doable without and you only really need 1/2, anymore is overkill. Blessing are a fun part of being a pally, they're huge buffs to many classes, people love having pallies in their group when questing and in dungeons because of it.
---
Not for nothing, but that would be an pretty excellent and unique signature move, so to speak.
---
or a beta release!
---
Or nothing :o
---
You don't have to speed level for this to be an issue. 
---
Just naturally progressing will for the most part be more than enough to out level the usefulness of your profession.
---
Keeping crafting professions up to date while leveling can take a while.
---
Right off that bat, I know this will sound cliché because it is repeated over and over again on this subreddit, but... play the class that appeals to you more! If you are going to be super annoyed by buffing the raid often, don’t play paladin. If you aren’t  fond of managing hots, bubbles, and different spell ranks then priest might not be for you.
---
The two classes are different to play as and have their respective strengths for sure. Fear ward is great for fights like Magmadar, Ony, and Nef. However, it isn’t make or break in any way (someone else in the raid will be a dwarf priest). If you end up deciding you really like the paladin class fantasy more than the priest (or vice versa), trust your gut. Once you get rolling you’ll get good at whichever you choose!
---
If in doubt go with whichever one you like the class lore of more. Otherwise you'll constantly be looking at what the other class has with envy.
---
So this is what it feels like if blizzard had no money
---
You were really really bored then :D
---
I hope your week starts getting  better man. Cheer up.
---
That would make them too op, stunning a warlock to death is one of the few ways to kill them. On private servers recently, there has been some duel tournaments and there is a reason why the winner of those is always an orc warlock
---
True. Either way, I'm curious as to what today's announcement is going to be...
---
Good to know
---
It's a reliable way for warlocks to break stuns.
---
How did you take it down the 1k needles elevator? 
---
Or did you just swim to tanaris?
---
Desolace and Feralas :)
---
To minimize overcrowded starter zones they will launch the game tomorrow without warning /s
---
Ah, the ol' shitting your pants on purpose. Good move
---
Classic has meaningful progression and contnt even when youre lvl 20. Retail has none until you start raiding. If youre a casual you get to have a meaningful expereience right off the bat
---
My guy did you just say ally shaman? Lol
---
They did not state there would be sharding. And latest insider information is leaning towards no sharding / dynamic spawns. With that in mind, a ninja release would be the most desirable release.
---
Oh man i would love to join a guild just as you described. Played vanilla in my early 20s. Now mid 30s and a 2yr old minion running and singing around here.
---
He's natural for sure. People think he lifts heavy, when really for an average built male you can hit where he is with 2-3 years of 3 days a week with a proper diet, leverages aside.
---
kill me. beta is advertising now instead of bug testing and feedback. 
---
NO CHANGES
---
All because DP?
---
Wasn't possible in 1.12.
---
You ain't getting a party though.
---
If it is as simple as you phrase it, I think you would be more happy with a mage. I too can feel drawn towards cool endgame pieces like lok'delar and the like - but I realize that just getting to 60 will take a long ass time, and the road leading up to that point is going to be the actual journey. So it seems much more productive to focus on what you want the gameplay to be, rather than the endgame goals.
---
Unfortunate.
---
&gt;heavy sweatpants and a thick hoodie
---
I don't get why you would loose fat like this. Water maybe but fat, I'd do the opposite : go in a cold environment.
---
After a while you get it
---
While I agree, exercises help. If you are skinny it doesn't mean you are fit and healthy too. 
---
I have a friend who is 1.80m and was 115kg. At some point he decided to do something about it, and started with the very basic - running, he could barely run 300m without stopping (I am not a great runner and I don't think it is very good when you are heavy but still), after a while he did 15km each day, he worked on 2 jobs but still manage to find time to do it, lost 40 kgs, got a gym membership, changed his eating habits and now he is a gym coach.
---
The beauty of it is that youll have a different experience with your choice, the community is what I really want from classic releasing tbh
---
Not a fan of surprises in general. Yes my mind would be blown 100% but would not be happy.
---
On pservers, yes. The amount of honor everybody in the server was meant to get was predetermined and "bracket beakers" who exceeded the set honor caps were hated.
---
GARITHOS DID NOTHING WRONG! HE JUST LOVED HIS PEOPLE!
---
Then you dont know him at all. He wouldn't even dare to start a fight IRL in the first place
---
Yeah this sh*t aint no joke, this is why I'm considering PVE server this time even though I'm a PvPer. At least thats abit less time consuming.
---
Imagine insulting someone’s intelligence but not knowing how to spell the word ‘whose’...
---
Actually insufferable 4Head
---
&gt; As a paladin, you're killing a mob every \~60 seconds, the extra three seconds isn't that much
---
3 seconds of extra porn for Paladins :p
---
I feel like point systems leave too much freedom to the raid, and most people look at their own performance and not the raid as a whole.
---
I'd classify all items in a tier list, and use loot council for very valuable items.
---
Meme items, situational items, some tiers, side-upgrades, or minor upgrades from pre-bis, roll+1. 
---
Simple, no need for addons or anything, people still have some freedom to choose what they want, but not as much impact in overall raid performance.
---
Making a 10 minute video, about something you read this one time on discord, where you talk at the camera while showing some generic ingame footage seems like a pretty effortless job.
---
Lol when the tauren hit the bear with the small stick instead of a massive mace
---
What? I asked a question.. how is that portrayed as a “fact”? 
---
Honestly wtf is going on, why the fuck am I getting roasted for asking a fucking god damn question?? 
---
This is why I’m never coming back to wow. Community is fucking toxic.
---
Even a broken clock is right twice a day.
---
Too bad you guys are NA. Would be a perfect ft if it was EU 😀
---
Hey c'mon now. At least be consistent. You really think naxx geared healers are 'dragging people in pre bis' through scholo to farm dark runes. That is not realistic. I've heard directly from high level players running naxx that they have never asked any healers to pop distilled wisdom so you are mis-informed there. I don't even know why we're talking about naxx, 99% of players aren't going to run it. All through bwl and the majority of AQ on psevers I barely had to use any dark runes and certainly no flasks. All I was really taking were resistance potions, major manas and mp5 food (all of which I made and fished for myself, costing me nothing). You can try and say I'm wrong but my experience suggests otherwise.
---
Alright, keep me posted.
---
Sulfuras
---
Back when DayZ was a thing and he was getting in shape I really enjoyed his content.
---
&gt;You don't even understand classic or its mechanics.
---
Wut
---
&gt;I'm not sure what to say. You guys are the biggest but you can't just buy accurate knowledge as proven by your atrocious class overviews.
---
"Ive watched several youtube videos which means I am as much of an expert as all those people making said videos"
---
How can one be such an ass.
---
No dungeon needs attunement. As for raids MC,BWL,Onyxia and Naxx have attunements.
---
As for keys, you only need someone in your group to have the key, or even outside of your group to open for you. They are done via quests usually inside dungeons themselves.
---
BRD is lowest level dungeon and has a shadowforge key.
---
LBRS has no key.
---
UBRS has a seal of ascension key (very hard to get, its common to just pay someone to open you).
---
Dire Maul has Crescent Key.
---
Stratlholme has Key to the City.
---
Scholomance has Key to Scholomance.
---
Those are the names of keys, you can just google quests for them. 
---
As for order of dungeons besides doing BRD first, difficulty of rest depends on group setup mostly. Order is not so important, just look up what gear you want and hit those dungeons.
---
It's going to be long grain white basmati rice with a vegetarian tikka masala. Its low cholesterol, low in saturated fats. Using smoked Edamame(fermented soybean meat substitute) as a meat substitute. Also a choice of garlic of plane pita bread which will be low sodium and cooked fresh. House salad with shredded carrot,cabbage, diced tomato and green pepper with balsamic and olive oil dressing.
---
fuck these reaction videos, these are not original content but being a parasite
---
His deep dive videos are good.
---
I'm more interested in who wrote it and what his stocks are.
---
WPL
---
I have a slight feeling it will be announced 2 weeks in advance.
---
Ya. It's the main reason I quit every xpac after a few months. No one raids at 1230am pst or later. Latest I found was 1030pm but it's rare I get off that early.
---
How shitty would it be if the big announcement is just the lame streamers testing deadmines or something on the closed beta sever
---
My mother also said July in a sentence earlier this week. I think we are on to something...
---
Depends on the group. Some groups made it a free roll to ALL party members. Some made it a /roll for skinners to have the right to skin it. Some skinned it then let skinners roll. Some group just skipped the boss altogether because it was too much drama. Others fell apart because of it. 
---
Simply put... there was no etiquette for it and it varied per group. Plus reddit isn't the best place to ask this because it tends to be the more hardcore and their methods instead of what actually happened. If you have a time machine you could see the drama from that skin all over the official forums. It is a tricky item given that it is the only profession item that ONLY comes from a raid (minus hound skins but ppl didn't pug MC or to the extent of UBRS). One group claims all have a right to it because you can't get it anywhere else and require that raid's help to do it. The other claims since it a profession item then only those with a high enough profession can have a right to it.  So ask your group and make sure the rules are clear before the run.
---
Can't quote you now since you removed the post. But yeah you asked a question and that's fine. But did you forget about the first half of the post? xD
---
The WoW classic community is one of the least toxic you will find. Reddit is different, however.
---
Lol fanboy much? If Mn didn't want to be associated with tips, he shouldn't have accepted the invitation to go on his stream. Tips out is as scum as they get for sure, but mn isn't far behind him.
---
Balance/feral hybrids are no joke.
---
Beta.
---
I call release dates "deadlines". External testing needs to be done and feedback given before they can realistically say when a game will be ready for release. Any release date before public testing means a rushed and buggy end product.
---
Release date.
---
If its a ninja release there would be many, many upset working adults.
---
Diarrhea levels of shitty.
---
There's nothing wrong with both.
---
Do they keep the roots or are they dispelled once they have blinked? Can't remember anymore.
---
Bodybuilding becomes unhealthy when you start shooting up steroids/hgh/insulin/whatever other dangerous drug people abuse for muscle gains. Bajheera is obviously natural and from what I know about him he eats clean as fuck and exercises daily so you’d better believe he’s healthy lol.
---
Wrath of the lich cringe
---
Those guys are awesome, Kargoz as well. TipsOut, Towelie, StaySafe and some others however... Not so much.
---
Whats  up tomorrow?
---
I'd be happier for a release date, but it's probably a beta dropping tomorrow for everyone I think. 
---
Beta will keep at least some retail players busy while they wait for 8.2 to drop, which is a huge content patch.
---
I keep debating in my mind if Blizzard wants Classic and 8.2 to drop at the same time, or if they'd want them to be separate so that they aren't competing for players. 8.2 is supposed to drop during late June or early July which is when summer officially starts, however college students are getting out of school now and summer is starting so I'd assume that Classic should come out before 8.2 in the next month or so.
---
Clickety clickbait
---
My congratulations, sir!
---
Same for Sap
---
wow
---
Looks hella cozy.
---
Something like that.

I think he has a crush on you and doesn’t know how to express his feelings
---
Source: am in Naxx right now on pserver. Have popped wisdom for Saph and KT progression. Will take anyone to Scholo as a means for runes. Have farmed Satyrs for 15+ hours a week.
---
Farm content = low rune consumption, in the same way it means low consumes for all classes. Progression = high consumption. Pretty basic IMO. Yeah a healer in farm content wont burn through too many resources but neither will the mage popping a greater arcane elixir and occasionally LIPping.
---
**edit**: also, that late in a server, the ONLY people who need Scholo are healers and people who want pre-bis. Occasionally you'll get someone geared trying to farm Argent Dawn rep but honestly why would anyone geared for Naxx need Scholo unless it was for runes or the 1.11 shaman totem?
---
**edit 2:** i'm also willing to bet YOUR source plays alliance and has never had to heal Saph without blessing of wisdom and paladins who never go OOM.
---
July 16th Release!?! &lt;3
---
Fakey Mc Fakeface
---
Not mine at all, I have been getting these from people in Discord though.
---
At this point I have no idea if these are legit.
---
I guess we will know in 12 hours.
---
This guy is a real tank.
---
You know, doing it in that order (so long as everyone knows that's how it'll be done, beforehand) seems like the best way to keep drama from starting. That way everyone knows the rules, knows exactly who it's going to before it drops.
---
This comment gave me explosive diarrhea. Just what I needed to skip work today, thanks man.
---
Well thought out response. To be fair though new battle royales come out every week, so there was not much interest in information on what the next one might be.
---
As to your second point, this is entirely untrue. They may not have been flown in, but every major influencer on twitch was payed to play apex for the first week. This means respawn absolutely contacted and worked out details for a contract with them before the release, and no one with half a brain is signing up to play a game for a week without knowing if it will be any good, when that’s how they make their living.
---
The third point I find completely irrelevant, I played anthem and it was complete garbage, but I find it hard to believe they would rush a different game out to attempt to distract blame. that sounds like a recipe for disaster. But using your analogy I think blizzard releases new games all the time via patches to retail, and the most recent retail patch appears to have run its course, and now would be a perfect time for a game release, since its supposed to be months before the next big patch.
---
Your fourth point is completely correct. I’m not sure why I inferred that. My bad homie! :)
---
May 14th, 2019. But then says January 16, 2019. Missing the th.
---
Fake
---
I like the fact that Blizzard doesn't have to spend a dime on Classic wow advertising. Everyone and their mum will play Classic.
---
this shit is kinda a downside of classic for me... only my opinion of course
---
Gamespy knows whats up.
---
True. Female orc always looks fine.
---
What if my ultimate bar isn't full yet?
---
Ah, okay. Thanks for the thorough answer. If I were to tank a group for this my inclination would be to only let it go to the skinners, who roll for the opportunity. A comment above talks about rolling \*before\* you skin, and that makes the most sense to me so that people don't try to change the rules if that sweet drop comes down.  
---
For me, it seems like any other rare profession item. I wouldn't demand to roll on a black lotus if I weren't an herbalist, or roll on a rich thorium vein if I weren't a miner.
---
Velf monk?
---
The one person I've read mentioning that it works really well was someone in a top guild on the n-server. And iirc he only started looking into the specc when they were well into speed running BWL. (Suddenly trash clear speed is important too). He said he always tired healing on trash, but pretty much went back to HT on bosses IIRC. 
---
So it's a very niche use case - being overheated, competing for clear times, and bring specialised in healing on trash packs (so short fights). 
---
I think the standard Nature's grace specc is much more useful - but I definitely saw the synergy between T2, and those two talents, and like you, wondered what you could do with that ;)
---
horde, no question
---
My money is that tomorrow will be Beta stuff since that’s what so many streamers have been low key hyping. But I would prefer a release date so I can put PTO in.
---
Cant remember where but i do remember HOW i did ding. For by chance at first i always dinged by discovering a new area. Now i actively try to make sure i do the same thing on every char i make.
---
sure... mid level blues that cost an arm and a leg.
---
Okay lets say you're right and it costs healers quite a bit to progress through naxx, I said up front I've never done it only spoken to those who have. Still don't know why we are only speaking about naxx in a damn 'simple questions' thread lol. Progressing through MC/BWL/AQ is cheaper for a healer as they won't really be using dark runes all that much, nor will they be flasking, nor will they be using the plethora of stat pots that all classes need to use (and need to be re-popped after each wipe). Seeing as how that is the content that most players will actually do saying that it's cheaper to raid as a healer is a pretty valid thing to say. Unsure how you don't agree with this.
---
WhisperCast was a thing in vanilla as an fyi
---
You also have to manage your mama as a hunter, trinket swap, time your rotation according to your rapid fire or IAoH. Not to mention the possible melee weaving and making your per do optimal damage. And if your troll you need to think about how you can get potential out of your bloodlust. It's not as you depicted it is.
---
go to work you slacker
---
its a video game it can wait
---
Yup. As someone that’s been bodybuilding for 7 years I am almost 100% certain that he’s natural. If his physique was unobtainable naturally it sure would suck to be a natural bodybuilder lol.
---
Name checks out
---
I started playing in wotlk, is classic that different when leveling? It sure wasnt so easy as it is now
---
Fear ward doesn't matter, if you're going to roll a priest roll dwarf but this ability isn't that important.  Only raid bosses really have a fear you need to worry about, and warriors can literally deal with them without a dwarf priest, horde doesn't have fear ward and we do just fine (don't even mention tremor totem).  Certain fears are also dispellable.  
---
Paladin buffs are more important, and very strong. The two classes play almost identically end game, just bring different niche's to the raid. If you don't like buffing, roll a priest basically, because paladins have to buff... a lot.
---
&gt;Seeing the excuse "I can't work out because I'm tired so I just game and let my health get worse" is so frustrating because it isn't true.
---
Right, that's like your brain playing tricks on you.
---
How do you feel about the people selling the runs?
---
If you’re going to fake it at least check the spelling before you post it lmao
---
You're Swedish, I can tell.
---
Do you also consider Swamp of Sorrows a good zone because of Sunken Temple?
---
Release date. I'm tired of stressing out over my vacation days. Beta is more likely but hopefully it's both.
---
Pixar called, they want their lamp back. HEYOO
---
&gt;I am in the minority
---
You're not. Most people prefer the watered down version of WoW, look at subscriber numbers.
---
Lok'Tar Ogar!
---
Y'all can have Bret Hart
---
&gt; they have a hard task in making interesting vids
---
The point is most of them don't do interesting videos. They take "news" that you can talk about in 2 minutes and stretch it to 10 so they can monetize. They are not content creators, they are content leechers.
---
True true but tanaris has more. I remember getting my first mount around that time and riding over the sand hills
---
Might not been the best example with tips i agree. But the point still remains for pretty much all streamers.
---
Couldnt care less about beta (unless im in it), i just want the release date.
---
Log them?
---
Both classes can deal with fear so the difference you need to focus on is: Priest is a caster, they DOT up a target and finish them off with spells or wand. Paladins buff up thier auto attack with seals, wear heavy armor and fight in melee. 
---
That will be you gameplay experience most of the time for the first 150 hours. Many players only get to lvl 47 and then quit. Priest and paladin are both excellent in the endgame so stop overthinking this.
---
Looks like fishing
---
Mumble streamer
---
I'll be super excited but also a little mad. Due to prior commitments there's no way I can get any time off work until mid-July, which is why selfishly I'm hoping the 16th of July date turns out to be right: I can get that week off.
---
So were macros that allowed you to basically bot your rotation, and macros that blatantly exploited bugs in spells (warrior charge.) If we're gonna bring those back, blizzard might as well start supporting bot clients that worked back then as well. Nochanges amirite
---
"I can't tell you guys, its just some BlizzCon stuff, that's all"
---
Connect the dots.
---
Ban the OP
---
There is too little and then there is too much... he might look good and be at a super healthy peak state right now, but I don't think it's healthy for the body to workout that amount..
---
LMFAO, and because Hitler had a bunch of followers he was right too? And moron i dont even watch asmongold, i dont watch any streamers anymore and havent for a long time... the only persistent one here is you going on and assuming shit to validate your point. So if there are only a handful of streamers then why is it such a big deal??? lmfao you're a fucking joke dude
---
I'd rather kill myself
---
In 5mans there really arent fears and if you get incapacitated, you can always bubble out of it. Same goes for raid fears. Got that one get out of jail card every 5 minutes. But in most content HEALERS will outrange the fear, so its non issue. And in raids warriors + shaman/dwarf priest will handle the tank fears (and there arent many).
---
It’s real. Quote me when I am proven right.
---
I calculated that if you were only grinding mobs to reach lvl 60 (pretty unlikely) and that you'd skinned all of them it would add 12h of /played.
---
In a more realistic scenario I don't think it will add to more than 6h.
---
Fwiw I found a Vanilla screenshot of my priest buying his mount at lvl 40 on a fresh server. I don't remember much but I saw that he had 91 gold (just enough to buy the mount) and he was a skinner.
---
No big crits? I guess you didn't get aimed shot
---
I'm not as young as i used to be and spammy classes cause my keyboard hand wrist to get sore. I've tried leveling a rogue on a private server before classic but I'm finding it too spammy. What's a better class for me that doesn't require button presses every/most gcd's?
---
I wonder how many people from this subreddit have actually called in sick at some point in their life simply because they didn't want to miss out on some specific event or new game release...
---
I've called in sick twice during my entire career and both times I was already in the hospital as I was calling in sick.
---
even if it was real you'd be breaking NDA already
---
&gt; we will learn a ton about how the 1.12 content and mechanics work int the new engine.
---
They should work just like back then, otherwise it's not the authentic experience they said they want to recreate.
---
What's with these crazy strawman's people in this sub bring up? You weren't ok with something, doesn't mean it should be removed. Also spell batching is in the game on your warrior charge point so
---
Blanket statement, ban 'em all.
---
Just as much as it is for the other classes whose PvP trinket actually dispels stuns.
---
Samesies, I was grinding mobs outside AQ thinking I could enter straight after I hit 60.
---
Alliance.
---
&gt;If you don't like buffing, roll a priest basically, because paladins have to buff... a lot.
---
Completely the opposite. If you dont like buffing, DONT roll a priest. Priest party buffs (fort, spirit, shadow) take a TON of mana. You can spend 2 minutes getting full buffs (with drinking). Paladin buffs are A) stupidly low mana and addons make it simple to handle.
---
Played a vanilla priest main and currently doing naxx in private server on a paladin. Regarding buffing, ill take paladin ANY day.
---
I raided with the guy for 6 years. I promise you, however dumb you believe him to be... he is dumber than that.
---
Have anyone seen this kind of form with any previous Blizzard titles? All the closed beta invites I have seen have been waay more prettier and complex in design(nice game related logos and so on).
---
LFG
---
Region: NA, but wherever is fine
---
Realm type: PvP, preferably 
---
Faction: Horde, but I’m not opposed to rolling night elf. I’d like to play a priest or another healer role.
---
I’m honestly looking for a very socially active guild. I’d love to raid a couple times a week and do plenty of world pvp, but I’m not what you would describe as a hardcore player. I have a lot of obligations, so I won’t have the time or energy to dedicate to max leveling within the first week, but having a fun group of people would make it more desirable. 
---
I’m probably on the younger side. I started playing vanilla when I was only like 8 or 9, so I never really got an actual classic experience. Ideally, I’d be able to run with people my age, but as long as you don’t have a problem with me being younger, then we’re all good!:)
---
PM me on here if you think your guild is a good fit!
---
RIP 39 raid members.
---
I want both too!
---
this shouldn’t even need to be said. We are literally waiting for new- old- shit
---
It's not that I want it removed. It was never meant to be there in the first place. Do you actually think they put these things in on purpose? They were exploits. You are literally advocating for exploits to be put in the game. I rest my case.
---
who seriously thinks they'd release classic today?
---
Yes, massively.
---
Pull more than 2 mobs at your level and you will die.
---
Elites require 2+ players to kill (you can't do them solo unless you're a kiting class)
---
There are no indicators on maps or glow effects on quest items, you'll have to read the quest text to find out where to go and zoom in and search for items on the ground, under water, behind furniture, inside barns etc.
---
Itemisation is awful, you won't get green items till well into you teens, you might get a blue or two by level 25 if you're lucky.
---
You'll get a class quest that requires other players to complete (you can't solo it unless you're really, really well prepped).
---
I respect your decision! Thats what im rolling
---
Nice evidence, who?
---
lol, alright man good luck out there then I see you're crazy so bye
---
Nice counter argument. Very well worded.
---
I could mean that if this was an ordinary release.
---
They're releasing Classic (a 15 year old game) on a client infrastructure that they're currently using for their LIVE GAME. A GAME THEY'RE CURRENTLY RUNNING WITHOUT PROBLEMS. You can't compare that with a completely new game releasing on untested software.
---
Pally?
---
Yes it's viable and your heals will be strong enough to keep your partner alive until you run out of Mana or get CC'd. But it is far from an optimal Warrior partner.  
---
A much bigger problem is dealing with CC. Shamans can't dispel magic from friendly targets, this means a single sheep, frost nova or root will make the both of you sitting ducks when your or your warrior friend's trinket is on its 5 minute CD.   
---
A good solution is to run around with these things [https://classicdb.ch/?item=5634](https://classicdb.ch/?item=5634) they will cost a noticeable amount but they make a big difference.
---
Fake news.
---
To be fair, dude, I have been agreeing the whole time that melee consumes are far more expensive. Moreover, *you're* the one who brought flasks into the conversation by saying casters "have" to flask therefore being a caster is expensive. I merely responded in kind by saying the kind of content *requiring* casters to flask is also the kind of content that is expensive for healers as well. You're the one who elevated the conversation beyond the level of casual raiding throwing flasks into the comparison list.
---
People didn't wait for years just to get robbed of the Launch day! That would be so messed up of them to do.
---
Sort by new on this sub, there have been a few with this idea and they give their reasoning for it.
---
Personally think it would be the biggest slap in the face to everyone waiting for a release date so we could prepare accordingly.
---
Don't care about a beta, I care about a date so I could get that week off work!
---
What is there to argue about? You stated unfounded opinions, there was no argument in there. 
---
"I think it should be this way, period" Isn't an argument. There was literally nothing for me to make a statement on or refute in there other than a "well that's just like your opinion, man".
---
Well said. Gank the streamers! Send them back to Fortnite where they belong!
---
I agree 100% with you.
---
&gt; (don't even mention tremor totem) 
---
You know what though, I will mention it. Nefarian's fear CD is 24-25? seconds and Berserker Rage is 30 seconds. Try squaring that each time a fear comes around on horde without tremor totem.

---
Release
---
&gt; Some groups made it a free roll to ALL party members. 
---
I never agreed with this method. Doing a DM jump run, the whole party doesn't roll on the RTV at the end, only the miners do. Shouldn't be any different for the skinners.
---

I don't see the problem? He signed the NDA January 16, 2019. (If this would even be remotely real)
---
Tomorrow there are exam draws. If I'm lucky I get drawn up to math which is on the 20th. If Blizzard only wants a short time high intensity beta to test infrastructure like they said early on, that would be sad.
---
He played vanilla..
---
It takes me at least 2 weeks to get time off.
---
How dare you do Loch Modan like that. How dare you.
---
&gt; Tips irritates me because he falls into a content creator category I like to call "the hypeman no one asked for"
---
The more interesting thing about Tips is that not only is he a hypeman no one asked for, he is a hypeman with no experience in the market he is hyping up.
---
He never did any significant content in 04-06 (by his own admission) and after being called out about claiming he has "leveled many Warriors on private servers" now refuses to say how many, on what servers, and any relevant content he's done.
---
He saw $$$ just the same as Towelliee but is even worse because he blatantly lies to his viewerbase and rides the coattails of better content creators.
---
I honestly don't know how Esfand stomachs such a fake person.
---
Wow, the image quality on your system sucks. What you playing on, a 1995 toaster?
---
Well for one, you could have pointed out how unintended mechanics sometimes had a positive effect by increasing the skill cap. I wouldn't even be able to disagree with that. There's plenty of ways you could've responded. Don't blame me for your lack of creativity :D
---
Sorry, I don't speak Hungarian (; Ha, just kidding... Best of luck out there. *For the Alliance!*
---
Faker than Nicki Minaj's ass
---
The way its stated is inconsistent with the previous date. 
---
May 14TH, 2019. vs. January 16, 2019.

The 16 is missing its th to make it 16th.

Here was my original TBC beta email - pictures do not show now..

---
Ignore him, the guy is trollbaiting.
---
All sounds a lot harder than actually eating semi healthy
---
If you by "everything" mean wizardcleave or double Shadowmourne, then sure.
---
S7 was where it was at.
---
&gt;There is no technical reason for a Beta Test.
---
... apart from it basically being a whole new game... 
---
If they just copy pasted a bunch of vanilla code, i would agree with you, but they basically built a \*NEW\* vanilla in a legion client.
---
There will be many bugs, inaccuracies and errors in the game. You could see that the demo was pretty full of inaccuracies like basically regenerating too much. (Energy and HP if i remember correctly.)
---
The networking structure will not be different (i guess), but finetuning won't hurt anyone. I bet my ass off that they will test the servers without and with sharding to see if it would be possible to get a "no sharding experience".
---
 
---
&gt;A Beta would defy the purpose of a Classic Release
---
That's rather a problem with todays gaming society though. Blizz is not to be kept responsible for what streamers and youtubers do with the beta. (tbh though... doesn't seeing it being played make you even MORE excited?)
---
And I certainly do not think that many will get into beta. Even if it is open, many will wait for actual release, or (to quench their thirst) level to about 10ish.
---
Why would you want to be more than that though? It just looks ridiculous tbh
---
OH YEAH?
---
you are so cute
---
Sucks to be you guys, hehe xd.
---
They break roots upon blinking.
---
"For the alliance"
---
Yeah enough said.
---
I'm torn on everything man. I'm tempted to break my Horde only streak because I've never played on a PvP server, and Shadowmeld + Mind Control seems fun as hell, even if its just an alt
---
Honestly, I played on Nostalrius (most popular private server), and once Min Maxing comes into effect they are pretty subpar. You will be forced to heal in raids.
---
They are pretty strong in Open World PvP but once again if you want to grind to R14 I doubt you can do anything other than heal with one.
---
When I was 12 the class descrition sounded so awesome. If you dont plan to play top end content go play one they are tons of fun.
---
You sound like you really enjoy your career.  Or you just don’t know that everyone all over the world uses sick days for leisure from time to time.
---
Especially if you have to request time off a month or more in advance. It would be too cruel.
---
Those are all private server or original vanilla addons. None of them will work in Classic since it uses the 8.x client and addon API as a foundation.
---
You're not wrong. The gameplay, mechanically, is better than it's ever been. It's super smooth and clearly defined. You can't really take away anything that feels 'excessive'.
---
If it creates a good user experience, though, is very much up for debate. Doesn't create a fun or engaging MMO, that's for sure, when all the classes are basically the same with a different coat of paint.
---
And yes, I realize that MoP had differing class designs, I'm mostly talking Legion/BfA.
---
I think most people of the older generation(and some younger) don't care much for content creators and don't like that they have a huge following that blindly listen to them even when they're wrong. 
---
They heavily influence people's opinion on certain issues and when people disagree they get attacked by their loyal followers. Then they also get special treatment by players and companies alike.
---
It can get very toxic to disagree with a big infulencer and their minions. From what I've seen that's what frustrates a lot of people the most since these influencers are often wrong, yet companies take their opinion more seriously than common folk.
---
(Remember when this Towel dude didn't want legacy? And now he's hyping it up with some big announcement lol)
---
Go to work stick an enigma up ur butt and shit ur pants at work. Get sent home for at least a week.
---
I'm pretty sure it's a mild form/sign of autism, not kidding.
---
Please god don’t let this be true
---
Hi, /u/lazypeon-ru
---
I think you are right. Zero cholesterol.
---
Legion was the worst expac so far by a country mile.
---
Nah this isn't it. It's because they aren't good representations of the community.
---
1-2 druids in one raid means very small competition for items, making you gear up quite quickly if you are looking for class tier sets and druid related items
---
To add to this when I say 'wrong' I don't mean that they're factually wrong always. Sometimes people just disagree and think 'wow this opinion is stupid' but don't feel like they are in any way able to disagree or influence the influencers POV.
---
Fucking Alliance heathen. Lok’tar.
---
Rolling a priest because of fear ward? That's a new one. Fear ward is useless like 9 encounters out of 10. It's as random as rolling warlock because of banish.
---
Diablo Immortal?
---
My last guild we just had hunters sit high on threat at max range.  Out range the fear, nefarian runs towards the hunter, fear ends, and it goes back to the tank. Just make sure no one else is standing in the path. Wiping from poor tremors was tilting af.

Fuckin audacity of this jobless prick to tell us to take a sick day tomorrow for what, information that you can read in 5 minutes from a blue post?

Yah. Not crazy though. Some dried powdered cayenne pepper gives it a bit of spice.
---
I doubt you're the only one. We all expect the population to drop down sharply at first when some people figure out they didn't want it after all and the tourists have their fill. 
---
Alliance high-five.
---
Noggenfogger is honestly all tanaris needs to lock it in.
---
That's interesting, I was under the impression they were using a legion 7.x client or was that only for the demo. Either way I'd have to say you're probably right in terms of how the add-ons will work, they'll need to rework them to fit just a classic style server from current times, from what I've read blizzard will be working closely with the add-on community to get add-ons working and even using the correct ones so they don't interfere with classic wow style of play.
---
:O
---
!RemindMe 8 hours

You clearly only have one mother.

People waited years for a new Diablo game as well and look at what Blizz did with that. People waited years for housing in WoW as well and look at what Blizz did with that. At this point it wouldn't surprise me if they did something else to annoy their playerbase.

Some people like picking up heavy stuff. There is a culture behind powerlifting and bodybuilding that some enjoy, myself included. I just got a new inzer forever level belt and it's the best thing I've ever bought. I'm not as big looking as Baj but I'm at a pretty similar strength level.
---
Trusted source !
---
I imagine this is doubly so for horde players. I would think Alliance would have more Druids because more people like playing Night Elves compared to cows.
---
Can someone refresh my memory on if UBRS was still 15man in 1.12?
---
Oh right. Good eye :)
---
Ferals tank just fine in Raids.
---
its called an opinion, dont feel the need to justify it
---
three day admission for a DVT?
---
Being fat and inactive is also worse than being fit and using PEDs lol.
---
Release date. Doubtful any of us will get into the beta anyway, this is Blizzard we're talking about.
---
You can absolutely do it, its just very hard imo. If you're dedicated to doing Feral DPS you're better off rolling Alliance for the blessings.
---
Nothing to do with healing, read the first comment  of [Druid Life at 60](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95q09f/life_at_60_druid/) :
---
&gt;I  was a dedicated feral. I had a bunch of Feralheart gear, some MC epics,  a Breastplate of Bloodthirst, and a Warden Staff. I leveled enchanting  exclusively for a Smoking Heart of the Mountain. It was a long time ago,  and I was much younger, but I believe I knew my stuff pretty dang well.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Some  of my most poignant memories of Vanilla are being denied from groups**. I  wanted nothing more than a Mace of Unending Life. I got my Cenarion  Circle reputation up to exalted just from grinding mobs in Silithus and  just needed the raid drops to finish it. **I recall spending weekends  loitering in Ironforge looking for groups forming and sitting on that  rock outside AQ20 whispering people zoning in if they needed an off-tank  or secondary DPS. I never got that mace. I never even killed the final  boss. I'm still bitter about it.**  
---
&gt;Maybe I  was not as good as I thought I was. Maybe I was just bad at the "MMO"  aspect of a MMORPG back then and couldn't make the connections I needed  to get into good groups. But in part I blame my class, and I feel like  if I had been another class or enjoyed playing Resto then finding groups  (or finding *competent* groups) would have been so much easier.  
---
&gt;Make no mistake, druids are really fun. The speed and versatility is great. But if you have the misfortune of enjoying the *wrong*  spec then you're playing everything beyond UBRS on hard mode, and will  have to overcome the prejudice of players who'd rather have a warrior or  mage.

I have the next 2 days off so that’s a yes from me

Probably good advice, to be fair I have never raided a paladin, I just assumed 15 min buffs on all 8 classes would be more tedious than 4-6 one hour buffs on 2-4 groups.

This video would be better suited to [/r/wowservers](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers) as these addons will only work on private vanilla servers

Apex was leaked on 4chan but I think the idea of a titanfall battle royale game was so outlandish that it wasnt really taken seriously. Also, Apex launched several weeks before Anthem
---
&gt;If you set up succy for a rogue duel a rogue can just skull it off anyway and will still save trinket for fear.
---
This is some armchair expert PvP'ing right here. Skull is NOT the reason Succy isn't used that much. It wasn't used that much back in vanilla either, when Skull wasn't known yet. Skull didn't change it much, because news flash, not everyone has a skull equipped. The vast majority of players won't. This is some niche stuff that is mainly gonna be relevant against high skill PvP'ers. If Skull is the best argument against Succubus that you can think off then you should stop trying to think of beating high skill PvP'ers in the first place.
---
Succubus is bad because it's an awful choice if you're not Destruction just because you can't Seduce anything with a DoT. If you're SL it's even worse because she's prone to dying to SL, especially if any AoE comes your way as well. The general squishyness of the Succubus doesn't help much either, as many classes can opt to kill it if you're poor in managing it. Those fundamental reasons is why you'd only see some Destruction warlocks run Succubus even back in vanilla.
---
If you don't own any of the wow expansions, does the game itself come for free with the first monthly payment, or would you have to get the whole game first?
---
S7 was for sure worse. It had slightly fewer viable specs and tanks hadnt been tuned down enough yet.
---
You should check the Mount and blade bannerlords Subreddit. Been literally years with spamming threads about release date.
---
Getting dazed would be a huge misplay from the hunter. rogue ranged attacks are fairly telegraphed, so you'll be able to flick your cheetah off and on if necessary. but you're not gonna want to sit in cheetah vs a rogue anyway. you pop it when he is in CC or when he already blew all his shit so you can kite freely.
---
Old entrance still worked and still works to this day.
---
Release date, because I know I won't get invited to a beta.
---
The demo used a 7.x client yes but a lot has happened since then and now it's up to 8.x. Classic and retail will most likely update side by side so they won't have to maintain two separate clients.
---
The 1.12 API was extremely open and exploitable, the current version is much more secure since it has been worked on for 14 years and all exploits has been fixed in that time.
---
Either way, none of the old addons will work since the API has changed so much. A lot of BfA addons will probably work without alteration and some of them will need some tweaks.
---
considering warlock is unquestionably the strongest 1v1/duel class in the game, and top pvper in general, thank god they can't break stuns tbh. Another reason why orc warlock is so OP in vanilla pvp
---
You are worried about making a wrong choice. Don't be. If you are a good player it won't matter for a second.
---
I somehow think, we ll get release date
---
I’m curious, I’ve seen a lot of people on here disliking TipsOut, but I thought some of his videos are pretty interesting. Why the dislike? Am I missing something? Didn’t watch all his videos but still
---
Let's simplify then. Casual raiding, no flasking, progression through MC/BWL. In my experience a healer will spend less then a caster. I have seen this. That is my main point.
---
I SAY THEE NAY!
---
This makes the most sense to me.
---
To be the odd one out here, I have always enjoyed tanking as a Paladin. Sure, on paper you will not be in the absolute top tier, and in top tier raiding you will fall behind warriors, but still you might get an offtank position. I am considering going in this direction again, because paladins are just so damn great fun, have the best looking armor, and can do all roles pretty decently, if tanking ends up not being your cup of tea.
---
It is!
---
You need a lot of tools to help with mages, free action potions, engineering, trinkets and items like the skull. It's no guarantee but it at least it gives you a chance.
---
It was tough for sure. Nowhere to hide or run, mobs were sparse so they could always spot you from mile away and just beeline you.
---
IIRC there's a belt that removes roots/snares too.
---
Opposite for most of us, but I appreciate a different view point.
---
I loved playing holy pala in TBC exept dealing with the damn blessings in raids! Offspecs that wanted might instead of wisdom and so on. In vanilla blessings were even shorter so its even worse then i had it. But there are addons that help deal with it. Other then that paladins are great.
---
10 man in 1.12
---
Release date, so I know when to get my 2 weeks vacation off work.
---
Thanks for the reply. As far as i can remember i couldnt solo elites as well in wotlk but maybe i was just bad as a kid haha. Was quite difficult for me to level. 
---
Without questhelpers will be alot different then, never really played games like that. And luckily i dont care about itemisation till lvl 60, just wanna enjoy the leveling experience first :-)
---
Aside from the bots ruining any semblance of an economy.

* 1 Release date
---
* 2 Actual release
---
* 3 Beta
---
* 4 Silence
---
* 5 Streamer only beta

I feel this is a better option for alts. The character before the alt has the professions that can gear up said alt.
---
I think it's worthwhile to invest a little extra in something that you use every single day of your life, no matter what it is.
---
You can say whatever you want on the internet when the deal is not known.
---
hahahaha the STV one was perfect
---
westfall, dustwallow marsh, desolace are probably my least faves.  in fact most of the 10-20 areas are pretty annoying cos the mobs get hard but u still dont have many tools to deal with them... and then dustwallow is a swampy hole and desolace is blad
---
Joana had people mail him gold. You need to do something outside of straight leveling to have gold for a mount at 40.
---
He’s referring to a blue post wishing a good classic summer or something, not the summer release announcement.
---
He provides a lot of flawed or simply wrong/obsolete information; everything is ''**absolutely insane guys**''; he pretty much begged for money playing the sympathy card to gain more Patreon followers; most of his video titles are clickbaity hype crap like this one: "BETA LEAK!!! Classic WoW Beta files are on the CDN!!!"; dude didn't play retail Vanilla but jumped on the bandwagon headfirst. It's all very *meh*.
---
No matter how many times i've listened to this in the past, and it must be thousands at this point, it still gives me goosebumps every now and then.
---
Whenever I played everyone rolled unless it was specifically demanded before the run even started.  Things like that could easily cost you an invite.  I would usually form groups myself and move on to the next guy, skinner or not.  You could try forming a group and informing everyone that only you or maybe you/other skinners get a chance at it and see how people react to that(I'd tell you to solo it).  If it were a BOP(soulbound) then it would be no issue because you either craft with it or not.  But its not, and you can't solo it.  Yes, it takes a skinner and one item to do.  It also takes a group of people.  Its the same thing on BOE epic drops in pugs.  Everyone rolls even if you don't use it.  To top it off most skinning classes are going to be the easiest to replace in a group. Rogues, druids, maybe some hunters.  Although a lot of people may have skinning at the start until they get more money.
---
This is definitely one of the more unique/divisive situations in the game and I'm sure some people feel the total opposite, and I would not blame you one bit for trying to get them in your group so you have a better chance at it.  But what would you rather bring, someone claiming an item they cannot possibly earn without a bunch of other players, or someone offering the group a chance at a bonus item?  Its not the same as a vein or herb spawn.  Its WAY more expensive.  You would probably sell it if you got it.
---
He could be on roids, he could be natty - who knows. 
---
But the point is that he's nowhere near the extreme doses that the big boy bodybuilders are cycling.
---
def go paladin, absolute beasts at healing
---
Ya that worked well for me last week. Got the full week off. Its a shame I actually had explosive diarrhea but hey got the week off
---
Release date! 10h beta... Wow. And then wait for another 2 months to wait for the actual game... No thanks.
---
A closed beta with invites to streamers makes no sense from a testing perspective but all kinds of sense from a marketing perspective.
---
It's basically free advertising from volunteer shills directed at their target demographic; retail players who watch streams because there's nothing to do in retail.
---
The others don't have cooldown and there will just be new meta to handle head drop. Probably some kind of schedule so you can grab it and log off, and log in when you are gonna raid (you don't time on your buffs while logged out). People will most likely find a way.
---
Everyone should definitely exercise to some degree, and it will speed up weight loss simply because it burns calories.
---
But people should at least know that you don't need exercise to lose weight, nor do you need "healthy" food - you just have to eat less than what your body requires to maintain its current weight.
---
If you wanna poopsock 20 hours a day while eating only twinkies, you can do that and still lose weight.
---
Christ, that's prime douche.

Can my 13" MacBook Pro 2,3 GHz 8GB 2133MHz laptop run ClassicWow?

Nice hearing from you too.  Some good memories came back to me from reading this thread.  I'll hope you change your mind before release comes, but either way, good luck with whatever it is you're doing.

Nothing like getting rekt on a 60 Warrior by a 40 Hunter from 100 yards because his wolf crits for 700 on plate.
---
Maybe it's the launch without a beta... One man can dream right?
---
The guy is an entertainer and he's trying to sell a show. He isn't actually expecting people to take a sick day.

i turned a quest in at chillwind point and hit level 60 on my dwarf hunter. i think it was the scholomance quest.

What about 5 mans? I've heard a lot of groups won't take a druid purely because of the lack of normal res?

Staysafe is alright. It's the annoying streamer persona he's adopted to appeal to the lowest common denominator. That's the real kicker.

Esfand is really genuine. Used to talk to him ingame and he was always friendly

Haha fair enough, that’s true, everything is absolutely insane xD thanks for the answer, I will take his videos with a grain of salt :)
---
People play d3 ?
---
If he's on a low dose, it doesn't mean that he has surpassed his natty limit - it's just much easier to stay lean for stuff like Men's Physique with a bit of Tren and friends.
---
And?
---
&gt;and healers if you got someone to cover resurrecting
---
That's partly one of the things I'm worried about, am I going to be denied groups as resto purely over the rez?

Wait I just read this and am legitimately so confused...

1. Can you show me a single classic youtuber who has said "I am the spokesperson for the classic wow community" or something similar?

2. That's probably the most ridiculous thing I have ever read. I can only speak on my own behalf, but I have never sent a nasty email to C2C or disrespected him in any way. As far as I'm aware, there is no bad blood between me and him at all and I literally have no idea which compartment of your asshole you pulled this out from. 
---
3. ??? I started in Cataclysm??? LOL I started in Vanilla as I have said time and time again and showed on stream time and time again. I actually legitimately have no idea where youre getting this Cata thing from. 
---
4. Can you show me where the Classic hype train was 18 months ago? There really wasn't any; the truth is, we've been grinding. Again, I can only speak on  my own behalf, but my journey hasn't been easy. I've put out around 150 videos since I started. That's a lot of hours, sweat, and passion poured into something. The community has been amazing and the responses I get from you guys are what makes this worth it, but please don't mistake the grind for "riding a wave". That's a huge disservice to the work we put in to get here.
---
Feel free to criticize content, challenge assertions made in videos, and even offer feedback or suggestions, but everything you just wrote is none of that. At the end of the day, we love Classic and have dedicated our careers to being involved with it and the community. It was never easy, a lot of sacrifices had to me made, but we do it because we love it.

 INTJ- Alliance - Mage - DPS - PvE
---
Damn...
---
Can’t lie, kinda sounds delicious.
---
They're both highly desired in 5-mans, raids and battlegrounds so play what you want.
---
Greater Union cinema if I remember correctly
---
RTVs aren't a boss you have to kill. Same for the dark iron on BRD. But the skinner can't kill the boss by himself. If seen groups where the money for the hide would be split.
---
 !RemindMe 7 hours

Would never happen with Blizzards correct formulas.
---
Man I'm also so hyped. I don't know what it is but since a week or so I just can't stop thinking about classic, I know it sounds dumb but all of a sudden I just got this hype feeling like you have when a new expansion gets announced. I just hope we get a release date soon, streamers getting beta isn't really that special since there are enough people streaming private servers already..
---
&gt;Going to make a fucking killing with all the noobs coming in lol
---
Presuming they know about AH. When I started game I sold all my herbs to vendor and farmed my first 40 mount that way :D
---
Well unless you used exploit to do it, why would you be banned?
---
*equips \[XXL Diaper\]*
---
I have no problem if it's just a beta for some content creators and would watch quite a bit of it but please give us a release date.
---
i dunno man, i mean i hate streamers but i also acknowledge that they can bring more players in and that is good for the game, so even them getting to play is a good hype tactic
---
Better than STV imo, or at least how I remember it. Might have something to do with me going through there when hardly anyone was level 60 yet though.
---
A release date. Unless it's going to be August or beyond. Otherwise beta.
---
Tanaris has a huge, mysterious gates in a wall being guarded by huge earth giants, what swamp has?
---
I get what you're saying and it makes a lot of sense, but do they actually need to advertise to retail players? It's the same subscription and they gain nothing (financially, which I assume is mostly all they care about) by having retail players double dip.
---
That is exactly my situation, I hope I don't get math. I would rather get sidemål=)
---
To be fair, Blizzard have said multiple times that it is releasing in the Summer (it's now mid May).
---
So all people want is a more specific date so they can make arrangements to play the launch. If Blizz didn't think it would be ready for summer, then they wouldn't have said that it would be out in the summer.
---
I think expecting a release date at this point is fairly reasonable.
---
Only you can answer this question. Holy paladins have a much lower skill-ceiling and will become somewhat dull/repetitive for PVE content. Priests are the complete opposite and are much more engaging. At the end of the day, both will always be in high demand.
---
Who cares about a beta, we've already all played the game for years!
---
Now, only the latest expansion isn't free. A sub give you access to all expansion except BFA. I think it's a safe bet to say that only a sub will be required, with no other form of payment
---
Itemization is awful because you aren’t showered with epics from level 1? Bitch please
---
i add that shit to everything
---
Yeah.. it's only really admirable to the employer if someone doesn't take sick days.
---
Everyone just needs a day every now and then. Everyone's job isn't the same.
---
highly unlikely, I don't think blizzard has ever done anything like that before, or would think it's even a good idea to begin with. Wouldn't make any sense business wise unless they are really trying to slowly trickle people in without the launch day shit show.
---
I didn't say the time didn't include any downtime. Many classes when played correctly dont have any downtime.
---
I'd say view it as entertainment! We need to digest any form of Classic content anyway until the official release, right? :) As long as you'll enjoy it, don't let my grumpy ass opinion bother you.
---
&gt; If you'd like me to open a ticket to further investigate my viability as a vanilla player let me know and I can give you updates
---
We're waiting.
---
Why do streamers have such an ego?
---
I would really not recommend gaming on a laptop and especially if you are going to do it over wifi or even worse public wifi.  I made the mistake many years ago going that route and I deeply regret it.  Even though technology has come a lot further I've seen laptops with great specs have such heat issues that they are either bottlenecked or straight up turn off.
---
What is your budget either way?  The cheapest laptop I see on cyberpower PC is like 900 dollars.
---
They can also blink out of stuns.
---
Both. Little reason at this point we can't have both.
---
Aspects assemble!
---
Yah I ask if I'm a rogue that cheapshot. They blink. Then I want to net or if lucky gouge on blink.
---
install retail wow and see if you can run that (you dont need to buy it or sub until level 20). if you can run retail you'll be able to run classic most likely.
---
Just read in a comment in this topic:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bof0z0/once\_in\_2006\_i\_was\_so\_bored\_that\_i\_kited\_a\_elite](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bof0z0/once_in_2006_i_was_so_bored_that_i_kited_a_elite/)

that you can't kite Kazzak into Stormwind anymore.
---
Why is that?
---
I once used it on a potatoe hill to get the squirrels from digging. They get a face full of cayenne pepper instead
---
Both.
---
Yeah fuck that.
---
Alliance has something i was really envious which Horde is lacking - Stormwind Park.
---
Thanks, I hope this is the case, can anyone confirm?
---
I would love to play female troll... if she had boots. Also running animations are even more awful than others.
---
You post this shit comment on everything you dont like?
---
Invasive species. And that's why there are alien bugs digging underground. Nice job.
---
as others have said, paladin. but i'd like to add hunter too, they don't need to be constantly spammin buttons, ideally they let their autoshots happen and weave buttons in between.
---
Our PvPers have always been better. Just look at the arena stats for yourself
---
just /roll for that ph4 l00t. jk
---
loot council is good but sometimes it can be sketchy and/or authoritarain
---
dkp is good but sometimes people hoard too much dkp and its impossible to get new members geared
---
To be honest, i think the best system is that every player makes a list of items that they want, rank them, and if it drops give it to them. so life a soft reserve list

Please watch this video as it gives you an impression of our raid environment but also the long journey we've had together as a community. For Classic we're actively recruiting players that are willing to go for a Week 1 Molten Core clear. In short this means playing upwards of 18 hours a day the first week depending on your experience.
---
\_\_\*\*About RETURN:\*\*\_\_
---
\*\*RETURN\*\* was created back in 2013 on Feenix (The biggest private server at the time) and have gone through several different iterations as we've survived a multitude of different servers and projects. With a very effective raiding schedule we've completed all PvE content within two weeks of the release of the servers we've played on. Aswell as running two inhouse raid teams to maximize loot also completing all the current content. Now we have a strong core that needs tending and preparation for whats ahead. We're now out on the market looking for potential elite players ready to embark on the new epic journey that is ahead of us.
---
But first...
---
\`If you constantly need to go AFK during raids, do not apply.
---
If you do not want to min-max/theorycraft on your char, do not apply.
---
If you cannot dedicate an "extreme" amount of time on release and for ranking, do not apply.
---
If you cannot rank or keep up two active raid characters, do not apply.
---
..assuming we get new content; If you cannot atleast raid 4 days a week during progress, do not apply.\`
---
If you would like to compete for WORLD FIRST and SERVER FIRST records of Classic WoW, we're the guild for you. If this sounds interesting you can read more on our discord server.
---
Do not hesitate to get in touch with the Leadership if you have any questions or would be interested in joining our project; alternatively you can follow the application process advised on our Discord.

Meh, I'd rather go on a different server and ignore them - there's few things I want less than my Classic WoW experience being centered around someone I don't care about, just for the sake of ruining their experience. Not sure how that would make us any better than them.

That's not boredom, that's vanilla lyf

Why not?

---
Ah bugger. Was looking forward to chaotic 15 man dungeon haha. 10s still good though,  cheers
---
Good idea, but I looked up there financials.   Blizzard follows the calendar year for their fiscal year.  
---
But they could still drop the game in 2q and not expect a real financial gain until q3.  Especially since there is only subscription model with no retail purchase.
---
I never claimed that Swamp was a good zone
---
Dont forget the fact that this guy was against Classic.
---
You always steal people’s content?
---
Blasted lands... Meleeing my way with a resto shaman..
---
is it possible to join a zone chat while you are in a different zone?
---
This is an absolute mess design wise..
---
They won't be launching it, that would be an enormous marketing blunder.
---
Haha what a fucking track been pumping it in my car for the past month!!
---
Yet they still give him access... Such BS.
---
I think you're a bit too optimistic about the PVP healing priest with crap gear. I did it in Vanilla with the best STAM gear I could get my hands on (I think I had something like 4k HP but don't quote me on this) and I was still dying really fast without much options for mobility / survivability except fear.
---
Of course I was in PUGs so most of the time others were not protecting me.
---
When I was able to survive long enough (by hiding or being protected) my heals were really making a big difference but I would get OOM fast (crap gear, I sacrificed everything else for STAM).
---
Can't talk about other healing classes I didn't play them long enough to have an opinion.
---
\+1 for being honest about it
---
I’d recommend trying to organize a server and guild beforehand. There will be enough players but whether they are all on the same server is another question.
---
Yeah, that's true..
---
His passion lasts just above 10 minutes.
---
Dark Lady, watch over you.
---
My comment should be the top one, this guy is just bandwagoning for money. Yet there are streamers from the private server scene that fought for Classic to happen that are banned from Twitch. hey world, gg wp.
---
In this post you say 19:00-23:00 CET, but in the application form it says GMT+1. Those two are not the same, could you clarify which times you will be raiding? (CET is GMT+2)
---
That's what your vacation allowance is for, no? Or do you live in an area where such days do not exist? Quite a few European countries require a note from a doctor for you to even take sick leave.
---
All dates have the format "day month year" e.g "1 May 2019" except for the date for beta activiation, it has  the format  "Month Day, Year" i.e. "May 16, 2019".  
---
I call fake.
---
To bad
---
Found it online. Not intended to steal. It wasn’t on this forum.
---
who the hell is this guy and why's everyone mad? xD
---
Uh, yes. You have to kill Alzzin the Wildshaper (last boss in DM east) for the tunnel wall to collapse and expose the RTVs.
---
will it be open beta? or a closed one for streamer only without NDA?
---
I'm being admitted tomorrow, but not for something serious, I have sleep apnea so the hospital is gonna run some tests and then I'll be given a cpap machine and sent home after a couple days (been waiting to get checked out / get my diagnose for 7 months, since October). Still gonna suck to miss out D:
---
Exactly this. What's the point in being stoked for beta while exactly knowing what to expect and it being temporary. It would be a spoiler for the real thing I'm looking forward to - the same reason why I really don't see the point in playing on private servers, unless you're keen on powerleveling. So yeah, RELEASE DATE!
---
you're probably better grinding for the gold, and just buying one off the AH. There will be a lot in the first 6 months as so many players need to run UBRS several times for BiS pre raid, and also for the attunements for Ony.  If you can spend a day farming, you'd prob have sufficient gold to just buy one, rather than hoping for the drop.
---
IF release date is further away than July 16th, then i'd rather have a beta.
---
Pörhaps you are a little bit of Sviden yes?! ;D
---
I think it's going to be an info dump and a beta release date or a game release date (no beta.)
---
Wouldn't be surprised if there was another short cinematic trailer featuring that gnome girl that turned back time with the temporal discombobulator.
---
I’m right there with you, 4:40 am and I’m up refreshing r/classicwow, only dozed off for a couple of hours /sigh

Big content, a random fake pic online!!!1

Fair enough, either that or heart/other organ problems is what I guessed
---
thank you!
---
My boss is chasing my daily for taking out my holidays, but until i do not know the release date, i cant :D
---
Can't you just use "interact with target" to loot ?
---
Hey, thanks for the response. You reminded me that I should always check my sources and post them with any claim I make. Given my career choice (research), it was sloppy of me.
---
After your comment I figured it likely that I have just been over-hyped and heard far more commitment than was actually present. So I went back and watched the panel again (I know: any excuse =P).
---
Ion talks about the design flaws of the debuff limit and how it was a technical limitation, as you stated. But right after that he states, "[that said, we are restoring the 16 debuff limit](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2225)." I should have posted that link with my comment at the time.
---
If I have missed something that has been released since then, please let me know. Any information about development that is new to me is welcome!
---
Lol. I upvote you
---
i agree, but hold your horses, blizz has many many ways to rob people of the launch day. crashing servers, insane lag, 2-3 hours queue time to get  into realms, constant dc. those are issues that have been present in every launch till today.
---
There must always be a Lich Cing
---
I played tbc, but no classic, and tbh dunno how big are the changes between them. Which class of those i'll say are more similar, about every kind of aspect, for lvling, and doing stuff+rotation?
---
Warlock, Mage, h.pala, h.priest
---
Such a cool looking set. The Tabard especially!
---
That‘s the answer to this bullshit post I was looking for. Thank you
---
On top, everyone is chiming in on the ten minute video thing. I'm pretty sure most of your videos are like 19mins+ of just pure excitment and hype. 
---
You put in the hours do the research and everyone is mad on reddit. 
---
I don't know why you are coping all this flack but its alot of misguided hate for no reason at all. 
---
You did the grind i watched some of your first videos when there was no classic content really available. People will be playing this game because of the hype you and your homies created. 
---
Misinformation about people we only interact with on a video to video basis get spread like the plague.
---
Holy shit are classic players really that retarded ? Posting a picture and asking if it is legit is not stealing content. He isn't even claiming its his how could you possibly construe that as stealing content
---
That would be like McArthur landing at Inchon.
---
Is it happening?!?
---
Or be an adult and do the job that you're paid for over playing a video game 🤔
---
This makes my penis the big penis
---
Herbalism is a lot easier to up than mining (more plants than mines), I don't think you would have to stay in a zone you have out-levelled.

" The problem is that the game isn't just about gear it's about  buffs/consumes. So you could in theory make up for your lack of gear  with a shit load of consumes relative to your enemies...Assuming they  aren't using consumes at the same rate. But if they have better gear  than you and are also consuming..You're fukt...So hard to say how bad  you'll have it "
---
prepare the tinfoil hats!
---
I was always fascinated by these types of posts but how is this even possible? Mobs stop chase you after couple of seconds if they distance too much from their original position
---
I remember mages soloing Zul'Gurub trash with AOE, no competition, and dense mobs.
---
He was, but couldn't stream it so he just stopped streaming all together in order to play.
---
either is fine with me, got my long vacation booked for 15-26 july, I am going to get my 2 weeks of nolifing no matter what
---
it's comming!!
---
&gt;Also does anyone remember a rogue called Lillith?
---
All these names are bringing back so much I thought I'd forgotten! Not sure I ever spoke to the guy but the name feels very familiar.
---
Anyone remember the name of the Irish guy who used to be a GM? He got me kicked out of Postmortem because I left the party and betrayed him in Gurubashi Arena :(
---
void elf monk, new reskin race from BfA and a class from MoP.
---
Some cursed words in a Classic subreddit.
---
it's vanilla mate, does Blizzard really need to inforce NDA for a 14 year old game? :D
---
If you are Norwegian of Swedish, I'll be creating a guild for people like you/us :) 
---
Sounds interesting? I can post the details if you meet the nationality requirements.
---
Thats just stupid. You wont make even decent gold before level 32. Just dont buy skills you dont use and focus on grinding the last 2-3 levels before 40.
---
And you need L35+ to get 225+ in any profession.
---
Because he felt the hype and needs to stream that ofc to keep a fair amount of viewers to bring in those sweet cash money
---
This makes sense to me. All the streamers hyping a beta to a game that’s already been played seems like a bit much. Hyping the release date and streaming beta content would make sense though.
---
MrGMs latest tweet has me feeling that way. Tweeting about hating streamers more, if you already hate them, after today's info drop.
---
ArenaNet has a talk on how they stress test GW2. They basically buy up an enormous temporary chunk of AWS and run packet bots on them to simulate the load. Blizzard could do the same.
---
UD Mage in Azshara, farming Satyrs IIRC
---
the good old diarrhea.   Never fails! :D

Is it really a good show? I never watched it

 [https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html](https://eu.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html)  Nope

If the Alliance has chicken tenders, then there is no choice.

Disappointed in it not being release date :( but it’s progress

So what are you gonna tell on him to your mom?

Time to stock up on Bawls, hot pockets and ramen.
---
Probably just a closed beta for the streamers and no release date yet.
---
Have you actually read the post?
---
My thoughts, precisely!
---
He’s been lifting for at least 7 years and has a typical physique of someone that’s been consistently lifting that long. He’s significantly smaller than pro men’s physique competitors because they’re all juicing.  You can literally see his physique slowly change as you scroll through his videos from 8 years ago.
---
Idk why you feel the need to remind people that maybe he’s juicing. Sure, maybe he has absolute shit tier genetics and takes roids to make up for it but his physique is obtainable naturally by almost any men that are dedicated enough for Pete sake.
---
&gt; The main demographic is 22-30+ year old males, likely with full time jobs that they are available to take vacation days for. Blizzard would want to give their major demographic a reasonable heads-up so they can adjust real life situations based on this information. Which leads us into:
---
Why does everyone act as if Classic launch is a life changing event in the lives of the players?
---
Ty for the back up
---
For me, I have the dillema of math being one of my stronger topics. This leads me to a situation where, on one hand, math I'm definitely getting top grade, on the other hand, it might be too close to the beta. I'd have to choose grades over beta. But then again, it's just a beta, it'd be worse if they released the game itself.
---
Haha ty
---
That's level 60 I'm talking about levelling aoe any instances gated content is more like vanilla then any non gated content on private servers in my mind
---
A Beta isn't going to take long. It will be a 6 Weeks Beta at most. They don't need to test the Content, they just need to stresstest some specific stuff to see if they missed anything.
---
You're correct about the game launching later than Apex. I misspoke, as the beta and PC early access melded closely. I meant the lukewarm reaction from the last open demos, and the emphasis on being called a 'demo' instead of 'beta'. Not the hard launch. The Anthem backlash was happening far before the Feb. 15th soft launch.
---
 I am so hyped right now, like a kid weeks before Christmas, already talked to my boss for a 3 weeks vacation  !
---
imagine the shit show if they would do such a thing
---
I need a release date. I am 28 now, not 15 anymore like back in the days, I have other obligations, I need to know how I should plan to book holidays during the summer.
---
I sold two accounts for over $500 each. Turns out I got like 6 cents an hour to play WoW as a teenager.
---
Fear ward is not used for only 1 boss per raid.
---
it's the race I like the most, aesthetics, combat animation ranged and melee, I like to see any kind of gear cloth leather plate on them, I love the mounts, the racials WOTF, eating humanoids and underwater breathing.
---
You don't? that's fine bro
---
Wow, the game has come a long way since i quit! Monks I know from the lore but void elfs are new! thats cool tho, seeing the lore expand
---
&gt;  I don't know what you call someone who advertises something, for free, in exchange for attention.
---
Fans.
---
fury tanking ,great dps , great aggro
---
Depends what you want. Want to spam flash of light and nothing else then go Paladin. Want a more interesting rotation then go Priest.
---
You can play WoW on a potato. Even Retail runs fine on old computers if you remove shadows, ground clutter and maybe distance to half.
---
I don't know how much distance Classic will have, but playing it on lowest will look like the original game and will run fine. You can get a laptop for like $1000 and it will be more than enough. It doesn't even need to be a gaming one.
---
that's fair! I dislike Velfs as we got them instead of High Elves.
---
In earlier versions of vanilla that wasn't the case. They would only stop chasing you if you were a certain distance from them, not the original position.
---
So hunters would stay in the sweet spot and kite them
---
If you keep hitting them every few seconds they don't. But I think at some point they made it so mobs do not cross zones
---
Release date but by all reports it’s something regarding mobile
---
If you take them responsibly, yeah. I’ve heard of a lot of pro bodybuilders dropping dead in their 30s-40s and yet tons of land whales lives into their 60’s 🤷‍♀️. I am incredibly biased though as someone that wants to look like a monster but is too scared to risk their health lol.
---
They aren’t competing if it’s the same subscription
---
It's actually going to be the WC3 Reforged release date, sorry.

Time travel is a complex plot and needs great writing and a lot of time to think through all the possibilities which are close to infinite. Lazy writing or simple plot makes it look dumb and usually leaves holes in the story. Look at WoD.
---
WoW is not a game for time travel. The plot needs to be simple for the huge audience it has.
---
How dumb do you think people are? This is the easiest shit to fake, a toddler can do this.
---
this was just posted dude it’s fake
---
The US site (default redirect for most people even in EU) has the comma format. Try switching language to English (US). However I still think it is fake.
---
1st was the hunter in Western Plaguelands, farming zombies north-east from Andorhal. I had to beg a random hunter  to give me 1000 arrows because I was so set to finally ding I didn't want to leave.
---
2nd was the warrior in Burning Steppes, farming the orc camp just below the mountain entrance because it was a really underrated farming spot for gold so there was basically no competition, had the place all for myself.
---
3rd was the druid, my goal was to hit lvl58 before TBC launch, I managed to hit it 2 hours before midnight, getting lost in BRD.
---
How about both?
---
Ever tried an MMO mouse? Or just binding sinister strike to the side button on your mouse, or maybe even the scroll?  
---
I tend to spam the button a lot more than necessary, but I've learned to pool the energy and just press the button once. But yeah, try different keybinds and realize you don't have to press the button 3 times per second maybe.  
---
Hunter is a good option with few clicks. Mark &gt; Serpent sting &gt; autoattack until dead &gt; heal pet if necessary &gt; next mob
---
Druid
---
Exactly.  Its different if on a private server you go for the racial, but you will leave that server in months.
---
Retail is different, you will be looking at your character for thousand of hours, so you better pick the one you like the most.
---
Yeah but a beta will bring a tonne of information with it
---
Ah right, I got caught up in the gold part of the question, and forgot it was for level 40 mount.
---
Mage and Warlock are similar. Warlock has much less of a rotation though pretty much shadowbolt spam as debuff slots on mobs are limited so for raids they don't get to DoT. Priest and Pally are more about balancing mana and using lesser ranks to last a whole fight while being effective.
---
Why not both? :D
---
Anything that has to do with altered timelines I am against. I hated the story of WOD because if this. It's the same criticism with End Game recently.
---
True true but we all know that beforehand! We're all expecting it, at least give us a date so we can choose to be there or not!
---
What all of you aspiring GoT writers out there need to understand is that the bringing back of Classic isn't a 'new' franchise for Blizzard; it's just an easy cash grab and pleasing the playerbase while doing that.
---
If they are to make any ***new*** content it will happen at the end of the branch with BfA etc.
---
(All of this is seperate for a possible future demand for additional expansions. I'm only addressing new content)
---
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH is it time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!????????????
---
WoW Classic Mobile App!
---
Pirate what? The activation watermark?...That means the exact opposite. You don't need to buy windows just to install it. Microsoft themselves have a download location you can get the ISO from, load it onto a USB, and install windows from it. If he "pirated" his copy, the average person would never know unless they've done it themselves.
---
Could be both!
---

I know it’s fake, but hype is hitting red levels.

Rank 10 gear is pretty decent for a mage. What you essentially need as a mage is stats. You're not looking for the highest crits but the highest survivability and durability. Tier 2 is commonly used for pvp because of the 8/8 bonus that literally wins you 1v1 duels many times. Ranking to 10 is definitely achievable solo without even premading (premades will get you higher honor/hour tho if you have limited time. And 10 isn't super hard at all, should be doable with a job on the side without issues if you're somewhat efficient.  
---
That and some offpieces from 20mans/mc/bwl and you're pretty damn set.
---
Let’s get classic first and then we can talk about it’s future.
---
This so much.. I get little triggered every time I see post asking what happens after naxx? Like 98% of the playerbase is even capable of clearing naxx

Fresh 60s druid tanks deal significantly more dmg than fresh 60 warriors.

Almost there! Summer 2019!
---
Lol can we all please just wait for actual confirmation from blizzard before we start shitting ourselves. Also, if people were already getting invited we’d have a dozen threads popping up from people that got invited.
---
you can always run some pugs
---
how about shaman tanks? Shield Specialization?
---
Or Rogue full Dodge/Evade?
---
Great Damage as well!
---
First off: Assume dungeon blue gear.
---
Druid can theoretically put out higher numbers if you use an item called manual crowd pummeler. The issue is, these items are valuable and come at only three stacks so few, if anyone, would use it for dungeon content. For Raids, sure.
---
Deep Protection Warrior with defensive gear and defensive focused Bear have roughly same dps.
---
More offensive geared and/or talented Warrior (Impale Prot with high crit or Fury Prot) has a higher dps than the bear that is not useing manual crowd pummeled.
---
Wtf, can i get some? sounds delish
---
No, you can only join zone chats when you are in that zone.
---
&gt; dude didn't play retail Vanilla but jumped on the bandwagon headfirst
---
sick gatekeeping bro
---
if anything this is just more of a reason to be excited. as someone who already played most of it i'm not that ecstatic, in fact i am super jealous of all the players that are about to experience it for the first time. 
---
plus if you played tbc that's close enough to know about most things that are good about vanilla without even researching anything
---
I'm starting to be less hyped because if that's what this last week has been then that's bullshit.
---
Yeah, the whole point of this is that it's available "on demand" anytime.
---
The main difference between DM, which is not available on launch, is the learning curve. 
---
DM is more of a "brainless" farm, which is why it's more convinient to do. 
---
1) You can start right off the bat when you enter the instance, both with DMN and DME. 
---
2) You don't have to go anywhere in order to vendor stuff, there is one in library, which can be accessed within a minute and a half as soon as you enter DMN. 
---
3) Mobs being non-elite is a BIG part too. Lashers got like ~1,8k hp, whereas those dwarves have ~7k. If you're unexpirienced, you'll die A LOT in the course of mastering it.
---
But beyond that, numbers are roughly the same, 10-12g per 10 minute run. That's not counting the highrolls (which you'll eventually get your hands on if you spent enough time there) such as high-value recipes, dark iron ore, BoE blues/epics and so on. 
---
Once again, we don't know for sure what's up with numbers on a private server, but I don't think it will be THAT big of a difference.
---
Female troll.
---
Source, or else troll and in that case piss off mate
---
Winterspring for me, up north by the lodge :)
---
Its excellent still :D
---
Take anything with a 1070,1080,2060,2070,2080 graphics card and atleast 6 cores that will do pretty much anything
---
Are you genuinely stupid or do you just lack reading comprehension?
---
read rumors that's it's open beta 1-30 level cap, but no release date.
---
All of that doesn’t rule them out as being considered the worst.

 *De gustibus non est disputandum*
---
Fuck it's prob gonna be media only
---
Ret paladin doing 650 dps is like fury warrior doing 1500 dps.
---
Can't come up with anything so let me counter point for some proof!
---
2 mistakes: 1st.the lotr pic. needs to go to the right.. 2nd. you don't pick alliance.
---
This is as fake as my personality. (Extremely fake)
---
I presume itll be streamer only, which im fine about since i'd rather play live then test anything atleast i can see how far along its come in the past 2 years
---
All the content from back then was a project of passion and love for the game. Everything now is just so corrupted by money and fame, everyone wants to be the next Asmongold. Everyone you can name accepts donations and makes bottom of the barrel content on anything and everything they can in 10:01 videos for double ad revenue. It just feels... scummy.
---
Is Bawls still a thing? Haven't seen that in stores for ages
---
In Australia if you are to take sick leave for more than 1 day (I believe) that's when you need a sick note. However, doctors give them out like it's free candy and you can buy them from a pharmacist for $30 lol
---
Im certainly not playing the beta. Dont wanna ruin that fresh start and invest hundreds of hours in a character thatll be deleted anyways. Since beta progress wont carry over to public release.
---
Classic will die in a few months anyway.
---
Drank so many Bawls during all nighters at my now defunct LAN cafe. Would wake up with my character auto-running into a wall or tree or something.
---
Classic beta 16th May confirmed?
---
I like questing in Desolace, but it might be because it's always less crowded there. It's a nice break from being ganked and compete over mobs in Stranglethorn Vale.
---
Primarily because of DP, but also because Touch of Weakness procs Blackout. Blackout procs *all* of the time as UD SP, it's insane.
---
I was dueling as Dwarf and UD vs an UD CB/hemo/prep Rogue and as Dwarf I was consistently losing about 3 in 5 duels so basically 60/40 in the UD Rogue's favor.  
---
That's not really so bad considering UD Rogue is one of your harder counters but as UD SP vs the same Rogue I managed to win about 4 out of every 6 duels. So there's definitely a dramatic swing in win rate. The amount of pressure you can apply as UD is so much higher thanks to the extra damage and blackout procs.
---
If I was going to main Shadow it'd be a toss-up between UD and Dwarf, but I've also happened to experience what it's like to try to play Shadow in premades and it's frankly awful so I just won't play Shadow while ranking.
---
My speculation now is that Blizzard is going to let Classic content creators be the ones to reveal alot of things today. 100% beta, and possibly a release date aswell. They probably got to play in Irvine and provided feedback and collected a bunch of information ready to be dropped.
---
100 million % release date, not a fan of beta’s i just want to sit and play the real thing 10 hours a day and get swamp ass and eat cheetos and drink mountain dew 24/7.
---
52. What?
---
Hello everybody! :) 
---
EU, Horde, PvP/Normal... I am interested in hardcore/semi-harcore raiding! I wanna play rogue which is the class I know how to play to the fullest. My timezone is  CEST. Outside of WoW I am in education. Very sociable person. Contact me if interested.
---
absolutezero010
---
He could also mean something like, you're gonna hate them even more after they've teased the beta to infinity and the big announcement today is really about something completely different. Like how they're starting a guild together or w/e.
---
Call it gatekeeping, sure. You think someone who never played a game should be viewed as a valued source of information on said game, even though all they did was play a bit on private servers with skewed values and make clickbaity videos about spreadsheets and guides made by other people? And then get's to be one of the ''mainstream faces'' of that game? Nah, bro.
---
Does this mean I have to listen to metal if i play horde?
---
So I’m going to guess it to be announced around 5pm for me (UK) or near that time. If it were to be announced that is.
---
Came looking for this comment. Was not disappointed.
---
Oh no, those streamers will be able to play limited Classic content for a limited amount of time.
---
If only there was some way to play the full game right now with no time limitations...
---
&gt; You’re REALLY not going to like them after today 
---
What does he mean with that ?  
---
So if there will be News tomorrow, we dislike them even further ?  
---
Sounds like a entitled man child to me.....
---
Itemisation is awful because Blizz didn't understand their own game fully and their vision for various classes was completely at odds with some of the game's core requirements. The notion, for example, that a Ret Pally or Feral druid had either the mana to spare for healing, or the +healing for their 2 heals (before OOM) to make any difference in an instance, when they were specced out for dps, was one Blizz subscribed to throughout classic, despite literally every data point showing them it was crap. The spirit on, well, everything, was also stupid as it ate into stat allocation for classes that had no use for it except out of combat regen. And the relic/ranged slot debacle took years to finally settle (Warriors, Rogues, Priests, Mages etc. could at least use a stat stick, so fully geared had more stat point allocation than was ever available to Shamans, Druids or Pallys).
---
Or were you under the mistaken impression that the three points I listed were in fact one and the same? Maybe work on your reading comprehension.
---
Oh, I do. I hate them all.
---
^This
---
But I think they only bound world bosses to their zone after someone pulled Kazzak to stormwind.
---
I doubt it being an open beta considering blizz always starts with a closed beta. Not saying it cant happen though, Classic is a very unique project and they may handle things differently
---
If you can find a used MacBook Pro with a dedicated gpu they run it good and it would be fairly cheap. My 2015 i7 M370x runs Wow like a champ. Though you could definitely throw together a new purpose built laptop for cheaper and it would work even better.
---
i hate em
---
Release date, over Beta,  
---
But if there is a beta, it means Release date , will be within 3 months.  
---
I can kinda live with that
---
Oh this thing that we all did 500 times - back to mordhau
---
Did they patch it in 1.12? It was still happening just before the 1.12 patch was released om 8/22/2006 according to this [blue post](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-customer-service/103879.htm) from earlier that same month, but I don't actually see any specific patch information regarding if that was the patch that fixed it.
---
This whole thing has been handled so fucking bad.
---
Disc is actually really good in PVP especially if you're on Horde, you're quite durable and with Power Infusion you can either boost a friendly caster's damage (this ability is really good alongside an ele/resto shaman) or you can just Infuse yourself and dish out some good burst. Not to mention fear / mind control are both amazing in PVP.
---
Don't forget paying $90-180 for the privilege. You are wearing some really thick rose colored classes if you think casuals will play classic.
---
Are you eu?
---
Predicting this thread is going to get filled with pure unfiltered COPE.
---
True. Got a few more screens of stuff you only would see back then. I will share more of them at some point.
---
Are there even people on this sub, that likes Asmondgold ?  
---
Sometimes YT recommends me a video off him, but after watching 1 minute, i'm kinda done with this man child.
---
Thats definitely a cause for concern for late game dungeons since some of them are enormous and shortcuts may not be available so running in is not an option. Easiest would be just getting another healer with ress and either of you would do dps. Its not like any of the dungeons are dps race. Problem is competing for gear but alternative sucks even more.
---
Pretty much this. I'm running a Guild where people can play what they want. Almost everyone who's joined as something that would be considered "meme spec" have joined with a realistic expectation that they may be healing from time to time, particularly for progression content.
---
Honestly though, until AQ there's little reason to worry about optimal specs unless you're chasing server firsts.
---
Exactly, or even the more realistic but still unlikely option, them making BC--&gt;WOTLK  or something
---
&gt; If today we find out classic won't release until September, I'd be okay with that.   
---
Blasphemy
---
Given a public beta hasn't even started yet, I'd imagine it will release last week of Summer, or possibly even get pushed back. I can't see it being much earlier than that given the sheer scale of the content that needs testing. This isn't a new zone or even a new island. It is two whole continents, 60 levels worth of gameplay, and all the dungeons, raids, and original race/class balancing a lot of which is being recreated from limited records. It'll likely be a long beta.
---
This. OP's point falls flat because we already have a 3 month window, and so we want the date because we're EXTREMELY close to the release window now. And it being a time-sensitive game, being able to make RL arrangements is not unreasonable at all.
---
Depends where you're located but yes they're still around.
---
vanish breaks roots as well :7
---
I think when Tera went F2P there was something like a 1week beta that kept the progess after it ended. But yeah, usually it's a terrible idea.
---
i think it means that it will be closed beta for streamers etc only so normal person wouldnt be able to get in
---
I'm starting to think it's just going to be the end of the NDA. The streamers will only be uploading videos they recorded while in Irvine.
---
If it's streamer/media only I'm ok with it, don't want to kill my hype by "burning out".  
---
If it's not i think i will try Paladin. I'm 100% Horde, hope that won't burn anything :D
---
Staysafe is not what I would consider good WoW classic content, the guy just watches other peoples content and pauses every 20 seconds to give his 2 cents. Most of the time is useless.
---
Seems passionate about classic, I don't believe he's a bad dude but got to ask how much of that is just cashing into the whole thing at this point.
---
Having an army of idiots be in your guild to help farm scarab lord is kinda funny though.
---
They are going to announce that WoW Classic will come out to Android and iPhone exclusively, and there will be no PC port happening....they also will rename it WoW Immortal. . . this is something I shouldn't even joke about.
---
STV tho!
---
pservers are just scuffed classic, tho.
---
Are you able to use any other tool as a stand in for the mouse? A friend of mine has really shaky hands, among other things, and she uses a joystick she got from the hospital. Ive played around with it and it works surprisingly good. Is it an option you have considered?
---
we’re getting 1.12 items, that was when the spirit was already removed and many items’ stats were redistributed properly. 
---
And hybrids are, well, hybrids, they were never supposed to be on par or better than specialized classes in vanilla.
---
You are completely wrong. In Retail Expansions they start of with Closed Alphas. 
---
But this is not like a WoW Expansion, there is no new Content to test. This is just about letting the Community Stress-Test the Game to see if they missed anything during Development.
---
Same here. I don't have the same problems as most working people have regarding taking time off at release, as my post-graduate studies won't commence until mid-september (although I fervently hope that it will release prior to that...).
---
But I have some personal projects going on that I want to have completed before it's release. The announcement of a release date would provide me with a set schedule on when I want those projects to be done.
---
I seem to work much more efficiently and goal-oriented when I have a carrot on a stick dangling in front of me.
---
Because theyre usually the most fleshed out ones.
---
Ive managed to get a controller work with wow using Keypadder back in the day. It should still work.
---
Western Plaguelands. Kiting the skeles from Andorhal over the bridge near Chillwind point. Don't ask why. lol
---
Limited records? You mean a full playable 1.12 for reference? And what balancing are you talking about?
---
Blizz very recently reiterated a Summer release.
---
Where do you see they will announce something? I can't seem to find anything about it
---
Classic Pepega
---
Launch is tomorrow guys its confirmed by me
---
Let the hype flow through your body
---
Oh really? Did you do it by playing 3 hours a week? I don't think so. I think you played a lot and just called yourself casual because you sucked, not because you didn't play much.
---
Imagine doing that now, just for your demon to get sharded even before he leaves the zone
---
BC had the best gameplay. Have those talents, skills, spells, balance etc but lvl 60 (with outland as lvl 40-60 content, scaled to lvl 60 raids Tier 4 = Tier 1 etc) without flying mount and we'll have the best game in the world.
---
In before pre-recorded footage of a bunch of guys doing a dungeon where half the party (or raid) members didn't even play the game during Vanilla.
---
Yes, to *some* people. But here we act like we need to sort out the divorce and find a suitable orphanage for the children. 
---
They won't do a sudden release because people need to plan their vacation? Do you really think that is the main concern?
---
There may not be an open beta, there may just be a very brief 'beta' to stress test the servers then move on towards release.
---
All of these PrivateServer YouTubers really suck ass.
---
Release.
---
I am npt wrong, you just seem to ignore every bit of context. The point is the beta always starts being closed and only at the end turns into basically an open beta. Yes, alpha happens before beta, duh
---
My biggest gripe with most of these content creators is that they are terribly wrong and more often than not they misinform their wiever base because all they care about is rushing to be the first to put that video out there for the maximum amount of views and they cba to check facts or simply converse with knowledgeable people to make sure their content is actually informative and not a load of crap.
---
Most of the leveling guides, BiS lists and what have you are all over the place, filled with wrong informations, bad suggestions and clearly show a lack of experience that is apparent to veteran players but not to the players these videos are targeted at and which end up being misled.
---
That 5 attack power set bonus is sick!
---
So the first person that gets a drop has to wait until 28 people get a drop to go again? Seems a bit extreme and would kind of kill the excitement for me.  What if you have a larger pool of raiders based on different days?  Instead of 40 lets say 60 players.  Are you going to keep track of everyone in each raid at all times on each day?  Are you going to list out the top people before every roll? Before anyone gets a single piece of gear, they are all technically in the top %.  It would take a while to even begin to start your sequence.  What happens if certain gear drops only usable/wanted by people out of the 12%?
---
I would aim for something more simple.  Main tank and whatever other things you decide are priority to them for pure progression reasons.  Anyone showing up will not be coming if they didn't put effort in to their gear, potions, repair money, enchants, whatever to try to limit the "who deserves it" part.  I'm also not a fan of limiting peoples chance of getting an item just because its not as big of an upgrade for someone.  There are plenty of times someone busted their ass to max what they can get and master their class to lose it to a guy with a green or not even good blue.  
---
I would propose a unique(as in each raid this resets and is NOT tracked after this raid is done) system where if its called upon by the raid leader/council for your class/spec to roll on it, you roll 1-100.  If you win you get the item.   Afterwords, the winner loses a certain amount to their max roll which could be kept track of pretty easily.  Could be 10, 15, 20, 25.  Whatever you want.   So if something drops on the next boss that they want to roll on they can only roll 1-90, or 1-75, or whatever it would be, giving them a penalty but still the chance to look forward to some possibility of winning.  I think -25 would work best capping at -50.  You get one drop you can only roll 1-75 the rest of the run.  Another win then 1-50.  You could still "technically" win, and people who haven't gotten a drop have a huge advantage.  It could also add some strategy on whether or not to roll on minor upgrades or wait for the chance at a bigger one.  If a bunch of one type of gear drops (healer, whatever) then worse case scenario all the healers will end up rolling 1-50 against each other by the end of it.
---
Granted, this is more of a strategy for vanilla wow/molten core and all its madness(40 people is a shitload) and not exactly appropriate for a very serious raiding/progression guild as that will probably be loot council or dkp.
---
Kind of like a beta is just a scuffed version of a full game.
---
I'm not, other than go formation release is a step closer. I would try beta to test my old crappy laptop and see if it can handle it ok.
---
Sooner we get that shit outta the way the sooner we get release.
---
Also for me my friends aren’t down to play private servers, so I have to wait for beta/release if I want to play with them
---
After someone pulled Kazzak to stormwind for the 20th time. And the 2000th time someone pulled a Minion Of Raze'Likh to SW. Since they are invincible it would spawn more and more guards and more and bring more and more players to try and fight it until the server crashed or SW became unplayable
---
No, did you happen to ignore the other points that I made, or did you focus on just the few sentences of the first point? 
---
If **everyone**, as you claim, is acting as though this is a life changing event, perhaps it is? Maybe the definition of life changing isn't sell the kids, divorce the wife, but instead simply means take a week off work, or tell a friend that you're going to be busy when they want to go and watch John Wick 3. 
---
If you don't fall under the category of **everyone** , then don't worry about it, you don't have to adjust any immediate plans that might provide you less fun than you'd feel like you'd gain from playing Classic WoW with some old friends.
---
I never got to play classic. So I’m pretty hyped about it, with all the good things players say about it, plus I’m not happy with how to retail version is
---
I'm actually having a gap year till september, just wished classic got releases already..
---
"the 2019 summer release was a typo, we ment 2020 :) closed beta starts end of summer"
---
Why would playing in vanilla be a factor?
---
Hi zeks.  This is goosnargh.  I want a naughts and crosses rematch.  Any chance we'll both find ourselves afk guarding an AB flag once classic comes?
---
Can you level a warlock just using your wand + voidwalker? 
---
I'm either rolling hunter or Lock, and one aspect of hunter that is appealing is the ability to grind mobs using autoshot while I'm "Working from home". 
---
I know going BM this is fine since your pet is doing most of your dps, but can you do something similar with imp. Voidwalker and a good wand?
---
I think it’s not because of the beta. A beta is the next step to release. That’s what makes the hype. And maybe because everyone is waiting for it and would be happy with everything.
---
Beta is a step closer to release. Getting beta makes release riiiiiight around the corner. Playing beta is eh.
---
Why do we think they're going to announce anything?
---
The beta comes with the *possibility* of a concrete release date. It's also something to do in order to kill time instead of waiting in limbo on /r/classicwow
---
I do. If the streamer has a good personality I'll watch him. I don't care that much about what game they play.  
---
And they can't stream classic, so they are limited in their options what to stream.
---
Hilarious!
---
fuck all streamers and youtubers. e-celebs and wannabe e-celebs can go die in a fire.
---
fuck anyone who watches them too, you are part of the problem.
---
it's Classic WoW Mobile.
---
My advice would be to save the experience for Classic release. The more stuff you spoil, the less exciting it'll be. Just skip everything and read less about the game. It'll be more rewarding once you start experiencing everything for yourself.
---
My pitchforks are ready. I can't wait to shit on Blizzard and the YouTubers. If we shitstorm them to hell and back they might even learn something from it.
---
It doesn't so long they don't comment with "accuracy feedback" or opinions.
---
What?
---
I haven’t read anything tbh. Just want a release date lol. I was gonna join a private server when I quit retail but I don’t trust that shit
---
We know it's coming in Q3 already from Activisions business reports. Shitpost much.
---
Once I kited a level 40+ guard to westfall during bc or wotlk. Literally the only point was to wipe out sentinel hill because I was bored. I was an evil child.
---
Thank god I am glad to live in the EU.  
---
If I am sick I can't work properly. I could infect other coworkers.  
---
I might die in front of my desk depending on the sickness.
---
But thats against the rules of capitalism I guess
---
No one in Stormwind anymore is really depressing ...
---
Why do people think actively trying to antagonize a fan base is a good decision, instead of trying to see it from their perspective? 
---
I honestly don’t really care, all I care about is a release date, and I don’t feel either way about anything but a release date or something contingent on it. Just like the majority here. 
---
What I’m seeing now from “content creators” (lol) is basically a mixture of pure pwnage, mean girls and bad fashion decisions. Stop it with the red ties dudes, and stop it with the pretend clout. You are getting early access to a beta for a 15 year old game, you aren’t fucking supermodels, doing heaps of coke or driving sponsored super cars. Your lives aren’t that exciting and people aren’t jealous.
---
This should recieve more appreciation.
---
&gt;1.7 million subscribers 
---
Where's that number from?
---
Personally I would like them to do a stress test rather than a beta. Can the servers actually handle a 40v40 battle? Currently the retail servers are absolute dogshit and can't handle a 40v40 as shown in [these](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDekJvBwczU) videos here. Another example is [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TH1a0a-4OYY#t=42m50s) video where Asmongold tries to do world PvP with 40 players. Constant lagspikes for 5-10 seconds where people aren't moving which makes the game literally unplayable.
---
not really, they work very well most of the time
---
Because seeing beta footage will help me make up my mind on Classic. I was not happy with the demo at all. I hope beta will vanish my fears and Classic will be a solid recreation of the old game so many people want to play.
---
Because I will be playing with a group and I imagine we aren’t all going to sit around and read every quest text and explore pointless places for the hell of it and mess around like noobs without the stress of trying to get to 60 efficiently.  So I will do that on the beta and then take the official release seriously so I can get ahead and gang some noob alliance
---
Jesus this shits been taken to seriously. We're waiting for the release of a 14 year old game, lets calm down a bit. Youtubers will get access first and will likely have some shitty pre-recorded footage to show. Maybe a 10 man raid at best, we'll get a lot of fluff and then some announcement probably beta maybe a full release date.
---
We see this play out with so many games, its part of the process. Calm down, let the shit content release and then find the date posted at the top of this sub as soon as someone says it. Its not worth people getting so worked up about.
---
I chuckled. Check out the perspective tool though, it would make the meme more crisp.
---
You are getting a CPAP that will dramatically improve your sleep and quality of life and you are worried about missing at most, potentially** one day, of world of Warcraft?
---
Thx for your answers.
---
Sounds about right with some of the "leaks" and rumours going around.
---
Thx for your answers!
---
youre being sarcastic on the wrong forum boys

We want to help Blizz make it as good as possible. That means beta testing tiny little things that they might not have caught.
---
Wasn't Herod supposed to be a human?
---
People who played vanilla cannot give accurate feedback, that's already been shown. The game was out so long ago people have so many incorrect memories of how it played. The blizzcon demo helped prove that.
---
Go to a doctor...
---
Sure, but getting a pc that could run it is going to be more then that. My wife dropped 1300 on a laptop yesterday because she wanted one for photo editing, so relatively speaking 300$ is still cheaper than a console.
---
Having played the open beta and regular game 14 years ago I dont need a beta to know what a game is like.
---
Maybe if it was a brand new mmo and needed to know if it was worth buying. (Wish I couldve done that with Aion)
---
What were you not happy about in demo?
---
I hope they take a similar route that Old school runescape took. 
---
By ignoring everything that happened after classic and just make complete new stories and  content that stay more true to the classic wow mindset and gameplay.
---
This is like showing a drug addict other people consuming the drug in front of him and laughing.
---
I don't think there's that much of a specific meta to 5 mans. First of all if people are dying in 5 mans then they're already doing something wrong and having a normal res available isn't gonna fix the problem.
---
Never saw a hype like this for a „remastered“ game. But I’m hyped too 🤣
---
I'm literally sick today and the irony is I'm English so whatever this shit is wouldnt be til after the working day anyway
---
They farm so ridiculously well that hunters are probably the most played class. They could be completely waste of slot in raids and still be most played class. It's worth to level a hunter to make 125g-150g per hour when other classes can make 30-70g per hour. I guess not if you main the 70g/hour class but otherwise.
---
you jinxed it
---
As a Lich King baby, I agree.  I remember finally getting all of my skills, determining the wheat from the chaff, setting up my bars and hotkeys just right, and then... dead.
---
They reworked the class abilities and everything changed for the first time.  I lost half of my Judgments and Hands, along plenty of other fluff abilities that weren't strictly necessary for combat.  In addition, they reworked the talent tree which, in their defense, was pretty bloated after 70 allocated points.
---
It's very refreshing to see K&amp;P on r/classicwow
---
My recommendation is a laptop with an i5 or better and an independent graphics card. They have one for 650$ at best buy its just a little thick and heavy, but great for the price.
---
I AOE leveled on last large server with "the pack", so with 10k population and I was not ahead since I started a bit later and it was not a problem. I would still recommend having option to AOE. 
---
You are not much stronger in PVP spec then with AOE spec, but not having an option to AOE can be bad. This was first time I played with fixed quest XP  bug and for me, there was a serious drought of quest s in late 40s, which was fixed by AOE leveling bugs in Tanaris (great XP, decent gold and not crowded).
---
It is just nice to have option. Some quests can be AOE finished. Even with 10k population there were spots to be found (you mostly can not AOE quest mobs). With classic probably having 4x less population it should be even easier to find spots to farm.
---
See, you're just lying, just what I thought
---
You also picked the two most grindy classes out of all of them.
---
They start with different topics, but, true, it always ends with sheep.
---
That wasn't the point at all, it's pretty reasonable to believe that he's natty.   
---
Some people just have the idea that you grow 23 inch arms if you're on a cycle, and that "small" people can't possibly be cycling.
---
Nobody should comment on its accuracy. It's important that Blizzard leaves it to themselves to do the right thing.
---
Idk about the alliance questing. At 17 you’re already going across 3 zones to complete quests.
---
The norf remembers…
---
September 20th is still summer.....
---
do you wear your fedora while reporting youtube channels you dont like?
---
Mmmmmmmmm yummy yummy shitty blueposts
---
There's no server list yet, so how would anyone know ?  
---
I'll pick whatever pvp server is first when sorting by high population
---
I expect a very short open beta for stress testing is my guess.
---
I think people just want SOMETHING at this point. Something to look at, talk about, discuss etc.. there's been nothing aside from memes and blue posts to speculate about.
---
was streaming a thing in vanilla?
---
Generally you just put up corruption and maybe another spell (curse of agony or siphon life for example) and then wand it to death, so yes definitely possible.
---
&gt; I'd imagine it will release last week of Summer, or possibly even get pushed back.
---
Just a bunch of rumours and hints from streamers... I mean it seems legit with so many doing it, but it isn't official.
---
I feel like he tries too hard to do reactions like asmongold does but in the end u can see through it, scuffed asmongold is what i like to call him. (Not saying that asmongold is 100% himself while streaming)
---
cant you macro a click ?
---
I literally called you out then you try to flip it and call me a liar, fanboy-ism at its finest
---
Make sure to set it to text-only version.
---
This is what I assume as well
---
I'd consider private server experience to be more valuable of a source of game knowledge than retail vanilla exp. Like sure it's not the same feel and such, but but come on, you talk about private servers having skewed values, yea they are, but everyone's memories from 15 years ago are as well.
---
Yo this actually made me cry lol, beautiful (yeah I'm a big time crier, but still). But where's my main man old time homie Dun Morogh?
---
I just want to jump on the bandwagon to say that Josh mr. countdown to classic is an absolute champion. He’s literally never not replied to a single message I’ve sent him and his discord and the community he’s made are very warm and fun people.
---
a rasberry pi could probably run classic
---
Theres a rule to be 48 hours without symptoms before comming back to work. Doesnt work for me. I usually pull the headache/migräne out of nowhere.
---
np
---
I mean people dying happens, even in good groups. And not having a rez means running back and/or having to clear respawns again. I'm just concerned about groups refusing druids over it, which I have heard happens. I don't remember it happening, but I was a holy priest the first time around so I wouldn't have seen it.
---
No see it's a lie because what you said is false, he hasn't been proved to have insider information.
---
Whereas what I said is it is my OPINION that he is generally right
---
That's two totally different things, and I'm not downvoting, it isn't worth my time haha
---
Well if you roll pally your stuck healing for your entire vanilla experience plus leveling is going to be extremely tedius. My opinion would be priest. More desired heals in raid/bg's (not by much) faster leveling and if you ever want to, you have the option to dps. Let's face is ret is a disaster in vanilla.
---
It means you get the items which is BiS for you, which is outside dungeons. Like Heart of the Mountain. Choose quest rewards which gives armor, compared to the DPS one, for example.
---
This won't be true for Classic. In 1.12 fury warrior in prebis already does amazing dps.
---
What does BiS mean? Sry if it sounds ridiculous
---
You know bill orielly is rolling gnome rouge and is ready to gank the masses
---
1. Check out what servers are picked by streamers   
---
2. Avoid all these servers   
---
3. Pick any server based on pvp/rp/pop preference
---
haha yep I was doing the opposite the other day (human lvl 1 run to Teldrassil to get Darna rep) and followed some geniuses in some posts here on Reddit. There's a lot of great tips laying around the Internet. Also.. In Dun Morogh you just run up a mountain vein near Gnomer, and over the mountains and then you land in the water near the Menethil Harbor, sooooooo much better than running all of Dun Morogh - Loch Modan - Wetlands
---
Ok so do you want vanilla spell queuing? Do you want vanilla charge/blink failure? Do you want vanilla fear/poly through the ground or stuck in walls? Do you want vanilla pet pathing where pet randomly bugs get it and gets stuck on tile edges? Because all of that is going to change in the new engine and if you want the old style back you better start campaigning now. There will be a ton of changes in the new engine and by and large they’ll be for the better.
---
He's not wrong either I played kitty for about half of vanilla, people who talk about how all the classes are perfectly balanced and druids are viable and all that shit never sat on a druid with preraid BIS and spend week after week benchwarming because nobody would take you as a non healer, I eventually rerolled a warlock and the game was significantly more fun when you could actually play the game.
---
Best in Slot. For a Bear druid, you have to go out of your way more than the Warrior to get your BiS items.
---
This is exactly what I was thinking. This was just an idea of how blizz could go about it. Thank you for the runescape example its a good model for us to look at and hope for.
---
oof legion release year. like 310?
---
of course: do it as a ghost not only because it's faster but you walk on water as well... Although I think the drop down from the mountains there will kill you anyway, not sure about that
---
Why do you hate streamers? Genuinely curious. I mean they don't really affect your life unless you watch them, right? (Ok I get it, if you have Asmongold or Sodapoppin on your server you're fucked by the hordes of people, but other streamers?)
---
If people here can't take a joke, then they can't take a joke. I chuckle every time I find sarcastic remarks or straight up jokes getting downvoted because readers lack insight or humor.
---
Its going to be difficult because we don't know the server pop limits and server ratios.
---
If someone is LF 3 more healers and 16 more dps for there MC pug. They dont care if you are a warrior dps  rogue of hunter. They just want to fill the spots and not LFG for 8 hours before having the perfect setup.
---
How dare you come here with reason... Get him lads
---
&gt; If you don't fall under the category of everyone , then don't worry about it, you don't have to adjust any immediate plans that might provide you less fun than you'd feel like you'd gain from playing Classic WoW with some old friends. 
---
You worry way too much about this. For gods sake just chill. 
---
&gt; Are you one of those people that scoff at the idea of people playing Fortnite, yet rave how much fun Minecraft was when you were younger?
---
Huh. You know, maybe that makes more sense. It's just such a shame having skinning with that shiny carrot dangled in front of me and not thinking that I could get the most out of having that profession at 300 (and 15)
---
Oh i see. So like analyse each and every item i get, especially from quests which i cannot repeat. Am i right?
---
Armor dodge stamina are the best?
---
From what we've been able to tell, the Classic client is separate, but a LOT of files have been removed, so the download is a lot lighter than current retail size.
---
It will probably be a separate download. It doesn't make sense for two different games to use the same files.
---
Yes and no. They have the tech active right now on PTR, where it shares some files with live. However it will still most likely be a few GB download, because most of the classic content (old models, old zones, etc.) is no longer in live files.
---
Macho Man wins it for me. I’m going Horde.
---
bear druids in 5 mans do so much dps they honestly are an extra dps. its awesome and its another reason why they are the 5 man dungeon kings. maul/swipe do a lot on their own, but if you get 3 set t1 + imp thorns, you suddenly gain a ton of passive damage too
---
warrior damagedoesnt change all that much. it starts low and it stays low. even when youre super geared, it works against you in the sense that youre taking less damage via dodge/parry/blocking and it causes you to be pretty starved most of the time. druids dont have this problem since they get more crit as they get geared which triggers their talent that gives them rage. when swipe crits 2 or 3 times, it actually generates rage lol. when maul crits, it pays for itself
---
The closed beta is already running though, isnt it?  
---
And they could very easily differ from what they usualy do for WoW since it is not new content, but repair of old content.
---
You're not going to find Herod in the Badlands, but you will find a savage Orc who stole his armor in the Badlands.
---
"He both loves and hates the news, as he both loves and hates himself..."
---
Armor is the best by far, until you hit the hard cap where you can’t reduce damage taken by more. There’s good guides out there stating the BiS items and from there, you can see it does require you to conmit to going for tanking items.
---
What you describe is called leashing and wasnt in the game initially
---
“Cheating” lol. Welcome to an MMORPG tips.
---
i feel like youre being sarcastic, but fury tanking is currently the optimal way to tank as a warrior - especially if the damage values we see are true 1x
---
Because in a game without content yet because the game is not out yet. Youtubers still find ways to make 10+ minutes videos a few times a week. Some youtubers have 10 hours of videos material without actually uploading content. There is to few to talk about but there is alot of talking going on.
---
Man... I had so many nostalgic screenshots on xfire, probably 11 - 12 years old at this point, but I never backed them up before xfire was put down :(
---
Going through life so angry must be so tiring.
---
No, there is an intern alpha happening. So far there is no beta
---
Or maybe you could do something productive with your life instead of acting like a pathetic manchild over who gives to play the beta of a 14 year old videogame.
---
Hmm ok. Is there a thing like
---
1 armor &gt; 2 stamina
---
That kind of math will help me
---
As soon as my post goes up im at 0, i really don't care and i know how important this dicussion is to you so ill let you have it since you can't really prove to me how his right or where is right
---
Guides will show you that. There’s a general rule, but sometimes you have to account for other things, such as armor being useless against spell damage.
---
Try to google Vanilla tank druid guide. There should be quite a few.
---
Mainly class issues. Rogue energy regen was wrong. Shamans using 2h weapons without the talent. Ranged attacks don't make your spells cast longer (this mechanic had a name but I can't remember). There are a lot of examples. I'll link blue post talking about some of them and player post. Not every bug in player post is correct but at least 60% are right.
---
All of this in about 6 to 9 months before release. It's not a good sign but if the beta will be much better then it's all good.

Inb4 all this countdown rubbish is just for the beta for Diablo Immortal.

were there rp-pvp servers in vanilla or only pve and pvp?

Check it on wayback machine, they never had release dates.

Some people like Queen some hate them. Some loke ACDC and some hate them. Some people have taste and some people dont.
---
Everyone is free to like and hate whoever they want. Its all personal oppinions.
---
Thanks man. What are you going to roll? :)
---
I was thinking Mannoroth. I'm making assumptions but I think classic will launch with *at least* the same realms as the original launch and keep the types the same. Mannoroth was one of the best progression realms then so maybe some hard core (not me) players will go there. It'd be nice to have a chance at being there for the world first re-opening the gates.
---
ahhh thanks alot for the answer :)
---
That’s called commitment.

And you can't prove how he has insider information

Lirik likes to fuck with chat.

Im literally unable to call in sick because it requires a 2 hour  notice and my shift starts an hour after the GM gets in... So by default i cant follow protocol.

Absolute shit, but im bringing my laptop tomorrow just incase.

not all of them orcs are brutal and thievish man
---
Unfortunately no. https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms
---
Do you know if they will be bound to their zones in classic? I used to kite Kazzak or Teremus from Blasted Lands to Stormwind and had a lot of fun with that.
---
I don't think cross realm will exist at all.
---
Sharding is as far as I know, only being tossed around for the first zone, maybe the second popular zones as well, which I find kinda shitty but oh well, I can see why they would WANT to do it, I just don't agree with it.
---
Huh? I thought it was clear - from your first response to me, it seemed as though you were questioning 'why' it seemed as though people were having to adjust life events for the release. I was going to summarize it by basically explaining that a larger than average demographic playing this game is going to be adults, and they may have to adjust to meet whatever goals they might have in the game. 
---
You then responded to someone else and it seemed as though you were going off on a "I don't understand why people would think this is a big enough event to change immediate plans" to which I responded with a long winded: 
---
**Let the kids play. If they feel that it's major enough to re balance current plans, or plan vacation around, it shouldn't affect you, and there's no reason to question it.**
---
Looking forward to all the info that is going to be shared.  People should be more excited for this stuff.
---
Maybe in battlegroups for battlegrounds but this has not been confirmed. Battlegroups came at the end of vanila to balance out battleground queues.
---
At servers with 90/10% horde alliance ratio horde had battleground queue's for hours.
---
They inploment battlegroups to create a new balance between servers. They mixed the 10/90 servers with the 90/10 servers.
---
I hope they will inploment this later on to fix faction balance in battlegrounds. If they do this at start it makes no sence.
---
This post has been removed because there is no definitive answer that can be given. If your PC can run BfA, it should without any doubt, be able to run Classic. That is all we know.

RP-PvP servers did exist in Vanilla but because Blizzard wants to keep "players together??" they're none currently planned for launch.
---
Can get it on Amazon I think.

I would hate it, I still haven't picked a class lol

Some of us are depressed with the life we are stuck in, and those days we so unscrupulously take off might be for mental health reasons.  For some its just a nice day to unwind, for others it keeps us from sucking on the barrel of a gun.
---
Dont be so quick to judge that which you clearly dont understand.
---
Items:
---
No, they weren't, not until TBC was anything close to that done (just look at the Shadowcraft leather set, or Valor plate set on any 1.12 database)
---
Hybrids:
---
Yes actually, they were. That was the repeated message that Blizz gave out through their community messaging. That the "bonus" of being able to "pop out of cat form to throw a heal on the tank when required" was supposed to make Feral Druid "on par" with other dps classes (likewise for Palas and Shamans), which was demonstrably crap. 
---
Likewise the fact an e.g. Warrior could grab a +stamina/agility/hit ranged item to actually assist in their tanking, or +strength/crit ranged item to assist in dps, whereas not one relic actually featured stats and the bonuses they provided were very quickly both theory-crafted and demonstrated to be inferior to straight +stats, was avoided or ignored right up to TBC, when relics started (suddenly) to feature stat bonuses.
---
Well this one is!
---
If its supposed to be for his own good he should be grounded during p2.   
---
That shit will be brutal
---
Bro I have to wait for a response its Blizzard
---
Same here. I think they are too confident in sharding and also underestimate the amount of server load that will happen in the non-sharded zones.  A recipe for disaster.
---
Roll druid, trust me you won't regret it.
---
Crossrealm isn't going to exist in any form (except maybe BGs if they decide to)
---
Sharding is not cross realm. They have explicitly said at blizzcon that there will be no cross realm. You will only see horde from your realm, if they are in your phase. 
---
We have no idea how many days or weeks it will last. But I think 1-2 weeks is fine. It's far from ideal, but it's the best option we have. 
---
If we were lucky, servers would just always be able to handle millions of connections simultaneously (remember error37?) but that doesn't exist yet. 
---
You're obviously right that it lasting too long would suck, for a variety of reasons, but let's be real. They've done a great job thus far securing faith among the vast majority of the playerbase. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.
---

Ok, today then.

I played a druid in vanilla and consider it one of the biggest mistakes I made in the game, I won't be following that advice lol
---
Glad you could make it to the sub, Nancy.
---
Sorry this is correct but not at original launch.
---
You could like.. Hire an AH player. Send them everything, have them make money with your items and gold then have them loan you whatever difference you need at 40.
---
It's one way they could possibly do it without sharding.
---
Getting my addons ready and setup before release
---
Water elementals in STV are far from optimal for AOE as they are frost immune (most water elementals are).
---
And ZG crocs are not really normal AOE, much harder as they are elites in a raid with a ton of HP while there is much less room to maneuver and they like 4 shot you while also applying bleed. Also there is a bit of gear check too. They are farmable , but prepare to die while you learn. It is great for ZG reputation though.

He's not wrong though...
---
Where did I say that mental health is not a valid reason to take time off or that you have to be bedridden when you call in sick? I've seen people who I have the utmost respect forget get burnt out by the sheer amount of pressure put on them. That has no relation to taking time off specifically for a game release.
---
Experiencing the updated graphics for fun, seeing how true the game is to actual vanilla, playing a real blizzard server version for once, chatting with others who are also super excited for release. It's more of a why not for me.
---
I appreciate you stating a source to your claims, but it'd be even better if you were more careful at proofreading it. Here's what it says for September 13 2005 (Squarely within Vanilla)

Helping make the game better for release. Having been involved in a long alpha/beta for an emulator of another mmo, there is a lot that gets missed by a dev team and tester groups.
---
A big ol eyes on from many that played back then could really iron out the creases.
---
What I am not interested in is a "here is the finished product that we don't want input on to tide you over til release"
---
Human rogues are pretty iconic too if you think about Ravenholdt , the SI:7 and the Defias Brotherhood.
---
Is that a 27" Asus Predator 144hz monitor? I have the same, the price still stings over a year later but it's the best monitor I've ever used.
---
How can you be dissapointed on something that you had no clue what it is exactly?
---
You know Horde can't roll Pally, right? O.o
---
If they keep this drought up it will be DOA. People are getting burned out just watching and rewatching streamer videos and reading guides.
---
Everyone needs everything. Sells the item you win to the highest bidder.

Because I'd really like to play it?
---
Human rogue named tasumaru
---
&gt;He has always liked classic
---
&gt;That is why he was never a fan of it
---
After classic releases, retail will die in a few month
---
In retail you can make a macro to interact with your target "right click it". Maybe there is a macro to target last target ( mob you just killed ) and interact with it. But without autoloot Idc if it would work.
---
They will be kept separate. Classic will probably be well under 10 gigs.
---
You won't need a powerful rig to achieve that.
---
What is the problem?
---
MrGM is a great creator I look forward to his streams every day
---
I've had enough of all the streamers acting smug because they know things we dont, Why would you have NDA's for a game that came out in 2004? get it out already..
---
Yeah, there’s a few of those in every “first town with an inn” like Bloodhoof Village, Razor Hill, etc. in my experience you have the money for it around level 6.
---
Who is this guy anyway? Never heard of him. Seems like kind of an ass.
---
Will be fun to hit 20 or so with the people I plan on playing with.
---
Classic uses 7.3.5 as its base, so we need Legion Addons.
---
didn't they only invite like 5 people to their HQ? That's enough for a dungeon... man that would suck, and would absolutely get some outrage from the community too but Blizzard currently seem to go from bad idea to bad idea for the most part. Their Classic stuff has been good, but their PR team can certainly fuck that right up.
---
I use Vega 64 and Threadripper 1920X (although that's not for-gaming pick). Used i5-6600 before with such 75Hz display. The framerate is in general there but it will go down below 60 Hz on effects/mob/players quantity intensive moments.
---
Ideally wait for beta and ask people what they are getting on widescreen monitors. 
---
But on 'insert private server name here', I get 115-140 FPS at 2560x1440 at average settings with a GTX 1080TI. Drop to a 1080, you're probably looking at 80 fps. Now since your monitor is wider than standard, your 80 might be 60 or slightly lower. (as your resolution is roughly 25% more demanding pixel-count wise than mine). 
---
That's some pretty quick napkin math, but it should give you a decent idea. 
---
(I am running a ryzen 7 2700x for both gaming and productivity reasons, which is roughly equiv to a modern mid-high end i7.).
---
Mental health isnt a reason for most 'sick days'.  It sure isnt at my job.  So if you say that mental health is a pass, then youre okay with breaking the 'rules' around sick days.
---
In the end its none of anyone's damn business why I need the day off.  If you cant handle my not being there, pay me enough to make me want to be there instead of what I have going on -- or hire appropriately so staff can cover sick days.
---
That would make sense. Frostadamus said in his recent video that there is a forshadowing for blizz to make an announcement this week with a release date in june/ juli.
---
It would suck if it were announced for the late end on summer since they said its coming in summer

Gonna be sad if we can't do the BG jumps, they added so much to the game imo

Crafting your own Purples...

Classic will use \*the same\* engine as on live - so if classic launches during 8.2, then classic will use the 8.2 APIs too. You should watch (again?) the Blizzcon video when they explain how they bring Classic to life - basically they will import the old art assets from 1.12 and the database from 1.12 into current wow's engine. It won't look the same as vanilla did or that the private servers do, but it will use the same original art assets and hopefully they will make it look almost the same in terms of the iconic vanilla fog.
---
Not an office meme?! My lord... is that legal?
---
Would be cute, but thats not how it works. They need some PR before a Release and obviously they would get shitstormed to death if they just launch it without any warning.
---
Not going to happen.
---
Personally I believe that this is some kind of beta (Open or closed). I don't think Blizzard would delegate release dates to a couple of boring streamers. However it could be a tandem thing, they drop beta stuff and Blizzard separately drops release date shortly afterwards.
---
[The Norf will rise again!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwtSdJaPCSI)
---
Itll all depend on its popularity. Soo get all your friends, family and neighbours :)
---
I didnt really have issue with streamers before but they seem to be quite antagonistic of late.
---
I just like to play the game, have you never restarted skyrim a hundred times?
---
I don't know if he still does this all the time but he did do it a lot when I still watched the occasional video. He would suggest other people to do content all the fucking time and then sorta take credit for the idé. All I could ever imagine when he did that was exactly this https://youtu.be/Cfa-QD9DUig#t=51s
---
You might find [the WoW site on Logical Increments](https://www.logicalincrements.com/games/wow) interesting!
---
I would imagine for that resolution you might want a 1080 Ti or RTX 2080 for that, but it really depends on how Classic runs in comparison to current WoW.
---
Wait for the beta release, see how people are doing and make decisions from there. :).
---
I'm super torn between Priest and Warrior. I'll make the final decision when I stare at the character creation screen, but it'll be one of these two. 
---
If someone has Classic experience with both these classes and can give me some insight, that would be golden.
---
Start your own business :)
---
https://youtu.be/c3AMBw_oSRc
---
Believe they said they wanted to do it for starter zones.
---
This is the kind of thing they will explicitly detail when we get closer to release since sharding is such a fundamental part of the game.
---
View distance is the big thing that kills FPS on modern WoW. This will be limited in Classic making the demands of the game quite low on systems. WoW also take advantage of higher clock speed on a cpu as opposed to higher core count.
---
Mid range cpu with higher clock speed, something like an i5, and a mid range GPU like a GTX 1660ti. If buying new. 
---
The advantage of classic being so low demand is that you could actually go second hand and still build a machine that’s a beast for classic. You could look on Facebook market for something like an i5 6600k and a gtx 970/980.
---
As if i even have to explain myself when im sick. When im sick im sick. In The Netherlands its even illegal for an employer to ask.
---
Same is true for leatherworking. Tailoring is a bit better because you can make bags and sell them if you're ahead of the zerg but still not actually worth it while leveling.
---
For min-maxing while leveling, two gathering professions are the way to go. You store all your mats and then decide at level 60 what to do.
---
If you're really going to go ham on leveling, pick skinning and do Devilsaurs asap while you're the only one who can farm them.
---
I think for a lot of people the idea of Classic WoW has been alive and "on the horizon" for about 3 years now and with no way to stream or create content using private servers it's like we've been stuck in limbo. I think a playable version of the game and more importantly a streamable version of the game is going to be a very freeing experience and will reinvigorate the World of Warcraft community.
---
Shit, so how did you loose them if you didn't have sprint or stun or something? They would just follow you until you died?
---
&gt; The streamers that you're throwing insults to are already starting to call this community toxic
---
i really REALLY dont care, what some random dude on the internet thinks or says ...
---
r/shittylifeprotips
---
Yeah esfand is cool. Stay safe just rambles and says dude every two seconds
---
OH YEAHHHH
---
Warrior priest is 10x better than shaman. Priest healing is so much better. I've played both to rank 11 on sham and 13 on priest and I was never invited to a single premade as a resto shaman. Only shamans that get invited to PvP groups are 30/0/21 ele resto shamans
---
Alliance best faction
---
Shaman favourite class
---
Damn..
---
way to big for me
---
This guy here has some benchmarks using that resolution:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/960imr/benchmarking_world_of_warcraft_directx_11_vs/
---
Wtf Desolace one of the easiest and efficient zones to lvl in. Start it at 33/34 and you're laughing. This is before even touching STV it's so good.
---
By Muradin's Beard....
---
Fer a greenskin, ye sure be makin alo'a sense there, lad.  Drinks on me!
---
The group didnt help the skinner level his skinning (Not that its hard).  /roll before kill who gets to skin. The trick is how to tell who actually is a skinner and if they are even at the level.
---
That goes with any multiplayer experience... this time around I don't think people are understanding your point though. 
---
I believe most people are underestimating the "small" feel classic will have since everything in classic is mapped out and detailed for everyone there isn't AS MUCH interaction needed in 2019 classic wow.
---
I feel like people without guilds actively playing together will fall off so fast and that old mindset community won't take place for the first 6 months at the very least.
---
Just because I brought up a point about something using two different streamers doesn’t mean I’m a fan boy. Gtfo.
---
Hi, /u/Hazkem
---
The real community will only be found ingame on your servers. Just as with the internet in general, people on Reddit have a degree of anonymity.
---
They gotta generate them views somehow, don't they?
---
So, what you're saying is that you feel that you aren't getting paid enough to work to take (unpaid) time off work so instead you lie to your employer about being sick to make up for that or am I misreading the last bit? Nobody has to know why you take a day off, but that is what your vacation allowance is for, no?
---
those "content creators" are getting early acces to the beta. as long as its only the beta i dont real care about that. us normal plebs have to hope we get a beta inv in a few days
---
No you can sell it on AH
---
I can now confirm Blizzard read your comment and will have the stress test during the 20th.
---
Chill bro
---
Thats complete and utter bullshit. You aren't GPU Bottlenecked in WoW LOL.
---
I was for some odd reason sick every time an Assassin's Creed game was released (from Ac2-Unity). Strange, huh?
---
You're horribly misled, or incredibly ignorant if you think everyone gets a vacation allowance.
---
I wonder if I could emulate this on Linux with the resources though, if you can still get them
---
Oh that sucks, Im mostly a pve player but I absolutely want the pvp component in the world, its part of the experience
---
Are you? If so, do what you can to change it :) I hated my job, got stuck in an area where I really didn't belong. Took a job I knew I'd hate but it would give experience for jobs I would love.
---
And I'm now an IT Technician and happy! Next stage is game dev! :)
---
Where do you live that this is not a thing? That was the original question in the first place.
---
If you stopped generating agro for a bit, they'd leash and evade back to their regular spot.
---
Did anyone actually believe classic was going to launch tomorrow?
---
No idea, but some people in this thread are saying 1.12 which Classic is built on was after they Zone Bound the mobs.
---
Maybe tomorrow streamers get in and then Sunday it opens? I could see that happening for sure.
---
As others said already, Blizzard clearly stated there won't be any crossrealm stuff on Classic.
---
Sharding (that's not crossrealm) will be there possibly only on starter zones for a limited period of time.
---
It seems their intention is not so much to avoid the glorious "within normal release parameters" overcrowding, but more trying to account for the huge number of tourists they're expecting to leave after a week of two.
---
Original vanilla *was never* in this situation not other big releases.
---
Not wanting sharding is not unpopular at all, quite the contrary, it's just that there are *no better alternatives* to try and avoid dead realms early on (that is after all the tourists leave).
---
Too many posts and questions in comments for me to not think there were people believing a "surprise launch because of overpopulation"
---
Jeez, yeah it's a hell of a way to make a lot at the start. I wouldn't doubt it if we get a lot of people doing it. Imagine it, the road to Stormwind and Orgrimmar littered with wand peddlers on each side whispering you all at once: ["Psst, kid, wanna buy a wand?"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07MQEMwpW8Q)
---
&gt;If I were a Blizzard exec, there is no way I'm launching Classic before 8.2
---
The problem is that they are probably feeling the 8.1.5 content drought now. They can't afford to wait for 8.2 to release the way things are looking.
---
If they have classic ready, now would be a good place to release it. 
---
Especially if they have some issues that might delay 8.2
---
This is what makes me partial to believe a release (or at least a beta in a couple of hours)
---
Just bear in mind that if they reveal something nice, but its not what people wanted or expected because it was poorly handled, then a huge whiny shitstorm wont somehow teach them to do better it will teach them not to give the community anything but the bare minimum in releases etc.
---
All of the things you mentioned, except spell queuing, are bugs which they would have probably fixed even if they didn't use the new engine. Heck they prolly would have fixed those things in vanilla if they had the time. I'm pretty sure they didn't leave the bugs in the game because they liked it.
---
Fucka beta. Barely different than just playing a pserver, any time investment is lost
---
Yall are saying there will be an open beta?
---
yeah totally agree with you. I played vanilla from 2005, and only ever seen it drop that one time. Even on all the other alts I raised, and played, I never ever seen another skinner get it when I was running UBRS. 
---
I found grinding on the Yeti's in Winterspring to be great for Rugged Leather. You could get 8-10 stacks an hour, and a good few great drops if you spent 3-4hr doing it.
---
Jesus christ y'all quoted me? You realize I was making a /s comment based on another "announcement" someone teased a week ago?
---
WoW with only 10 players is not really WoW. They won't play if there is no one playing
---
TipsOut is alright. He actually gains his information from players that played in retail and are playing in top private server guilds, rather than stating his opinion. I don't see the need to hate on the guy. The argument that he's just cashing in is silly, everyone's cashing in on classic because everyone likes to make a bit of extra money. Can't dislike him because he's doing and other people aren't.
---
Sorry, but if streamers punch the hype train on galaxy speed and talking about long streams TODAY - only to tell us beta is coming - screw them.
---
Just reading this gave me a rage aneurysm.
---
Desolace sucks ass
---
[Is meme friend](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/big-if-true)
---
Sharding has nothing to do with server load. Realms aren't servers. Clusters of realms are on A server. Servers are grid based or "cloud" for load balancing.
---
Sharding limits congestion in zones and queues. That's it. That's all it's for. You're being moved laterally.
---
I mean it's a beta. Blizzard won't open the floodgates for everyone at the same time.
---
Not sure why streamers would keep talking about tomorrow being a big day while today is the announcement.
---
Maybe those linking GoT and classic are just assuming people will already be let in by then?
---
but ur smart and like a father to us :(
---
wow classic classic vanilla reboot classic vanilla classic is the name of the game in 2100
---
release date for sure
---
&gt; Jesus christ y'all quoted me?
---
I've done it again.
---
My power is immeasurable.
---
What's bullshit? That having almost 5million pixels vs 2million requires a better GPU?
---
Here's what I want, in descending order:
---
1. A beta, with me in it.
---
2. A release date.
---
3. A beta, without me being in it.
---
.
---
982. A bout of genetically modified cholera.
---
983. Streamers NDA lifted.
---
"All us streamers are getting beta guys! Aren't you excited?!"
---
But like you said, weight doesnt equate healthiness. That twinkie eater will be fucked even if theyre skinny. Just like a fatty that works out 2 hours a day.
---
Did he say it was DVT? Those symptoms could be other things too. But yeah at his weight tbat stuff is expected, tragic really.
---
Tipsout and stay safe along with esfand are some of the only decent classi streamers tbh, they are putting a lot of work into informing the community about classic wow.
---
I must say, yours and /u/KingKC612 comment, even though you guys said nothing special - gave me a nostalgic feeling of me pvping as a kitty cat.   
---
You guys just decided my class to play in Vanilla "i was stuck between Shaman and Warlock" - it's going to be a Druid.  
---
They prey on 12 year olds with gambling videos, loot box openings and bullshit like that. I honestly don’t know why anyone who has hit puberty would watch these people.
---
The private servers use the real, 'vintage' 1.12 client. But WoW Classic won't run on that, it will run on the actual, modern 8.2 client (DX12 mode), just with the old assets (old character models, old textures etc).
---
Geforce 1060-1070 should be enough for 60 fps at 4k - possibly 1070 to be overkill - we'll need to wait for the actual beta and see real results.
---
If you don't wish to level fast, then you should be able to farm up extra cloth if you're missing a stack or two.
---
We can hope :D
---
Wow, they made self-damage remove scatter and traps back then? Damn that sucks. Oh well, we still have Intimidation + Wing to create distance and try to survive the remaining 7 seconds.
---
Tailoring and Enchanting seems to be the way to go early on. Can self fund for wands which is the biggest boost you can get for leveling. Then i'd probably transition from enchanting to engineering. Some of the tailoring recipes are close to pre raid bis so you could sell those to fund leveling engineering too.
---
GET HYPED for 20 minutes of footage captured by Towellie at Blizzard HQ.
---
You're right! God damn.
---
You scared me. I read this and thought "He really said 100% there's no beta?". Lol. Damn. I need my glasses.
---
I mean hotted has been around for ages and he's an incredible nice guy but yeah you can tell something isnt right there. Sadly hes been like this for ages and its taking years off him.
---
I suspect a Geforce 1060 would be enough to drive the classic assets at 60 fps in 4k in DX12 mode (draw distance was really small in vanilla, they will try to replicate that). We'll obviously need to wait for beta to see actual, real numbers.
---
Bawls use to be the energy drink for the biggest lan in thw east coast (the ets), my friends and i would buy crate only because it was.impossible to find anywhere we live
---
Probably means streamers have or have had access to some early versions of beta and we wont like it because we would be jealous or something.
---
That's just Asmongold though. You need to take everything he says with a pinch of salt cause he loves to wind people up.
---
You make a great point, that it's not on ancient infrastructure. I didn't think about that.
---
Guess we won't know til it launches, but you make a very good point!!
---
Yes, having done research is more valuable than trying to remember information from 14 years ago.
---
EU has the turbo nerds and that's a fact. America just needs to git gud.
---
Go mining and tailoring. Mail all your ore to a bank alt. If you're going at a slower pace with leveling then you'll have time to set aside to farm any extra cloth you need to maintain tailoring and first aid. I suggest to not skip first aid. Locks benefit greatly from it due to life tap.
---
They will most likely open up the beta tomorrow. Let streamers get early access so they aren’t advertising their game and getting trolled/griefed by their audience.  
---
Streamers will most definitely get access before you.
---
Minute plus loading screens in the modern engine? How? Do you guys not have SSDs?
---
That bug list is scary. Demo was only two zones. I really hope the demo build wasn't the current version at the time.
---
If you expect to find decent people outside the game, good luck. Streamers (or should i say their followers) and forums are generally toxic, and always were. In game, obnoxious people will be filtered out with time, its hard to be an ass when you are all in a single server. The first few months of release will be pretty interesting sight, but afterwards it will be fine.
---
Back in the day, being an ass wasn't a good idea, and this will happen again. If someone can't stand it, i can suggest them to try again in time.
---
He doesn't seem genuine. He probably is but he doesn't come off that way. I tried watching some of his videos when this hype train began over a year ago and he seemed really fake and desperate.
---
That's exactly what somebody who is covering up a beta release date would say.
---
folks = us, the playerbase. folks has 5 letters. 5 days. soupa doubled down here guys.
---
Feral Faerie Fire was great for kiting since it did no damage, had a short cooldown, and you had the movement speed bonus from Cat Form and the PvP set.
---
I regularly kited the dragonkin packs from the world dragon in Ashenvale to Orgrimmar.
---
Or that one quest mob in Stonewall that would turn invulnerable if you did too much damage to it. Only grey to 60s but it was hilarious to watch dozens of people failing to kill him.
---
And of course Thanthaldis Snowgleam, the Stormpike Supply Officer. It was a nightelf at the Alliance Alterac Valley entrance, wielding a loot bag for a weapon, and with enough damage output to oneshot most 60s. Getting him to Ironforge or Stormwind took a lot of time, but he usually killed quite a few people once unleashed.
---
Its possible to play on a private server sure, but loads of people just don't want to do that. For those people this is their opportunity to explore a bit and figure out what class, race, or faction they want.
---
It also will produce more content to watch as people will be streaming it or putting it on Youtube. Not everyone is in to watching Twitch, but thats the biggest reason I'm excited for the beta.
---
That said, I don't think they will have an open beta at any point. Would be a hype killer.
---
who cares? cause Tipsout didn't even play on vanilla private servers he just got out of nowhere the day Blizz announced Classic with the only goal of cashing in.
---
Guys like Frost, Kargoz, Defcamp and Melderon are awesome youtubers for classic. Not sure what you're smoking.
---
We arent all privileged enough to have such opportunities.
---
I hate my job but it allows me to get by.
---
I would have to make less if I took another, and I couldnt survive on making $1000 less a month.  Thats a big chunk of change for me.
---
Dude, really? People are only throwing rumors that **the date for beta** will be announced. How did you even come to the idea that classic will launch anytime soon?
---
Its stated somewhere that in account management you need to opt in for beta invites
---
So fuck Frost and the actual content creators of classic? Those guys are in it because they do love classic.
---
Its only open to employees and friends/family of employees.
---
SOURCE?
---
I'd be totally OK with some bug fixes and performance/net code smoothing.
---
Why are there so many gate keeping assholes in this community
---
The United States of Murica.  Greatest Nation on this blue rock, didnt you know?
---
Take great care of our people here, and our leader is a true-blue humanitarian.
---
/s
---
Same here, brother.
---
Vanilla charge/blink was aids.
---
*WSG FC Charge Hopping flashback intensifies*
---
hahahahaha no way man
---
\*Yawn\*
---
Just right click and skin the beast?
---
Glad you said at least unlikely. There is basically non-existent demand for TBC and WOTLK servers, compared to vanilla. The high demand for vanilla on pservers is why they are creating Classic.
---
Now I know there's some  people (who don't play at all) claim they want TBC and WOTLK. If you want it, put your money where your mouth is go play it or stfu.
---
I agree with tailoring / mining.
---
Make a bankalt and send all the mats to that alt.
---
No one ever kills him lol
---
The streamer hate on this sub is insane, makes us sound like a bunch of old men shaking our fists at “you kids”
---
If you came to Herod due to his shoulder pads, Herod only has one shoulder pad these are the drake talon pauldrons iirc :).
---
i wont play it, but we should be glad that people do want to play it. it will make sure the real game is better
---
WoW is CPU bound. Even a 1060 should suffice.
---
Yeah aus&gt;EU &gt;US
---
xDDD
---
Hi, /u/boolawa
---
&gt;those "content creators" are getting early acces to the beta
---
Most of those guys need ALL the help they can get.
---
No you're right it doesn't. Saying that he's a professional vanilla player (LOL) does however.
---
Lol shakey cam incoming... I'll be watching esfand when it goes down but if he's not on towellie it is.
---
Counting the Russians as part of Europe when it suits you eh
---
They gain those retail players potentially not fully quitting wow and just quitting retail for classic.
---
As far as the common thought retail is bleeding subs, this may be an attempt for blizzard to stem the bleeding a little bit.
---
Don’t forget not everyone is as interested as we are, not everyone follows classic or even retail wow on a reddit sub or goes online to find wow information.
---
Hell, many of the current playerbase doesn’t even know about resources like icy veins
---
Why?
---
Healers can start early. Like 55 if needed. Obviously not ideal. You can start tanking BRD full runs at 57/58, earlier with competent groups. 
---
Thing is, group composition and knowledge plays such a huge part in vanilla, this is all subjective and contingent on exactly that. 
---
Running strat or scholo with a shackle and polymorph makes the instances a cakewalk. With 0 cc and a 58 tank however, chances are you’re gonna have a bad time. 
---
So yeah, highly subjective, but perfectly doable before 60.
---
me not that kind of orc
---
I dont agree. It would be good to mess around a bit on classic to make sure they pick the right class. Classic has like 6 different starting zones, even if you go through a few there's still a few more waiting.
---
Think he means he will play pally because he's playing horde and won't burn out that way
---
Lmfao god I need to go do that
---
100% and they should, builds excitement.
---
I don't care to play the beta except for an hour or two so I hope it's more than just a beta announcement lol... no release date = see you all in Late August / September!
---
Don’t be that guy, you aren’t cool or edgy for pretending to not know who some is.
---
Haha fair enough. I didn't expect to be replying to an American at these hours. I like your description.
---
that guy narrating the video desperately trying to sound cool
---
Rich piano?
---
By people specifically saying that, but if that idea of someone thinking that gets you upset, sorry!
---
they would follow you if you kept attacking them
---
"lol"
---
I can't find a source but I know it wasn't, as I remember they posted a few things that had already been fixed but was still a problem on the demo build
---
This comment made my morning lol
---
How to guarantee you’ll have enough money at 40 to buy your mount: grind beasts the appropriate level from 35-39. Done.
---
It could well be, but as you say we just don't know. If you're basing it off current WoW then definitely not, even a 1660 struggles to get playable FPS at 4K.
---
Of course this could all change, and it depends on your definition of "playable", as all the Logical Increments ratings are done at maximum graphics. So if you don't mind dropping some settings, you can do it a bit cheaper.
---
You'd probably just be better off selling the stuff you make and buy a wand.
---
I want to play the beta for the same reason I still currently play private servers. I love Vanilla WoW
---
It'll be a blue post that says they've decided to slightly change the font kerning on quest text
---
He keeps advertising eating all this red meat on his twitter. Dude needs to chill with that.
---
No no USA
---
You’re* how are people still getting this wrong in 2019.
---
But they will do exactly that _at some point_, Blizzard will want to test server architecture and network capability with an open beta where everyone hammers the servers as hard as they can.
---
I doubt that is _this_ beta though, but it will happen.
---
I mean, I see where you are coming from. You're right to an extent. 
---
I just don't understand the group of people active on this sub that seem to have a problem with any content creators succeeding for whatever fucked up reason. 
---
The shit they are mad at is totally undeserving of the incredible criticism it has received.
---
Yeah, I dont sleep well -- shocker I know.
---
Yeah, it’s 3 second of getting your 5 second rule started that will make your next kill smoother/faster=less down time.
---
Everything that drops in raids is going to the guildbank. All skins and mines.
---
Beta being open tomorrow is good news regardless of who gets in. We'll have a bunch of questions answered about the game.
---
I live for that shit. It may be a waste of time by speedrunner standards but I plan on running dungeons like SM/Deadmines, RFK/RFD like 10 times each.
---
However, in multiple classic discords there's like 90% Alliance guilds promoting, you have to actively search to find Horde guilds.
---
Can I hijack this post and ask about levelling for a Mage as it's pretty similar. I guess tailoring and mining if I want to go engineering later, or herb for alchemy later or enchanting? 
---
I haven't played much mage so anyone with experience would be great.
---
k 😭😂🤣
---
Only by the barrel though. hehe jk
---
Words are just words. The fact is this version was what they gave to the players. That's the only thing I will judge because there's no way it's false.
---
How is a beta test a waste of time? It's there to finish finding bugs. That's literally the reason products have betas.
---
A basic gaming GPU should be fine, like a GTX 1050, along with any modern CPU, like an i3-8100.
---
This has got to be a troll post.
---
Exactly what i did hence the 5 days played at level 42! And the full set :)
---
It’s like watching your friends who don’t have jobs go on spring break when you work 2 jobs and have crippling student loans.
---
Tailoring, Mining. Keep all the ore and use it at 60 to level up Engi or just sell it.
---
Like anything in classic it does take a commitment to keep ur Prof useful to ur current char lvl; however, even bsmithing can be done without too much of a time drain as the later quests, xp from killing mmobs while farming, all makes for a nice way to lvl off the normal grind.
---
I honestly dont know how people that are not in puberty anymore are so god damn angry about what some people do online. 
---
Like what the fuck is going on with some of the people here, i dont care about youtubers or wow streamers but god damn are some of you motherfuckers angry about something that you could basically just ignore.
---
Athene 2.0?
---
He himself has been hyping up a beta announcement.
---
"We decided to adjust the width of the WoW-Logo in the loading screen by 16 pixels, to ensure brand visibility"
---
Do you live anywhere near the West coast? I love all the national parcs in the area. Hiking helps a lot to clear my mind.
---
Sharding mames it possible to level in a crowded place. It also makes it possible to level compleetly solo. I hope blizzard nakes the shards not to little and there will still be masses running around. But I dont want more players than possible mobs around me.
---
You did what I wanted to suggest. Great to hear!
---
Beta are for those who are willing test things and report anything broken or buggy that they might discover. So for those people who want a bug free game in release, it is not a waste of time.
---
How do people get things off the bank? Is there like a bookkeeping system or do people just take what they want and no one knows?

I'll give you another perspective. Because their job encourages people to parrot their opinions and not think for themselves. I asked someone I play games with what they thought of a game a few months back and the first words out of their mouth were "well, this streamer I watch says-" and I cut him off. I didn't ask what this streamer douche's opinion was, I asked him.
---
I find this incredibly fucking irritating. It's cancer.
---
Im going with Engi/Tailor as well. For leveling up and bit after 60 i will go with mining/skinning. When i collect enough mines, ill swap to Engi. As for tailoring, i will level up my First aid first, while keeping skinning for some extra gold. Later when i farm up enough cloth i will swap skinning for tailoring. 
---
Check a guide to see how much mats you should send to an alt before you spend them on leveling engineering, tailoring isn't big deal to level either, but i don't think i should try leveling it along with First aid.
---

---
You are going to be OOM always regardless of optimisation in comparison to other classes. If you don't believe me, go to an instant 60 server with free gear from all tiers and try it for yourself.
---
I feel like if you feel ashamed of either side, that isn't the side you were destined to be on.
---
I'm gonna go against a stream here and suggest you take skinning purely for farming gold and getting that epic mount first. Second profession can be whatever. It will save you a long ass time in long run.  Second profession, whatever you want. Even if skins won't sell as good on AH, you can make 50+ Gold / hour easy just vendoring animal trophies + skins on level 60, especially as warlock. Besides, there is going to be huge competition for mining nodes at the start, with how few of them are out there. If you ever did mining in vanilla you know this is going to be hell even if you don't intend on speed leveling to 60 asap. I'd much rather do that later WITH epic mount, honestly. Engineering isn't going to give you a huge competitive advantage so early in the game anyway.
---
Why not just like....play the game yourself?
---
Damn that was some intense boredom.
---
Thottbot was king during those days.
---
I know. Only hints though and never stated anything as facts. I myself think it has to do with the beta but we wont know until it's time. I was merely introducing a plot twist of sorts.
---
And the best comment in this thread award goes to Grievuuz! You win gold!
---
You'll have to speak up, I'm wearing a towel.
---
After 15 years people has tested every scenario with everyclass and every gear combination. When people say something is just not good ebough for serieus raiding I believe them.
---
I'm a 12 year long elemental shaman onetrick. No alts no offspecs. I had to put my love for elemental aside for my love of raiding. Something with a cake and eating it.
---
I'm going tailoring/mining
---
In terms of doing first aid + tailoring, no you won't find enough cloth to level both. You will have enough for first aid, but you need to buy cloth for tailoring. It's not so bad because you make some of the money back by selling the bags and you get a free mount.
---
I don't see a beta either, what do they need testing for? They have all the files as they were.
---
But I still think blizzard will have a release date. 
---
But on the other hand a release out of no where will Couse less problems server wise.
---
The same thing happened with other games and i still don't understand people's hate. I even read the same salty comments.
---
Why shouldn't Blizz give people with thousands of viewers beta access or whatever else thats going to happen today? Its advertising. They aren't "the face of the community", "unworthy cuz not real Vanilla players", or w/e hateful little comment, its just a fucking ad. Jesus christ. Go hate on 2004's gamespot for making a WoW review, it makes just as much sense.
---
Ironic.
---
&gt; no guides, wikis, or videos. Just as it was back in the day 
---
Uhhhhhh

thats not true

give those guys a sub
---
ill watch their content over the shitty tupsout,ronjeremy,alexshitsual or towel
---
Why would they do a beta? It's not new content 
---
But let's see
---
Too right, dont here of many of us!
---
Holy fuck honestly how are you this fucking stupid 
---
&gt; I didn't throw an insult
---
I didn’t say you did I said I did and asked how you thought that was a conversation.  Jesus. Fucking. Christ, my dude.
---
Shamans make melee groups stronger because of windfury is an example, and paladins have a blessing that reduces threat generation allowing dps to go harder.
---
At 60 seconds it's 5% longer. So if you spend 24 hours of combat time to hit 40, that's an extra 1 hour 12 minutes. If you kill mobs in 30 seconds it's an extra 2 hours 24 minutes.
---
Gm/officers take everything. We thrust them that they give it out to the right persons. It will be known if people need stuff. I have big faith in the guild I'm in right now.
---
Illuminati confirmed? 🤔

These comments go hand in hand...

&gt;(Hopefully I can stick to it and not give in to using outside help lol)
---
If you play solo I'll give it 2 days at most :)
---
Who in their right mind thinks Ashenvale is the worst zone?
---
MrGM is probably the best out of the bunch though. At least he's tried to make his channel legit by converting to retail WoW content. Would you rather have DodgyKebaab?
---
Well OCE
---
My mouse finger is ready to mass dislike all the youtube content of some elites club of 14 year olds getting to play a beta.
---
Even when I did not speak good english as a 12 year old. I knew how to search for the screenshot tab on thottbot to help me out. You just cannot play without help.
---
Yeah WoW went off the rails after Cata. Actually, probably during cata.
---
California.
---
I work 60 hours a week, Im not spending my one day off hiking when i need to catch up on errands, get groceries and god forbid relax at home.
---
Damn only 2? Haha
---
My sense of humor has been distilled so much that I can scroll around on the Internet for hours but this...this is the comment that actually makes me laugh out loud
---
Highly doubt it but since it's not a new IP I don't see why they wouldn't open it.
---
Oh didn't know about that
---
Can’t speak for him but personally, I think it’s a generational thing.  As a gamer who came up prior to streaming, I just don’t see the appeal in watching someone else play.  They make a gaming community pretty shitty as some of their fan base (and sometimes the streamers themselves) are annoying little trolls.  When classic releases I will be actively looking for a server with as few streamers as possible to minimize my interaction with streamers or their fan base.
---
**&lt;TBD&gt; \[PvE\] \[A\] \[EU\]**  
---
As much as we'd all love to no-life the game like we did back in 2005, I suspect for many of you circumstances have changed fairly drastically. With the overwhelming majority of the Classic demographic being in their mid-20s, I can't be the only person with relatively limited playtime looking for a decent raiding guild.  
---
There doesn't appear to be a huge number of Alliance guilds rolling on PvE servers, so I've decided to begin forming my own. I'm looking for a number of like-minded individuals to form the backbone of the leadership team.  
---
Here's what I'm thinking so far:
---
**Intended Region:** EU  
---
**Intended Server Type:** Normal (PvE)  
---
**Intended Faction:** Alliance  
---
**Intended raid/play times:** Tuesday and Thursday (20:00 - 23:30 - Game Time)  
---
**Priorities:** Raiding, Social  
---
**Rules:** DKP (or similar)  
---
**Language:** English  
---
Interested? Drop me a message on here or Discord (blnkmyr#8584).
---
Alliance is (or was anyway) the preferred faction if you wanted to optimize raiding. Blessings were just better than totems at the end of the day.
---
The threat reduction blessing makes threat management almost a non-issue for classes that have to otherwise just stop DPSing if they get too much threat.
---
Windfury makes melee classes more valuable, but overall the threat reduction blessing is just better imo.
---
....... because it's not out yet.
---
It's how blizzard have done it for a while now. Hearthstone... Heroes... Overwatch... SC:R (although it was just turned on early for some accounts)
---
Yea, cause a closed beta for streamers will make me happy. Gimme that release date baby
---
Lemme get uhhhhhhhh
---
You seem angry. Why don’t you just ignore them instead?
---
You have to admit it's quite fun.
---
Wait, what? So beta is only done for new content?  
---
In this case is a new game, literally. No, it's not the old game, that one could not be used. They imported the old assets in the new engine, so probably a million things are broken, or not at their exact spot in the world (ie: flying tries and so on). They definatelly need a ton of players to point the small errors out. They even said at Blizzcon that they will need the community to help them figure things out.
---
My problem with a lot of the classic guys is that they are completely devoid of charisma and personality.
---
They either robotically read out their script, or have such a limited vocabulary that you'll hear "unfortunate" every 2 seconds.
---
They survive off of their viewers' hype alone.
---
Streamers have heavily alluded to a beta. People are looking forward to beta. If it turns out they were intentionally missleading, mentioning "beta" but it's only footage, all to bait people into their channels for money, means people will be upset.
---
Can be the smallest thing like a class quest that gets frustrating or a weapon trainer that you aren't in the city of. 
---
Not saying you'll need to but there are so many little changes between then and now!
---
Is it really poking fun tho? I look at this picture and see more things on the alliance side that appeal to me. The horde side looks like it smells like stale BO, Diesel exhaust, and Axe body spray.
---
Cream of the Crop always rises to the top!
---
Just play on a PvP server to avoid noteworthy streamers. All the big streamers usually play on PvE because otherwise its just a 100 man skirmish where ever they go.
---
Asmongold talked about trying a PvP server, but I don't think that will work out for him.
---
How about this phrasing instead: They've hacked together a 15 year old database with a modern client, hiding the new stuff and hoping nothing goes wrong. Especially given how much went wrong in the demo I don't fathom how people can say that no testing is required. I'm confident the game will be in a much better state now, things such as the return of spell batching puts me at ease, but I believe that testing is in order.
---
I haven't watched a single second of any of them. I tried watching the Fat dude a little but but oh boy, that was some shitty unscripted content I could not bear. 
---
StaySafe and Frostradamus seem the only one that are watchable. They just share Knowledge without much drama.
---
There has been plenty of dissapointments from Blizzard the past couple of years so its only natural to be apprenhensive.
---
Now do GoT.  Lots of quality meme content to work with.
---
Well, for one thing I'm at work right now, and even if I wasn't I'm quite sure classic isn't out yet. Any other stupid question?
---
The only thing that would affect my decision is faction balance, but I would need to wait a few days at least to get that data and I'm going to play as soon as its available.
---
Some people have an irrational hatred of streamers.
---
Perhaps.
---
&gt;prolly would have fixed those things in vanilla if they had the time
---
Now you're already diverting from the #nochanges mindset, and entering slippery slope territory.
---
Oh you must have missed that last 2 years of him shitting on it and him calling it a joke
---
Yeah I have never been into PTRs or betas just like I'm not into LFR.
---
&gt; people aren’t jealous.
---
You're right about everything but that part.
---
That’s not his hand in his hand...
---
I'm a TBC-baby so I don't know what it was like before both factions had Shaman and Paladins.
---
I'm looking to play a druid for classic, I just wanted to know what benefits I'd get from each faction, or if for example there would be less spots in Horde due to Shamans for totems.
---
Big Big Bonerino.
---
It's very confusing for newer or younger gamers to understand but it's not their fault... most of the time in recent years beta and demo have been interchanged.
---
All about the $$$$$
---
I'm talking about watching streamers in general.
---
ayy 420
---
&gt;certainly don't trust anything I say
---
I don't trust you about this
---
I'll take uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
I'm gonna give it a shot though!
---
It was very patchy at best with what it had but back then we needed any scrap we could get out hands on!
---
She's undercover. Don't let anyone find out or she'll be depreciated.
---
A.) Was talking about streaming in general.
---
B.) Get back to work.
---
Well let's see how well they managed to get the old client working, who knows.
---
Gotcha. I'm sure I'll cave eventually lol
---
I only see them at 7-11 now
---
It still doesn't change the fact that it's crap. The city raid on retail which got shut down by a GM is a perfect example of it.
---
For real
---
He tries too hard to be entertaining which devolves into rambling
---
They are working hard to keep a tight lid on the secrets of Ragefire Chasm.
---
You're legit too stupid to insult.
---
Mining and engineering
---
Oh I bet!
---
Hoe can people not love the money crater?
---
Took me around 4 years but now I'm happy with a bigger wallet. It was worth the effort. During that "middle" job I did everything I could to be in different departements, learn as much as possible and get a lot of connections and references.
---
&gt;i'd just block them like an adult and move on with my day.
---
This is the lesson.
---
I love the maul.
---
That's sad =( Hopefully you'll find a way to make it work. What do you do and what do you actually want to do?
---
can confirm, I grinded/farmed from level 57-60 in Azshara alone back in the day
---
Hi, /u/poppywoofs
---
I'm also curious about this, I think tailoring and engineering are going to be my end game profs.
---
But I was thinking to take skinning and mining while leveling. Mail all my ore to the bank alt and sell all the skins to vendors for the pocket change to aid in funding the leveling of profs and such.
---
Classic tailors dont get a buff in cloth drops right? Thats a thing that started in Wrath I believe.
---
We're in the end game now.
---
I’m with you. You have to manage, and if that means skipping a quest to grind, so be it.
---
Hi, /u/jebeli13
---
Can you tell me where you found those images for the wallpaper? i want one like urs but i can't find the continents in 1920x1080 size.
---
But it has cast time in vanilla which makes it a feel clunky as hell
---
Feral is always going to do more dps and thus TPS than prot warrior tank and is always going to be better tank than fury warrior tank.
---
Two reasons, for me personally;
---
1. WE ARE GOING HOME.
---
2. I want to help Blizzard make sure it's all on the level so they can blow the Wall of Nope out of the water proper come summer.
---
Imagine reading what towellie has to say.
---
Always put the tl;dr at the top.
---
Emerald welp pet farming to make BANK!
---
He's said multiple times that he started in vanilla, don't know why this rumor that he didn't keeps going around.  If you don't like the guy, don't make up lies to try and justify it.
---
Think about not having anything positive to say.
---
LOL, it will be twice as big as the other fingers. (Well, not really, since there are no muscles in the fingers, but I liked the visual imagery)
---
Shamans have tranq totem that reduces threat generation by 20% in a 20-yard area. It's worse then paladin's one but still, you should mention it to make a fair comparison.
---
A good rogue will win 100% of the time.
---
This sub has a lot of whiny, bitter, "content creator" hating, gatekeepers who apparently have the thinnest skin of anyone on the planet. This tweet is just banter, its really not hard to see that.
---
Yeah, I'd love to go back and play through lich king but, classic would have to be an absolutely massive success for them to try for the trilogy.
---
Unfortunately private servers have never been a good fit for me. I play way too slowly to ever make any progress on them. By the time I get anywhere the server dies out or gets shut down.
---
well windfury increases the threat of the tank so you can go harder from that alone
---
I didn’t know I was only providing examples I know of. But dang I always hear people talking about the paladin threat reduction and never heard of the shaman one that’s pretty sweet
---
F*ck Desolace
---
Just not the case.
---
Wow that's amazing.
---
True, this is mainly just for launch day and leveling as quickly as possible without relying on other players. Prices could be a bit weird for the first few days. But mining still works if you aren't planning on rushing to 60
---
You can play it blind but it will take much more gametime to reach lvl 60.
---
If you are a roleplayer type you will enjoy questing and figuring out the stuff much more enjoyable.
---
And if you aren't statisfied you still can use external websites or addons :)
---
I would rather have them follow the normal timeline but run polls on new features like OSRS. 
---
It's been said a million times already but wouldn't it be great?
---
A few changes that I would like to see would be;
---
No flying... like, ever. It ruined world pvp and made the world feel so small. 
---
No group finder... The community was so much closer when we had to actually communicate to find groups. I miss that. 
---
No Graphics upgrades... OSRS is a blocky browser game from early 2000s and its doing great. Vanilla wow had character, let's hold on to it. 
---
Tons of other stuff too but yeah, I wouldn't mind seeing them add new stuff, as long as it was voted for by the community. 
---
I would love to see classic thrive like this because it would send a great message to other game companies.
---
[1. General] [Scrublord]: anal [Garrote]
---
No real overarching story?  Finding Rexxar and then allying with one of two centaur clans (of your choosing) then murdering the hell out of the other one.  Deso was great.
---
To my knowledge, only one successful server has been shut down and 80% of the players had quit by that far (they thought they do but they didn't lol). Getting shut down is a huge red herring, server dying is real issue but I don't see what solution Classic has for that.
---
&gt; Absolutely garbage content. Videos stretched out to 10 mins so they can monetize them, when it's something they could have wrapped up in 2 mins.
---
Hey, maybe they dont want to work for free?
---
It's totally doable, playing without any guide. I personally think it's significantly more fun, but you have to realize you will be getting through content very slowly. As long as you are fine with that, I highly recommend it.
---
Im a member of management in a restaurant, and honestly what Id like to do at this point is never deal with another customer ever again.
---
Seriously, I'd kill a man for a permanent position at UPS.  Union, good pay, healthcare, no customers, just throw boxes.
---
Calm down Goy, I know you love your greasy streamer.
---
Good luck getting T3 tokens on a druid :(
---
And I'm talking about youtubers. Which OP said fuck them and the people who watch them. That's why I called out OP.
---
Get more shammies in the raid and you can swim in totems.
---
Your mom is your wife?
---
I don't really even get why we need a big reveal on a game we already know 99.99999% about. The hype is already here. There's nothing to reveal. I mean look at previous blue posts. People have spent days arguing over things as relatively minor and trivial as some stat changes.
---
Never said it wasn't crap. No need to read what isn't there.
---
I can't say I'd mind it to be fair. If Blizzard did do an altered timeline I'd be happy as long as they stuck with it instead of reeling us back to where we started like it never even happened. I'd prefer a continued divergent timeline rather than a trip to the past.
---
If they also continued with the original design and gameplay philosophies of classic whilst developing new content, I could see them making some fantastic stuff. It won't happen of course, but it would be nice to see what they could come up with.
---
Yeah, exact- *hwat hold on*
---
OMG I can’t wait to have cursed back.  Amp curse in curse of exhaustion just to watch them try to run and can’t get away.
---
It really has been the worst kept secret in classic history. I wonder if Blizz will invite any of them back again.
---
It's really down to the wire for me with being able to put in PTO for the release. If they don't give a release date very soon the train is leaving without me unfortunately.
---
Damn you're smart
---
So you are aware you plan to relapse?
---
a wall of text that used to be posted on official WoW forums whenever someone would ask for classic WoW servers
---
stop this already
---
People opinions are affected constantly by others peoples opinions. Maybe he says that because the streamer came up with another perspective that the person hadn’t thought of; ”oh, that is true, I didnt even think of that”.
---
Release. Fuck a beta.
---
Let's hope they release/announce a beta tomorrow and let's hope more that it isn't in a '20 percent of it works' state.
---
The rogue will use CDs, the hunter will get caught after his first escape and never get back to range.
---
Yeah that's what i ment! Sorry if it wasn't clear.
---
Perfectly normal addict behaviour xDxD
---
Against hibernate/scare beast you just shapeshift out of your form before the hunter's cast is over. Easy.
---
&gt; Hibernate (which can only be cast on Druids in the first place).
---
Also, hibernate and scare beast can also be cast on a Shaman if he's ghost wolf'd
---
Joana, lol
---
Is there a larger version of this map?
---
I'd much rather have a period of time to test the game for faults before our actions actually apply to our characters permanently...
---
I'm sorry your legs don't work, missing a lot of cool things in the world.
---
Hahahaha amazing more more please
---
3 hours left!!
---
depending what kind of druis you want to play, but feral is stronger on alliance.
---
Oh man, restaurant must be quite tough. I (not sure why) got into the healthcare area, but really disliked it since I'm an IT and Tech guy. Got a job for customer support, which I from there went to other divisions within the company to build up my resumé.
---
Some customers are so damn annoying and harsh. I am state employed It tech now so the "customers" I talk to are just employees within our county, and everyone is very friendly.
---
I would never set a foot close to a job where you have to deal with private customers ever again. I really takes it toll on you.
---
You're a funny man but why have a NDA for a 15 year old game? Seems silly unless they were to make drastic changes.
---
The real reason you should be playing horde in pvp is super sticky glue.
---
Not even playing a video game, more like "potentially getting some new information which has a chance of not being relevant to you, and which you could get anyway by checking your phone or when coming home from work".
---
If someone decides to call in sick or take a day off for this, I don't even know what to say.
---
As silly as it seems, it has shot up in quite a few threads today.
---
Consider this comment as a second upvote my good sir
---
I think the only real solution after wow classic has maxes out progression, is to make a new fresh classic realm and the old becomes a master realm. When that one maxes out those characters get dumped onto the master realm. Rinse and repeat until the game dries up. In essence a seasonal ladder system, albeit with a much longer time scale.
---
This type of system would require the absolute least amount of blizzard resources and least likely to incite the masses.
---
I think one point of the demo was to showcase how much the new stuff interferes with the old game. They already talked about most of them problems during blizzcon. I guess they really wanted people to understand why classic still would need this long to develop and also show people their dilemma in some cases, like fixing bugs which where in classic but fixed later which could be game breaking if abused.
---
I don't see any good reason for it to be limited to level 30.  There's nothing to spoil or limit here.
---
the highest pop pvp server, hopefully a good faction balance or at least 60-40. But i dunno how we will know on launch day.
---
We wont know until a good few weeks after when you've probably already levelled to much to start over :(
---
And he's always talking out of his ass regarding vanilla.   Closing people didn't know about world buffs, engineering, macros, etc.   
---
And I thought he did play in vanilla.   Got to like lvl 35
---
Generally only effect party so you can't dou Le dip unless you have more than one per group.
---
Both factions bring about the same amount of Druids. Usually 1-3. 
---
Alliance has benefits if you're a Feral Druid. Gnomeregan is easy to access for Alliance and believe it or not you have to farm Manual Crowd Pummelers  (a lot of them lol) if you want to have optimal equipment. You don't need to do this necesarrily, but if you're trying to be the very best, you have to.
---
Alliance also has Blessings that will increase kitty DPS, the shaman totems don't really help them as much or at all.
---
But most Druids are resto, and there isn't really a distinct advantage to either side in that regard.
---
One of my best friends used to be our raidleader in molten core in 2005. 
---
One day we talked in voice and realized, we live both in Berlin. So he jumped into his car and come over to drink a beer. 14 years later we meet on a regular basis. 
---
There are more people I talk to from back in the days. I‘ve never met them but everytime a new blizzard games was released we play together
---
They sell them at a Safeway in my city, but they probably only restock them because my LAN group buys them all once a month haha
---
I need  **Classic WoW**   now T-T

Using the 1.12 client at 3440 x 1440 I get an average of 100FPS using an i7 4790 &amp; GTX 970. 
---
Any mid range CPU/GPU combo from the last few years should do you fine, especially since Classic is going to be running on the 8.x client.
---
I'm curious - what do you think this link shows?
---
no changes
---
This. He is so over the top telling what awesome information or story he has to tell and its never that interesting at all.
---
You can always change your circumstances, it's just a question of what you're willing to sacrifice and how long you're willing to get out of the hole.
---
Unless we're talking debt, what could possibly be more worthy of those dollars than your actual quality of life?

Same, but it’s the closest we’ll probably ever get

Fake is the correct term indeed
---
Hey! I met my current wife (7 years) on World of Warcraft, couldn't believe at the time that such a pretty woman could be playing the game but eh, here we are today. She was in another city for her studies and moved in with me in Paris, continued her studies there :)
---
We still play everyday together and we plan on joining classic as soon as it releases!
---
Main and a new
---
It definitely is more casual friendly as in casuals have a lot of fun things to do as compared to retail.
---
I'm sorry your brain is full of air :(

---
Wow thats really nice. When wow used to unite players, not separate them
---
Sap can be broken by Stoneform and Iceblock IIRC
---
I'm not even sure if iceblock works on hunter trap
---
stupid chadmins
---
always think you can MISLEAD the honest elf people!!
---
*unsheathes blade*
---
what are ur last wordes
---
Yea, I have just been really trying to wrap my head around it lately. I just don't understand why somebody would have a rage aneurysm because somebody else got to be involved with something cool.
---
Yeah, nowadays society's streamer favoritism is really disgusting.
---
New
---
Well, the worst class in vanilla had to get something good
---
Irony aside, they wouldn't have needed a beta test if they were going with the original 1.12 client (well, only for technical - OS compatibility reasons, maybe). But they actually imported the old assets and database into the modern, 8.2 client and millions of things could get wrong in this way. We won't be playing vanilla, but a 8.2 client and APIs with only 64bit support and DX12.
---
If you have a Publix near you they have them there.
---
Really went the other way to his gameplay wise
---
That may be the case, but it doesn't change the fact that I asked a person's opinion and instead of getting the opinion I asked for I was given someone else's opinion.
---
Oh yes, I am definitely doing that, it is amazing. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
This^ I sat inside a lot for two years only playing video games on my sparetime and not taking care of my health at all. I noticed I was performing worse and worse. I didn't get why.
---
Fast forwards a few years and I'm going for walks everyday to do my daily in Pokemon Go, as well as eating healthy and working out regularly. 
---
Not only has it made me a LOT happier but for me, I started performing a lot better in Video Games after being active before logging on. (Better aim accuracy, better decision making, better concentration)
---
Don't forget to take care of yourselves this summer guys!
---
I don't remember those issues in BFA launch, in fact it was perfect.
---
You wife'd your mom? Bro....
---
because end game guilds will be trying to rush raiding.. they herbs will be in high demand for pots and flasks
---
There was a dude who did this at my work. We work in a factory and there is no AC so it gets super hot in the summer time. Like over 100 degrees inside. It sucks so people do what they can to try to get out of working. This dude thought if he shit himself, they’d send him home. Nope. They made him take a shower in the locker room and gave him a fresh pair of coveralls. So he shit himself again, but to no avail. They made him take another shower and gave him another fresh pair of coveralls. He stopped shitting himself after that. I don’t understand why he stopped at 2 though... Turd time is the charm.
---
Thats so cool. I hope we will meet and have a double date then xD
---
Do people actually call in sick and stay home just to **potentially** witness an announcement?
---
Like I can understand not wanting to miss a server launch or something, but what actual reasoning is behind this? You're going to sit in your chair, hoping for Blizzard to announce X release date for beta or classic, and then what?
---
i had a queue time to access for the 1st week
---
Tier 2 is what i'd need, so no tokens.
---
A lot of places in Europe require information from the doctor after a certain amount of days... Like 4 in the UK for example.
---
Very hard to fire people these days regardless of what industry your in.
---
I was a troll hunter back then, will be rolling a nightelf hunter this time. I'm still not sure if it's the right decision, it just doesn't feel right... Unfortunately all of my friends are going to play alliance so I don't really have a choice...
---
6 to 9 months is not a long time in game development and I'm assuming game recreation is similar in terms of fixing issues.
---
So the rumors on the internet in the past 2 days were:  
---
\- Blizz will announce something related to Classic
---
From that, everyone wishes and wants a million of things:
---
\- they **have** to announce the beta date too, otherwise what's the point?
---
\- but they could very well announce the Classic release date with that, right?
---
\- oh wait, they will actually not announce the beta date, not release a beta and release the actual game instead, despite all the rumors that were pointing to a late summer release, why would it even matter it's not even summer, they must release it now
---
I know that it is factually correct. The thing I am not so sure about is people who do not realise how good HoJ is for warrs, getting marked as ninjas and not being accepted to raids.
---
I mean I will not accept a hunter who says he will roll on HoJ to any of my dungeons, because he doesn't know what he is doing myself.
---
Except the minor youtuber has around 1.5k viewers on twitch every day, streaming his face and talking about Classic.
---
If that were the case it makes me more nervous about the state of the entire game if they can't Grant access to the full thing yet. Which in turns makes me skeptical of a soon tm release date.
---
I just explained it if you could read.... they prey on preteen kids and target them with gambling videos.
---
I don’t know about the wow steamers, but some of the CS:GO streams are pure trash. They are paid to advertise gambling websites that are rigged, there have been cases where there are 12 year old gambling addicts. That’s why people are vocal about them.

Never got to 60 during vanilla. My main (human warlock) was 47 when tbc dropped. Never the less, as I thought you needed to be level 60 to go to outland I dinged 60 in eastern plaguelands.

I played a mage on nost! World pvp was everything to me on that server. Sooo many people everywhere. The whole world was a battleground. Good times! I think this time I may go Hunter just for the convenience of being able to grind money and mats with ease. Don't have the spare time like I used to!
---
&gt;Tera Patrick released a new video and something has come up, gotta go
---
Yeah man well although you’re a traitor I would do the same, playing with friends is worth switching factions for, it will be worth it!
---
For the popular realms i can imagine that but that's hardly a hinderance like server instability, lag or rollbacks.
---
Holy crap I was looking at this page literally less than a day ago. It was actually one of the top search results when you searched "Classic WoW" and I was annoyed that it had moved up above the US Wow classic forum.
---
The hype is real.
---
&gt; private server weirdos 
---
this man will get to 10 in elwynn and stop playing lol. If you're expecting some utopia community in Classic, you're going to be disappointed
---
I was hoping by asking the question we could figure out how most people would think about it. I mentioned joining Mannoroth in another comment but I think I'll just pick the first (alphabetic) pvp server in the time zone I want to play.
---
Why would assume that? Pretty sure they where poking at it long before Blizzcon last year.
---
That's the point! Not based on current content - just the engine. Set your draw distance to 1 and see how much fps you get at 4k. Set everything in current wow to minimum/low settings, you might already achieve 60+ fps at 4k. Classic will run in current engine, but will have assets way, way lower than anything on low in the current game (models have just a fraction of the polygons, textures were tiny, shadows were really really low resolution) and most of all, the draw distance was just a fraction of what the draw distance **on 1** is on live.
---
Ganked in STV on my practice Druid run -&gt; turn on Mordhau
---
League of explorers for hearthstone would like a word with you.
---
Hes also dumb as fuck
---
New ! Maybe even new faction :D
---
I tend to recreate my old chars. Maybe different races. My main was a tauren warrior and I guess it could be a troll in it's next reincarnation... (troll with horns maybe? :-) )
---
 /clap
---
Let's treat classic wow like every other blizzard game! Closed beta that never fully opens with an August/ September release.
---
Then let's include wow streamers in on our announcement of a beta date to a game people have played for years... we'll get huge numbers for the announcement of a beta date that everyone won't get into. 
---
Sounds good!
---
Well I've changed my mind about 5 times now, but I'm currently leaning toward recreating my main.
---
I'll decide during the beta, or if I don't get invited/there is no beta, I'll decide for sure roughly 5 minutes before launch.
---
Recreating the Orc shaman I played in the EU Final beta. (Was originally a Night elf Rogue in Vanilla) :D
---
Maybe he legitimately doesn't know who this is?
---
I don't either.
---
Expectation (original) vs reality (this)
---
Visitors to my house, staying with me
---
Recreating my main. I loved tanking. The real tanking of old, pre-Cata, pre-WotLK even.
---
I’m a new player but I will be meeting up with a friend of mine who played back in the day, So while I will be going in blind I’ll probably be getting help from him and his guild while I level.
---
So instead you're just dissapointed by default. Amazing!
---
Main. I had to stop playing in vanilla after 1-2 months after launch and when i came back AQ was almost released so i missed completely the preraid-&gt;MC-&gt;BWL server dynamic. I tried again to go for it on Nost (PVE) but it was shut down before BWL. Im super excited that i can try again now officially.
---
And yet he, along with other dumb fucks have more info then you.
---
Gj.
---
Hey man, not to be rude but this isn't really theory crafting... You're just kind of talking out your ass and throwing in a few numbers.
---
All optimized builds have been actually theory crafted and simmed for years. There's honestly no "mystery" anymore and any variation you come up with is just inefficient.
---
I'm curious to see how the classic world is different from private servers/vanilla world.  Like, on private servers running 1.12, in eastern plaguelands at the chapel, the little blacksmith area is there even though that wasn't added until the Naxx prepatch.  Will classic have that area still in at launch?
---
Meanwhile ive read that exact comment joke at least 30+ times this year alone : &lt;
---
Met my current GF (of 12 years) in TBC. We used to live rather far away from each other, but made it work till she got accepted to Uni rather close to me. We moved in together after a couple of years. We plan on playing Classic together :).
---
It's because of the self-promotion and how these streamers are tripping over themselves to tell us how excited we're gonna be that they get to play classic wow. Golly gee I gotta multitask during Game of Thrones, Tips is playing the beta!!!!! How can I watch two things at once!!!!
---
There's a reason people are getting annoyed at Tips, Towliee and Staysafe during this 'hype period' and not other streamers who are keeping their mouth shut (Esfand, Asmongold, etc.) If Esfand told me I should take a sick day to watch him play classic I'd laugh at him too.
---
I dont understand this. Should there always be a disclaimer on each BIS item list that some can be needed by several classes, and that some classes have priority? If someone cant find out those on their own, well shit happens. If someone were to make their own research on their own BIS list without any streamers, there wont be any disclaimers either. People are stupid but theyre not mindless amebas just taking everything for granted without any hesitation.
---
They don't have anything to do with the old client. Wow Classic will run in the current, modern client, with BfA engine, 64bit, DirectX 12.
---
Mech suit from Legion. Things got a bit Sci Fi when we went to finish off the Demons.
---
I was a Forsaken warlock with a beehive hairdo. She was lots of fun leveling and exploring, but I was terrible at dps, never got the hang of it, and sadly still have the bad feels associated with her and that failure. My guild was on a small RP server and were nice enough to bring me along in runs when they had a spot. 
---
So I will be re rolling and wish me luck with my new character!
---
A few people. Unfortunately two of them are dead and the other I haven't spoken to in 5 years. Just drifted apart when we both stopped playing the game. When I look back I suppose it was really the only thing we had in common/kept us talking... and there was other stuff, but it was long ago and I wish them well.
---
My guess is they were probably invited to the friends &amp; family alpha or something, so they've been playing classic for a while now and today they'll reveal this.
---
But that’s stranglethorn.
---
Honestly if Im paying $15 a month for Classic and it drops at the same time as 8.2 I might actually go back and try out retail too. I'm paying for it so I might as well use it.
---
Thats a lot of luck. Gj mate
---
No shame in using a random number generator to pick 5 mins before launch, I might have to do it too 😂
---
Imagine literally shitting yourself on purpose twice and achieving nothing but a loss of dignity.
---
As in: random people on the internet talk out their ass and state things they only wish or dream of, as if they were facts. Awesome.
---
Not sure yet. Most of me wants to roll a Druid, which I've never mained before. However, I won't play cow girls so that would mean rolling Alliance which I've also never done.
---
Its a tough choice for me. I keep going back and forth on it.
---
Thanks, I love it.
---
Sorry to hear that man. Why dont you use that vanillafriends site to find them?
---
New for me. I played Rogue and really don't want to do that again. I am considering trying the Horde out, but man I really hate not knowing where to go. Last time I tried Horde in WoTLK people weren't too keen to answer questions so I went back to Alliance.
---
!remindme 2 days
---
is spellsteal an exploit though?
---
im going horde EU. So my best bet is to find the most popular alliance EU streamer and play that server as i will have lots of fan boys to slaughter then :)
---
UD warlock in classic super hyped, first char ever was a lock, got it to level 6 on my cousins account. Once I finally created my own account I rolled a pally, took me ages to get level 67 right before WotLK came out. I’m eager to play vanilla now that I’m older and understand game mechanics 100 fold.
---
Well you tell me how to do it and not be homeless, and I'll start listening.
---
Until then, I'm sick of people thinking that Im ignorant because Im stuck.
---
i would be pretty mad
---
15s
---
I am going to have my main NE feral druid and probably level up a pally/priest/warrior on the side. I have not made up my mind about the alt haha.
---
No answering machine/voicemail.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/SteamyLovelyOwlPeanutButterJellyTime
---
A wealth of information...
---
anything that isnt in your main rotation
---
Gonna play Tauren Shaman like my very first character, maybe even with the very same name, since the original has been server- name- race and faction changed to shit haha. 
---
Slightly sad that it will look like the slowest thing ever, having to watch this massive cow roam around the world on hoof, always thought Undead Shaman would have been supercool to create in vanilla, but definitely looking forward to seeing the beautiful resto Shaman gear on great display again.
---
Because people don't have much shineys to focus on, so they spend a lot of time on the content available. Volume is a kind of intensity, so when most people find the streamers a little annoying, it looks like the sub as a whole has a lot of intense hatred for them. That's kind of the nature of having a big sub at all.
---
Out of the 80k subscribers, there's maybe 10 insane people who really hate YouTube creators, and in top of those there's a couple thousand people who find them mildly annoying and haven't got better things to focus on. . That adds up to looking like a lot of hatred, but it really isn't.
---
As to why we dislike them, tips out for instance has a lot of content that's just reading blue posts without adding anything interesting to it. I don't think that content is good, and I get mildly annoyed when I get baited into clicking on it.
---
I've checked there and didn't find anything...thought briefly about posting, but I think by now we've both moved on from one another. Talking again would just be awkward.
---
Ever Legion/BFA have both had smooth launches. Aside from queue times which isn’t a server issue and it still means people are in the server experiencing day 1.
---
I’m hoping classic has a similar launch
---
you have a wonderful girl.  
---
I plan to start playing WoW with a wife, but I'm afraid I’ll finish it without my wife.
---
 Joke.  I will not finish.
---
First time I ever walked into Stormwind I died almost immediately from Teremus. My computer was so bad I never even saw what killed me, just the trade chat exploding clued me in. I was so confused and enthralled. I assumed dragon raids were a thing that happened often in major cities.
---
It's pretty sad that this guy cares more about Classic than he does his health. He must be very depressed.
---
Rolling alliance? I’d rather be a cow girl 😁
---
pls dont scare me. i would be fucking mad if they does it. i am pretty flexible with my vacation, but just taking 2 weeks of the next day, is a bit hard.
---
Don't listen to the people that say you shouldn't. Give a go! But if you end up feeling too lost to the point where it's not fun anymore I'd look up a guide. As long as you're having fun you should experience it fresh I think. 
---
More fun to be amazed and completely immersed if you don't know where you're going to end up. Classic is about the Journey, and not the destination after all.
---
New main! New faction, new class. I am going from a Human Warrior to an Undead Mage.
---
I feel like this will allow me to finally “complete” the game. /s
---
Lel
---
I also have zero idea who Hotted is.
---
How isn't it theory crafting? I'm exploring options and there's no harm in that. The numbers are math based off spell damage coefficients, cast times and fight length. People thought they had everything figured out back in the day too and then look what happened with wolfshead helm and power shifting for ferals, or dual wield fury warrior tanking.
---
The math shows a relatively small overall DPS loss on short fights, that could potentially be offset by higher net damage on longer fights where mana is an issue. 
---
Where are the optimised balance druid dps simulations posted? I've yet to find one. Not trying to be sarcy, i'm genuinely interested in reading them.
---
Continues to talk to his chat and say "I'm just saying these are things people will bitch about"
---
But hey keep being a moron!
---
You’re a monster
---
From Human Warlock to Orc Warrior :D
---
Totaly new experience
---
edit: Both females obv !
---
I've been playing on the vintage 1.12 client at 280-320 fps on a 1440p ultrawide in OG, 8700k clocked at 4.7, 1080ti.
---
Just built a budget wow pc for my gf, i3 8350k@5.0, vega 64, easy 4k@60hz. Vanilla was single thread "optimized" and I believe even the current client doesn't really utilize more than 1-2 cores, so just get some recent cpu with high clocks and some midtier gpu. 
---
Classic is supposed to run even better than 1.12.
---
A release date. I Just want to know precisely when the actual game is coming out so I can plan ahead and avoid the flood gates by logging into the game a couple of days after it comes out.
---
Beta is good and all but I have no major interest in it because there's nothing new that I'm interested in testing for myself. I just want to sink time into the actual game with characters that will be sticking around.
---
Streamers can broadcast their hearts out for all I care if they have a beta or some footage, but I won't be paying attention to anything unless it's from blizzard directly.
---
That is exactly what will happen. If you've been on the internet in the past year, you'd seen the entire press putting headlines about WoW Classic - actually about every official annoncement related to Classic. Every company will obviously see the PR potential and invest anything they can in the marketing, so the headlines will continue. The game is not even just like every other 'remastered' game (which, mind you, every other remaster goes big on hype and media attention), because WoW was a global phenomenon, something unheard of, before it. This is not the "Tomb Raider 3 remastered".
---
Streamers could have already signed a NDA weeks ago, they just can't talk about it yet. Streamers and youtubers are the inflluencers, ofcourse every company will give them products so they can present them to their followers, that's how the industry works, this is how most of the consumers consume digital products in the modern age. You somehow act as if you discovered the internet today and are surprised.
---
Post it, man! Are you going to play alone if none of your friends are playing rn?
---
Oh my bad forgot that children like you don't research let alone think before they speak.
---
"When it's released it'll release"
---
WOW GM CONFIRMS CLASSIC BETA.... RELEASE SOON? URGENT CLASSIC WOW NEWS 
---
- 25 minutes long. Thumbnail is an annoying, huge text with the Classic icon and Blizzard logo
---
&gt; Watch you tell me a release date?
---
in exactly 10:01 mins
---
Gave me the good old lol
---
How does one get beta? Do you have to be randomly picked? Do you have to have a subscription _before_ beta release? Or can we hold off until it's released to start up our sub again
---
Was in a shitposting kinda guild and got friendly with one of the guys since we were pretty similar, turned out we were the same age and lived really near each other.
---
We were both at uni at the time so it took us years to meet up but when we finally did we got so shitfaced we tried to go to the airport and catch a flight somewhere, obviously that didn’t happen but I woke up on the train at the airport covered in my own piss and my phone and bank card were missing. He got so drunk he ended up going back to his mum’s house by accident, realising where he was and then walking miles across London to get back to his flat.
---
Using spellsteal to gain buff that gives you basically godmode is what was an exploit. Technically it didn't involve anything but using your abilities normally. Just like the paladin who soloed Kazzak (40-man world boss when it was current). It is completely wrong to compare that to normal undermanning.
---
You're telling me lol. I like Night Elves, but humans/gnomes/dwarves are all in the same boat as Tauren are for me; just not playable. Horde have three good races for me at least.
---
If this was Burning crusade at least I could lean on Draenei for alts ):
---
As the other commenter said, your heals will be quite effective. You'll be maybe about 10% less strong as compared to a full resto spec, but that isn't much in PvP especially when you're spamming heals. Also, since you can dish out really good damage as a hybrid, you'll likely be ending fights before you really need to start spamming heals. It's easy to out-heal the damage from a dead enemy.
---
In PvP, Shaman are definitely more dynamic than priests. The strength of priests is that they are really versatile healers, but that mostly comes into play during PvE content when you're constantly making decisions about how to heal whom and when. But even if you went with some kind of shadow hybrid, the priest toolset - while strong - isn't as deep as that for shaman. 
---
Sounds like you'll dig shaman more. Note that you'd likely need to switch to a full resto build if you want to raid, but the elemental hybrid is really strong for PvP.
---
How often do you fuck each other
---
My main was (and still is) an undead mage, which I will be recreating. The only thing I'll change are his professions: used to be herbalism/alchemy, I'll go tailoring/skinning this time.
---
I've thought about switching races, class or even faction... but it just feels wrong. Infinite food/water and portals it is!
---
You will surely evolve in some nice neckbeards, awesome story lel
---
Release date. Beta is cool for games that I've never played before but like a lot of us, I already have hundreds/thousands of hours in Classic.
---
You should check at Jaoana's leveling guide if you decide to roll Horde. Its super detailed, and probably the best guide out there. 
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
Ah yes, the signature backstabing motion of Stranglethorn Vale
---
I logged in and the number of huge, ridiculous mounts all around the AH was just stupid and distracting. Half of them have clickable shit on them. WTF is this madness?
---
That's the plan. Just going to let it be as natural as it was then. The friends and guild will come along eventually.
---
lol this :D
---
lol. just completely not relevant :D
---
very doubtful since i dont think that the game has aged well into the modern era.  that being said, i could probably be coerced into playing vanilla
---
&gt; single sheep, frost nova or root will make the both of you sitting ducks when your or your warrior friend's trinket is on its 5 minute CD. 
---
Sheep, perhaps, but frost nova and root don't prevent you from casting.
---
My wife and I met on wow three days before BC launched. Been married 10 years now.
---
When Classic was announced Toweliee said the launch will be around 2020. He was close enough lol.
---
Incorrect, they don't have a product to sell. They only require a subscription. 
---
People think this is such a grand scale operation and it isn't. 
---
If they had people sign NDAs to not say anything about an announcement that does nothing but give a beta release date... then you are telling me the release will be pushed to Fall.
---
Media attention - if we see a "TV spot" about classic I'll be absolutely floored.
---
Classic will be big but not some multi billion dollar steam like they were used to.
---
I remember seeing stacks of the stuff at QuakeCon 2008 in a 1UP video, shit was all over there I guess
---
"About to dive in and drain these Bawls"
---
RIP in peace
---
It makes them feel good that they know things about stuff.
---
I originally played a troll hunter back in vanilla. Been playing overwatch for the last few years and basically got forced into a flex healer/tank and occasional DPS on my main (3800-3900 SR). So this is my opportunity to DPS without guilt lol. Going undead warlock for a combination of reasons. One of the best leveling classes, great at PvP*, free mount at 40, awesome looking gear, don't need multiple different sets of gear for different specs, versatile play style with different pets. Good at almost everything
---
Abolish Disease can be usefull. Mana Burn can be great on PVP server.
---
the others seems ok :)
---
Tanking in classic has a rotation? U r kidding right?
---
this made me laugh. i wish they would do that :D
---
It can be a little tricky, but I wouldn't prevent your preferred class choice over it. If you're Horde, you'll still have Shamans and Shadow Priests who will happily DPS in dungeons that can cover that.
---
I will pretty much recreate my main. I don't think it's out of nostalgia but simply because I enjoyed it so much and being a warrior puts me in a position where I am the best tank as well as a top DPS class.
---
Are you going to play on a EU server?
---
Yeah because who needs healing spells right? /s
---
The extra mana isn't worth gimping yourself for the duration of the fight. Also, what 3 pieces of T2 would you be using and what would you be sacrificing by not having something else with better stats? It's not just the spell damage - Balance needs as much spell +hit as they can get, as much as 16% on boss fights. So if you are swapping out pieces with spell hit for a little bit of mana regen, you are just gimping yourself.
---
Consumes, scrolls, dark runes, innervate, etc. There are a lot of ways you can (and should) buff yourself if you want peak performance (mana) as a Boomkin.
---
 [https://discord.gg/sS9YteB](https://discord.gg/sS9YteB)    
---
&gt;\ I have no idea how many fights will be lasting more than 3 minutes in classic though.   
---
It all depends on how good your guilds dps is and if you are threat capped some can reach +6min. I'd advice downranking for the parts where dps is not as important (phase 2 nef) or 90-50% on chromaggus for those fights if you are dpsing and not removing poison and such. 
---
For the people that say that every combination has been tested there was a time not too long ago when feral druids was complete trash in many minds, while ferals might have been used consistently whatever the "general knowledge" knew about their potential or not shutting him down for trying things out and reaching out for help is just sad to see.
---
Isn´t that any WoW nerds dream? :P
---
Glad it worked out for you! But how shouldn´t it in the City of love? :D
---
What happens if nobody reserved an item and that said item drops ?
---
Prayer of healing can definitely be skipped. A lot of people under value mind soothe as well. Can be quite handy at times
---
And if they actually put work into it that'd be fine. But if you're literally just reading a blue post, do you really think that it'd be unfair if they didn't get ads for that?
---
Seems simple, nice catch boi
---
Nah, I'm NA(lul.) I tried playing EU for a bit in BC but the latency was just too unbearable for me. I don't know how the aussies put up with it pre-Oceania servers.
---
Don't forget the surprised [Soylent Grin](https://external-preview.redd.it/baejvhoPRwgLC7KvMmNLtuVkGGLp5WhQlO_eETsZLB0.jpg?width=994&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a262e520d975dc79e294cf165bf592cef8f0b2ea) he pulls off in the thumbnail.
---
Sad, we could ve played a bit
---
Why would you not get holy fire? When you can first get the spell it is the hardest hitting ability you have, but it is slow. So you open with holy fire so you have another dot on the target while it’s running to you.
---
It's happening!!
---
Because streamers are intentionally encouraging the perception that there will be a beta or a monumental announcement, and if it's just some more tedious video content then they can get fucked.
---
My current gf and I met in vanilla - 11 years together. I moved to her country, changed carreer and had a kid. We have a lot to thank the game for.
---
when a big shot streamer and their army of fanboys ruin your realm, it's gonna be hard to ignore.
---
You’d very rarely cast prayer of healing until the big boy dungeons around 60 so maybe skip it until after you’ve got your 40 mount
---
Worst hype build up ever all this news of no release tomorrow and release tomorrow, going to lose my mind.
---
But if it's a solid shit they'll know - gotta load up on laxatives first.
---
Wow nice
---
the wow feed on youtube is now such a cesspit, it's ironically generating stuff like this: https://youtu.be/85XTgKhGBpY
---
What's wrong with self promotion? They are trying to be full time streamers for classic, they need people to watch. They are hyping up people because they obviously have an announcement today. Seems logical to me. 
---
Like why do *you* care if *somebody else* is getting hyped?
---
Look up Skarm Tank, he has good stuff, even if you're not tanking.
---

Time to make a 10 minute video about it reading the blue text.
---
Then they should make content worth 10 mins, not 2 mins and then 8 mins of filler. They just repeat info from their previous videos, insert baseless speculation and/or fear mongering, do "fan shoutouts", stretch out intros, plug other vids, etc. until they have 10 mins of content.
---
Sure, they're doing it so they can get paid, but that doesn't mean that their 10 min stretched out low effort content isn't garbage from a consumer's perspective. It's just not good, regardless of their reasoning for doing it.
---
Thats a confident guy right there. Gj man
---
It will be great to go back and do it better than we did as kids!
---
New main for me. Never made a Pally in Vanilla so will be playing that.
---
Just no spoilers for season 8 yet, some of us are behind on being disapointed and depressed.
---
Met one of my good gaming buddies in WoW 14 years ago.
---
We still play games almost daily together and I meet him in his home town once a year for a beer.
---
I dont think the NDA was for content within the game. It was more about beta/release dates.
---
Okay, so because some streamers who stream other games are shit, they're all shit?
---
Nice generalizations.
---
Good lord
---
So true, that’s how I feel. Back then I was only 10 years old and spent all my exploring and messing around. It’ll be nice to see all the game has to offer!
---
So why are you preemptively having a rage aneurysm? All the signs point to an actual announcement today. Why wouldn't you save the hate for if it's a total disappointment.
---
Just seems so silly to be so fucking mad because somebody else got to be involved in something cool.
---
u can buy it directly off their website w/ free shipping!
---
And it doesn't help that his mic setup is absolutely horrible..
---
This is amazing
---
Trying to decide to between recreating main (UD priest) or a new experience (Troll Shaman). My 1-20 test run for the Shaman, currently at 11, has me leaning priest.
---
Best 10-20 zone.
---
Are we expecting beta tomorrow?  Or release?  Or just a release date?
---
Well, classic is coming out soon so it doesn't really matter anymore, right?
---
If they want to keep driving retail into the ground, let them, I just hope they do right by the Classic crowd.
---
Thanks, will get rank 1 then.
---
They implemented vanilla spell batching.
---
What u going to roll in classic with yo boy?
---
It's an intended gameplay function, if the thing is possible to steal, and you do, then what is the problem. Exploit is if it's not possible to steal ...
---
Intention counts for shit
---
This, even if going a shadow build you will still rely on 5 points in imp wand until you really start moving into the talents at levels 30+ where you transition from wands to more perma casting.
---
Not really. IF its OPEN beta, you might be able to see sharding, but other than that, what do you expect to get out of it ? Only people that care about the beta are "content creators". Excuse to do 5 more videos.
---
Westfall Chicken hype.
---
I like playing games while having stream on the background. And many games are not enjoyable to play but enjoyable to watch. I fucking hate dota 2 after dropping the game ~4 years ago but it's fun to watch certain streamers playing it.
---
You’re referring to non-combat pets and yes they’re in vanilla but they take up an inventory slot
---
I wouldn't pass Mind Soother, Holy Fire, Abolish Disease and if you're on a PvP server I would also take Shadow Protection and Mana Burn, Mind Vision if I plan on ganking
---
The word you are looking for are companions and yes.
---
Yes there are several. cats, snakes, roaches and all that stuff. You can buy some in the cities
---
&gt; So why are you preemptively having a rage aneurysm?
---
I didn't actually experience a major health crisis, it was a hyperbolic remark made for comic effect.
---
I'm not actually mad about twitch streamers, these are simply Jokes Online.
---
No. Just do the google search as I mentioned in my post. Or take a look at the comments below, there's a comment with the cached Page.
---
I'd rather see a beta, and preferably get to participate in it. Knowing the release date isn't going to make it happen quicker, but opening a beta means I get to enjoy the game a little before it releases.
---
Yes, there were. Clockwork squirrels, cockroaches, dragonling whelps, etc. all existed in vanilla. Pretty sure there was also a murlock pet for getting the collectors edition or going to the first blizzcon or something.
---
Yes, there were noncombat pets. Some could be bought from vendors (cockroaches, snakes, cats, etc.) and some like whelplings or Disgusting Oozling were very rare drops from specific mobs. Nowhere near as many as there are in retail, and you had to keep the item to summon &amp; dismiss the pet in your bag.
---
That was funny lol
---
Yes, quite a few. Just some examples:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4401/mechanical-squirrel-box
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/junk-items/name:carrier
---
...and many more.
---
Would be pretty stupid. There are not enough streamers to test anything. I expect closed beta for a lot of randomly selected people. As to release date, it's more obvious with each day that it's July, 16. Two months is more than enough for beta testing.
---
Sheep 100%, this is not a 'perhaps' moment.  
---
I believe you don't realize that this is about Shaman supporting a Warrior and when the Warrior gets screwed over by a magic effect the Shaman is going to get obliterated by their opponents.
---
Forgive me, I'm actually still newish to WoW. Played for like 6 months, 10 years ago at the end of Lich King beginning of Cataclysm and havent really returned. Recently I jumped back on to try the trial and fiddle with some classes to level 20, see what I like because I am actually really interested in getting into Classic. Apparently theres possible big news comin?
---
ITT: OP furiously defending his favorite streamer
---
someone who actually plays wow
---
I'll definitely get Mana Burn once I have lvl40 mount, I'll be playing on a PVP server but not expecting there to be much 1v1 same-level PVP while levelling. On the PServer I'm playing on the only PVP outside BGs is getting camped by lvl60s, being attacked 2v1/3v1 or being jumped by rogues at least 3 levels higher than you.
---
I'm rolling the same class as my Vanilla main but on the other faction this time.
---
Fuck the beta
---
ahh thank you!
---
He said he was going to put the 5 points into wand in the start of post
---
I love tauren, one of my favorite allies to have in dungeons and raids, their lore, their personality. However, I really don’t like playing them for that reason, they fee like there running at half speed!
---
Bruh go to a naughty server
---
It's okay to be a nerd. You can stop pretending to be friends with people you don't like.
---
&gt; possibility of a concrete release date
---
And even if they don't announce a release date at the same time, the beta will tell us kind of how much they have left, which gives us very rough estimates.
---
Can you give me an example? Because we are getting 1.12 which implies the "faults" are as fixed as they're ever going to be. Aside from numbers being tweaked what possible bug or fault can you predict will affect your character significantly and permanently?
---
I get that you aren't actually having an aneurysm, I'm just continuing the hyperbolic senario you set up.
---
Forgive me if you are just joking, but there seems to be alot of really legitimate rage being thrown at streamers lately. I think people are generally going to take you seriously unless you make it clear you are joking.
---
They are dragging this out for no perceivable reason. Why not go straight into closed testing if it needs to be tested?
---
Just teasing, marketing bullshit.
---
Blood and thunder buddy, welcome to the horde :)
---
Yes, but you are 100% correct in using holy fire as the opener dropping SW:P then wanding.  This will be the basic 1 mob pull from lvl 1-30+ mind flay is not mana&gt;dps efficient and the only other optional thing is using mind blast on CD or not depending on your mana situation.
---
Because it comes across as fake. Asmongold and Esfand are cool (others may disagree) because they don't walk around dropping hints about this COOL INFO they have. Tips logs into twitch, and oops guys dropped this sick leak about BETA! Oh man my bad, totally didn't mean to do that on purpose! He makes videos like BETA CONFIRMED as clickbait when obviously that isn't true. He doesn't appear genuine and this entire bullshit around him thinking other people are gonna be hype for him getting into a beta is laughable.
---
Tips comes across as someone who cares more about the ad revenue and his own 'streamer career' than the actual fans of Classic or the game itself. It's a massive turn-off.
---
Isn't spell queuing confirmed to be in?
---
Some companions were really rare, such as Disgusting Oozling. People would spend days/weeks trying to get them. They would sometimes be availible on the AH, however they were not cheap. So when someone had one it was quite impressive.
---
Because they are making a mutant vanilla client out of the modern game client and it may look terrible in the unfinished state with a bunch of people led by hating content creators jumping on bandwagon of the doomed classic. ruining the hype for the game?
---
Nothing wrong with that, mages are great! Also you can’t go wrong with undead they are amazing.
---
My brother and I loved this back in the day! Thanks for the reminder!
---
It would be interesting to see the actual numbers on the mana regen, and how long you can fight before you run out of mana. On short fights, you can switch gear and go all spellpower.
---
There could be other reasons for a level cap. For one thing, it helps focus the testing. For another, it helps keep people from getting burned out and left with nothing to do when the real thing releases.
---
Another possibility is that the level cap is temporary and will be lifted later on during the beta, as a compromise for temporary benefits like the above.
---
Why watch sports when you can play it? Cause its entertaining.
---
I will make fun of you either way.
---
Recreating my good ol' undead female mage. Same name, same look.  
---
Also recreating alts. Warrior, priest, rogue, hunter, druid.
---
I might actually even get a lock and a shaman to 60 this time around.
---
You can always ask people in general chat for minor things such as a herb trainer or weapons master.  This would keep you from spoiling too much of the game and also you can interact with the the community.
---
a closed beta for 20 people?
---
They said teach them how, not tell them how.  Now you have to get to work showing them how to start a business.
---
Agreed. Every vanilla video at this point is the same washed up shit. People are trying to cash cow this hype train.
---
Are you getting the early self made wand? If not you’re going to need higher ranks of smite. Keep in mind that once you have cookies stirring rod money doesn’t become a huge issue, because you can go get small flame sacs and sell them for over 1 gold each later on. People will already be trying to buy them out once the hunters hit around level 50. So money really isn’t a problem once you get that wand.
---
A blue quality pattern that makes a green #feelsbadman
---
&gt; Items that did get a soft reservation are on roll on based on main spec &gt; PvP &gt; offspec priority.
---
Mining+engineering also because:
---
A) Grenades are great for lvling.
---
B) You'll need engineering anyways at 60 because its mandatory for all roles.
---
Yeh, wow content creators just steal content, pad videos or just insert false information so they can monetise it in YouTube, click bait viewers etc. Truely gentlemen of the modern era.
---
:'D
---
Overwatch meta is cancer! 3 tanks 3 healers is so boring imo. It’ll be nice to play a game where dps does more dps 😂
---
Really don't get the hate for season 8. Still epic as fuck
---
This guy here about to be spamming barrens general chat asking where mankriks wife is.
---
They haven't ever done a media only beta, no? Overwatch was memed as being streamers/youtubers only but many non-content creators were invited and participated.
---
&gt;	Based on earnings reports,
---
One of retails biggest flaws. Nothing is boring
---
Very nice! On a similar note, a buddy and I (both hunters) kited Borelgore from EPL to Ironforge around that time. Its AOE attack was very efficient at exploding curious lowbies along the way.
---
Thanks for sharing, all my friends have quit shortly after getting 60. These are people who actually played the game instead of overhyping and claiming how they will play it, so I feel once people actually play the game there is very different tone.
---
People have mentioned Prayer of Healing. You also don't need Fade or your highest ranks of other heals unless you plan to do dungeons (skip all new healing ranks except Renew and PWS from 30 till you get your mount if you don't plan to do dungeons in your 30s). You should also probably train Smite till you get rank 3 Mind Flay at level 36 because Mind Flay is just not that good early on. Holy Fire is also really good so you should not skip it till you get Shadow Form. I also usually start skipping fort in mid 20s because it is really not that useful. The only thing it does is give you some extra HP which is just a safety net which very rarely proves useful.
---
There will be a lot of same level PVP while leveling. Since everyone will be starting fresh there will be lots of opportunity for same level PVP once you hit the neutral zones.
---
Idk I felt like the monkeynews interview was pretty good. I think tips more so sets the tone for the interview and wants the interviewee to answer all the questions, so he restates his questions, and clarifies information for viewers. He is trying to tailor stuff for viewers and respect the interviewee by letting him fully answer everything rather than have himself chime in. 
---
I don’t like streamers but my take on tipsout is he tries to make it easy to follow so he may come off as a fruit cup sometimes, but it’s for an easier understanding of his audience. He’s also not that bad to watch generally when he’s just streaming. Seems like a solid guy and not looking like absolute ass such as staysafe and esfand. Those two ppl r gross.
---
The day Michael Clark Duncan died I made the biggest Tauren death knight I could and named him Mikecduncan. Had to walk around Org for almost an hour before someone was like “HOLEEFUCKINSHITDUDE YOU ASSHOLE!!!!”
---
Nah. All I'm saying is its good to have lower expectations and be pleasantly surprised.
---
Wasn't really anything else to do she is wonderful :)
---
Easier to list the spells you should get. You're pretty close, but missing a few; like renew, fade, and flash heal.
---
The ones you should pick up are:
---
**Disc:** 
---
PW: Fortitude
---
PW: Shield
---
Inner Fire 
---
Dispel Magic
---
**Holy**:
---
Lesser/Greater/Heal
---
Cure Disease
---
**Shadow:**
---
SW: Pain
---
Psychic Scream
---
Mind Blast
---
Along with any skills that you get from talents, like mind flay and silence. If you plan on off-healing dungeons, you can splurge on the extra healing abilities; namely fade.
---
Fuck me, Cata released nearly 10 years ago. :(
---
At the highest pro level that is absolutely the meta but I rarely see 3-3 at all in my ranked games. I see more 2-2-2 or 3dps-2healer-1 tank
---
I was commenting in the context of a elemental hybrid build, which is what the OP was asking about. If the shaman is sitting back doing nothing but heals while hoping the warrior kills the enemies, then a priest would be better. But the OP is considering a shaman. If a mage catches both of them in a frost nova or if they get rooted, then the shaman can still toss out some really strong lightning bolts / chain lightning which is likely to end a fight.
---
For me I think a lot of the allure comes from having the same experience except through different, hopefully more mature eyes.  On my warlock I never even had engineering and I think it was the same for most people in the games we played, though there were a few exceptions.  I also never used a single FAP or LIP and had keybinds like 9 and semicolon for real abilities I used during combat.  So I want an opportunity to go back and do it right this time.  Maybe you do too!  Although I don't think you have quite so many things to correct as I do

He won't. His game is nearly dead and Classic is hyped to shit, he's going to follow the money.
---
I am going to be honest here: I do not get the soy part. What is that about?
---
I know the comment was a joke, but no employer in NA or the EU would force someone with diarrhea to work in 100 degree weather, thats a massive liability because of dehydration.
---
Who the fuck are these people? Just give me a release date.
---
Yes sir. The hype is real
---
I have seen so many people tell similar stories of these epic experiences of seeing a huge boss monster lay siege to a city. My impression is people's fond memories of it far outweigh their negative memories of dying or not being able to use the NPCs they needed.
---
I think since it was a part of vanilla it should be in there, but it was seemingly also fixed in 1.12 so if they give us 1.12, it could be that kiting is not possible.
---
&gt; People are stupid but theyre not mindless amebas just taking everything for granted without any hesitation.
---
You and I have met different people in our pasts as it seems. This community is full of exactly this mindset right now. With Classic it will go away as people will realise that half the shit in the YouTube tutorials is false though.
---
Back to the question at hand - if you make your BiS list, need on a HoJ as hunter, and get ostracized as a result, that is fine. You fucked up, you bore the consequences.
---
Now if you are a new player, who doesn't really understand raiding and items, and just want to get started - you will watch a bis video, and then go farming the items. Suppose a HoJ drops, 4 hours after you saw the video - you will be all happy, need, win and never get into a raid with a guild or two, because the people in the dugeon will see you as either a ninja or a stupid person and spread the word.
---
Now, have you fucked up? Yes, but admittedly, a lot of the blame is also on the video, which told you to Need on HoJ.
---
If we are in a group with people who do not need HoJ or all have it already? Go for it mate, it's BiS for a month for you. If there are people which will use this in 15 months and you win it? I will ask you why you did it, then blacklist you and kick you, because that's ultimately a big dick move.
---
EDIT: Same goes for Blackcrow needs from warrs and rogues, over a hunter. Exactly same - win a Blackcrow over a hunter, I won't tank for you.
---
Mind Vision isn't as useful until rank 2 because of the range restriction, I think skipping that one until R2 is completely fine.
---
I grinded that ducking welpling in the wetlands so long bad never got it
---
Not media only beta but I recall streamers and media recieving beta invites in the first wave. And after some time, some more ppl got it but the media folks were first to play it for a while.
---
lasian made this spec shine in breakthrough
---
u use a shitton of mana - darkrunes and mana potion are a must - also convincing your healing officer that u should keep your innervate for yourself
---
if u are on horde being in totem group rotation would make you  even stronger
---
u want to get songflower and all possible worldbuffs because the spec gets stronger with crit chance
---
its far from meme spec - properly executed this is the spec that shits on other healers and gives paladin a run for its money as top healer
---
it requires knowledge of the fight - as in how long the fight lasts and how many casts you can maintain - if u finish the fight and u are not close to oom than u were using wrong rank of regrowth
---
u can still use ht but your goal should be regrowths
---
this is not an easy spec where you just spam r4 healing touch - you need to know the fight duration and your mana efficiency
---
i wouldn't use this as a 5 man healer
---
IBS is a hell of a drug.
---
I just can't take the amount he stutters. Literally can't watch him just because it's so frustrating to listen to.
---
Tips is just as boring and dry as it gets. Just your happygolucky "i'm more concerned about making it than anything else"
---
Wish we could switch places.. All my mates want us to play horde. I kind of want to revive my dwarf hunter.. I might just say fuck it and roll alliance on my own. Who needs friends?
---
Too right. Some people on this sub are acting like they are having breakdowns because they don't have information soon enough about a game. Acting like choosing what type of character you are going to play is like picking between career paths.
---
Haha wow you really were bored
---
I have a theory that a mindbroken /r/classicwow mod made it
---
What do you mean since a week? I feel like that since Blizzcon..
---
Can't even imagine how much people have felt like that for 10+ years xD
---
This issue doesn't affect Classic mechanics, and doesn't affect you at all, and is Blizz-like since they added higher pop servers as Vanilla blew up and money flowed in. 
---
You are so triggered by something that doesn't affect you - why?
---
Well the good thing about vanilla is you could make new friends easily 😁
---
My wife, then i cheated on her and joined the champion's club
---
drop rates might be different
---
From now on we should just link that to anyone who asks what class they should play.
---
Even if I'd have access. What am I gonna do? I know the game. Blizzard knows the game. Everyone knows the game. I'm pretty sure a beta version would be finetuned enough to feel like Classic so even if there would still be bugs/readjustments to make, they would be so minor that you'd have to specifically try and find them.
---
So even if I had access to a Classic beta, I'd probably log in, hype with all my fellow Classic boys and just go on hoping for a release date...
---
xQc was hanging out in a certain PS streamer's chat while the duel tourney was going on a few days ago, there's no coincidence that these rumors are all popping up at the same time.
---
haha right? Lich King is basically 11 years old. I wanted to get into WoW because I got into Arthas' storyline then Cata happened and I just keeping falling behind and couldnt keep up. Classic I feel will be the perfect spot for me to reacquaint myself and give wow another shot. Plus from friends and stuff I hear the current state of WoW is hit or miss.
---
My god you're fucking unstable
---
Keep going with the generalizations and lack of evidence. Love em.
---
I levelled a Human Prot Pala and a Feral Druid (yes, I'm a masochist) and played both up to AQ40 (though by the time we entered BWL I was Holy/Resto), TBC saw me take a Dranei Hunter and Shaman to 70, but my Druid re-spec'd Feral and that remained my main till I quit just before MoP.
---
I'll be rolling a Warrior as a main, haven't decided on NElf or Human yet.
---
I might bring my Druid back (I'll be reserving the name at any rate).
---
I live in hope TBC returns one day and my Pala can be brought back as a Space Goat!
---
Oh right, I forgot, you know people's wishes and desires and regrets better than they do.
---
Lol, fucking moron. You're not people's parents. If players want a high pop server then let them. Sitting there saying "I think you'll regret it so it's a very bad decision" just makes you look like a weird neckbeard desperate to play some kind of parent role.
---
If it doesn't affect you at all, and it's blizz-like to have some servers with higher pop, then you shouldn't be triggered. But you are... you're triggered so hard by this. Why?
---
Main. I just love druid too much. I'll probably make a lock as an alt, that was actually my very first class during OG beta.
---
may I finally got gud when classic drops
---
&gt; to an actual announcement today
---
Everybody talked about Wednesday, why do people in this thread say today?
---
/r/outoftheloop
---
I won't be playing my first character that is for sure. My Vanilla experience was mostly Alliance-PVE and it took me a while to grow up. Will definitely be doing it right this time with Horde-PVP.
---
&gt;  Classic content creators be the ones to reveal alot of things today. 
---
I mean that's fair enough.
---
I just don't agree with you. Remember streamers like Asmon and Esfand gained a following from actually being able to stream games. Tips is trying to build this from scratch without being able to actually stream the game, so trying to build an audience is hard. I totally get it if there are people that just get turned off by it, but it just seems like a really unreasonable hatred when most others would just turn the stream off or stop watching youtube videos and leave it at that.
---
It like the people in your camp aren't content with just saying 'yea we don't like this guy, we are going to watch somthing else'. Ya'll wana try to go out of your way to generate as much hate from others as you can.
---
Probably a lot less scuffed than a beta.
---
Please a fucking release date !! Im gonna fucking scream at work and run around today if its a release date
---
Hellfire peninsula :( started during late TBC. Main rason i am so excited about classic is the fact that i missed it all.
---
I can't but hope I'll be able to craft myself the Truefaith Vestments one day. Maybe... just maybe! Gosh I'm so excited to play Classic!
---
Said no one ever.
---
We are old men yelling at young kids though....
---
Very prominent figure in the WoW scene. I don't watch anything he does but I've known about him since around 2015. In the same circle as Cdew, who is regarded as one of the best PvP players NA, won Blizzcon 2018.
---
You motherfucker.
---
You shouldn't have replied to me because the context I used was Shaman + Warrior vs multiple opponents. Not a 2V1 Mage.  
---
Though a Shaman still wouldn't take out the Mage as you can't fake cast while stuck in frost nova so heals, lightning or chain lightning spells are off the table as they are vulnerable to counter spell. Sheeped Warrior + CS'd Shaman in Nova = easiest getaway in this solo Mage's life. Just blink away and mount up.
---
Nah I’m using wow head if needed, got me fucked up lol. I will be doing my own talents and no vids or anything tho
---
Sorry
---
&gt; after today's info drop.
---
We can see the thumbnail lol
---
Ah fuck. I Can't believe you've done this.
---
You know that ppl can see the thumbnail ?
---
I know I'm pretty cheesed there's no way to get rid of that
---
You realise the thumbnail/picture show Rick Ashtley right? lol
---
Came to say this
---
Might go dwarf priest instead of human this time. Hard decision since I can’t no life it this time around the diplomacy is looking a little more attractive
---
Beta, because I'm a filthy NEET and a beta launching means release 4-6 weeks later.
---
Once in 2019 I was so bored that i ran around in boralus for so long you could get from winterspring to tanaris in the meantime.
---
Are you really comparing me to Hitler because you don't agree with me? I think you might be surprised to find out that most people didn't agree with him. There was a war, remember? If you don't think it's a big deal then why haven't you dstopped by now? I really don't know what motivates you to keep annoying people like that.
---
No. Combat is not significantly worse in PvP during leveling.  I'd argue it's better while leveling due to talents such as Imp. Sprint, Riposte, Adrenaline Rush and Imp. Kick as well as good leveling swords being more abundant than daggers.

Multiple people are pointing to today. Blizzard also took down their post this morning saying that there are no Beta's for classic currently.
---
LFG WC

and the cheeky LF4M
---
Nah dude, Undercity Cockroach Crew!
---
If I had gold, it would go to you today sir
---
We all are.
---
Maybe the high pop PServer I'm playing on is different, but people just don't seem to care about 1v1 PVP that they stand a chance of losing. I've only been attacked once by someone close to my level on the lvl38 priest I'm playing. Perhaps this is because people are worried I'll log a lvl60 main or maybe it's because they don't want me to rez and interfere with their levelling by ganking them back, but I'm just not seeing any 'fair' PVP at all. Alliance either gang up on me or attack when they're many levels higher.
---
if we judge normally how long it takes for a new xpac going from beta to retail then that would mean atleast another 3 or more months of wait.
---
Then you should have beat him to it RITE?
---
D: you've just made an enemy for life.
---
The Minions weren't problematic. Guard spawns are capped by the number of civilian NPC's nearby, so typically you're going to have like 4-8 guards whacking away at it and that's that. Any time a guard died it'd spawn a new one and the Minion would just endlessly fight them and never move to a new location to actually spawn more guards total.
---
I've kited several to Stormwind before and quite often it'd get zapped by a guy with the quest item after like 1-2 hours anyway.
---
Holy hell man, that is a blast from the past. ASUS ROG 2012 was amazing.
---
Had some less than a year ago. What kind of gamer are you?!
---
New! Tauren hunter to orc rogue, lets see if I commit
---
feral in raid is like 4th tank, same with paladin as they cant taunt   
---
unfortunately warrior is the only solid tank class
---
They started recreating Classic in 2017 and it's very possible that the Classic demo from Blizzcon was several weeks older than their current build. You can't just take your in development build and slap it out as a demo. That thing was prepared weeks before Blizzcon.
---
Some of your best Rings come from CC and Nozdormu rep, BiS shoulders from AB rep, bracers from WSG rep, and there is something from AV that a lot of ppl have to farm but i forget what, I think its BiS healing.
---
And he hasn't done any research judging by all of the mistakes.
---
Big ticket items like sharding aren’t the only things that matter.
---
I’m talking about all the little stuff that was either wrong in the beta or is just an unknown: regen rates, mob speed, sit crits, hitbox size etc. Granted some can be assumed, but there’s so many little things we still don’t know that it ends up having a major combined impact.
---
Heck, even just seeing the current state of affairs for things like graphics will be nice.
---
I'll be wanding asap. My rotation from lvl5-38 has been Mind Blast &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand / alt+tab and read forums until the mob is dead.
---
Im ok with alt tanking and healing/dpsing when needed.
---
I really hope TBC will come after. I’m in no rush, but it would be great if we could take the characters we make in classic to the outlands, eventually.
---
A lot of streamers have said that today at 8 am pst there will be new info. MrGM has a countdown to that time currently on his stream.
---
He can't be "very prominent" if I've never heard of him. I've played every WoW expansion.
---
I'd think that an extra 15% mana regen would outweigh losing ~50 spell damage, but really, on longer fights, I'd assume you just downrank your spells a bit.
---
disclaimer: I've never played an OOMkin in vanilla
---
I played Warrior as Main in Vanilla, on Nost and on Ely and until a few Month ago I thought I do that again in Classic but then I changed my mind and will level Warlock first and Warrior as overpowered Twink later.
---
I just found a second edition strategy guide and in the back I remember it having all the companion pets listed in the back. I will look when I get home. There are Vendor pets and NPC drops.  The cat carriers can drop from the zone where the dalaran crater will eventually be.
---
But it's not irrational. Its totally rational for anyone over the age of 12 to hate most streamers as they mostly cater to people under 12.
---
oof, can we stop pretending that these social media "influencers" are in any sense relevant to anything
---
If I was an alliance player I think I’d be playing a paladin 👌
---
I don't hate streamers, but when they hop on social media and start antagonizing people with comments like "iF YoU hAtE StReAmErS nOw, jUsT wAiT uNtiL tOmoRrOw!" that's obviously going to generate a lot of animosity. It's intentionally strirring the pot to get a reaction out of people. 
---
If Blizzard honestly believes that qualifies as "good" PR, then they are so completely out of touch that I honestly fear for their future. They seem to go from one PR dilemma to another (Blizzcon 2018, HotS esports, optics of the lay offs, app permissions for Blizzcon 2019, public drama surrounding cost-cutting impacts, etc.) with little ability to control the narrative.
---
idd, he's really chill IRL compared to when he streams.
---
Hi
---
It's not my responsibility to make sure every streamer gets a fair shake. I don't care. If Tips wanted to be liked, he should be likeable.
---
Don't associate other people's hate with why I don't like someone. I'm my own person.
---
That is because the Windfury totem from a shaman is the star of the show.
---
Thank you! Was just scared there would be a pretty big QoL drop off trying to world pvp with swords during leveling. Didn't really pvp back in classic when I was young so wasn't sure.
---
Can’t go wrong either way, but I think shamans get more fun when you unlock a bigger chunk of your skillset, ghostwolf and totems baby! But priest has been my favorite class throughout most of the wow expansions.
---
I started with Nostalrius. Leveled 3 Warriors to 60 on private servers. Going to be playing a Shaman for the first time on Classic.
---
Un'Goro was awesome, you take 20 Q's, travel around the zone until they are completed and see your exp explode when you turn them all in at once.
---
I leveled to 60 in vanilla as assassination daggers and I have to say that it was fun, but was also frustrating. Leveling is so slow and the advantage in pvp isn't consistent. Sometimes you wreck your opponent and other times all your backstabs miss or hit for 5% of their HP lol.
---
Just go combat till you get some gear that will support daggers a bit more. Even with full tier 1, you deal with some bad luck no crit moments, but at least your HP and AP are high enough to give you a chance to recover from it.
---
With combat, you can still be very proficient in pvp at 60 and its my opinion it's just stronger before level 60 unless you just get a great dagger due to it's consistency.
---
Just a streamer who makes radical predictions and summaries of WoW updates. He's not liked very much by Blizzard, or by fans for that matter.
---
Going hunter to specifically lower the effect relapsing is going to have on my life
---
The dude literally said these content creators are gonna just send a shit load of videos which one of those content creators admitted to releasing like 7 videos once NDA is lifted. Which means announcement most likely. So you can not watch their beta test “content” or you can watch it for the next 2 months to hold you over for classic
---
There’s no guaruntee anything on any private server is accurate so I don’t think your statement can be backed up until classic launches.
---
Every single class is welcome and is bringing something unique. The side does not matter.
---
[yup](https://giphy.com/gifs/thats-a-penis-EzVPnZABeepdC?utm_source=media-link&amp;utm_medium=landing&amp;utm_campaign=Media%20Links&amp;utm_term=https://giphy.com/gifs/thats-a-penis-EzVPnZABeepdC)
---
Right up until the dude who has been saving dkp for months to get his ONE item gets snubbed because LC doesn't agree with him. With a massive degree of transparency this can get mitigated but imagibe wanting to spend your hard earned dkp only to get told no.
---
Lol at ANOTHER thread with dates and times people are pulling from their ass. Give me that false hope I get it about 20 times a day from this sub anymore.
---
LOL i can't see shit on this vid, the graininess is real. Love vanilla.
---
America has the school-shooting nerds. Step up your game EU.
---
You son of a mother fucking...  
---
   
---
Now I got this shitty song stuck in my head...
---
Yep and everyone takes up a Slot in your Bags. I only carried Gurky with me.
---
I'm pretty excited about it. So it seems to be working.
---
I think it's just angry internet dorks like you that give a fuck about streamers teasing it.
---
Hopefully for a lot of people’s sake they just plain don’t release too many servers at launch.  Nothing worse than a long list of “low” pop servers.
---
This was my biggest argument FOR Sharding for the launch of classic. More sharding means less need for extra servers (to make sure people can actually play). More servers means more dead servers later on.
---
And yes, I also hate sharding. But it's a damn sight better to have short term sharding than being on a dead realm in a game which requires other people to do anything meaningful.
---
sounds about right
---
This is my biggest fear too, and server transfers are the one character service I can’t argue against.
---
Rogues can't insignia Stun, so Orc &gt; all others.
---
You're the triggered one, how am I triggered when I just speak the truth?
---
I'd play on one, with an alt, because higher pop would bring a lot more W-PvP which is very fun. That's something I even said. Is that being triggered?
---
And yes, it would crush a lot of people who believe pservers actually do mirror blizzlike servers and it "works" with high pop. It does because they have dynamic or higher spawn rates.
---
3 weeks level 14 kappa
---
It's something I regret not doing on my hunter alt when I could.  I had to settle for kiting Bunker commanders in AV to Galvangar so he could murder then during that time that people ignored towers and rushed the boss.
---
you guys are so easy
---
I've only found a BIS list that goes up to BWL &amp; ZG, but from having a quick look through some of the BIS heads, shoulders and gloves, most of the items result in no spell hit lost as they're mostly just spell damage pieces. There is only one set of bracers that have 1% hit too, but they are the absolute best in slot for that patch and they will be rolled on by mages and warlocks so it's unreliable to assume i'll have them.
---
Pretty much what we expected. Hopefully there's an announcement of the timeline for the rest of us plebs coming.
---
IT IS ALL TRUE
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3HiS49piTw
---
fuck this guy
---
hi /u/mrgm_
---
&gt; regen rates, mob speed, sit crits, hitbox size etc.
---
If those work differently than in vanilla, then they need to be fixed. And no, sit procs wont work. I couldnt say if they were correct on example regen in beta. Blizzard has to check that (would assume that they have done it) from their 1.12 copy.
---
Laugh at the warriors mistake in mage
---
&gt;It like the people in your camp aren't content with just saying 'yea we don't like this guy, we are going to watch somthing else'. Ya'll wana try to go out of your way to generate as much hate from others as you can. 
---
THIS is exactly why these dorks are so insufferable. Just dont watch it, jesus christ. Do you really have such a need to put even more hatred out into the universe? Over something so trivial?
---
Can you buy me a wow token pls
---
Not me but two of my irl friends bumped into each other one recognizing the other nickname used for the toon. It was just below the first cliff as you enter the barrens if I remember correctly
---
It's super interesting in how the real world every official position and company boss has strict oversight and for good reason. In guilds that flies out of the window and everyone just hopes for the best 🤔.
---
"Opportunity makes a thief." Also even the guild leaders can deceive themselves. Everyone thinks of themselves as being fair, and it's super easy to rationalise whatever you want. You really need it, your friend really needs it more than the other guy.
---
Seems fine to me.
---
give me what was revealed not the fucking stream
---
I was 9 years old playing a Human Warrior back then, spending months levelling, begging for gold to buy a mount at level 40...
---
I'm going back to that. I will finally be the Warrior I always dreamed I could become. This will be my redemption.
---
MadSeason already said he didn't get an invite.
---
For PvP: Combat swords works just as well as daggers, since most of the time you want to open with Cheap Shot. Daggers are great vs clothies, but the damage is very reliant on your main hand weapon.
---
My advice is to maintain a combat sword spec for leveling. You won't need to respec at all during the 1-60 grind. At 60, the best type of build for daggers depends on your gear level and reaching the crit cap.
---
Combat Dagger 15/31/5 is great for early for both beginner and pros.
---
Seal Fate 30/16/5 for around AQ40 gear, and higher crit cap.
---
I can't account for fun, but if you get a great dagger weapon any time during your leveling grind, maybe look into switching then.
---
Fuck does that mean
---
Do you know if it would be decent to carry a dagger if I get a really good one and equip it in the main hand so I could ambush in world pvp then switch back to the double swords when leveling? Not sure if dagger MH is even worth for the ambush.
---
So your assertion is that somehow you will not be able to level if you don't start literally minute one? That is ridiculous. It takes on average 10 days played to level, even if you figure you will be one of those who get it done faster you are looking at a week played to get to 60. 
---
Since we can assume that the pop caps will be normal (2500 people), and sharding will be used to mitigate starter zone problems for the first week or two, getting ahead of the pack does not require you to be done with the first 15 levels instantly. Even if you start later in the day you will be starting as many are ending their day, and as long as you work at it, you can still be ahead of the day one pack by the time you end for the day.
---
Noted! As I said at the start I’m more new to the posting on Reddit. That idea slipped my mind even from past posts I’ve read. Will edit when I can. Sorry about that!
---
One set of 25 push ups, crunches and squats takes less than 10 minutes. You can do this as part of the morning routine.
---
He said he has been playing WoW Classic for the last three weeks and is level 14.
---
WoW Classic (aka vanilla wow remastered/remade in the modern engine) is a product and quite a huge one (I mean, Warcraft 3 remastered is quite small compared to wow classic, in terms of reach and scope). That you don't want to consider it a product it's your own choice, you could very well consider Warcraft 3 remastered a non-product too.
---
Unfortunately it **is** a grand scale operation because they wanted to have it that way, because they're recreating the original game in the modern engine - which means they'll have to make sure things feel and look as close to the original as possible. **It** **will not look identical** to the vanilla client, because they use a completely different engine (the modern one, the 8.2 live, 64bit DX12 version). The game will not look as what you see on the 1.12 private servers, but it will be manually made to look "pretty close". They literally have to recreate all the UI/game systems, mechanics and so on from the vanilla client, onto the modern one, because they didn't wanted to use the actual 1.12 client (which was full of hundreds of bugs and hacks and botting/automation was so easy to be done in it). They can't just copy-paste any code, they'll have to write new code in the new engine in order to recreate how abilities were working (mechanic-wise) in vanilla.
---
Not sure if Blizz is even investing money into ads for Classic, let alone for tv. Besides, who even still watches tv? I thought it died 15 years ago, together with the landline phones and I'm honestly not sure how tv and pc gaming can relate one to each other.
---
What usually happen in the modern era is that media attention = the internet, people get their gaming information from the gaming websites (the "gaming press") or gaming communities (which means social media and includes Youtube, Twitch and Reddit too). Gaming websites oddly enough cover wow classic and every official announcement about it gets posted on virtually every important gaming website; internet communities (reddit &amp; co) are all hyped up about wow classic too, there's insane coverage everywhere (if you ask me, it's really disturbing).
---
Noone has a clue if classic will be big or small (a huge percentage of those who will play Classic I bet will get bored really fast anyway, or quit because it's hard or lacks convenience features, dungeon queuing tools and so on) and it wouldn't even matter if it's big or not, it merely needs to exist and that all, nothing else, nothing more - just as all these hundreds of pirate servers kept existing all these years, because some people were interested in playing that old version of the game. Blizz doen't even charge additional money for it, so for them the entire product is being considered as "just a perk" for their live wow subscribers - atleast for now, since we have no clue if they maybe plan to add some form of monetization inside Classic later on.
---
Wrong trap icon for the slow :)  
---
This is the icon for the freezing trap, the one that slows is the frost trap: [https://classicdb.ch/?spell=13809](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=13809)  
---
You are most welcome!
---
Well wtf do you think it means? He's joking.
---
Thinking the same but I don't want to fight for one mob with 300 other people. Its going to be a mess. I will start playing a little bit later.
---
Well... The guild Im in is a rebirth of an old vanilla raiding guild. Most of the guys are between 30 and 40 years. The rules and structure looks promesing so I have faith.
---
I've met most of my friends and an ex girlfriend through WoW. It's kind of a nice way to effortlessly meet someone new. You already have a lot in common from the second you meet.
---
????
---
It's literally a 30 second clip with nothing but the "reveal".
---
Yes, I did say some can be assumed.
---
But just because things worked a certain way in vanilla doesn’t means that’s how they’ll work in classic, hence why we have sharding, loot trading etc. So that’s why the beta is important: it will answer many of those questions
---
With Blizzards recent track record.... probably whats going down.
---
Sorry! I can try cutting it down a bit more but I guess I didn’t want people thinking this was just another real quick guessing thread. I put a bit of thought into my speculation/prediction. Noted though, I’ll try to fix it up!
---
That's always the recommended stance, ofcourse. But we see the contrary happening over here - people are excesively hyped and make up tons of things out of nothing.
---
Ambush build is good if your level &gt;= mob level. Combat is good all around.
---
I would not spec into weapon type and always use best weapon. Getting locked into 2 swords while leveling is terrible.
---
Private server...(?)
---
There is absolutely no way the classic beta will be as along as a beta for a new xpac where you have to test a gazillion of new features.
---
7 days played is short. Most people will take longer than that. You WILL take longer than that if you don’t have a planned route.
---
You need sleep as well. It doesn’t matter if you start when they end their day, when you end your day they’ll catch up again.
---
Damn he got the moves.
---
Seriously tho how this videos doesn't still have 1 billion views is mind boggling.
---
ripped away from who - i’m having the same amount of fun i’ve had years ago
---
slow leveler lol
---
Can someone write a TL;DW?
---
I'm at work atm and can't see the clip
---
Jokes are just as bad and unpopular as his stream then
---
I never got to play vanilla I started in bc towards the end. Soo undead warrior.
---
attention whore
---
I’m only high plat/low diamond and I see a lot of premades run brig/zen/luv/rein/Zarya/dva to the point that I quit altogether 😂
---
oh no please don't add me to your cringe compilation, oh woe is me
---
She confirmed your family's vacation booking for July.  No Classic for you!!!
---
You usually want to open with cheap shot in world PvP.
---
they are releasing hearthstone pve content to streamers only now as well. could be the start of a new blizzard trend to try to build hype or whatever. 
---
i just think its going to end up doing the opposite.
---
New one! :) I mained Human Rogue in vanilla, and I will main Tauren Druid or Orc Shaman this time around.
---
What is jumping a charge?
---
He said he's been playing the wow beta the last 3 weeks which is why streams have been short, but take with a grain of salt
---
I think there’s a lot of lingering questions regarding the “nitty-gritty” of blizzard recreating classic wow vs the current iteration on private servers. A beta will allow players to find answers to these questions that they have.
---
&gt;	bawls
---
Wow that is something I completely forgot about.
---
Because content creators themselves were giving different days, some were saying today and others were saying tomorrow. Even in this tweet GM says today and then in his response he says tomorrow.
---
he hasnt been streaming because hes leveling on classic, he has a 14 gnome rogue apparently. dunno if hes trolling or not.
---
These benchmarks are a great guide, definitely the right place to start. From reading the rest of the thread a few things to note:
---
1) The game will be run using the modern client with some alterations to assets etc. This means that posts relating to the vintage 1.12 client are not relevant for your purposes.
---
2) GPU. Considering you don't want to overspend it's worth considering the following: GTX 1060, GTX 1660 Ti, RTX 2060. The GTX 1070 is also an option if you can get one for less than an RTX 2060 but that's unlikely even with recent discounting. The GTX 1060 is probably pretty borderline but I left it in because it's very cheap now.
---
3) CPU. Any of the modern (Gen 8 or Gen 9) i5s should be fine but to my mind the i5-9600K is the one currently in the price/performance sweet spot for your purposes. I wouldn't bother with an i7 if all you are going to use it for is WoW.
---
Best of luck with the build!
---
Some of us are at work.
---
You're triggered because you started swearing, calling names and typing in all-caps. It's pretty evident from your last message that you're triggered, lol just reread it
---
People can pick what they want. Your comment is basically you saying "I know whats best for other players" Lol - what a stupid approach. You're actually advocating *less* options because "you know lots of other players would be crushed" even though they don't have to pick that server? LOL you're killin me. 
---
That's a common theme in people against high-pop servers. You guys are convinced you just *know* other players will hate it and you're doing some justice by fighting against it. Hilarious that's your justification for fighting *against* your community. You're in highschool arent you?
---
You’re so mad lol
---
Only class with an o shit battle res, bear tanks are pretty good if you know what you’re doing and itemize correctly.
---
Jack Daniels and Randy Savage makes my heart happy.
---
I think he was kidding? (keep watching the video)
---
This. During the original beta they kept it open an slowly increased lvl cap. Then shut it down two weeks before launch.
---
Yeah I'm gonna go at my own pace and enjoy it in the best way possible.
---
Dis makea mah peepee da biggen peepee
---
Not mad lol hop off his dick bud
---
He's saying he's been playing classic wow for the last 3 weeks. Currently a level 14 rogue, blaming the low level on him testing out everything :)
---
Cool dude
---
Found the “content creator”.
---
If you are decently geared and play well, you have an opportunity to create a reputation for yourself on your server as a reliable, knowledgeable tank.
---
Let us know which server you're playing on first.
---
Fukken done him
---
Aw man you’re too nice. I’m just giving you a hard time. I’d rather you be passionate and write to your hearts’ content rather than cutting it short for trolls like me
---
No one cares
---
Stop being a bitch and just enjoy the game. 😂
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
As a noob, I do not get that reference but probably lmao
---
This ! Someone type out whats in the clip ! LET ME INNNNNNNN
---
His unpopular 650 viewer stream LULW
---
Strange, no? It's got so much to do, but it actually *is* boring.
---
twitch prime to this guy :0
---
Yea I'm not saying you have to give them a fair shake if you don't want. I'm trying to figure out why you and others have a vested interest in spreading and generating hate from others to validate your own dislike.
---
If you don't like it, just turn it off.
---
you guys all keep getting jebaited...
---
He sits in front of a camera so is more qualified to test the game.
---
Agreed.
---
let them do their gatekeeping. they dont have anything left besides pressing f5 on this sub and shitting on streamers until classic releases.
---
I’m playing on a streamers server so I can corpse camp them on my undead rogue named Fourtwenty
---
Man I would love to see a gif of the best movies from 2004-2006, like The Prestige or Departed or some sheyit
---
When I first hit level 40 and got my first mount, I went from north to south on my mount, then returned in travel form to see the difference in speed.  I wasn't bored, just enjoying being a druid.
---
oof
---
beta then release at the end of it
---
i just want to schedule my days!
---
Classic items are the definition of uncommon, rare and epic. At least in terms of availability.
---
Did not mwntion a beta. Just classic wow.
---
nothing is stopping you from respecing
---
get your best healer and mage - make strat ud reserve run - run couple of them - split loot - u should have 100+ gold - respec to w/e you want to play than spec back to your raiding spec before raid

Hello there!
---
“The Muffin Vendor” is recruiting people interested in playing Horde on a PvE server. We’re going to be making a guild for end game content, including PvE and PvP as well. That, of course, doesn’t mean we only want raiders and pvpers. Anyone interested in having some fun is welcome!

**Who are we?**

We’re a group of friends who have played Warcraft together after meeting about 7 years ago. We all played Vanilla at the start as I’m sure a lot of others have. We’ve got experienced raiders from all across the timeline of Warcraft, and we’re all avid fans of the Lore.
---
The guild itself has some background in vanilla as a raiding guild. So there is plenty of experience there as well!
---
**What we offer?**
---
First of all, we offer all you may need to make your levelling experience as fun and enjoyable as possible. From help with dungeons and group quests, to experienced players willing to introduce you to the game, to an active and bustling chat which will keep you engaged even through the dullest grind sessions.
---
Second, we offer a productive and organized environment to let you experience everything Vanilla’s endgame has to offer: dungeons, raids, battlegrounds and so on.
---
**What we are looking for?**
---
While we have the “basic stepstones” covered (such as a MT and a minimum amount of healers/dpsers), we still have plenty of room for additional people.
---
What we’re looking for are mainly dedicated players. Which means, if you have the passion to keep on playing, and the willingness to show it in your commitment (i.e. show up for raids and group content, bring consumables, improve your game and so on), then you’re the kind of person we want to invite in our guild.  
---
**Recruitment status:**
---
Druid - CLOSED
---
Hunter - CLOSED
---
Mage - **High**
---
Rogue - **High**
---
Priest - *Medium*
---
Shaman - **High**
---
Warlock - *Medium*
---
Warrior - Low
---
**Rules &amp; requirements:**
---
* A patient, positive attitude. Vanilla content is less about your macros and more about your commitment. Respect your guildmates, listen to your officers, and we’ll go far!
---
* Consumables. We’re not going to be hardcore about flasks and such, but everyone can fish some sagefis/rum or get themselves a few potions/elixirs.
---
* English – or at least some basic understanding of it.
---
* Looting rules: We're planning to use a **DKP** system with **blind bidding** in order to avoid bid wars. **Loot Council** will be employed for **legendary items**. We believe this represents the fairest compromise between the needs of the guild and the needs of its members.
---
**Raiding schedule:**
---
We’re currently planning to have at least three weekly raids. Of course, these numbers depend on content and player/alt availability (such as in phase 1 when there’s only MC/Ony and people don’t have geared alts yet), but eventually we plan to have every major raid cleared at least once per week.
---
As far as times go, we’re planning to begin our raids at 8-9 PM server time (depending on players’ availability). Exact days/hours will be set in stone once we get closer to Classic WoW’s release date and our ranks are properly filled.
---
**Where you can contact us:**
---
For anyone interested in joining, feel free to pop by on the discord server. When joining you’ll have a temporary rank and only see a public chat to counter any potential shenanigans.

You must not be into the community. He is very prominent if he is going to Blizzard HQ every year and getting a press pass.
---
Work? I thought we all called off to watch TipsOut today
---
"Gainastyle is so cool and handsome"
---
Are you claiming the go-fetch quests are more fun in Classic than they are in Retail?
---
I am hugely excited to play Classic and get the nostalgic feeling, as well as playing the more class-oriented role, rather than the master-of-none classes in retail.
---
But you are a fucking retard, if you think the questing system/grinding in Classic is BETTER than that of retail.
---
What a big intelligent boy you are
---
Sure but that won't be an issue in the beginning. No one will have a level 60 main and no one will really be much higher than you if you start on launch. I am just someone who takes every fight since it's what I enjoy but a lot of people don't that is for sure.
---
Dude I love kargoz! You guys should also check out defcamp &amp; melderon TV on YouTube. They are brothers who share a YouTube page and make amazing content
---
coolstorybro.jpg
---
They’re not interesting enough as their own individuals so they use this as something to identify with that makes them feel special.
---
1. it's something playable after 7 months of blueballing us
---
2. beta release means actual release is in 4-6 weeks
---
I can only find it online now.  
---
After winning a tournament their reward was a case for everybody on my team.  
---
Miss that shit, good shit
---
What was your point? The topic is Classic not World of Warcraft (2004).
---
So, out of the 8 other classes, wich one you think it's worse than druid?
---
With how stoked I am to tell my boss when I'm taking off, a release date seems likely today since he's out for a few days.
---
In my experience, the time I had to play was spent tanking or getting ready to tank. I sucked in PvP, but rarely engaged in it enough to matter/respect constantly anyway. 
---
The times I wanted a break from tanking, I played alts. Fire mage was especially fun as it was so opposite the tank role. But I spent most time on the tank. The alts were temporary diversions.
---
&gt;I can't wait to shit on Blizzard and the YouTubers.
---
Seems like a weird attitude to me. You *want* something bad to happen so you have a reason to be mad?
---
Finally, a parody video of a “WhAt ClAsS tO pIcK” video. Should be more types of these
---
Fuck, that’s some good shit
---
That scene made me cry in the office, now I’m about to cry in here too cuz it’s just as beautiful with this sub
---
:( I didn't even do anything
---
*virtual eye roll*
---
This entire project basically exists to capture the pathetic manchild demographic. There's not a lot that can be done without causing some portion of the community to sperg out.
---
Bawls is still the official energy drink of Quakecon.
---
"if women feel safe around you on public transit, play rogue". 10 out of 10.
---
Actually 4PM UK time.
---
Dagger builds are better for wPVP outside of just ambush ganks, but there are limited options, and it definitely does not make up for the leveling speed hinderance.
---
That being said, the PVE engagements are more fun than just chopping multiple mobs up. You learn a bit more about tempo of combat and energy management.
---
Nature's Swiftness + Hibernate is instant cast though. And NS is actually useful on a PvP spec.
---
Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
They are competing though because if they release classic at the same time of 8.2 I have a feeling the majority of players are going to go with classic instead of playing retail
---
It isn't F&amp;F, it is purely for internal employee testing.
---
(I have F&amp;F)
---
I buy them at microcenter, thats the only place I see them.
---
Thats true, the first subject you talk with someone is hard to find
---
The client on Blizzard's CDN has been labeled as beta for a few weeks now. It started off as a friends and family alpha but it seems like it progressed to a friends and family beta.
---
They had upcoming releases/patch listed. They also had a PTR, I mean, even if they didn’t have a direct release date, everyone knew a patch was about to drop after the PTR ended. And even then they only rolled out patches on maintenance days.
---
I’m assuming a smart player will lead with all their spells so the 5 second rule starts a bit sooner.
---
Don't worry. Blizz likes money. I imagine name change will also be there.
---
Same main, new name.
---
On my server there would always be like 20 people trying to fight it Or just attack it to level weapon skill for that hour. Which would make the server lag
---
You could. It would be a very situational thing to employ though (like a sitting clothie) and I would switch back to main handing the sword as soon as you ambush. I wouldn't put the points into sub for it though because you're spending 99% of your time leveling and you'll want those assas/deep combat talents.
---
Like I said, even if you had all the ambush/backstab talents you can get, you can still get so unlucky and do very little or no damage and still spent 60% of your energy on your opener.
---
I'd just always open with a cheapshot or garrote and dance around them with crippling poison. The combat talents are just more robust for when things go bad, you can always widdle your enemy down.
---
Keeping the level cap low also helps stress test the servers more by concentrating the population in fewer zones.
---
just quit and become full-time neet
---
They will also have a higher sub count than at any other point this year
---
all you need is frost shock gets me for some reason lol
---
I want to check how pvp feels like and especially if the jumps that made wsg flag carrying so fun are still a thing.
---
I get it, you felt attacked without even reading and I'm quite sure you still havn't with the replies you keep throwing at me.
---
No one here is triggered except for you and nothing I've written even comes close to what you talk about.
---
But it's quite good entertainment though, that you're so commited into making up random stuff to create this nonesense argumentation instead of just letting it go and realising you misunderstood.
---
Best alternative for you is to not play
---
I would totally put the faction I´m on before my friends too... Hell I didn´t even have most of those friends back when I bonded with the Horde... So why would I betray the Horde for some IRL friends... ;)
---
I totally get u!
---
This is why so many people on this subreddit have such an issue with streamers like this. Instead of simply giving context that you didn't intend for this to be taken so out of context, you make a quip that insinuates that you intended to mislead people to mess with them. Obviously at this point you have no intention of being liked by people around here, and that's your prerogative, but you can't act like it's the subreddit's fault they hate streamers like you. Just a thought.
---
Shut up, and enjoy the game.
---
You need an alt to produce a stable income of gold for your tank.
---
Guess we’re just two freaks who like watching people melt then.
---
Half-Life 3 next week confirmed.
---
1:30 gachiHYPER
---
I think hyping up a countdown to something and then it's just prerecorded footage would be a let down. I mean it would be nice to see the footage, but if there's no beta/release announcement there's gonna be a lot of blue balls.
---
But 1 min cd
---
Hope you enjoy playing with the streamers toxic fanbases and long queue times when they are online then.
---
If you don't know the answer to anything of this, i.e. sustaining yourself economically in the slightest, then you should reconsider becoming a main tank for a raiding guild.
---
Care to provide some examples of why you think retails leveling experience is some how better?
---
Beautiful, sexy
---
That's true
---
&gt;...so I can avoid you like the plague.
---
Wow, sounds pretty salty and resentful :^)
---
Play WoW while also going to school and fail your classes like the rest of us. For the authentic classic experience of course.
---
100% agree!
---
Preventing someone from abusing terrain exploits or fixing fucked up pet pathing is not slippery slope territory.  Stop that.   The game will not lead to flying and LFR just because your pet behaves properly.
---
I had a horrible adulterous relationship with a priest once, went on for a few years (and many many air-miles) without the husband finding out. He was in a different guild which helped.
---
Also I used to often chat and run BGs with guildie - shortly after I stopped playing I found out he was an IRL friend from a sports club who I'd known for years. Neither of us mentioned WoW (in fear of being outed as a geek) until we one day sheepishly talked about online gaming and made the mouth-dropping discovery.
---
🔫😏Line up boys
---
My experience is I mostly chat with my friends, and rarely play with them.. We have different schedules, I want to play when it fits my schedules and them theirs. They have kids, girlfriends, lives.. I have classic wow. So perhaps I'll no life alliance in a the most nerdy way. (alone)
---
STV is my favorite zone of all time, any expac, even (and it hurts to admit) Grizzly Hills. I get so excited as I approach level 32, and have been known to blast Fortunate Son on the Zeppelin ride in.
---
&gt; vegetarian tikka masala
---
Bro do you even vegetable korma?
---
that streamers and their groupies taking over a realm (or killing the realm population when the streamer leaves) is even a cause for concern.
---
Blood and thunder, yo.
---
Why would you be shitting on Blizzard when they have neither said nor implied anything?
---
Human rep buff is awesome man!
---
I hope if there is a beta it’s only a week or so. I was there back in November 2004 and there were bugs and server crashes all over the place. Having the game buggy and server crashes is just part of no changes and an authentic vanilla experience. 
---
All jokes aside, how many people really care if they released Classic a couple months early in exchange for putting up with bugs (the loot bug for example) and some realm crashes.
---
I'm excited for the future for sure. Its either that or moving into a BC phase. I'm okay with either.
---
I hoping for some Always Sunny memes...
---
Forever. Competitive feral dps is an exercise in masochism.
---
You must be new to this sub and gamers in general.
---
Grind Swamp of Sorrow Jaguars from 37-40.
---
What bracket homie?
---
Good luck finding any realm with zero toxicity.  
---
&gt;!you wont!&lt;
---
I actually started one before the hater took over, might just finish it 😉
---
I literally referenced classic by it’s name. I don’t understand your confusion.
---
You are right that it will keep people from playing 8.2.... but we know they’re just after the $$$
---
You're just making excuses to not break a sweat. Literally no one with half a brain will tell you that exercise doesnt promote weight loss.
---
Wants to visit Japan ;)
---
Can’t wait, so thankful we’re finally getting our second chance!
---
This is the right answer. Just lean into the role. Prot tanks are fun in pve but they are shit for consistent gold farming and PvP. Yes you can sometimes get groups sufficient to farm some good gold/hr, and when those opps arise feel free to take them on your tank. But the cost of respec’ing and the inability to use and hour here or there to grind some gold efficiently will catch up to you. Level a hunter rogue warlock or mage and park it somewhere good for gold farming. Log in when it’s convenient for you. Better yet get a second account and grind gold on your alt when you’re waiting around for the right group or whatever on your tank.
---
No, I and others got into the first wave. I agree though, there were mostly media personalities in there. With every wave more and more non-streamers got invited though. So maybe the same will happen here.
---
&gt;5 days 12 hours played  
---
&gt;level 42
---
Aww yissss. I am so fucking forward to leveling actually feeling like it's worth a damn again.
---
You get to watch them play in the closed beta ;)
---
No Bracket at all, I will level him up but I will buy him all the shiny Gear I can get.
---
Of course he is wrong. Blanket statements like that are quite wrong generally speaking.
---
I actually liked that they included classic with the regular game subscription, because every once in awhile I haven't urge to play retail. Mainly because I usually get dragged into doing it by some of my friends.
---
I agree, parts of this sub are so fucking toxic it's quite incredible
---
Once I kited Gamon to AQ40 entrance
---
Please see: literally any pro athlete.
---
Just take easy generals for a semester, surely it’s worth it
---
Expansion betas mean testing entirely new content and making balance changes at the same time. Neither of those apply to Classic, it's going to be purely bug testing.
---
Meh I don’t need to be pushing top of the charts, just doing enough to get by is fine with me.
---
It's all falling into place so nicely.
---
It's going to create hatred towards the streamers mostly I feel like – and frustration.
---
I’m gonna go skinning and herb to prioritize my mounts, then eventually switch to tailoring + eng wayyy down the line.   
---
You can always make an enchanting alt and get it to level 5 to disenchant greens at any level to make some more money.
---
Haha and I'm going from undead mage to Human Warrior :)
---
Once you start I'd stay away from this sub. It's going to make you want to just grind hard to 60 instead of enjoying the leveling process. 
---
It takes a long ass time to level, but it's super rewarding when you constantly have goals throughout the process.
---
Nice.  Keep the Office parodies rolling. :)
---
This constant shit posting is getting really old really quick.
---
Maybe it's because I've played through it so many times, but I honestly can't stand westfall anymore. 12-20 alliance is the worst questing experience for me; all of the options are tedious as hell, but westfall gets it done the fastest, so that's usually where I end up, while I try not to vomit from boredom as I kill my 700th goretusk.
---
New main, faction, and guild; though I am still recreating my original main in new faction form and I will eventually get around to leveling it.
---
Assuming you are getting T2 pieces that are not going into slots with spell +hit on them, are you planning on healing - any guild will just give the tier pieces to Druids who are going to get the most benefit out of them. 
---
Thinking longer term, how long until you plan on replacing them? For example, you could obtain the T2 belt, however Chromag drops a belt with 2% hit that any Balance Druid will not want to pass on (2% hit from a single gear slot is imba.)
---
The Rockfury Bracers have +hit on them and are a quest reward for anyone able to do the grind. So if you get the T2 version, you would be wanting to get ahold of the Rockfurys once they are available.
---
Only play a main tank if you can play 2-4 times as much as everyone else. It's fucking rough
---
Well, if they spent their NS on this you are probably going to win the battle
---
If you don’t want to level a second character to farm on then plan to not play solo, do group runs, etc.
---
Best friend of 12 years I met on wow. She flew across country to hang out for a week irl 3 years ago and in September we're going to New Orleans.
---
Yeah, I’d definitely find a way home lol. I’ve been a bit paranoid that they’re going to surprise launch it. I doubt they would though.
---
&gt; **I'm not hyped for a beta release. I'm hyped for new information** 
---
There is significant overlap between a beta and information.
---
Hi, /u/aydsz
---
Shaman.
---
want some cheese with that whine? haha
---
Exactly this unfortunately. Basically failed my HSC (Australian). Only later on gained a appreciation for education in mid 20’s.
---
Server transfers would give people the opportunity to ninja-loot and effectively reset their reputation as a player on a specific server. Especially nowadays where people are able to have hundreds, if not thousands, in bnet balance simply gathered by farming gold on retail.
---
Watch Mr Gm on twitch now his on the login screen as I write this comment
---
Uhm. We're like 90% private server players here. Maybe our community isn't for you?
---
I’m gonna cum
---
gimme those tendies
---
*snap*
---
I must feed the trolls too :)
---
I just wanna test bugs so we can make sure we get the best version possible
---
I think it's the pants from wsg. Didn't know about the rings though... Those are bis for feral tank? Better than Dark Iron Ring? Do you know their names?
---
WoW, really?
---
Damn lol everyone wants a shaman in their party, and I think they are way better healers and casters than druids.
---
But okay, opinions are opinions
---
Watch Mr GMs twitch now, his on the login screen
---
Where did I state the leveling experience is better?
---
I just said you had to be a complete retard if you think Classic is better.
---
As Horde who does drunk raids, can confirm
---
I personally use a poopjug and a piss sock. Each to their own.
---
Nice to see one of these without 20k gold on the character.
---
A streamer has an announcement in like an hour so we will know more then. 
---
Unless they are just bamboozling us.
---
Oh cool. Don’t forget to get runs through SM around 30-40 to get all that filthy scarlet gear 🤤
---
Nothing says “cool and stable individual” like a Reddit thread asking which server people will play on when there is no server list.
---
Too bad by the time you finally manage to craft a good blue, you probably already have a dungeon drop thats better
---
That's nice. None of those things are something you can't do in BFA, are they?
---
I know it's a meme, but anyone who has actually defecated at the computer knows it's a poopbox. Cheap Tupperware type containers are best.
---
Fantastic advice, thank you
---
For those of us that have a hard time keeping up with internet personalities - who is MrGM? Is he affiliated with Blizzard, or just a content creator?
---
Dude that's disgusting. I'm grown adult now, and I can bring whole setup to the bathroom with the fridge.
---
You mean less than you've had in the past lmao
---
&gt;it merely needs to exist and that all, nothing else, nothing more
---
How romantic. 
---
Not just a perk though when the majority of your playerbase doesn't play bfa trash.
---
The main point in all of this being... they don't intend to spend money to promote something they will give 70%+ of their playerbase access to by subbing to current wow.
---
And we all know it will be huge on release. At least the first few days to a week twitch will probably average 150k viewers within the wow channel (hopefully they make a separate classic channel) 
---
First day will probably be triple that at least.
---
All that already being almost a guarantee means they don't need to do a "promotional stream" just for the sake of announcing a beta release date. 
---
Everyone expects that but not everyone expects a release date... which they should deliver today.
---
Still deciding. 
---
My main was a Dwarf Hunter, and then I changed to Horde and Played a Tauren Hunter.  I quit back in 2012, and then I was playing my resto shammy more. so still unsure whether to start as a hunter, and roll a resto shammy as an alt.  
---
I'm worried about how easy it is to farm gold as a hunter, compared to a shammy.
---
Alliance win almost all AVs because the map is imbalanced and offers Alliance huge advantages over the Horde. Alliance are also massively overpopulated because their player base are shallow and only picked Alliance because "they want pretty character models"
---
I'm not familiar enough with him to comment on the latter, but I know he does a lot of stuff related to data mining.
---
The Smith's (aka Kroger) here in Las Vegas has them
---
You might be having “fun” breaking the meta like that but just don’t expect to be invited to any raids, sweatie.
---
For sure! 
---
Met my best friend back in Wrath, have travelled countries to see each other and hang out, and will be seeing each other again very soon!
---
what do u think it will be?
---
Public Test Realms only started with patch 1.11. Use wayback machine and check the day before any patch 1.2-1.10. They had no forward marketing.
---
And they’re reusable too!
---
Joining the horde is the right choice!
---
I'm here to learn. Players don't start off knowing everything when exploring a new role
---
My main will be the same class I normally play. My alt however is gonna be switched up. It should be a requirement that all DPS mains have a healer or tank alt!!! Do your part!
---
Thank you very much for the detailed answer.
---
??????
---
I saved a step and created a bathroom in my bedroom so who’s the real adult now
---
Man sometimes you just want to zone out and run around chatting with the locals in general chat while you mindlessly kill boar people to help some poor sod grieve.
---
Constantly having your ear blasted off every 5 minutes with, "oh grand hero, you're the only one with half a brain, please save literally the entire planet", gets old way faster.
---
It might not be a better system but your character plays a small part in the world, not the world revolving around your character.
---
It does feel quite Zug Zug! :D
---
I did a somewhat well received AMA a few days ago, answered a lot of questions, but this brainfart is where I earn my first reddit gold, wtf xD  
---
    
---
I mean thanks and all, but is this real life haha.
---
Zero chance game releases today. 
---
But if it does I'm starting to feel sick
---
No and no.
---
Without it you don't even qualify as "getting-by." That's why feral OT who can bring a crit buff is a thing, but dps feral is not.
---
Nah it was awesome.
---
Im right there with you but we just gotta acknowledge that Hype is part of the game industry now and all the big companies do it one way or the other.
---
the game isnt releasing today, the beta might release but idk
---
Not worth it with the cheap Reynolds ones, call 'em a "fourpack" you get two deuces in there and you toss it.
---
This. If you don't know how to make money as a prot war, then being prot will break you; economically and spiritually. 
---
Phase 1 the only really way to make money is doing Strat Live to reserve the 1st Orb drop. Or doing 5 man farming. Phase 2 you can start doing 3 man Dire Maul runs. And after you and your healer get decent gear you can easily drop the 3rd person so you each get a larger share of gold.  
---
My suggestion is if you have the time in phase 1, get your warrior AND and alt to 60. If you cant, then casually take your time. Maybe level your professions and run lots of dungeons on the Warrior. That way by the time you get 60, phase 2 should be out or at least soon. And you can do the DM farms.
---
Yes. Look at apex legends marketing success. This will be the new norm.
---
so sick of the trolls, this sub should be temp locked because it's out of hand at this point
---
Just go feral and have a healing set of armor...
---
How many days do you get off with that excuse?
---
if you think it will release today, you are mental, and should visit an hospital.
---
I never was out dps’d by combat rogues in similar gear, they were right on me some fights but I played dagger rogue through most of nax.
---
Why would you, even IF it's an open beta it's not like it matters to be on "launch". That's if it's beta at all, and chances are if it is it'll be media only for now. You'd have to be an idiot to actually take a day off today when you could save them for release or something else more important.
---
I used all my vacation days and GBP just for today. I have a whole case of mtn dew and tray of tendies. I am so excited thank you staysafe!
---
If you took a streamers advice you are gonna have a bad time. Just wait till blizzard does announce something.
---
lmao no one, its not coming out today.
---
Met my Wife in WOW.
---
She was the GM's girlfriend at the time and well, we had some "RL" raids where we met up and from one thing came another, when they broke up she decided to take revenge by dating me (I was a class officer and 2nd in command of the guild. But she could not resist my charms and we actually fell in love)... Thats about 13 years ago now :P (we met in vanilla, started dating in TBC, moved in together during wrath, and got married when legion was live).
---
This ofcourse killed our guild btw :( everyone ended up taking sides and "my" side ended up merging with another guild, the other side just disbanded.
---
We still use "Slub' and "slubm" in our texts and even in speach wich is shorthand for "/love" and "/em loves you more"
---
Yeah I could see that, but man for me westfall screams alliance vanilla/BC leveling experience. I remember during BC by the time I could get all of my friends playing we would have a mini guild running through westfall leveling up and running dead mines.
---
a*
---
Saved up a week of vacation to use as soon as the release date is posted. 
---
Not going for any servers first, but I don’t think I’d be of any use at work while I’m itching to play.
---
He’s a pro warrior. Watching him for 5 mins will show you that easy. Dudes a master with warrior mechanics. I’m just stating facts. Not being a fan boy.
---
Deathknights
---
If you skip both Smite and Holy Fire your opener will hit like a wet noodle as you out level the spell rank. Bad idea.
---
What specifically makes the tank role so time consuming?
---
If you genuinely believe Classic releases today, then PM me, I have a bridge to sell you.
---
YOU'RE that guy...for pretending to be shocked that someone doesnt know who some fat fuck wow streamer is.
---
Ill probably decide soon. And when its live ill ragecry at the character creation screen in frustration since i cant decide what to play after all :) and then all my friends at the LAN will be annoyed and just start without me and ill make a character and all the time im playing ill hear the voice in my mind say "this was a mistake, you wont like this character, you'll regret it". And then ill reroll somewhere around lvl 25 and try and catch up to my friends, but fail and just make more alts. 211 alts to be specific. Just like it was back then.
---
If people would stop supporting shitty streamers, this would not be a possibility.
---
I’d be surprised if they didn’t incorporate master loot into vanilla. With master loot, yes you can ninja but you would lose months of time you spent making friends, possibly building a competent guild, and earning respect.  If you are willing to sacrifice that for the loot, be my guest.
---
If they have NS, then they're a Resto Druid and Druids can't kill other Druids. They just CC you until help arrives.
---
Best way to counter Druid flag carriers in WSG is to Hibernate with a Druid of your own, then wait for help to arrive while they're stuck and can't run.
---
I still think they might be trolling us
---
Being competitive does not only relate to raw potential damage. Sword combat also has the advantage of being less dependent on positioning. With a rogue of similar skill, you'll always be behind, but does that matter to you? It's not like you are on a ret-level as a dagger-rogue, quite the contrary, but it still is not the optimal spec.
---
It may still be not a bad option, so that the loot gets distributed more evenly in raids and daggers should be more accessible than swords.
---
&gt;Why do you hate streamers? 
---
It's not streamers in general. People are okay with madseason and platinum. The ones singled out usually just pull clickbaity titles or spread misinformation (for the sake of at least saying aynthing). For instance Asmongolds stream titles have been  "CLASSIC BETA HYPE" or "CLASSIC BETA NEWS" for the past week.
---
&gt;I mean they don't really affect your life unless you watch them, right? 
---
They're the representatives of the game and shape the community.
---
Basically this. Leaks like this always get people super hyped and if it turns out to be false or the announcement gets delayed then the fallout turns on the company rather than the people responsible for leading the masses on
---
Fortunately I got this out of my system a couple of years earlier, with Counter-Strike beta. Had a 3.4 GPA fall of 1999, then a 1.4 in the spring where I spent most waking hours shooting up the campus network (this was also the days of dial-up, so having a campus-wide LAN and a T1 connection to the outside world was f’ing amazing).
---
Learned my lesson after that.
---
I quit my job today because he said it's worth it
---
Sooo does this mean today there will be SOME kind of announcement?
---
I know all of those names except for Hotter's.
---
I met some of my best friends in game while in darkshore in 2005 we all still talk all the time and have had meet ups.
---
The beta will reveal a lot of stuff though
---
Shadowmeld is helpful.
---
If you jump during the warriors charge at you the charge will end where you started your jump if timed right
---
I thought this was just bad.
---
Bonus: Daggers without 5 points in Opportunity is literally the worst thing you can ever do for Dagger Specs.
---
Seal Fate starts to come online once you get crit capped.  That can happen as soon as BWL granted you get full BiS from there and all world buffs.  More realistically, you're looking at Phase 4 when AQ comes out.
---
Since so many streamers/youtubers kinda said they know about this it's either a closed beta, other beta announcement or release date. Anything else would not be worth the hype that they started.
---
I quit my job! But, as they say, you gotta put all your eggs in one basket.
---
&gt; Man sometimes you just want to zone out and run around chatting with the locals in general chat while you mindlessly kill boar people to help some poor sod grieve.
---
&gt; 
---
And that doesn't happen in Retail? When I have War-mode on, I get griefed a lot. I grief a lot, and I help people out.
---
I chat with people, invite them to my groups, get invited to their groups. Always content to do, because of World quests. Even get random groups going so we can finish on several characters...
---
The game is as social as it ever was, I just think the social aspect grew away from some of us, and maybe don't find it as easy. Because it is not "forced" onto us, by the game being too streamlined(Which I agree with).
---
I honestly don't care for the story, I care for the gameplay. And I love grinding, and the game is as grindy as it ever was...
---
It’s hard to decide when every class is good. Damn you blizzard of the past making everything unique and awesome!
---
Unless he put A LOT of work into faking the client, I think it's legit.
---
To be fair, most first waves are extremely small. I remember the Overwatch beta the only people I played with were blizzard employees and streamers.
---
Not talking about the recent beta, but I recall this being the case at least once or twice in the past.
---
Pink ponytail time!
---
My guess it that it will definitely be release ^^^^before^^^^ Jan 1, 2020.
---
I did nelf hunter in vanilla and human Paladino on all other expac..  this time I will try undead mage! Really like their casting animations.
---
Warlock here. I'm skipping primary professions till 60, but my plan is Tailoring/Enchanting. My focus is raiding, and Tailoring provides some of the best gear throughout each phase with the epic robe in phase 1 to the ZG recipes for Bloodvine. 
---
I'm taking Enchanting because it has great synergy with Tailoring and is a good source of income.
---
i now :c
---
I think you misread my post. I don't care if there are people who enjoy a 500 pop server. I want there to be options for people who want to play on higher pop servers.
---
Triggered? I mean I'm worries about the caps being too low so I guess I am a bit triggered... Maybe not enough to call a random person I don't know a 
---
&gt;fucking moron
---
Cant speak for him either, and I dont necessarily hate streamers altogether, but a few ones like Asmongold that are strongly opinionated and not very mindful about what they say and the kind of influence they have affect a lot of people, especially younger ones, to think in the same ways they do.
---
There are some who are just there for pure entertainment purposes and try to refrain from influencing their audience, but the ones that use their position to influence their audience to think a certain way are pissing me off.
---
You can tell that some of these people are just regurgitating the opinion of their favourite streamer and I think thats horrible. Of course, its not all the streamers fault but it still makes you hate them.
---
Again, some are fine. I used to watch summit1g a couple years ago and he seemed fine and usually just minded his own business / entertainment.
---
Guess I’ll figure it out! Thanks for the inputs!
---
and my axe!
---
All this speculation reminds me of a pregnant woman having contractions. Are we giving birth today or is it a false alarm? (Oh, gross, what is the equivalent to the water breaking?)
---
I think the most viable version of what your talking about is going up to Nature's Swiftness in resto and then dumping the rest into Feral. You can get by with that even in raids.
---
Although if you're just playing casually (ie not raiding) spec however you want,  you can heal every dungeon even if you have 0 points in Resto.
---
+1 for ponies - my daughter loves that show.
---
...it's actually pretty good...
---
I farmed that set for my Tauren Shaman, or at least what I could get
---
Felt like a total baws with that helm and shoulder
---
I agree with you. However, do not underestimate the extent of which some people will go to in order to get loot or other rarities in games. Especially in WoW.
---
You should consider higher level items, not craft able gear within the first 10% of your leveling progression.
---
100% yes. Something is happening in about 2 hours from now.
---
Agreed. I love healing, good thing, because all my friends refuse to do anything but dps 😂
---
Hi, /u/simplepirate
---
Can someone explain the hate of WoW Classic content? I truly don't understand.
---
The plot thickens
---
oh this thread can only go well
---
backstab positioning honestly rarely comes up in raids. the only ones I can think of that are significantly affected are thaddeus, thekal, some trash in AQ40, Ossirian maybe. Nothing huge
---
I dont think having the client is a big deal. IIRC he's just kept it installed since the blizzcon trial.
---
heheheh my daughter love it too
---
its why i know so much about the show
---
cause of my daughter
---
which I have
---
You’ll be fine as combat. You won’t necessarily be able to global someone but you can still put out high dps and if you time your stubs and vanish properly you’ll be fine.
---
son, have a seat
---
I quit my job, my relationship, gave my child up for abortion and sent my family to hell. I know streamers wouldn't abuse my trust.
---
You could time a jump so the Warrior would complete the charge but not be close enough to immediately attack.
---
Yeah, there's really no excuse for not doing good research.  We all come across incorrect information on the internet.  People that make videos just want to make a quick video without working too hard.  That's the wrong way to do it.
---
I don't have an issue with him not playing Vanilla and being a content producer, but he needs to do his research if he's getting things wrong.  Otherwise it's just not being genuine.
---
Just watch MrGm, the hype is insane, his got his client up
---
Mind Blast hits harder than Smite and I get bored waiting for Holy Fire to cast - I usually MB &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand then alt-tab for 15 seconds.
---
I hope it does but doubt it will release. Tbh I'm not interested in the race to 60 thing at all but if you think bliz / the fans care about would they really go for a stealth release? My 2c, hope I eat my words
---
I pulled the plug on my grandma so that I could get home to watch Staysafe! I’ll make sure that I’m too sick to make the funeral. Thanks Staysafe very cool!
---
The axe went to Yorkshire terrier ☹️
---
Switching factions. Will main a new class, but will have my old one as an alt.
---
There's also a ClassiCast today. It is possible that they might have a dev in the cast who is going to talk about alot of the things they have been working on.
---
It’s a closed beta client , should be up in 9 minutes.
---
The rumor mill spins with uncertainty. Best guess is beta announcement amd or launch.
---
Is there a list of who went to Irvine?
---
My old ass took the day to lime my lawn, not realizing there may be some classic news dropping today. Now that my work's all done, bring it on!

exactly it’s hyped up so i’m hoping for a release date.

hybrid druid is the shit

soo fun to play

---
It’s highly illegal to share links and unfortunately you’re in big trouble bud
---
Do it like I will, play at work! When boss comes in, just use the good ol' alt+tab
---
I really hope you meant adoption* :/
---
No it is not legal, I have contacted the internet police.
---
I only hit 24 on my rogue before TBC came out.  I'll be rolling a new character though.  I was thinking Druid, but I might change my mind later on.  Always Horde though.
---
Closed beta client is out in 9 minutes, they just want you to watch them play it.
---
It’ll be pandas.
---
Shamans are good to have, but not to be.
---
no fun allowed.jpg
---
I'm still convinced it's going to be released quite a bit later than some folk think - beta testing sometimes takes months, even public betas can last over a month, so end of July at the earliest is my guess.
---
However, since I have a non-refusable family get together on 21 June, Murphy's Law would dictate that as the most likely date.
---
Lmao, op seems butthurt that no one gives a fuck about this guy.
---
He probably has a point as far as solo playability, the only real top-tier spec is elemental once you get completely bonkers gear.  Even an enh with Might of Menethil still struggles just getting kited for days or getting torn about by rogues or warriors because of the low armor and melee defenses. 
---
Resto is pretty good as a healer though. 
---
Everyone wants them in PVE because they boost the other classes so much, like a paladin, but their personal performance tends to suffer as a result
---
Dude you are getting trolled, are you really that gullible?
---
the streamer cancer is way too much at this point
---
Depends. When i was MT. I was helping guildies get attuned, or helping guildies get their 0.5 gear from dungeons. I took all the greens/blue's that where not needed to finance my raiding repairs. but those where guildies, so they where happy to give it to me.
---
Later, i needed an alt. prot can't farm for shit. In PVP you wont die in a 1v1, but you aint killing annyone either :P
---
You can still do dungeonruns for fee's if you have a decent reputation on the server.
---
I dont even watch these streams but the irony here cracks me up.
---
I dont see a single comment in here that's "toxic" coming from self proclaimed streamer fans.  The only toxicity is from people like you, who are full of hate and vitriol for a stranger on the internet.
---
The Blizzcon demo said 2004-2018 Blizzard Entertainment on the bottom, the one he has says 2004-2019.
---
But we'll see.
---
The sock also functions as a mop if you miss, very cool!
---
Oh damn, how many years will it be for me?
---
That's because you're a fucking casual who listens to young thug and wants a mobile version of wow. 
---
I'm honestly fucking confused as hell how you even wound up in this thread.  Probably just a towlie fan tbh.
---
Niiice

he pressed it back into it's mothers womb and aborted it

&gt;since there are no muscles in the fingers

^^^What ^^^the ^^^fuuuuck.
---
Never watched mr.gm seems like a genuine dude
---
Not too bad tho
---
Closed beta
---
The mods removed the stickied blue posts. This can only mean something big is dropping.
---
Have fun mate
---
Would be so infuriating it would be funny. Would begin to think blizzard troll.
---
Yo, that title is fucking aids, lol

Is there a flair for (rumor) or something, lol

we are the pillars of their success they dont lie

Pepega

I can get behind this content creator to be the face of wow classic

(Maybe)
---
I sold my cat, my goldfish, and my salamander just to have less responsibilities. I quit my job and invested my reduced 401k into split shares between Acti/blizz and junk food companies. 
---
I told my fiance that she needs to cook meals and bring me fresh, warm clothes from the dryer every 6 hours to keep my body heat slightly above average to stimulate brain power and to keep my arms in a perpetual state of energy. (I found this tip online in one of those really convincing popup ads)
---
Thanks Staysafe, without you being a true pioneer and visionary, my 3 pets would still need to be cared for today.
---
Hope it pays off, wish me luck!
---
Lol Why does anyone listen to him?
---
Who cares what they are calling you if you genuinely don't care about the 'streamer culture'. Just keep killing :)
---
Closed beta client
---
I mean, what is considered the last day of summer, I expect it to release 3 days after that knowing blizzard
---
I'm recreating my old main as my main alt. Gnome mage :) but going warrior as my main.
---
Not sure if I could have worded that worse...
---
cute af
---
A friend and I once kited Hogger and ended up inside Undercity, but someone killed him there :(

Why exactly are you so upset?

It's time to stop. SLAT!
---
Everyone who took Vacation will be hugely disappointed. I have no idea why these people put out all that Hype, its made people believe they can play it today.
---
**FBI OPEN UP**
---
Your mistake was not photoshopping an Office characters face onto Pinkie Pie. Or a dog. Probably could've flown under the radar
---
#nochanges
---
I am mostly talking about the "followers" they are absolutely zealous nuts and fanatics
---
Thats really nice. Revenge tastes good i guess
---
Does that make him a legend then, since legends never die?
---
If it would be just a re-launch, it would be out already. This is a 'remaster', which is a complete project, not just re-releasing something without changing it. They are pretty much updating the whole thing, while trying to keep everything as same in spirit to the original as possible.  
---
The work they have to do to properly set up everything takes time, and lots and lots of testing. To say that it's just a re-launch in such a dismissive way shows that you probably have no idea how much work goes into remastering a game.  
---
(Source: I'm a software dev, though not in gaming, but I don't doubt there are similarities in processes)
---
lol this cat looks really impressive
---
Fair question, I’ve been wondering this too. A couple things that suggest it: blizz said “see you in classic early summer 2019” —kinda vague but this would be early summer; also it seems like some streamers have inside knowledge and have been faintly leaking a beta release this week. 
---
Other than those, I don’t know the source of the expectation. Maybe there was something else I missed.

"we chose to bring back collectors edition pets for wow! the following streamers will exclusevily get all three vanity pets for their characters because of their constant support and promotion of classic: ... be sure to pay them a visit on their classic home server if you want to take a look at the pets i action and salute your heroes"
---
God i love darkshore
---
I am "retired" so I have everyday off. Did make sure to mow the yard and get my chores done for the week tho ;)
---
Because I can buy the game and then pay the price of the game to skip the previous couple of games to get to the game I bought!
---
On a more serious note tho, even if I'm not the person you asked, questing and leveling ARE better in some aspects in the current game mainly with regatds to the production value, it would be unfair to claim otherwise, but that came bundled with making them virtually impossible to fail and completely soloable, which can be a big turnoff for a lot of people playing an mmo like myself, however, I do acknowledge that a lot prefer it that way.
---
Funny cause I'm actually playing No Man's Sky while waiting for WoW Classic. xD
---
\[1. General\] \[RussianTank\]: LFM Strat Live, all orbs and flask res. Need DPS and heals PST.
---
&gt;  Prot tanks are fun in pve but they are shit for consistent gold farming 
---
Two words:
---
Strat Live
---
This is my advice but it's likely that your guild can help out too. There are a lot of perks for MT in guilds, 1st being that they'll be the best geared(altho prot gear) just for the guilds benefit. It also makes sense for the guild to ease the repair cost of MT's too since they will be wearing the most expensive gear(Plate and higher tier gear).
---
Outside of the guild help, you'll still need that alt to more sufficiently farm up the needed stuff, unless you can get all you need by MT 5 man for resources.
---
it's like sharding
---
one minute it's at your side
---
next moment it's gone
---
Better have a good amount of time on your hands as well as the alt. But besides that you get your dick sucked constantly and get all the loot first so that’s a plus
---
You claim that Classic will be casual friendly because it "encourages exploration, it's not a race". That is total bullshit.
---
The obvious answer is that the classes are good at different things and serve different purposes. There is no overall worst class.
---
For example, druid healers are fine, can even be the best healers in some situations, but not all, same goes for every healing class.
---
But even if druid healing is the best in least situations, druids excel in other areas that the other healers don't, like say, flag carrying.
---
It comes down to preference ultimately
---
Oh.. you won't be going to jail.   Your punishment is going to have your computer replaced with one from 2007 loaded with... Windows Vista, and dial-up internet.   The only phone you'll have access to is a landline and your phone number will be given to every telemarketer across the world.
---
May God have mercy on your soul.
---
I understood it perfectly fine, you said you’re rolling a worgen warlock right? 😜
---
I was there in November. But I don't want to play vanilla with bugs. I can play on one or two private servers right now and experience pretty much no issues (at least nothing at all that I found from 1-60). One of the biggest things an official release has going for it is not feeling like a discount experience.
---
Dude your entire post history is pure toxicity. Go outside. Get a hobby. This isn't healthy.
---
I'm actually going to revert and multishot your sheeps!
---
A) you can still log into the demo client from Blizzcon that says "classic" on it.
---
B) you can somehow download the client from the CDN and use it for data mining and shit (I am not sure the specifics so this comment is not completely correct, close enough tho)
---
What was your old main?
---
Aww bummer :(  
---
Good luck though finding a good group, there are lots out there!
---
Zug zug!
---
I think its just a “next best thing” to a solid release date.  At least if beta is up and running you can assume its not long away.
---
You can’t use MB twice. Getting bored is not a very good argument.
---
Amateur. I killed my entire family and all co-workers, friends, neighbors and associates. I also set fire to other homes in my neighborhood that might decrease my Internet performance. I only called in sick today from work. You know, don't want to overreact.
---
Yes, back in early cataclysm I met a guy I'd later end up flying halfway across the world to meet.
---
Started with mammoths in wotlk, which I thought were cool at the time. They had a trade skills vendor and a repair guy. Helpful if you were pvping outside say, ulduar, with the guildies and needed a quick repair or needed a vial to make a consumable for someone who forgot theirs without hearthing and resummoning.
---
After that blizz just went with “let’s make them bigger and more colorful and obnoxious”
---
Will most likely just use the same client version as the live WoW.
---
West coast? Because the Lan I go to does the same thing and can only find them at Safeway lol.

Yeah I know, especially because I'm playing during work so it's always good getting invisible when a customer calls.

And also I love their mounts, so it's probably not that bad.
---
Having done hundreds of strat live runs in the last couple years, yea, I’m aware. That’s why I said to take those opportunities when they arise. But you’ll still benefit from an alt in the long run.

---
That has a 20 year cooldown though
---
Oh yea the pants too I forgot about those. Rings are Might of Cenarius, and Signet Ring of the Bronze Dragonflight. They are for the dps set, Dark Iron is for tank. I suppose you only need to farm one of them if you get the Circle of Applied Force out of BWL, but aside from that they are BiS until Naxx.
---
I met my bestfriend on runescape back in 2000, when wow launched we both started playing that aswell, fast forward almost 20 years later, he has been there for the birth of my child, and a shoulder to lean on, living on separate sides of the country and yet to this day, we still never met eachother irl. Its amazing what connections you make online and how they transcend the virtual space.
---
Blabla mandatory blabla mandatory my ass
---
Well there’s a &gt; 5% chance to be correct every week from now which increases exponentially until the end of September
---
I killed my family because he told me to eliminate all distractions.
---
&gt;These people are nuts
---
continues to hang out here anyways.
---
Hey can you shoo away some of the rats down there under the bridge?
---
They are not your friends. The Horde is, brother.
---
Yeah 8 PST or what the time of the countdown was is 17:00 herr :D no need for time off.
---
I wish you the best! Don't be afraid to ask players around you if you're feeling lost. The classic community in general is a lot more talkative and friendly to newcomers! I love helping people with quests and giving them buffs to help them out. I'm sure a lot of others do too. :D
---
WHile true, it's a little difficult and situational to use.
---
The person you sac might also get CC'd in some way, or Purged.
---
That's the only thing it is, "epic". Back when most people got into the show it wasn't epic at all, that's not what was good about it.
---
one word:
---
 redundancy
---
Barrens is more like a continent of its own..
---
Break his legs so he can't escape.
---
Every streamer no adays just "reacts" to videos. I saw a video of Asmongold reacting to someone else reacting to someone else. It's surreal.
---
There is also an alpha Client though
---
I think a single streamer may be able to do something like that but not all of them will be. I think the teasing is real, we're getting (closed) beta. Maybe even a release date.
---
We wants a release date. Gives it to us raw and wriggling!!!
---
Nms was bad because it was hyped to be something it wasn’t.  If they were too soon on the release date it was by about 2 years
---
Now you mention it I do have a water feature in my garden that's difficult to traverse
---
Always chose grades over games
---
Who else is ready to avoid every single realm that streamers play on?
---
I didn't mean everyone, specifically just people like you that are going this insane about something that will not affect them whatsoever. 
---
Get a life, weirdo
---
Okay, story time (tl;dr at the bottom):  
---
Way back in vanilla, I played a gnome warlock with a handful of friends Alliance side. We had a guild, did dungeons, dueled outside Stormwind, sat in Crossroads, and all the other usual stuff.
---
Then, one day, a very well geared troll shaman found us when we were dueling. And killed us. He killed all of us. Repeatedly. For many days. Weeks. We'd fight back and occasionally kill him but this was back when windfury was nuts and we weren't the greatest players. It was brutal.
---
One day he comes to gank us, but we had a plan ready:  Our priest would mind control him. Now, back in vanilla, there was a bug where people could communicate with the opposite faction by using a "/e" emote when the enemy is mind controlled. Out pops the shaman, the priest gets off a mind control, and we send him our Ventrilo info through the emote.
---
The shaman logs in immediately and we all became immediate friends.
---
Fast forward \~12 years: I'm still playing games with this shaman. In fact, he's one of two people from that friend group that I still have contact with. I've talked with this person almost daily for 12 years. I finally met him in person after more than a decade when I flew him up for my wedding to be my best man. He's my longest running friend outside of family.
---
One of the people in that original friend group ended up becoming his wife. They had a their first kid a couple years ago.
---
So thank you, Blizzard. Thank you for an amazing game that built a universe where we could create memories like these. Thank you for making windfury so broken and stupid that we devised an intricate plan to communicate with the shaman who had been beating us into the dirt for weeks. But most of all, thank you for a bug in vanilla that let you briefly communicate with members of the opposite faction through a spell that one of my friends happened to have.
---
tl;dr: Got rekt by the same troll shaman for weeks in vanilla. Gave him our vent info thanks to a bug and, 12 years later, he married someone in vent that day and became the best man at my wedding.
---
I'm no fan of content creators but they are undoubtedly a more active means of engaging the hype train when it comes to promoting games.
---
You are wrong.
---
You can go back in VoD and clip it :)
---
Upvote because hotted is a treasure
---
so it's all a bunch of BS
---
I actually happened to have vacation this week as well. Lucky me
---
Wow, people must hate Towelliee, lol
---
really trying to decide between lock or druid.
---
What a guy
---
no u r mental
---
Never login on them
---
I tanked through out vanilla and I disagree with nearly every point in this thread.
---
The things that will kill you financially are repair costs and respeccing(because you can't do much of anything else).
---
The PROBLEM with tanking is, most guilds already have their tanks, they're mostly the leaders or close friends/officers. You're going to spend most of your time on the side lines, being 3rd or even 4th strand tank.
---
You're going to mostly be pugging without being the MT in a guild and those raids IMO aren't worth your time, they're usually shit.
---
If you're going to MT for a guild, start your own guild with a few friends. It's almost impossible to get into the MT spot in a guild, let alone the OT spot.
---
Good luck.
---
or that it lasts for more than a day
---
&gt; all the info he has will come from him. 
---
Sure, then why is MrGm, on a Classic client login screen, with a timer with an hour.  
---
Surely he has something to announce.
---
&gt; If Blizzard honestly believes that qualifies as "good" PR, then they are  so completely out of touch that I honestly fear for their future. 
---
Doesn't mean that you Blizzard is out of touch, just that you are no longer in their target market.
---
Going into details for over 5 minutes about a mobile version of the game does not fit my definition of a low effort meme.
---
MrGM has a countdown plus some sort of Classic client open on stream right now, so I doubt Towelliee is the only one with info.
---
I hate this current streamer environment we're in. Wish I didn't have to watch insufferable "entertainers" for news on a game I've loved since it first released. Oh well.
---
I was an offtank in a progression guild. We were in Naxx when I hit R12. 
---
That feeling when raiding is 'taking a break from WSG for a couple of hours'.
---
I think a beta is good for us to get a more accurate view for what to expect however, beta won't be anything like it was for vanilla. It's more likely to stress test and show off/promote the game more than anything else. 
---
Vanilla beta lasted for about  9 months and in early iterations, 60 wasn't even the cap yet. IIRC, players were capped out at 50 for while until they added the level 50+ zones and increased the cap to 60. Then only later did they test Ony and the like of end game stuff.
---
As for me, I have no interest in player Beta a lot, although I would mess around a bit if I had access. Will I be upset if I don't get Beta access? nope, not at all. I be much happier just getting a release date. As for now, I'm being using a pserver to warm up for Classic, and that'll do far more for me than any Beta could at this point.
---
It’s not bad, I’ve leveled a paladin to 60 and it’s really relaxing. Actually sort of similar to priest. And I’m with you on being more of a support player now days, I just love finding groups fast and not having to deal with a bad tank or healer :p
---
Putting the max dps discussion aside, Seal Fate is a good middle ground if you want to do both pvp and pve. It might not be absolutely the best for neither, but it's good enough to be effective. I had a slot in a guild raid group up to C'thun and did most of my rank14 journey using Seal Fate build back in the day.
---
Then again, most of people didn't care about min/maxing back in the day, it'll be interesting to see how the community has changed its attitude over these 15 years.
---
That is my whole point. Average is 10 days played, some will be less, some will be more. You will only be competing with the people online when you are, with normal population caps if you spend any real effort to get ahead a little it doesn't matter when you start. Many will be casuals or tourists, those people will not level nearly as fast as someone who is trying to go faster. As soon as you outlevel them and get into a range where you have multiple good zone options (20 or so) you will not have to worry about being crowded.
---
I said that vanilla encouraged exploration upon release, and then referenced classic when I said that we can’t unlearn what we’ve learned. If  Classic was released with no knowledge of vanilla, it would be a similar experience. To your point, it’s a race if you want it to be, but a large population of players have been very vocal on the fact that they will be taking their time with classic. You misinterpreted my comment.
---
So if this ends up being a bunch of bullshit, I'll be pissed. I'll trust you guys to post the info, I'm not giving that guy views or clicks.
---
Yeah the Creed fucked me up. The gnome was good too.
---
Flip a coin! I’ve been going back and forth on priest or warrior for weeks now and it takes up all my mental free time but it makes the work day go by faster lol.
---
What did you think was going to happen on launch day on a high pop realm?
---
True, but hard to do sometimes. But I had most problems with locks and priests.
---
You need to be on your A-game every raid.  Can't forget flasks, need to stay current on resist gear, your guild will expect you not to miss any raids.  Farming for repair bills and potion costs suck as prot.
---
It's treason then
---
You should see the vast emptiness that is Ironforge.
---
Can’t be too safe. Check all the boxes.
---
he is a giant douchebag tbh
---
INTJ - Alliance - Warlock
---
Nope I don't believe that
---
Release date for sure. I know what vanilla is like lol I don't need to play a beta I just want to know when it's coming out.
---
Hot take: OP rolls on a server with a bunch of retail kids. Trade chat gets spammed cause no one knows where to complete quests. Mages want 15G for a port and OP can’t finish wailing caverns cause the tank is trying to aoe down 3 pulls at once. OPs server goes from high pop to low by week 2. Feels bad. Re-reads my comment and sighs...then subscribes to my twitch channel
---
Does a sitting opponent = 100% critical chance?
---
What I think was better about quests in classic was quest chains. Quest chains that started in one zone and took you to multiple other zones to complete it. It was more work but if you were reading the quests and paying attention the lore aspect of it was great. I leveled to 120 is BFA and I just did these independent quest hubs that didn't feel related in any way, there was so many quests that they didn't feel important "Ah I'll just skip this entire place and finish leveling in a different zone". Theres also dungeon quests that felt important and made dungeons more interesting especially things like the SM, RFD and Mara quests (thrash blade etc.) Oh and also elite or group quests, great way to make the world feel dangerous. Getting stomped by elites trying to solo a tough quest put you in your place, and caused you to interact with other players to group up. Helping other players when you didn't need too was a great way to make friends as well.
---
Why cant people relax?  There is such a thing as a patch.  They've been doing it for quite some time now.  If something isnt right I'm sure we will collectively let them know.
---
He’s been on the classic client login screen since like yesterday. Probably before
---
Thank you sharing. From this video, I learned I need to play a feral druid. I now feel safe in life. Durid 4 戦い
---
literally exactly whats going to happen
---
every single big streamer on twitch will be doing one run of deadmines and then do "community" stuff, just to drop classic a day later for the next sponsored event
---
What happened to the sticky posts on this sub?
---
THE MODS KNOW SOMETHING
---
hammers up am i right guys 😆🤣😆🤣😆🤣
---
I don't hate any streamer. I just hate that it wasn't Blizzard teasing us about the game. It's all being done through streamers, and some people don't want to rely on information coming through Twitch.
---
Exactly this. We all know what's right around the corner when beta hits. The sense of progression is what we're really after.
---
Getting in the beta would be nice though. For one, the community will be different than private servers. But we also get to check out new graphics and such.
---
We'll just watch MrGM restream it tho. It's fine. POG
---
Posted a new thread of MrGM Said...
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/UglyProudSharkFailFish
---
College is the best time to play WoW so much free time
---
Good.
---
We will find out in 50 min
---
lol imagine playing druid
---
MrGM has openly said multiple times this week that he personally has no info and is just going with the hype the other streamers that apperently do have info have generated. The client he has is the current Alpha/Beta client but everyone can get that.
---
you don't have to watch them... Just check for updates on Reddit.
---
I met my ex girlfriend raiding, she was pretty cool but it didn't work out.
---
Can we get a tldr for those who are currently at work or so and cant watch it rn
---
Dude thats next level. You can just pre-insert your cock in to the sock and go whenever you need to. This is revolutionary.
---
If you dont leave the room you should be fine. It only smells if you breath fresh air before entering your dungeon
---
I was the front end manager at a CompUSA when we would have lan parties for og halo and classic wow.  I would discount 10 cases of bawls down to cost and bring them home to the party.  It was like I was bringing home all the beer haha
---
Bawls will make its return
---
Hey OP you know when Hello Kitty Online Classic is launching?
---
Alliance Best Faction
---
Dwarves Best Race
---
NO PROBLEM!
---
TLDR? I am at work
---
I will say this, MrGM and Staysafe and Tipsout seem to be more teasing, Towelliee has been pretty straight forward with what he is saying. Yesterday I posted a clip of him saying tomorrow is a normal stream (ie today) and that there MAY be a 24hr stream sometime this week, randomly, maybe
---
I know at some point it was like that but don't remember if it was like that in vanilla already. I was trying to remember that same thing.
---
You don't HAVE to watch shit. People will repost the information minutes later here.
---
I am not that try hard, I assure you, he said it.
---
The enemies are supposed to be hidden, after all
---
I want to recreate my vanilla warrior so badly, I'm just afraid I won't have the time to gear him like I did back in the day.. I'm considering playing something less gear dependant this time around.
---
in one hand, i understand people hating on them, but on the other hand, its hilarious
---
Gods it was treason then.
---
Were playing on all the servers. Good luck
---
Same boat. Boss wants to know and I just stare back at him like an idiot. It's not a great plan but it's all I've come up with so far. 
---
Pretty sure no matter when the release date is, it will be smack in the middle of something "Important" lol
---
Wonder what's in that link
---
That's good to hear! I agree, it's easier to do it yourself and getting groups fast is a nice bonus.
---
Filesize of Beta is 10gb.
---
I’m not sure why the vanilla zealots are so hard up about you tubers either. So what they are putting out videos to reach out to different people. I would argue that they generate more hype than anyone redditor does.
---
File size of beta is 10gb. The client he is using at least.
---
Beta is 10.5gb (shows folder on his PC). You can download it the way you download normal wow, through the launcher, whenever it shows up for you
---
I believe you
---
The file size is 10.4GB for the beta client, or perhaps even less.
---
Also a dick move for staysafe to tell people to take sick day today if nothing is going to happen
---
TL;DR He is talking about the current size of the Alpha/Beta Client being 10GB.
---
tldr: he is talking about the file size of the beta client, 10gb
---
its nothing
---
Huh cool, did not know and now I feel more informed :)
---
If your goal is to get to 60 asap, it’s in your best interest to start as early as possible. All I’m saying.
---
Well as a OCE player it'd be nice to test some stuff out without having to play on EU private servers with 350ms
---
Nothing to see here
---
This needed like 10x more upvotes
---
I will MAKE IT legal
---
I feel like the radio silence from Blizzard is where I have the issue. No blue post. Nothing from Blizzard. Just streamers... way to outsource your community engagement Blizz. I don’t hate streamers/content creators. I just want to be able to get my info strait from Blizzard. I miss Ghostcrawler...
---
Release date easily.
---
My original was a rogue. Switched to priest right before BC was released and mained that pretty much after that. I'm thinking about going mage or warrior tank, this time.
---
Hi, /u/Meowtar
---
Ya, that was rough one for me. I know he was partially joking but he should have known what people would think. We will see what happens in 47 minutes.
---
Was funny at the start, then the story sounded like an oddly specific rant. Bet the narrator mained a rouge.
---
This isn't hate, just parody.
---
I keep popping in and out of this stream. Its really hard to watch lol.
---
The dude just isn't my cup of tea and his notification sounds are some of the most irritating shit I've heard in awhile.
---
I would think so as well at first, but it's less about the mechanics of a boss that force you to not be behind it, but rather the situations in a raid, where you end up not being behind it, even for a few moments. The tank moves, taunts, aggro etc. 
---
Being at a disadvantage with daggers is less an issue, because a raid boss inherently prevents you from being behind, but rather because you lose seconds here and there, potentially wasting energy, cooldowns etc. due to being out of position.
---
adsghadsfgsxdycvasdfgafsdvadfg..... you feel me?
---
my link? watch it fam
---
Thanks
---
TLDR beta size is 10.4 gb
---
also: redundancy
---
Just watching the streams at work like I assume most people are tbh. And sure if it gets busy and I can't watch it, I'll just check this subreddit for the one line of text that actually matters.
---
Not wasting a day off so I can get a release date for a game, thats fucking insane. Maybe if I had to pick a day off within the next 2 weeks I'd have went with today but thats about it
---
Raided on the smallest german server in wotlk, I quit in May 2010 after Prof hc. Started vocational training in the very north of germany, not far away from my hometown in august. We talked about what games we played, some of us used to play wow so we talked about the servers we were on. Turned out that the guy from Freiburg (about as south as it can get in germany) was the shadow priest that I used to raid with the last 1.5 years. He moved 700 kilometers to start the same training as me (without knowing that I would be there)
---
Same. It's as if my brother is allergic to supporting others in any kind of way. A true rogue I must say! I guess he is doing his part by ganking allies nonstop.
---
k.
---
and you can download it whenever it shows up for your via the launcher
---
From what I understand he didn't even go to Blizzard like the other streamers, and didn't play Vanilla either. He has been like this (shitty teases) for some time now. Probably gets more viewers/money.
---
As am I. On Live, anything from 79-120 gives nothing but a talent row. (I don't count Azerite Armor, as we don't get that by leveling.)
---
Just watch out for piercing howl or fear bomb
---
Tipsout basically just said on stream that Beta is available for streamers today and the release in a 'couple of months'. So it's limited beta and a release date. That's what we're getting.
---
All of this is true.
---
derp
---
Sad reacts only
---
Not giving them views. Will just see it on here or the site, soon enough.
---
Heroes only get remembered.
---
Troll post. Hes on title screen which anyone can do atm.
---
Some people pick things purely for aesthetics and class feel as opposed to min/maxxing their odds of winning 1v1s .
---
I have a similar setup but I need a wireless keyboard and mouse and something like a couch master setup.
---
You completely misunderstood him and are now misinforming people here. He said that all the information will come from him, there would be no need to watch anyone else because he will have all the info in one place, not that he will be the only one.
---
They’re skipping classic and going straight into wow legion. As it was more popular
---
These mounts are the biggest turnoff in retail for me, it completely ruins the immersion.
---
I cant say I love Towelliee either but he seems to be the most level-headed through this process and seems to be trolling us far less than everyone else is. Everyone else is having a field day teasing their viewers and playing with us, Towelliee is just like, I have info... Ill show you at 8am, thats it guys
---
No, fans do it for the love of the game. Streamers do it for attention or for tangentical ad revenue.
---
links
---
Of all the things the Classic team has done so far, giving these "content creators" the opportunity to reveal any news like this was the first real misstep in my opinion. We're not a community that look up to these people, we just want the news goddamnit. This is a far better strategy when you use streamers and such that are already big on their own, see the release of Apex Legends for example.
---
Lmao this is the demo from blizzcon
---
Feign death shadowmeld is pretty damn good. Stoneform on a hunter is a giant pain for rogues too.
---
Did you play mages or warlocks on a vanilla realm before? 
---
You just can't make a decision by playing a class for a few hours without growing with them.... Who tells you that you played the classes right?
---
I understand that. But there does seem to be a large audience of people that hate these vanilla content creators. The tips out / stay safes of the world
---
Yea said " YOU WILL SEE WHAT YOU WILL BE PLAYING" i mean there ya go.
---
Working bro.
---
I can just walk from my room to my bathroom I think, mental idea I know but it just might work
---
MrGM has said the entire time that he's just waiting to find out what's being announced today, like everyone else. His countdown just seems to be be a countdown to when this supposed announcement is happening and he'll be talking about it as it happens. It doesn't necessarily mean he knows or will be announcing anything himself.
---
The client login screen may just be a backdrop to fit the theme of his stream. It wouldn't be too difficult to whip up a fake client screen.
---
What about the loss of Exploration exp?
---
Ahhh yes... Shields. ... Where no damage = no rage... :(
---
The feenix one for private servers is 5gb but theyre actually building Vanilla in Legion
---
Tips said:
---
- we can book vacation times today = release date inc
---
- we will see what things looks like today = beta
---
New rule, all twitch clips must include a tl;dr
---
I know what it is, I am just having fun like everyone else :)
---
These kind of stories make me wanna play this 15year old game really. Thanks for sharing
---
Anyone who has defecated at the computer has serious issues
---
Hi, /u/sneakyryan
---
He said "Few months"
---
So not July?
---
 In a few months from now  ??????? wtf
---
It's just the client he pulled from the CDN.
---
Mods just removed my post for saying this. Wth
---
Today you will see what you will be playing in a few months from now
---
Might roll an alt rouge called Blazeitmaggot and join you
---
Some coincidences written here are so nice. Awesome story
---
Down voting any new post that doesn't have actual content.
---
No :)
---
July 16th...
---
July 16...
---
I think it would be a good chance to stress test the servers and have both factions meet up in say, southern Duskwood and see how many players the retail client can handle on the world before sharding kicks in.
---
Yeah not going to be watching streamers play beta. Thankfully I haven't yet reached that level of boredom and emptiness in my life. 
---
To be fair, I also have no interest in playing in the beta either.
---
Obviously, clap
---
We have jobs. TLDW it.
---
Funny, because I think you are wrong.
---
Classic used 7.3.5 for the Blizzcon demo (which was later on made available for download), but that was an old version they were experimenting on before the official 8.0 BfA client was ready; their plan is to be on the same codebase/APIs with the live game, for obvious reason (compatibility with the OS, security fixes, anti-hack protections and so on). Just this April there was news that the classic was already updated to the 8.0 codebase, I suspect since then they've already migrated to 8.1 and I suspect for release they'll be on the 8.2 codebase.
---
TL;RD: "Today vacation days will be booked!" Which probably means we will get a release date in 39 minutes.
---
Huh, interesting, I've never noticed (I think). I'm not complaining tho, I'll adapt.
---
How nice. Keep the friendship going man
---
Again, I have no fucking clue how you wound up in a thread about a game you've never played defending a man you know nothing about.  But yeah I'm the crazy person.  
---
&gt;Get a life
---
I hear you havent achieved a fulfilled life until you seen young thug live lmao.
---
Super cringe how badly this has been handled.
---
Speedy the turtle was mah boi. He followed me everywhere I went.
---
Cool bro
---
In a few months?
---
God just freeze me now plz
---
I've been trying various routes as a priest from 1-10 with the additional requirement of crafting my own wand. It is very doable within only 3 hours as long as you are not a Night Elf (Launch time will be longer because of competition). After you get your first wand is when you would want to switch out. Until then, bank linen until you have 54-60 total (You can get by with less if you DE many green items), then craft bolts of linen, learn brown robe, DE brown robes till level 9 enchanting, make your own runed copper rod, then craft your first wand.
---
Ya, I would rather have had an official twitter post letting us know the date and time and then a blue post covering all the info.
---
Release date is apparently late July, take that with a grain of salt tho
---
My dog told me it's limited to second cousins for 50-60.
---
Totally agreed, came here to the comments to figure this out cus im not watching all of that
---
May the wind guide you man
---
Aren't you an edgy little fuck
---
Pretty sure it was 20s in Vanilla and later changed to 15.
---
Hes SUPER trolling the community right now.
---
Nobody believes you or cares, but can I have your stuff?
---
TL;DR It sounds like we will get a release date today ("vacations will be booked") and we will "see" the game we will be playing "in a few months".
---
when u die in the dungeon finding your way back back... Especially to them underground stegadons.
---
No but several live in another country and I’ve lost touch with them, which feels just as bad as losing contact with friends from school that you hope to see again
---
But they have a release date. A confirmed release date of at worst the last day of summer. All we are waiting around for is an "updated" release date to be any earlier than that. It's not like they have no release date and are waiting to polish all the stuff you're talking about. They basically set an exact date with a comment "or earlier"
---
Ah, it was MrGM showing "classic beta" folder on his computer saying it was 10.5gb and you can download it whenever it shows up on your launcher
---
I kited Volcan or whatever his name is, in Burning Steppes, to SW on my druid.  I had a video of it on that warcraftvids website or whatever in 2005-06.  Hard to believe that was almost 15 years ago.
---
A ‘few months’ man...
---
Was hoping for july so that i could play during my holiday, but now I bet it will release just as my college starts again
---
Good thing that 75% of the horde will be UD. ;D
---
Sorry, played for 3 weeks now - lvl 14 rogue.
---
lmaoo
---
Few months is more than 2 months.
---
Blizzard heard your cries for #NoChanges and you can expect Classic WoW to release on Aug. 22, which is when patch 1.12 originally released in 2006 :)
---
Undead rogue. You can hang out there. :)
---
Check that vanillafriends site. U might find them there
---
Many of my old guildies and I are still friends, to this day. We have seen each other grow, get married, have kids, etc. We still play games together on occasion, as well, and many of us will be joining wow classic (albeit on a much more casual basis than before).
---
:( my entire summer vacation without classic, then when my study starts again it will release but i wont be able to play. Really sucks...
---
It’s 23 seconds long bruh
---
Just keep refreshing gm reckons theres gonna be a blue post in 27 minutes
---
Like me trying to play wc3 but I can't find it anymore because they want people to pre-order the remastered
---
The safest bet right there
---
Yeah, they're obviously not going to let people kite Kazzak to SW this go around my friend.  That is an unrealistic expectation, I'm afraid.
---
Not at all. I hate every classic wow streamer, they are all annoying as shit.
---
You know who I fucking miss? Hayven. He had some of my favorite vanilla videos and he would probably be the only classic content creator I watched if he was still here today.
---
Thank you. Not gonna lie I'm gonna be a disappointend if all we get is a release date today, especially one that slips the original July 16 prophecy. These streamers know how to pump up a whole lot of nothing, bliz got some bang for their buck on this nonsense
---
Keep the friendship going lads
---
You are one pathetic, angry little ho.
---
I've been playing WoW a few years before Burning Crusade came out, played daily up until the ending of WOTLK. 
---
After that, the game got horrible, and still is. I can't wait for classic. 
---
It's time to stop bein a fuckin angry lil weirdo.  Go watch a game before you get shadowbanned again.
---
A beta release date or an actual release date.
---
Honestly couldnt care less about the beta tbh
---
I despise the you tube channel stuff for endless news/analysis. 
---
Some of the guides and such are great. But when it comes to news.. I can’t stand commercials where people get overly/fake excited and yell out pointless crap, or use click-Barty titles to try and get you to click on a web ad. Why the fuck are they replicating that format on a you tube channel?
---
Never mind the quality of some of the information given in an effort to be ‘first’ and get those views.
---
Yeah, fck me right ..... :/
---
yeah, that scares me though. few monthes = 2 - 3, which mean we will have a late July release at best or a end of august worst...
---
Yeah this has rubbed me the wrong way. Leave all this clickbait bullshit to Fortnite and Apex and keep Classic classy.
---
I am sad right now.
---
Im out too... means my holidays will be without classic, then when college starts it will release, but i dont have the damn time then...
---
That's the one I got mine fir 560 after tax. Pricey but get my money's worth. I can porn at 165hz is unreal
---
my eyes
---
i dunno, everyone is teasing news and hypothesizing. maybe i'm alone in this but i just don't think what hes talking about in his stream is that big a deal  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
He also said he's apparently a July 16th type of guy
---
"Couple" would mean 2. "Few" points to at least 3 full months IMO.
---
Nice remove after you found out you fell for another streamers bullshit.
---
Because fear makes people angry
---
I don’t see myself grinding hard tbh. I’ll play the game pretty chill. Thank you for the tips tho. Hopefully I enjoy it
---
Let's not start over-analyzing (wishful thinking). People use few and couple interchangeably all the time. It could mean July, it could mean December, who knows.
---
What can I say mr butthole, i just dont like tips
---
I am so glad this will be over in 34 minutes, this shit is getting outta hand
---
Its a sad day for all of us...
---
We're getting 1.13, not 1.12. Which *implies* that changes have been made to the game, which means that notable differences to an authentic vanilla wow could be present. I'm sure Blizzard has worked tirelessly to try to squash these differences, but having thousands of eyes looking through for errors is much better. Plus it would give public assurance that the product is up the that standard if it's coming from outside observers instead of Blizzard PR. If there are errors present at launch that we don't have a chance to preview before starting, a lot of people will be rightly put off of playing. Why shouldn't we have the opportunity to review Blizzard's work before putting down a subscription fee?
---
He is the worst. Like a little kid who was told that there was a special surprise treat for the tots after lunch.
---
I'm glad you spent your precious time reading throughout my entire post history. Go outside, get a life dood brofist.
---
This seems to be the most likely scenario from what "leaks" we have had today.
---
What a joke, closed beta for streamers? Are they going to play with all 4 of each other?
---
Yeah, you're right. I completely forgot. 
---
He also just said that's where he got it.
---
Nailed it. I got frustrated with this and just went pure PvP as arms and did 5 man tanking for cash. Best PvE bet is fury/prot and focus on your DPS gear and earn your way into the spot by being ready to tank but fully prepared to DPS and consistently show up with RL knowing you’re ready to tank if needed.
---
You made me ROFL out loud!
---
remove? What was removed?
---
You’re going to have to elaborate. “Knowledge how to acquire knowledge, means to do so” - Thottbot launched in 2001, and became a searchable database in 2004, when vanilla launched. 
---
“Gaming culture” and “the world being different now”
---
dafuq, i forgot warrior can't break poly, shite
---
some of us are at work and can't watch twitch buddy, regardless of how many seconds it is
---
Which also isn't what you said in the title
---
Yet you're here, like everyone else, glued to the screen. Money well spent by their marketing team.
---
You think *you're* ready? You should feel my nipples.
---
I don't need to MB twice. At lvl38 my Mind Blast is 150dps, Smite is 66dps and my lvl33 quest reward wand is 50dps. I can PW:S &gt; MB &gt; SW:P &gt; Wand and never have down time as I'll be at full mana when I start the next pull. If I start using Smite I'll barely kill things faster and have to waste a lot of time drinking.
---
And it continues.  I feel sadness for you.
---
I really don't get how people mention always they don't care and stuff but are also mad as fuck because some content creators have insider info.
---
Stop hating on Tips.  
---
He doesn't reveal anything here.
---
As long as its legion with no changes
---
It’s a beta... it doesn’t matter? Like playing on a private server. It’s not going to be there forever.
---
It's blocked a lot of places
---
Downvote any new posts without actual content
---
I'd say it could also be that people spread this information differently, and likely never gave this idea much thought.
---
Now if something big happens there's articles on game websites, a post on WoW forums, a post on every WoW subreddit...
---
Because those retail players are dropping subs between content drops.
---
If a retail content drop comes every 4 months, but all the content in that drop can be completed in a week, there is no reason for a lot of people to keep paying during those 3 months between facerolling all the content and new content coming out.
---
I don't actually play retail, but from what I understand it...
---
In Classic/TBC and to a lesser extend WotLK It took people a while, even the top guilds, to get through content.  To a point where a lot of people didn't get through in tier content, they were chasing that goal through the entire expansion.  (Plenty of people never saw Kel'thuzad or   Kil'jaeden)
---
In retail, there are faceroll versions of all content, all barriers to progress are forced.  The end game, as far as I can tell, is just doing progressively harder versions of the content against a clock? A leaderboard?
---
It's basically the difference between a tv show dropping all episodes at midnight and stringing them out over 6 months.
---
Except, in this example, retail is basically black mirror.  It's so short that everyone can binge watch it over a weekend regardless of whether they're a basement neck beard or they work two jobs.
---
Blizzard is basically HBO, and WoW is basically game of thrones.  And they're desperate for something to soften the massive drop in subs once the final episode airs
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Ok...back to pservers. Wait for next fresh, roll rogue, grief
---
I'm guessing a mage who was ganked incessantly by rogues.
---
Ouch
---
Screw you Tips, you don't represent us and you're a shit showman. Hope you broadcast this comment on twitch.
---
Apparently Tipsout says he's a July 16th kind of guy.
---
The Druid tangent was hilarious.
---
Real fucking unfair to give access to Beta only to streamers...
---
The way some of these big streamers are milking and hyping the fuck out of the end of an NDA is really off-putting to me. I'm looking forward to the news and content as much as anyone. But the way they(primarily Towellie, Tips, MrGM and Staysafe) has been teasing this is really unprofessional in my opinion.
---
Why are random youtube content vultures getting early access to a beta of the game?  Like what?
---
I've come to expect the "technically it's still summer". They pulled the "technical definition of the last day of fall" once when they promised a fall release. When a game company gives a window, always assume the end of that window.
---
I'm blind not deaf.
---
He said he's  a July 16th type of guy. Whatever you want to take away from that
---
no content no upvote
---
Yeah, let's skip straight to the cash shop.
---
I don’t either but it took you more time to type that comment than watch it
---
to be satan
---
I love me some madseason. It's so hard not to binge watch his videos
---
Yeah, if I'm being realistic I won't be able to beat the wave at the beginning if I took time off. I'd rather take the second week than the first.
---
10am EST was 31 minutes ago
---
Hmm, I thought Male and female undead were the same
---
 Damnit now I need more research.
---
yea i know i tricked him!! lo
---
Gamers rise up
---
&gt; There wont be a site or other stream to watch, all the info he has will come from him.
---
This statement implies, whether by intent or not, that the information that will be released today will only come from Towelliee.
---
I'd prefer a release date but I'm guessing if they announce the beta the release date will be announced at the same time.
---
to not play for 3 months
---
It is what it is. If you don't want to watch them, then you don't have to. Somewhere like mmo-champion will most likely have any all information written up and posted just as quick. Hell, even reddit.
---
Corrected to 11am, dunno why the website I checked failed me
---
Neither really. He either does data mining, or has a friend/connection that does data mining, because he typically posts when new stuff goes up on the blizz content delivery network or changes happen to the alpha/beta files. 
---
He also shit posts for attention/retweets so not everyone loves him.
---
I'm baffled a billion dollar company is going about a release like this. It weirdly unprofessional.
---
of course they do they make money from it
---
He also called july 16th people "flat eartherners" aka them being wrong.
---
It's past 10am EST. Do you mean tomorrow?
---
I would, but we have the completely blocked internet that barely allows anything.  I'm amazed Reddit isn't locked out, but youtube and twitch both are.
---
No, it doesnt. It says "all the info he has will come from him". Which implies that there will not be a site or stream he is getting his information from, he already has it and will share when he can
---
I'd recommend you find a guild with multiple raid times (multiple raid groups). This will allow you some flexibility. 
---
Also, when BWL releases I seriously doubt that everyone will be in MC/T1 gear. That is highly unlikely. Even when Naxx eventually gets released there will still be guilds clearing MC for the first time. 
---
Best of luck!
---
I'd just want to play around with addons.
---
It should still be like that. They changed the way sitting works for priest, warrior, and paladins talents so they can force procs.
---
K
---
I wish Blizzard would just make a post man I cant stand this clowns.
---
i dont hate any of the classic creators except for alexensual but it it would suck if it was media only
---
Your are playing on
---
what about it? :)
---
Rogues may have been retarded, this is 2019 a lot of rogues could be actually skilled now. 
---
Stun locking, then kiting in the intercept deadzone with Garrote Crippling and Rupture to restealth.
---
get out
---
Nah second week is too long. Maybe a day or two at max. If they includd sharding in starting zones its going to be even more easier.
---
I used to work with a non-native English speaker who was also the nicest and most proper guy I've ever met. He called in once complaining of "severe intestinal distress". 
---
It has been my go-to excuse ever since.
---
The drawback of SF has always been lack of crit throughout the main bulk of the content, and I don't think you can count on having full world buffs as consistently during Classic as you can on most private realms.
---
In general, Adrenaline Rush, Blade Flurry and +weapon skill has too big of an impact on your overall damage as a rogue in most raids. 
---
Seal Fate Dagger has a spot somewhere after AQ when acquiring full Deathdealer's set for the increased Eviscerate damage, the book for Backstab Rank 9 and Death's Sting from Cthun.
---
Some of us don't have signals on our phones in our buildings and twitch is blocked (but hilariously not reddit).  Could you not be difficult and cryptic as fuck and just tell people what he said instead of spending MORE time telling them to go watch it and how they should be able to...when they clearly can't...than it would take you to just tell them what it said?
---
Yeah I actually always thought he seemed pretty genuine.  And I think it’s hard to deny that he put quite a bit of effort into his class breakdown videos.  On several occasions his guests are not very talkative and he does a good job at getting the info out of them and presenting some good material. 
---
I’m not the biggest fan of his videos to be honest but I don’t think his content is all that bad.
---
Gotta beat that STV zerg though!
---
the fuck is up with these low quality bait posts? Are mods asleep?
---
Completely with you on that mentality, but the reason you're seeing these kinds of responses is that a mediocre MT ultimately has the potential to stall guild progression or even break the guild completely.  This is why it's so commonplace for the MT to be in a serious leadership position within the guild.
---
I started playing pservers a couple years ago and in order to get comfortable with tanking, I made the decision to try to secure an OT slot in the guild I was joining and just tanked absolutely everything I could get my hands on.
---
The best way to learn is to simply start tanking lowbie dungeons and progress your way to harder ones.  You'll learn patience, you'll learn how to properly mark things, you'll learn how to control the pacing of your group, you'll learn how to assemble a proper crew, you'll learn threat management, just everything.
---
As a tank, you have to be a vocal leader, even in basic dungeons like WC.  You are the chief decision maker in the group and nobody does anything without you. 
---
Aside from learning by experience, I recommend you just try to read everything you can get your hands on that has been published by veteran tanks.  Everything I described above can be learned by simple repetition, but the math behind threat management and the more advanced mechanics are topics you'll only really be able to explore in reading materials.
---
Good luck man!
---
I thought Stoneform worked on Sap
---
If you're right then sap = incapacitate, and blind = disorient, and stoneform only works on disorient, is that correct? In which case it would remove hunter Scatter shot too which is disorient?
---
I just wanted to ask if you had phones sorry I’m channeling my inner blizzard
---
STUPID
---
FAT
---
BLIZZARD
---
Oof. I only recently jumped on the Classic train and even I would have a difficult time stomaching a late August release.
---
Amazing visuals amazing acting, amazing music, all being wasted on shit writing.   That’s season 8
---
WSB is such a funny sub
---
its just an excuse to hate
---
After TipsOut said "Few months" I suspect August as well.
---
play a lot and you can do anything :)
---
Something new, a dwarf warrior. I have everything planned out but have never a dungeon before so am looking forward to that!
---
Honestly blame Blizzard for giving them undeserved preferential treatment
---
"We're not gonna let classic take over our lives"
---
***The gang gets divorced***
---
Inb4 streamers and youtubers with god complex because they think Classic is possible thanks to them.
---
All except for the last part is true. I suck so they just keep corpse camping me. 😔
---
Honestly, in Vanilla I somehow avoided most of STV and leveled just fine. I don't care too much about being hyper efficient. I'll just be happy to be 60 within 2 months.
---
Depends whether the streamer knows that. I have met people who insist that "a few" means "more than one but not much more", which includes using it for couples if things.
---
July 16th
---
Yeah, great damage, but they can't tank.
---
I’m pretty sure I wore my deviate scale belt from level 18 or so until the low 50’s when I replaced it with a wild heart belt. That’s just how classic went back in the day.
---
where did u hear this?
---
This is business as usual
---
Blind might be disorientation (tbh I'm not sure), but that's not what stoneform helps against. Blind is also a **poison**, which stoneform removes, which is why it helps against Blind. So no, you can't stoneform out of Scatter. ;)
---
Thanks for this! If I get a beta invite I'll be testing this and keeping you updated.
---
Hi, /u/FakeColours
---
Yeah I very highly doubt streamers are gonna get access to a closed beta with just them. They'll either get access to the F&amp;F alpha for a while or Blizzard will open closed beta to a first wave of players, including streamers
---
That wouldn’t be a classic summer :(
---
It's not even summer yet tho.
---
Can you elaborate on "basically just said"? Sometimes things are taken out of context.
---
Lvl 38 isn’t the only breakpoint
---
Found the streamer dick rider.
---
Can’t wait to flex on all the noobs with it
---
Life isnt fair my man
---
Aligns neatly with Tool release but.. just need ASOIAF TWOW and we're set lmao
---
ive raided as daggers on multiple servers, and it feels like almost all of those tiny disadvantages can be made up through player skill and strong tanks. just never really noticed it being an issue that i was concerned with
---
August 27th release date would be great for me, sorry to everyone who this screws over. Would rather no life in the cold weather.
---
He knows we're all mashing F5 right now and we'll see his lackluster bitch post.
---
..”1.12 released”
---
Well fucking congratulations!
---
The alpha client that was datamined and is weeks old at this point you mean?
---
I will never forget the amazing private server experience, chinese players not responding due to not even being able to speak english, just like many russians, too.
---
Oh the language barriers &lt;3 how will I miss it, nothing like sometimes not finding a group for the specifics 5 hours straight on a 6k pop server.
---
I loved that moment where a full epic hunter literally flamed me for my gear in a Strat Ud run after I just dinged 60.
---
I mean...everything but the language barrier is just like on retail back then, but it is definetly no way near better than the „toxic reality“ on retail servers, that‘s just bullshit.
---
And I really hope all you streaming people will stick together on a single realm and leave the adults alone.
---
I - and most certainly many others - don‘t have time for this Bullshit.
---
No, I don‘t like what you‘re doing,
---
No, I don‘t want to support any of it
---
and most certainly will I not „follow“ any of you lowlifes that have nothing but half developed egos, their selfish interests and tons of 12 year old „followers“ to offer to the community.
---
A whole heartedly F YOU to this unnecessary phenomenon of the modern gaming industry.
---
Ohh ok thanks for the Information
---
Same. Real life is rough haha.
---
Imagine being so tone deft that you don't even know that people don't like you, they just use you for the information.
---
Seal Fate really works if you can also be consistently world buffed too.  The issue is that you won't consistently be world buffed if your raid wipes or if world buffs don't work like we'd expect them to.  
---
Side note, seal fate swords and seal fate daggers are both incredibly fun and once you get the 2.5 set you start seeing huge numbers.
---
I fucking hate them.
---
What is this phenomenon of uninteresting kids are now being the persons to handle valuable information?
---
If there was 1 blue post saying “more info the 14th” it would have created the same hype.
---
I met someone in Azeroth that I spent hours playing with one night, we were trying to get a VC group together. Turns out he was an IRL friend already and we had no idea we knew each other.
---
I REALLY don't understand the YouTuber/streamer hate in this sub... Like it doesn't affect you whatsoever, calm the fuck down
---
The addons for 1.12 (ones people use on private servers) will **not** work with WoW Classic, since the Classic will use the modern engine (most likely the BfA codebase).
---
Doubt the addons we have today will work. You will have to read a guide
---
Meh, you played wow classic  up until WOTLK and you claim to have never heard of Towlie or even ask why people dont like him.  You just jump to his defense randomly....
---
Bruh this is like someone saying they like rap music but dont know who Drake is.
---
My very first ever character was a dwarf priest. I’m thinking of playing that again, but not because it was my first, just because it’s the best.
---
LOL
---
Many people will burn out in the Beta before release.
---
Prolonged beta testing kills so much hype for a game like Classic.
---
Warrior “my dad”
---
Broadcast this one too.
---
lol sure, but it's quite easy to clarify something to make it less subjective.  You can either say oh well, to which you admit that you may be misinforming people and dont care, or you can simply make the edit to clarify.
---
Thanks! I'm stoked.
---
Hi, /u/DistortedShadow
---
yes it feels good, but enough with the hyperboles already.
---
&gt; why would they choose Warlock? It seems they would be gimping themselves by doing so.  
---
Warlocks scales really good with gear and naxx geared warlocks absolutely melts people.  
---
&gt; Warlocks more easily get (...) stunlocked to death by Rogues.  
---
I think most warlocks (prefer to) roll orc for this very reason.
---
You have to be a complete retard if you think retail is better.
---
Joanna’s (or similar) leveling guide on a screen next to the game.
---
best one yet
---
also also repetition
---
People will have the next 3 months to develop addons
---
Or I can just ignore it because the thread is basically dead and said oh well because its a moot point and doesnt matter anymore.
---
Notice that he completely ignored the part about ad infested spyware &gt;.&gt;
---
Take breaks.  Get up and walk around for 5 minutes of every hour.
---
Blizzard handed them free viewers, I don't watch them at all but I can't blame them for milking it.
---
Lucky you. All my friends want to play horde for some reason :/
---
Being the main crafter of Hide of the Wild cloaks on my server will always be one of my favourite things from playing back in the day. The experience ranged all the way from people simply bringing me the mats because they had heard about me or seen my name on other peoples gear just to press the button, to making cloaks and losing money so my guild members would have better gear all the way to people calling me all manner of racial and religious slurs for trying to make even the slightest copper of profit.
---
Good times.
---
No, not at all. Mn is incredibly dedicated in both PvP and PvE, and is exactly the type of person you want to give gear to, as he will show up and perform (performance is heavily weigrhed) on a weekly basis and he's an active pvp'er that goes for r14 on every server. 
---
Wouldn't you rather give a BRE to a proven active ranker that you know will continue raiding for the entire duration of the server? I'd say that's a good investment.
---
I'd putz around on an alliance toon in beta for fun, since I havent played alliance since early 2005 and dont remember most of the questing.  Then just play horde as usual on release :)
---
Oh you sweet summer child, you think Blizzard is just going to drop an old patch with no changes?
---
IT'LL HAPPEN TO YOOOUU
---
I'm making a combination of my very first character and what became my main. My very first character was a dwarf warrior and my main was a night elf hunter. I will have a dwarf hunter with (hopefully) my warrior's original name.
---
What's the equivalent here? Spitting my mt dew all over my keyboard.
---
Yeah good luck doing that with Hamstring and Bleeding on you.
---
&gt; After having tried 10-15 BG's each at level 60 with Mage and Warlock
---
I mean, that's kinda like reviewing a movie trailer.
---
The classes are just different. Why play mage over rogue? Why play paladin over priest? All classes have strengths and weaknesses, and while mage is generally considered one of the best classes in vanilla, they do have some disadvantages:
---
- Extremely poor raw survivability, probably the squishiest class in the game, low stamina on mage gear etc.
---
- High reliance on spells with cast time and/or short range. Can't kite ranged classes very well.
---
- No self-healing whatsoever, limited to bandages and consumables.
---
- Very little hard CC, highly reliant on soft CC which doesn't actually disable the target.
---
Those are problems that warlock happens to solve, in exchange for other disadvantages that give them different matchups against the other classes. Warlock happens to be strong against mage, for instance, which is one of the reasons to play it, given the popularity of mage.
---
Yeah I'm so shocked that the people in the community with the largest reach and most connections to Blizzard are tasked with spreading hype.
---
Thanks, Swifty!
---
Addons will be ported over most likely.
---
A combination of questie (or other) to mark the map with quests and where to do them, along with a map addon that makes it a window on your screen with coordinates, is your best setup.
---
As the announcement will be plastering the subreddit in likely, what, fifteen minutes? This post has been removed.

This guy is legit a retard.
---
August 27
---
Oh wait a minute, so YOU know about this guy? You must be a pretty big fan, or one desperate loser with a grudge. Lol.
---
Sub 4 beta i guess
---
Not getting the point here. What's the use of letting in 50 (assuming numbers hete) attention-craving douchebags first, while the whole point of beta is to have a sizeable stresstest?
---
Hey, this isn't a release date...
---
Classic tokens confirmed
---
Reddit bait
---
0/30/21 is probably what you are looking for. What can this spec do?
---
Any role in 5 man dungeons. You can tank, dps, or heal in this spec in 5mans without having to respec. You won't be super optimized, but its enough to skate by in any role in any dungeon.
---
You can tank in raids (technically). This spec grabs everything important to be a bear tank in a raid setting. Major drawback however is that your cat form is lacking, which sort of defeats the point of bringing a bear. But technically, if you need that functionality, this spec can do it.
---
PvP. This spec is primarily used to PvP. You won't put out as much pure dps as a deep-spec feral, but it gets the job done. Your bear will be beefy, your cat bursty, and your heals significant enough to sustain you. Throw on healing gear and you can be a fully committed healer in a PvP fight (although as a druid I wouldn't recommend). *This is also the S-tier flagrunning spec for warsong gulch.* Seriously, no other class/spec can outrun a 0/30/21 druid.
---
What can it not do?
---
This spec is built to basically maximize your power spread into 2 main areas: Bear form and healing. Thankfully because of the way the feral tree is built, you must take up most of the cat points on the way, so cat is okay enough to get by in pvp. The main drawback of this build is that without the 11 point dip into balance, your catform dps takes a serious drawback, and without the final point in feral, you really aren't worth bringing to a raid in that spec if you are being tryhard. However from your post it sounds like that isn't your prio. 
---
I'd love to answer any questions you have about this build.
---
This guy is literally a troll
---
Jesus Christ what is wrong with you people
---
I hope they are joking. They should do a stress test to see if tveir servers can handle all the logins and characters.
---
Life? as a MT? These 2 things dont coincide.
---
Ya, well be able to SEE it. We get to watch them stream the beta.
---
Stop posting this absolute fucking bullshit.
---
Thats how it works mate.
---
I think I'm just going to go ST it seems like a more reasonable option for someone essentially new to vanilla content, and less risky
---
Yes, your eyes.
---
Where to get it: You were born with them already installed.
---
What does it let you: Read the damn quest text.
---
fuck off
---
Such an annoying streamer...
---
No one knows what any realm will be called
---
Sod off
---
An old friend and I disconnected during high school when I moved. Didn't talk for a few years.
---
I was leveling when BC came out and had a group of guildies that quested together. We were in zangramarsh and found a disc priest leveling alone. We wanted a pocket healer so we invited him to our group. 
---
He joined vent with us as we quested and talked a bunch. I was talking about some school shit and he was like no way I live in that area! Go to find out it was my old buddy. Smallest world ever. We're good friends to this day.
---
I dont watch streamers at all. Think I'm going to chill on a private server. Fuck that logic. I could be chilling on beta right now if it would be available to other players, not just streamers.
---
"I hate the way this entire thing has been handled" "and yet you participate in liking classic wow, curious......."
---
in PvE?  pretty pointless
---
in PvP?  single best class apart from maybe warlocks.  there are some sick vids of druids form-shifting and pwning multiple people  
---
while leveling you can be mostly feral (with nature's swiftness in resto) and heal/tank/dps any dungeon, and also be awesome in pvp.  at 60 if you want to raid you'll likely end up being resto  
---
if you can collect decent gear with spell damage on it, you are a force to be reckoned with even as primarily a healer - if you do a cat form opener on someone and put all your bleeds down then do moonfire+insect swarm you have already done like half of someone's hp pool.  you then use bear form for interrupts and gap closing and caster form for a few wraths and heals
---
i played a druid on ely and i loved it all the way through
---
thank you for understanding haha. I am taking a week off and absolutely can't wait for this epic ride
---
Okay mods, it's time to start removing these posts or the entire subreddit will drown in it.
---
this chart makes no sense to me. paladins, rogues, mages don't have fear?
---
As a warrior, fear was never my biggest issue when facing warlocks, but then again I did play undead (lul). Curse of exhaustion is annoying though. Overall I never really struggle vs wlocks unless they use succubus.
---
I met my wife in a trade chat pug for vault of archevon, wotlk. She plays private servers with me still, and we'll be diving into classic with our eldest son.
---
You really gotta commit to this thing if you don't want to be taken as a casual by the Top Guilds. I recommend sawing a portahole directly into the floor of your gaming room. If you're a real 1%er you can modify your GamerChair so you never have to physically move from the spot to relieve yourself.
---
I hope to see content
---
I expect Zygor guides to make a classic version, theirs just too much demand not to
---
You got me bud
---
God this is so painful and cringe. 
---
Giving streamers like this all the info to dangle over those who just want to play the damn game is embarrassing. Of course this is how blizzard handled it though. 
---
There’s a few content creators I like, but the classic ones that I’ve seen so far are mostly bleugh apart from Platinumwow.
---
Maybe that isn't the point.
---
off healing can be useful for 2-3 man elite quests , dot up and heal a little
---
We're all with you on that. Release date announcement, realm list names and more would be freaking amazing.
---
I just wanna play BE pally /s
---
Personal issues, maybe, but I can guarantee they don't have issues clearing Naxx!
---
tbh I'm less interested now than I was 3 days ago. kinda not in the mood to even play a beta if it was released today or tomorrow or whatever
---
Correct, you couldn't interact with players in other realms. They haven't announced the realms yet but I would guess a PVP realm will initially be the most popular.
---
Okaaay. Looking at the comments people really need to take it down a notch.
---
I wish Blizzard, after 14 years, can make bigger servers. At least for the launch. Allow 10k people on a server for a while, shard the beginner zone if needed, and then slowly shrink the servers. Just think of all the advances since Vanilla WoW: smart phones that gives us computers in our pockets, self driving cars, virtual reality, etc, and Blizzard still can't make a WoW server that doesn't crash the server if a few hundred players battle it out.
---
Nothing will happen. Soon many people will stop playing (including myself I guess) because it‘s very time consuming. Think about it: people who want classic used to play vanilla back in the day. Now 14 years have passed by and many things changed. I‘m not in high school any more. I have a job etc. (I think many people are in the same situation) Once I hit a brick wall where I can‘t go any further without saying goodbye to my social responsibilities, my job, family etc. I’m going to stop. I will maybe create an alt but that‘s it. I will stop playing. I think (and thats just my opinion) many players will stop when they realize how much time wow used to cost. That‘s something we all underestimate I think.
---
So people will leave, maybe they will take a look again after a few months. But in the end numbers will decline. 
---
I actually can‘t see many new people playing classic because the gameplay and progression is way slower than in modern games. 
---
It‘s a niche. A beautiful one but still not made for a big audience
---
LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES, OP. BREAK THE CYCLE.
---
Here's to hoping they make realm/faction transfers available to classic
---
Because locks are cooler
---
Almost typed this myself, thanks for beating me to it!
---
I mean just looking at the map and having walked from blasted lands to ironforge it follows that kiting him further up the continent and over a couple of passes would be much harder than taking him to SW...
---
“summer”
---
Think of Mind Soothe as a movement abillity. Imagine you're in a clearing filled with humanoids. Now imagine they can't detect you. So much faster :)
---
Yes I understand the concept, better community. Just wanted to get a understanding of how it worked
---
Friends and family beta would still be nice, stop being petty. Would allow us to check like we did for the demo if there are still problems, and for the try hards it would allow us to update our guides.
---
It's kind of true but I don't know. There's a lot of people who just straight up gank you relentlessly - generally they're skulled/level 60 no lifers. They make PvP servers garbage to play on and why I'm rolling PvE.
---
But there are a lot of players who make it very obvious that they're coming to kill you. I sometimes throw up my hunters mark early on the player as a "get ready".
---
Sometimes I throw a hunter's mark on a lowbie and watch them run away, only to pull 3-4 mobs, get dazed and die lol.
---
PvP is the only thing I like doing
---
I've made it work on fresh private servers, but you really have to bust ass with professions and plaguebats early on. It's a lot easier as fury/arms because your solo farming is that much better, but if you play your cards right it's doable without an alt. Most of my gold came from Mining, Blacksmithing fees/tips (get good patterns early = print gold forever), reserved Strat Live orb drops, and selling the occasional tank run.
---
It's 100x easier if you're willing to respec to fury/arms and farm as those for the first 2-3 months while tanking as prot. You don't have to be spec'd as prot to tank anything pre-raid, and once you get enough gear, fury tank becomes really good again because of the threat generation anyway. Being a DPS spec means you can grind mobs way faster and can 2 man Dire Maul with a good shaman/priest once it's out for nutty gold/hr. The first phase is the toughest but that's why a lot of experienced people tank their "gearing in 5 mans at 60" phase as Arms/Fury, just to still be able to solo grind and have a chance in PvP.
---
Horde PvP Tauren male Shaman
---
Nope. I just want to play but I do hope they keep the original server names of the original launch.
---
I'd recommend zygor, they said they will begin development once they they access to beta
---
It's been like a hour any news?
---
And if you wonder if Warrior is good, let's flash back to this beauty:
---
[Malachiel - In Style](https://youtu.be/7JljoBFNYxg)
---
Fury Warrior PvP with a fun video. Saw this when I first started playing and damn did it make me want to switch to Warrior. I wanted that L-L-L-Ludicrous G-G-G-GODLIKE MEGAKILL. lol
---
My main initially was a Human Rogue then switched to Human Warlock. I think this time me and my friend will roll Horde for a completely new experience :).
---
Ill roll Druid. Just unsure in which race yet.
---
They can. The problem isn't server capacity, but the spawns and fighting for mobs.
---
Release date and available realms would be great.
---
&gt; but I know he does a lot of stuff related to data mining.
---
More like other people give him info and then he makes videos about it.
---
He is an ass, i told him how to get into the BFA warfronts long before they were actually accessible on the alpha. No one had seen them yet, he could've easily been the first one to make videos and among the first to see it. The only thing I asked was not to share how until I was done with it.
---
So he immediately goes and tells Towelliee claiming its his find and they do it on stream, his excuse was "well they'll be released soon anyway"
---
The only good part was that towelliee snubbed him on the credit as well.
---
He spent years playing private servers and once he reached a big enough following deleted every single private server video and switched to retail videos so he could be friends with Blizzard and get alpha access.
---
He is only in this for the money and attention.
---
I mean that demo was so unpolished. There was Crit rating on gear and spell Crit was 100% pre talents, Target/combat problems, and abilities didn't work like they should. The list of bugs and broken things was pages long and it was only 2 zones and a few levels/talents. 
---
I would normally expect a polished game if it's a re-release or a re"mastered" game but after that demo my expectations are pretty low.
---
Stuff? 
---
I ain't clicking that link.
---
Constructive comment! Better yet, let's downvote an honest question  :)
---
You'd likely need to read 95% of quest text multiple times, and explore whole zones to find single mobs.  Some quests give you very little indication of where tf to go.  It's going to take you months to hit 60 I would imagine.
---
If you really want to go this route, make /target macros for the quest mob you're looking for so you can spam a button while you search for shit rather than walk into every building/keep/cave in Azeroth.  You'll at least know if you're close to something or not.
---
Values will change slightly at different levels, but until you get Shadow Spec there's not much difference between Mind Blast and the other spells.
---
I've realised  the examples I gave above are wrong as I haven't learnt Smite 6 which I should have picked up at my current level. That increases Smite's DPS to 92dps. Almost twice as much dps as my old wand but 14% of my mana bar per cast. This is the best case scenario for Smite as it's just ranked up compared to Mind Blast which is 4 levels old.
---
god damnit this is great :D
---
it's like one of those low budget cinema movie trailers.
---
What's the name of this clip again? I couldn't tell from the video.
---
Very few resto druids get brought along to raids; usually no more than 2-3. So as a balance druid, ill be getting offspec tier gear at about the same pace as regular dps classes get their tier gear. I'm unsure how long id keep the set bonus for, a lot of it depends on how good the BIS gear is from aq40 and naxx. The gear available from mc, bwl and zg seems like the mana regen will end be worth it. I wish I could test it in person.

Boy are you wrong
---
Then the choice for realm-type atleast is easy, go for PvP. It will be really hard to pick a realm, i hope they announce some kind of realm transfer service so that you dont get completly fucked if you make a bad pick.
---
Everyone is saying "Im going to avoid streamer realms" and yes, while that initially sounds like a good idea, those servers will probably have the most players, or atleast many.
---
Classic realm names are still active. I played on Scarlet Crusade and Dalaran. Both are still active.
---
He literally just said that today is going to be a good day for "everyone" and the entire gaming community. My body is ready.
---
I'll be playing with my Wife, Priest(me) Warrior(her) combo. Been practicing on pservers and she actually loves the game. When she isn't playing I'll be leveling a Warlock alongside, pass loot/cloth/gold back to my main (also don't need to save up for a mount). Probably play Horde on a PvP server, we enjoy fishing for Deviate Fish together so we'll probably stack up on that until prices hike up (prior to level 40). 
---
I'd like to hit 60 relatively fast, not MC first fast but 2-3 months. Once we hit 60 she'll most likely want to play as DPS spec, hopefully with me being a healer I can form the group to be more friendly toward DPS warriors (not sure if this will be a thing or not). 
---
I'm really looking forward to farming with her, especially when Dire Maul comes out. Probably will use the gold we get to get her DPS BoE gear (Lion Heart helm, Krol Blade, etc.). Also looking forward to farming The Eye of Shadow together.
---
Honestly, I'm really looking forward to having nightly LAN parties with my wife, it's been a blast so far even knowing that once Classic comes out the progress we've made is worthless.
---
Precisely - you are one that has a brain and is not delusional! :)

I'll be perfectly happy with that. In fact it's one of the more reasonable assumptions that were being thrown around. I don't know why people are losing their shit over this.

wow thats dissapointing

classic xD
---
I see what you did there!
---
Excuse me, but the Booty Bay Parrot Party is going to have something to say about this.
---
Downvote this
---
Not gonna lie, kinda bothered by the fact that Towelliee is getting into this whole classic hype, considering how much he hated on it to begin with.   He can bitch and moan all he wants and try to make it seem like he never said such things, but he definitely said things such as "it's never going to happen"  "Let's just move on from this"   
---
And then he proceeded to ban people who had constructive conversations about it from his channel.
---
It just comes off as completely fake and laughable to me. 
---
If anything, the info dump should've come from Sodapoppin  or Esfand, one of the two that clearly pushed for this more than anyone
---
Hey,
---
back in the days, we were only able to raid with people from our faction on our server. There were servers were you got a population of 80% alliance and 20% horde. Blizzard tried to control this by adding free to character transfers.
---
As I remember correctly pvp servers were more populated by the horde and pve more by the alliance. There were some pvp servers like Aegwynn (in EU) which gained a lot of popularity by progressive alliance raid guilds. 
---
On battlegrounds, you got a realm pool with multiple realms. In the battlegrounds, you were able to chat with people from different servers.
---
God I lived this
---
I think they're embarrassed about letting their imaginations run away with them.
---
What is the significance of this?
---
Honest question... asked in a way that REEKS of inexperience on both classes. How do you even answer something like this? 
---
Give it a try.
---
If this is going to be what all the fuss is about I'm going to lose my shit laughing for days.
---
Have a shit before you raid?
---
Or don’t want to watch annoying ass streamers.
---
Big if tru... LEEE ROOOOOY

30 Feral, 21 Resto: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxsofo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxhscMdxVxsofo)
---
Compared to an 11/33/7 tanking build, you sacrifice Leader of the Pack, 2 points in Thick Hide, and a very small amount of damage/threat but gain the ability to actually function as a healer. You still have more armor and put out more threat than Warriors with this build.
---
I think it's the best way to Druid. You can make a hybrid cat/bear build, but cat is very weak damage compared to a Warrior, which IMO offsets your superior off-tanking ability. Warriors can't heal or decurse, however. And you need Imp Healing Touch + NS to compete with other healers.
---
If you plan to use this build in PvP, then you can take 2 points out of Thick Hide and move them to Feline Swiftness.
---
Makes sense to me...
---
What is druids capabilities in pvp, I know engineering changes the whole game for everyone but just by themselves, are they capable of 1vXing In feral or another spec? (Balance/resto) are they good 1v1 duels? If so what spec? And how does a Druid handle melee matchup or caster match up? Is it always a game of trying to keep distance dot and heal? Against melee it seems you can’t really keep up if you go straight melee face to face with them, and against casters they seem to blow you up quick. (This is coming from someone VERY new to wow and wow pvp)
---
It should be very easy to make those work for Classic.
---
Well, then what is? Getting us all hyped even more by dangling a closed beta in front of our faces :|?
---
TL;CW:
---
Source? I’m gunna need a source for your source or everything you say is scientifically unprovable and therefore you must delete your post bad mouthing my podcast before I tell blizz that we want flying mounts in classic
---
Also a fair point. Makes everyone’s lives easier.
---
I don't want to go through the hell that was leveling a warrior to 60 again so I am going warlock.
---
.. by pointing out the advances of both of the classes. Are they supposed to know the answer to their question before asking it ?
---
That would be so stupid... It would be one thing if it was some new content, but everyone knows that place... I would probably still watch it though cause I'm a Wow classic slut
---
Thanks for the info! I'll probably end up doing it blind until it becomes irritating and then use guides lmao

prepare for downvotes.  there is a looong list of reasons why people think this was unhealthy for retail and would be a terrible implementation in classic.
---
Correct. Panda demon hunter.
---
As a druid main I hard counter mages, and I am hard countered by Warlocks. So you might wanna consider warlock so that you can handle all...6 of us....*sigh*
---
classic comunity was allwaya very emotional, some of the private server elitist think that they are THE ones who should get first into beta xD and not the "stupid" youtubers they dont care about marketing or logic
---
I am not a Towelliee fan but he only ever hated on the community, which isnt much better but hey. He admits he prefers Retail but hey, it is what it is.
---
If you use a quest guide add-on you're already missing the whole point about Classic imo..
---
This is your boss...you’re fired.
---
I guess it would kind of confirm they're in fact privy to some information right now.
---
morning wood?
---
Fuck you boss you need me more than I need you
---
I mean... yeah, probably. There might be an open beta soon, but all this streamer exclusive content is purely for hype, and it annoys me when people on this sub don't seem to realize that.
---
I get the Classic and BFA Logo, but what is the Warcraft Logo for ? Surely they would use the Reforged Logo if it were for Warcraft 3.
---
did I stutter
---
Don’t you know that every word is literal, by definition?
---
Because they enjoy Warlock?
---
Dae think streamers are literally satan??
---
We had add-ons for stuff like this in vanilla. Someone will make new ones or make current ones functional for Classic. Honestly a big debate is what is to be done about add-ons that functionally recreate the conveniences of retail WoW in Classic.

SHIT

I have a 3440x1440 120hz monitor that I use to play retail, which should be about the same performance.  I have a 1080 Ti with an older 4770k CPU and slow down below 60fps in very crowded areas like Boralus.  I think that is an issue with the CPU rather than the GPU.  I would recommend a 2060 and a Ryzen 2600 is a pretty good combo that should hold up for a while.  You can always spend more if you want, but I'd say those two are a great combo.

A little late, but not unexpected coming from Blizzard. I suspect they are having more trouble quashing all the weird bugs that reverting to the old data created. Zones with weird terrain issues, weird textures, stuff that is "fixed" in modern and needs to be simu-broken.

---
NOU
---
Guess I'm the only one who's happy with this release date.
---
Living in the Northeast, summer is when you go outside. Winter is when you sit inside and play WoW.
---
This lines up pretty well with that.
---
Deep Feral builds put out 25%+ less healing than a hybrid build because they lack Improved Healing Touch, Tranquil Spirit, Improved Rejuvenation, and Nature's Swiftness.
---
On the other hand, hybrid builds sacrifice very little survivability in exchange for that healing. They sacrifice the ability to cat form, but cat form is kind of terrible anyway.
---
This is like Schrodinger's burnout. People didn't have to acknowledge their burn out so long as the date for classic launch was nebulous, but now that we have a hard date, people are freaking out about having to be hyped for that long. It's called burn out, step away for awhile, it's okay.
---
&gt;I feel like that since Blizzcon..
---
2017 :(

Id like to compare this to borderlands, they recently released a borderlands 1 game of the year remake. For ps4. I dont get the items i earned in borderlands 1 ps3 version on my ps4 now. Im totally fine with that. Its just a fresh start.  
---
You enjoyed your CE items from vanilla up to bfa. Now they remade vanilla into classic. A new timeline. Imo all start fresh is the way to go. I dont care for such items so i would not buy the CE tbh.
---
Hi, /u/Phenotyx
---
I just have to stay alive for 3 more months.
---
August 27th is like squarely in the middle of summer though.
---
Clearly you're not familiar with the optimal GamerDiet. I eat prepackaged food like lunchables and precooked chorizos (no cheetos your plebs the dust can gunk up your keyboard). Of course I always pound Redbulls and MntDew Code Red to ensure I always have an ample supply of caffeine coursing through my veins. Gotta keep my edge. Unfortunately caffeine often acts as a diuretic so, especially during a long instance, I will have to go multiple times. Please stay away from me and my guild until you understand the basics of raiding.

Lawl. "summer" Blizzard I don't think you know what that word actually means.
---
CLOSED BETA LULW FUCKING TERRIBLE
---
classic summer what a joke
---
But... that is summer
---
I hope they invite veteran players for the beta, say, 10+ year old accounts. I don't want to watch new players roaming the closed beta, or people that just want to fool around. The beta is an opportunity to polish the game for the classic community.
---
Blizzard fucked us in the ass,  classic summer didn't happen.
---
are you fucking kidding me, end of august????
---
In most places the summer months are June, July and August.

I mean, Blizzard have contacted many content creators. Asmongold is one of them, and he has been hinting on Twitter any other places that the beta pretty much is about to come out. Hell... even his Twitch stream title is called: "CLASSIC BETA HYPE--NEWS SOON".

So yeah, the beta is coming.

Don't be an asshat. That's four days before September. Summer will basically be over. Calling this a "Summer Release" is horseshit.

&gt; To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, **we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria** from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. **Participants will also need to have an active subscription** or active game time on their Battle.net Account. (...) We may also consider additional factors such as **how long a player has been subscribed to the game**
---
There it is, the literal paid beta.
---
well now i know what i’ll be doing all autumn and winter 😎
---
This is lame as shit.
---
I would have totally bought into the beta, but I am not going to buy a CHANCE at beta. Thats whack
---
Unfortunately people think of seasons in terms of when school is in session.  "Summer" is May - August 20.   I guess they just couldn't get it ready in time which is super unfortunate because summer is prime gaming time.
---
Winter is coming.
---
I hope so! Surely they wouldn’t change something as gameplay altering as mount level unlocks.
---
You guys will find something to complain about regardless of what Blizzard does, no wonder they hate giving any info on the state of the game.
---
Yeah, he means it’s the tail end of the summer - if you only get to play a few days in summer, then is not a “Classic summer”.
---
Say you’re a child of divorced parents and your usually-absent dad says “I’ll come see you soon and we’re gonna have a great summer together” - that would make you assume he’s going to come at early enough in summer that you’ll get to spend the summer with him.
---
Wow thats a terrible release date, this will probably suppress the amount of people who play honestly
---
This news is pretty disappointing. 
---
A closed beta
---
Requires active subscription
---
Very late summer release date
---
It is. It's literally a summer release date. "Thanks blizz"
---
Yeah that's kinda shitty. Not really interested in paying for a chance at beta if I'm not currently playing retail.
---
Maybe we can get chosen and then pay for a sub, but I doubt it.
---
They want people to sub just for the chance to get in.
---
Seems release is 27/8 2019 according to his youtube video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MINO7itk0Y](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8MINO7itk0Y)
---
If you’re watching toweliee stream, you can see they have a new UI in place for in party.
---
I'm sure its gametime, they wouldn't be so stupid as to have mounts at 30.
---
ITT: People who have no idea how long summer actually lasts. Summer doesn't officially end until Sept 23 guys :)
---
 Honestly this is so fucking disappointing. Classic summer my ass.
---
New. 
---
I honestly hated my main in vanilla. I was originally an orc hunter and undead warlock, but went Alliance when my friend stopped playing right away. I ended up with a Dwarven arms warrior for some reason. I don't like dwarves, so I guess I thought the other races looked weird or out of place with a massive battleaxe in hand. Loved being a warrior, moreover an arms warrior who refused to Respec. I made my best guild friends with two other arms warriors. We were all second string raiders as a result, but we were fine with it. 
---
I'm going horde this time. I went horde soon into TBC and flip flopped between alliance during WoD. I'm excited to try vanilla from the horde side, because the last horde quest I did in Vanilla was easily summer 2005. I have settled on an undead priest, but I'm open to rolling a shaman.

Classic WoW Testing Schedule
---
Beginning May 15, select WoW players will be invited to participate in a small-scale, focused closed beta test. Players will also get a chance to help put our servers and technology through their paces in a series of stress tests running from May through July—you can opt in now through Account Management and select the WoW Classic beta. Subsequent stress tests will extend the opportunity to even more players. Level caps will also be in place to ensure we’re emphasizing the “stress” in “stress test”
---
—we want to push our tech to the limit, and that means a critical mass of players in close proximity.
---
STRESS TEST SCHEDULE*
---
Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19
---
*Dates of each stress test are subject to change.
---
To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.
---
Create Your Character
---
If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
*To align with other regions, the Americas will launch slightly ahead of August 27 in local time.
---
August 27th isn't summer, August 27th is the start of uni again this is bull x)
---
Too late, but still in Summer. We will start playing in September, when people come back to work or class. Not very good.
---
27th of August :´(
---
Damn them!!! I have all summer holidays doing nothing, for them to release this game just before I go back to work. Why do me like that Blizz?
---
Not at all surprised. But I'll stick to my guns and not give them a penny until the game is available.
---
I feel sorry for anyone who now subs to a game they don't want to play for an outside chance at getting invited to classic beta.
---
Yeah obviously people will make addons, i mean at the start there probably wont be any or many
---
yeah and its after summer vacations are over, thats the whole point of summer releases, people might take time off of work but students cant.
---
Ill believe it when I play it.
---
Lmao. It's a dick move, for you.
---
I think being bored was maybe the wrong term. We just did things back then which would gives us no benefits more often just for the fun of it.
---
Is that only me or they announced and I didn't saw? Where is the price?!
---
Also you have to have current active subscription or game-time
---
&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13. Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
Rofl: pay us for 14 days of unnecessary game time if you want to reserve any names
---
Okay I’ll just go be thrilled then.  I guess I’m not allowed to be upset that it’s later than I thought it would be.  Thanks
---
is this fake news or?
---
Same. I would pay for a subscription to play the beta, but not for a chance to get in.
---
That's 100% reasonable.
---
Mark your calendars: WoW Classic goes live worldwide August 27! Whether your battle cry is “For the Horde!” or “For the Alliance!”, there’s no shortage of adventure awaiting you in the vast continents of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms.
---
See below for details on the exact time you can log in and experience the origins of World of Warcraft.  
---
** To align with other regions, the Americas character creation will occur slightly ahead of August 13.
---
no wifi there? or.....
---
I would expect that if they require a subscription to get in it's not a chance. You're essentially gambling on the possibility of getting into the beta if you aren't subscribed already.
---
Probably Mankirk's wife.
---
Wow what a load of bullshit. Have to have an active sub to get into the beta. Thousands of players going to resub til August for no reason at all.
---
Yay. End of August, like the rat bastards they are...
---
JK BOIS I DON'T CARE, WE'RE GOIN' HOME!
---
My baby is due August 29th lmaoooooo
---
Graaah!  I'm so angry it didn't release when I thought it did even though it's coming out like a month later and I still get to play the game I'm dying to get my hands on before September hits!  What a joke, Blizzard sucks, wtf such BS omfg lulzzzlzlzlz.
---
I know many of ya'll are disappointed, but i think its nice that i can actually enjoy the summer without feeling like im getting left behind in a game.
---
Dont mind this at all tbh.
---
*Summer*
---
I have no idea why anyone believed this would be released in early to mid-Summer if it wasn't announced by March or April.
---
You know what, glad it’s coming, glad people are hyped, but honestly fuck Blizzard. 
---
Classic summer...technically they are doing what they said, but fuck if everyone I know wasn’t planning on using their summer off work, school or summer holiday to play.
---
Would you rather they put it out a month earlier and it be a buggy mess?
---
TOO LATE EXECUTUS
---
"Yes daddy blizzard please fgive me your cummies."
---
Got yea, yea I was just talking about the tank gear. Those are nice DPS rings though.
---
"Summer"
---
I played a heck of a lot more video games in college than I do since graduating :/.
---
Even worse:
---
&gt;While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game
---
Needing to have an active subscription to the game to get into the beta will ensure that feedback comes only from people who are mostly satisfied with BfA. That seems concerning.
---
that’s late as fucko
---
I expected it to launch late June early July. What a bummer
---
"2/3 = 50%"
---
-kevbot1111
---
I guess adding game time in expectation that summer meant early summer means maybe I will get to test some beta. Oh well, it's coming either way. At least we will have a Smokywood Winter Veil. I've missed being in WoW for the holidays.
---
Are you going deep shadow pre-40?
---
I think it was actually a hot fix which would not be in the patch notes.
---
Lol right as I deploy fuck me
---
Summer ends in late September though
---
Told you all it would be late August. Late August is their usual release date.
---
I'm in the exact same boat. Let's cry together
---
Fuck me. I just booked my vacation for the 16th of July yesterday since they hinted so heavily at it.
---
I doubt that.
---
This is exactly the kind of attitude that allowed blizzard to keep blowing off the classic community for all those years. The idea that you shouldn't have to pay for shit that costs dev time and resources is absolutely retarded.
---
Happy birthday to ME! Literally!

It's not as soon as I'd hoped, but it is definitely in line with past Blizzard 'summer' releases. I guess it's the advantage of announcing a game by quarter/season initially - gives you the wiggle room you need in case production slips a bit.       
---
            
---
I would not classify this as a 'classic summer' with the game releasing 2/3 of the way through it, but that's semantics; Classic Summer could have meant one of several different things. Again, vaguery helps.
---
Damn it feels good to be 42 and not have to worry about classes starting up.  Gonna take a few days off and see how far I can level.
---
Yeah, this defeats the whole purpose of trying to get old players back if they base the chance to get in on active subs and how long were you subbed. Basically only active Retailers have a good chance.
---
If I would know 100% that I can get chosen THEN I could sign up for a sub I'd be down for it.
---
Too late. Summer my ass.
---
Haha I need an active subscription to the current shitty game to maybe have a chance at testing classic. Yea okay, see you on August 27th
---
I wrecked my GPA for this game the first time around.
---
Pretty shitty release date.
---
That isn't a Classic summer.. I'm so disappointed my god.
---
A classic *fall* is more like it....
---
I did see him post it like 30min ago tho, so he did technically get it, he also said something about a Ragnaros statue but not sure if that is correct
---
On my birthday!
---
This is a "WoW 15th Anniversary CE" not a "Classic" CE. The flying mounts aren't usable in Classic.

Told you all it would be late August. It's usually around that time they always release their new titles.
---
It is written in the article.
---
Classic Summer? ...nah Extreme Bummer
---
“August isn’t summer”
---
-90% of the crybabies in this shitty sub
---
Druid capabilities vary heavily based on what spec you are running and what kind of gear you have. Balance isn't really worthwhile until you have a ton of gear, and even then its basically a 1shot spec with a massive reset time. 
---
I mostly PvP'd as deep feral, which I consider to be 11/35/5. A lot of what I will talk about (but not all) applies to 0/30/21.
---
Avoid at all costs:
---
**Warlocks.** They will eat you alive. Even in full t10 gear I would avoid green geared fresh 60 warlocks. The fear will lock you up something fierce and the dots melt through you, ignoring armor.
---
**Shamans.** Don't counter as hard as warlocks do, but generally bad news bears. They can self heal, like you do, and damage like you do, but they don't have to change forms to do so (shapeshifting is a huge mana sink, so going toe to toe with a shaman you will probably oom faster).
---
They also move quick enough to stay on your heals (ghost wolf), and if they apply their frost shock well, they are basically the only class that can stick to you. Avoid equally geared opponents, but if you have a significant gear advantage you can just power through them with superior tank and damage.
---
You're strong into:
---
**Mages.** You hard counter one of the most overplayed classes in the game. Crit double-firing ravage into a Furious Bite to open from stealth WILL one shot a mage if his shield is down and he isn't ready for you. If he gets his shield up in time, he will likely blink away but be crippled at  very low hp. You can shift out of / are immune to all of his lockup. They simply can't kite you like they can other classes. 
---
**Warriors (low power levels only).** You don't rely on gear nearly as much as warriors do. At low levels, and at low-gear 60, your bearform is basically a better version of them, plus you can heal and kite. However once they have good gear this matchup swings in their favor HARD. I had about 10k hp and I was at the armor cap in bear form, and a top-tier warrior could still cut through me like paper.
---
**Rogues (high power levels only).** At low levels, and low-gear 60, you don't really have the HP requires to survive a rogue's opener. However once you get some equipment, your HP will outscale their damage. Stay in bear form and watch them tickle you, while you keep them from vanishing with FF and laugh.
---
Feeling the same way. But also thinking it may give me something to do while waiting instead of refreshing Reddit with a lottery dream of getting an invite :)   
---
Definitely not jumping right into it.
---
cool...I can play a whole week before college...thanks blizz...
---
You're not the only one. This is fantastic and works perfectly for me.
---
Damn, it doesn't?????
---
Seriously, this is bullshit. Does that mean I have to resub today to even have a *chance* at tomorrows test pool, or am I already fucked either way? This is a pretty greedy move considering other betas never require an active sub.
---
Damn I hope not.  I’m in my thirties and couldn’t care less about streamers.
---
OMO
---
Yeah but school starts 3 weeks earlier lol. I planned to grind some classic over the summer but now I’ll be stuck playing fortnite and crap
---
I'm literally moving continents at the time Classic comes out. Fucking hell
---
Same here. Magical thinking is still a thing apparently.
---
Yes, I was using a bit of hyperbole. The beginning of fall is the September equinox, which is the 23rd.
---
I would be all over this.  Vanilla TBC and WOTLK were my fav 3, as they are for most.  Currently playing on a TBC server that I started a couple weeks ago.
---
I’m sorry that I used the colloquial phrase “in the middle” (e.g. I’m in the middle of something right now) instead of the exact mathematical version of exactly half. I should have known fucking morons like you wouldn’t be able to tell the difference, so yeah my mistake for not accounting for your lack of critical thinking.
---
Thanks! Catch you in Azeroth then!
---
Holy shit, that's my birthday!
---
That makes far more sense at least.  Sort of mixed feelings - glad there aren't perks for Classic but it's also pretty unappealing as a result. Statue is sort of neat though.
---
&gt;implying law school students are all books and no play
---
what does "or active game time on their [battle.net](https://battle.net) account" mean? I play overwatch some does that mean I have active game time?? Or are they strictly referring to WoW gametime? Im not subbed and havent been since 2010 lol my chances are very low im guessing.
---
Lol have fun in class kid.
---
Goes live right when I get home from work on Tuesday, August 27th.
---
I have the next Monday off of work for Labor Day.
---
Can have 6 straight days right at launch by only taking 3 days of PTO.
---
For me August 26th is the second week of college.
---
It's less than a month of summer. Hardly a "Summer of Classic"
---
Not true. I've been in plenty of betas with an inactive account.
---
That's not an opinion. There's nothing subjective about it, it's just people bitching because it's not coming out sooner.
---
And my classic start the 26th! rip senior year first semester grades
---
aUgust 27 iS sTiLL SuMmEr iDiOt.  Fuck this. This is not peak summer time where we could enjoy the game with free time. It's too far out. What a terrible date.
---
This doesnt sound like nochanges, no not at all it sounds like yeschanges
---
Wonder how that would work since areas in Outland were designed for flying mounts. Like Tempest Keep.
---
Name claiming is pretty interesting. I had a plan to claim a full 10 on release but now I'll have to narrow it down to top 3 first.
---
Blizzard finally gives us what we want and y'all are nit picking the smallest shit. good fucking lord.
---
August 23rd for me.  Though it might actually be decent for casual leveling.  My first kid would only sleep for like 45 mins at a time in the first few months, so I basically stopped sleeping when it was my night to stay up and just played video games or watched shows between trying to get the kid back down.
---
This is incorrect. As gear level scales up, druid threat/damage goes up exponentially, while Warrior goes up linearly. Druids are the premier tank for threat generation.
---
StaySafe just mentioned something. He asked Blizzard "what if I want to snipe somebody in particular but they aren't in my layer?" 
---
Blizzard answered: "There will be potential for you to not see them"
---
COMMUNITY IS DEAD
---
What is game time on account that isn't a sub?
---
I really hoped they made it first come first serve. I guess it will still be, in a way, but character creation should've been part of the race.
---
In this thread:
---
People who don't know that Summer ends in September.
---
People complaining about the fact they're being more selective with the beta, boo fucking hoo you can still get selected if you opt-in and are subbed. If you aren't giving Blizzard anything why should they pick you? As if this is some sort of anti-consumer conspiracy.
---
We finally get a release date and all you crybabies can do is bitch about it. What the fuck do you people want? Shall they rush it out the door as a buggy mess just because your impatient ass can't wait 3 months? Get a grip.
---
Thanks for taking the brine off this semi-disappointing news.
---
05 btw, children that have school btw.
---
Kid you're 14.
---
That's a problem for children. Grow up, you're in college. Learn to balance your life so you can play WoW and also study. Life only gets more busy after the fact so you can't spend 15 hours a day playing a video game.
---
Basically sharding. RIP.
---
Great.... I'm off all summer but Classic is gonna wait until School is back. Literally the busiest part of the year for me...
---
&gt;summer 2019
---
&gt;Let's release it 4 days before summer
---
Obviously it wasn't fine though, otherwise they would have released it July 16th.  Blizzard is a pretty damn greedy corporation, they aren't delaying the release for no reason.  They want that subscriber money as soon as possible.
---
 [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) 
---
Well, look at that. A stress test schedule.
---
Did you just pull the number out of your ass or did you pick 27
---
If being an active subscriber was a 100% chance sure but asking folks to pay for a version of the game they don’t like in order to have a slim chance to get a beta invite to the version of the game that they do like seems all sorts of backwards.
---
What is? The fact they require you to, or that you need one? Because it does say that on the announcement.
---
bro, blizzard has been incredibly greedy for over a decade now, cant blame activision anymore
---
You could provide a new flight path.
---
Yeah, I don’t get why there’s a brigade of people thinking I hate blizzard and I think the world revolves around me.
---
This just sounds like sharding with extra steps...
---
It was obvious :)
---
Better than prot, but still falls far short of a properly played feral druid.
---
Granted I obviously haven’t been to law school yet so I have no clue, but I would think I would be wayyy to busy for a game like this...
---
Noooo my big rip came through. August 27th release. I'm so sorry!!! I feel partially responsible. D:
---
Garbage and hope its gone fast.
---
Hi, /u/Green_TeaRoll
---
So stating facts makes someone autistic?  I bet you think vaccines cause autism too, lmao
---
TLDW = Your poop will enter through your mouth instead of your anus
---
If you want a shot at the closed beta make sure to opt-in specifically for Classic under account management.
---
Then it will also require a subscription to WoW.
---
TIL 71% is "basically" 100%.
---
If you just tell your professor that maybe you can get by with a 71% in class and have more time to play video games.
---
This is awful. lol
---
It's kind of like if they announced the game would be "Out in time for the Holiday Season" but it actually releases on February 27th. Yes, that's still Winter, sure. But we all know what was implied with "The Holiday Season", which is that the game would be out before Christmas. Just like how we all know "Classic Summer" meant it would be out before Summer Break for college/school students ended.
---
I'm not in College/School so I really don't care when it releases because I'll have time either way, but it's pretty easy for me to understand why people are upset. There was an implication and hype built around that implication.
---
I'm just happy there's a release date.
---
Summer starts on 21st of June and ends on September 23rd.
---
Nah, just don't use slogans like 'prepare for a CLASSIC summer!!' and a lot less people will be pissed off with this date.
---
Honestly thats what it sounds like. Wtf is going on.
---
you forgot "bedpan"
---
Time to put in the vacation request now before someone beats me to it.
---
It's too bad they didn't consult every single individual for their release date to make sure it aligned with everyone's schedule
---
Fuck me, I knew release date was coming but I was told july. Holy fuck ny imaginary job is gonna freak out when I postpone my imaginary holiday..
---
This layering is only for the first few weeks or its gonna be a permanent feature?
---
Not anymore; launch is August 27
---
Blizzard revolves around money and they will make less money with less people available to play classic
---

You do not need an active sub for any wow beta.
---
I'll resub on August 26th.
---
And, you know, subscribe if you want into the Classic beta.
---
Looks like I may be downloading Light’s Hope tonight.
---
Like if you canceled your sub like me but it doesn't expire until June 4th... THat's an active game time.
---
We can obviously handle it, but we would prefer to no life the launch. Why is it so surprising to you that people want to play the game a lot when it comes out and not have to worry about grades dropping?
---
September 23rd is the official end of summer.  This is an actual fact.
---
Which is an opinion. I'm not sure what you don't understand or why you can't fathom people might be disappointed. Why get angry at people who are disappointed, what does that serve?
---
Wow gametime my friend.
---
Why would inactive players be rewarded?
---
27 August it is 😁
---
Just pre-ordered it in EU. Feelsgoodman
---
Yeah I was hoping for the latest possible release b/c of my schedule, I’m super hyped about this release date.
---
The biggest of rips....
---
It's a joke, based on a very sad truth.
---
But apparently everyone here is a student that can't play 24/7 now lol
---
A fool and his money are soon parted.
---
Paying a sub for a small chance to be invited to a limited stress test...
---
Well, what the fuck, then. Let's make a stink enough during the beta process to revert this awful bullshit.
---
yeah fuck my life
---
Of course this is a week after I no longer work 10 hour shifts 4 days a week. I was hoping it would be in July so I got the entire Friday to play.
---
Yeah, fuck them. I shelled out just for the demo since it was guaranteed to get in...but paying while only getting a chance to get in...yeah, fuck that, nope.
---
See you in August.
---
I don't stream and I don't want an open beta.  We don't need an open beta for a 15 year old game. Closed beta is FINE.  If they did an open beta it would risk people getting burned out before the actual release.
---
No, it's bitching about it not coming out when I had time to actually play it. Classic takes a lot of time, if I want to find a dungeon group I can't have just 1 hour to play. I'm not sure how much you studied, but I definitely don't have a lot of spare time.
---
So you cant say 'selling Earthroot at Xroads mailbox' cuz you'd be in a different layer. That sucks.
---
I’ll sub in August for character creation.
---
Well should be pretty obvious that Blizzard doesn't use "students summer" as a timescale.
---
Quick, my brothers, let us all jump to the worst conclusion before they make any more announcements
---
We just went SSJ1. Still got more forms to go.
---
It's not a "WoW Classic" collector's edition - It's a World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary Edition
---
what a joke
---
Just the beginning. Will continue to build up.
---
t. dwight
---
I really don't think so. I used to play rogue and thus I had a lot of DR tracking going on. If you look at https://archive.org/details/shurrik_-_Shurrik_Part_3_Rogue_2006-10-30_4.44 (by the way an excellent dueling video) you can see that his stun DR timer starts with 19 seconds and not 15. Also I always remembered DR as 20 because that's the same as Kidney cooldown, so if you only use kidney you will always have a full time stun. (Funnily enough there was a time in legion where a bug occurred that your kidney could DR itself)
---
That said, I'm not completely sure, it is just how I remember it.
---
There isn’t one
---
This sucks. It will be a lot of fun to hear about a city being under attack, then going there to find it mostly empty..
---
Yeah it’s interesting that they always release stuff when school starts. I magazine how many more subs they would get if they released in May every year
---
In classic internet form you’ve stooped to the lowest levels of pedantry to win an Internet argument. Well done, your father must be proud. Guess I shouldn’t expect any more from a top mind T_D poster.
---
Lol why not?
---
T is time of the event happening, so the current time is T minus the time between now and the onset of the event.
---
FOR THE HORDE

Well Blizzard is an American company. September is still summer. Deal with it.
---
For sure dude, I want nothing but the best for the game. I was just really hyped for a potential June/July release or whatever was being said in rumors earlier.
---
It sounds like layering would prevent the situation where you'd see someone phase in/out of your view that sharding can create. It sort of acts like overflow, they "fill" up a layer with players and once it's full the next players logging on/entering the continent (I think it's continent wide) go to the next layer.
---
Does this mean duplicated world boss or black lotus ?
---
Yeah, one month of whatever they want to kill it won’t bother me much at all.
---
What a fucking massive disappointment.
---
I wanted to play this during my time off in the summer.
---
Where is the fun when the few servers will be completely dominated by no-lifers who have the time to play all day, while ordinary people are at work/in school.

Prob 77days

 Annual Leave \[OneOrMoreFullDays\] 8/27/2019-9/6/2019 Submitted 
---
Well, that's my prep-work done. Might add another week later but I think 2 is probably sufficient.
---
no offence but thats simply not the case at all if both are equally skilled. 
---
for your consideration, a huge recent 1v1 tournament with the biggest pvpers in the private server scene for each class (participants besides others perplexity arguably best rogue out there at the moment, monkeynews, traque.... essentially the best of the best of each class participating)
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/411229747
---
all hunter rogue matchups at:
---
02:53:00
---
04:56:30
---
"The rogue will use CDs, the hunter will get caught after his first escape and never get back to range."
---
is just not true. check the tournament its a great watch on the highest level.
---
Well, we've waited 15 years. 3 more months will go by fast.
---
Oh, okay...
---
There's too many unknowns. If they make the entire world a shard, and fill it up to 2000 people, then spawn another world, and fill that one up to 2000 people, and continue, all while being under the banner of one realm, this might not be bad.
---
If this is, each zone is a shard and we fill to 20, then fill another, then classic is fucked.
---
I must confess that I sort of pulled that out of my behind. After watching lots of vanilla warlock pvp video's it's just what I assumed to be the case.
---
It's not the job, it's the family that gets you.  Even working long weeks like this I could play obscenely if I was single.
---
When has it ever, ever been ok to charge for beta access?
---
yeah..
---
I am sad I won't have the chance for that sweet sweet ivory raptor, but also I understand their reasoning.
---
Me being lazy and never unsubbing may have finally paid off!
---
Okay so why are you surprised that people didn't believe you if you couldn't provide proof?
---
“If you want to level slowly and enjoy your journey you should”, are they stupid, by that same logic if I want to rush through and get the mounts I should.
---
I commented in another part of this thread, but how would you go about doing it?  The base game is free now, people could sit and make hundreds of accounts and hoard beta invites and sell them for $200 a pop.  Would that *really* be a better alternative?
---
They are waiting. It comes out August 26(27?).
---
It literally says it in the article that this post is about.
---
Waiting an indeterminate amount of time. Now we wait with a countdown clock. Who is going to make the Classic Wow countdown site?
---
If I wanted to join parties to get sharded to the right world I'd play retail.
---
Yup, totally defeats the entire purpose. I am not denying some people who played Vanilla may still have an active sub but Retail players are the last group Blizzard should take feedback from regarding Classic....
---
Figure it out cupcake!
---
As if anyone will get into it that isn't a streamer.
---
I agree with you.  
---
But I gladly wait 2 months for a more bug free experience.   
---
The classic team seems to get shit done and more time means more work on all kinds of stuff related to WoW Classic
---
"T +" is used for time *after* launch. If you watch a rocket launch with a timer, the "T -" will count down to zero and then roll over and start counting positive time.
---
Projecting: the Post
---
It's already stickied.
---
I mean it's easy money for Blizz, why wouldn't they do it that way.
---
"the real experience" of having servers that lag and crash every day, corrupt admins spawning rank14 characters for money, half the server being chinese....yeah
---
Yeah gotta rack that blizzard stock back up again
---
Great, I want to enjoy the summer outside. This works well both ways.
---
Confirmed via the official Warcraft Twitter account (Link to [Tweet](https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1128314553253683200))
---
I just think that Mages have clearly more strengths, and Warlocks clearly more weaknesses. They are both ranged cloth casters, and more comparable that way than Warrior and Spriest.
---
"don't worry guys, they'll only shard the starter zones!"
---
brb, hopping layers for respawns
---
This is a good date. I'd prefer it being earlier but this way it limits the amount of children that will be in barrens chat lol.
---
It’s just for launch, awesome.
---
Try playing in traffic, thats free
---
it has layering aka sharding in the entire world lol
---
my heart is broken
---
Gamers wanna get mad and rise up I guess
---
Ion has said nothing about layering. What you are talking about is from a year ago about sharding. Things have changed since then like the idea of layering. The devs very recently said it could be for entirety of phase 1 which is most likely 4-6 months.
---
I get it. I graduated with an Engineering degree. I thought I could never be as busy as when i was finishing my degree, then i started working..
---
Can you predict the date they say it all was a joke and the release is july 16th so i can actually get a classic summer
---
Right? Go to class for 5-6 hours a day, study/do homework for a few hours (with some exceptions during exam times) and then just play all night, stay up gaming until 4am with your friends, stroll into your morning classes looking like shit with no consequence, and repeat.
---
Uh, what?
---
Are we talking about corporate America? Because if you think you'll be working 8 hours a day when you graduate you are wrong. Get ready for 8-5 PM with a 30 min commute. That is 10 hours if you have it good. Then add in family, kids events, dinner, responsibilities, check work email oh and now you have 3 hours to play before bed.
---
Get ready for it, it'll happen to you.
---
WOOOOOOOOO
---
OOOOOOOOOO
---
Hyped as fuck, only played private servers can't wait to have an authentic experience.
---
 But can someone explain something about games and their stupid release dates? You'd think something like an mmorpg especially classic would release in June or July thats when most teens/uni/ college ppl are off and  have time to no life the game people with Jobs might have some time off too it'd be perfect but an August release literally days away from the start of a new semester for most people teens back to school most can't get day off since there's the winter vacation ahead and needs to get shit done. I don't get it.
---
Well everyone has a different situation.
---
Not only that, but you have to sub 15 days in advance of Classic release to be able to "reserve character names."
---
Opted in! I hope they take account age into effect when selecting beta participants.
---
It's all about layering rage now.
---
To little and far to late. Already enjoying myself with ff14.
---
So much salt here. It's fine boys classic is here to STAY
---
Because some people seem to want to play just vanilla, for like ever. I honestly can't see vanilla lasting very long if they do absolutely nothing with it after release.
---
Dude read the article and stop spreading misinformation. The beta is starting tomorrow their having 3, 2 day stress tests completely seprate from the beta
---
Layering is only phase one according to Ion.
---
It all depends on how exactly they implement it, which we barely know anything about as of now.  Freaking out is pretty premature.
---
Works amazing for me, to be honest. Starts right when I get home from work that Monday. Take the rest of the week off. The Monday after is a Holiday in the US, so I'll have 7 straight days for only spending 4 days of PTO.
---
How will you know if you get in?
---
It's almost like not everyone studies the same subjects at the same college...
---
August 27...but I want to waste my life now....
---
University students are adults
---
I dont know if you heard about Vurtne, well, he was a really known mage for his pvp videos, and made a lot of world pvp videos killing other known players on the server (Method players and so on), he useally allways was around EPL, me and some friends always thought it was fun going to EPL and find Vurtne to have some nice world pvp. If this "sharding shit was going on back then, this would be really hard to do, for Vurtne to find the known players, and for us to find Vurtne. This is why i dont want "sharding" :(
---
Yeah hype may be dead by then.
---
layers is just a better sharding but equally stupid.
---
I’ve stopped playing this game because I feel as though each expansion has made it worse.  I want classic - not TBC, not WOTLK.  If the endgame here is that my character either becomes useless or I play TBC/WOTLK I don’t see the reason to play at all.
---
It's hard cut off after phase 1 dude, if not a few weeks into it. IT's not that bad.
---
IT HAS BEGUN!
---
I told people this for months they wouldn't fucking listenc
---
Dude, yeah technically it's still summer, just like it's technically morning between 24:01 and 12:00. But when someone asks "what did you do this morning?" you don't assume they're asking what you did at midnight.
---
!remindme 87days to install Classic and register my names
---
If you are a company, would you rather award paid customers or people who do not pay?
---
How is releasing at the end of summer (which it isn't) a trick?
---
Grats Blizz on your new WoW subscription uptick.  Obviously gauging interest, who is ready to reactivate to get a chance at this.
---
12am is midnight. PM is lunch time
---
Most degrees are bullshit, sorry if you're just realizing that now.
---
Every single teachers (a lot of my friends) are on suicide watch. They were expecting easy leveling during their long summer vacation but no! back to school !
---
Agreed, but definitely not what they teased and implied with their deliberate choice of wording either.
---
# please stop the fearmongering
---
It won't be. You just have to take your mind off of wow. I know its hard but its doable and it works.
---
You're right that is an unpopular opinion. 
---
Mostly because playing Classic and enjoying the summer weather aren't mutually exclusive. Every day will still have an evening, not to mention rainstorms. It's a dumb argument.
---
Is this a fucking joke
---
Dude i setuped my vacation the way if classix is releash early August im okay, my vacation end on the 26 ... Atleast i will have 2 hours of classic the first day before the kids are back from summer camp
---
You need to have an account that is older but not currently subscribed? Sounds better to me that way classic fans that have played in the past can come in even if they do not want to play BFA.
---
Because they’re running off of zero information

---
Weren't they were talking about how the servers will be so much larger they needed to develop layering -- why is cross-server queues required?
---
You still have a month of summer, Layering is a huge shard - you won't see people phase in/out plus leaving within the first few weeks and guaranteed by Phase 2 it's a good solution the the inevitable frenzy launch will be. 
---
Don't play beta and just wait if you don't want to support...
---
I think "dedicated" players, are either on a private server, or not playing at all.
---
The only thing that was shady was the release date. gtfo here its gonna require the same sub as retail. Likely the reason for this is I think Q3 Starts in September.   
---
At the end of EVERY. SINGLE. DAY. Blizzard is a company / business. Boost Q2's end and insure a solid Q3.
---
My bday is auguat 28. Thx blizz!
---
That sounds horrible. And it's been nothing like that for me, but I'm also not in America. And I don't have kids. And fuck checking email outside of work.
---
From Tip's stream, which although he's a little insufferable, he has all the info.
---
At last!! Thank you Blizzard!!
---
I'll believe it when I see it
---
I know that, but I mean if you need an active sub to get Invited. It might be that you can get invited, but in order to play you need an active sub.
---
1) August 27th? Way to ruin the hype, basically September
---
2) Beta May 15h? Streamers might get bored of 3 months of beta
---
3) Active sub to get beta access? In bird culture that's considered a dick move

---
Revolt.. how exactly? 
---
The announced the game. Lets be happy with that. We can finally plan our time properly. Sucks its later than we all want, but if we could choose I'm pretty sure we would all choose tomorrow. Obviously that isn't very realistic.
---
They want people who play the game to test the game. Makes sense to me. I wouldn't be surprised if the metric for people who participated in PTR and feedback type things were people who still maintained an active sub. Best chances for best results. Not a huge issue.
---
Layering, is going to be needed regardless of how terrible people think it will be. I for one, wish we could have the original experience as was. But lets be real, that would have caused problems for the server, so if this puts a TEMPORARY bandaid on that issue, for a TEMPORARY amount of time, I'm perfectly fine to concede to that.
---
Let's not get all riled up negatively, and try to be positive bois. We're one day closer.
---
Topkek.
---
It says it in the description. 30 days gametime.
---
No way in hell am I resubbing on the off chance of getting into a  limited beta, and no offense but I'm kind of looking down on the people who do.
---
Hi Cartman
---
Right, but even beyond the starting zone is unacceptable. It shouldn’t *have* to come to that but I’ll be really disappointed if it does.
---
No, I meant on the forums.
---
So can I. I was invited to BfA beta with no sun while my friends were mythic raiders. They were so salty lol.
---
Wizard
---
Yea I'm bummed to
---
There will only be so many servers, so I think this will be better than retail cross realm honestly. Most people don’t want really long waits to get in and I’m one of them, you’ll end up getting to know people you’re going up against if you’re playing often.
---
So then do your work first. Instead of going home and playing for the 2 hours between classes, hit up the library and knock out your work so the monkey is off your back when you're home for the night. I made every mistake in the book freshman year regarding not managing my time well, but I figured it out by senior year to be able to finish all my work and still actively raid 3 nights a week.
---
Yes, give the people who actively are supporting your game first chance at getting into beta.  Makes total sense.
---
Jokes on you I’m not in school. I just have to juggle it with my life like I would have to regardless of when it was released.
---
I agree with everything other than the beta part. "Pay us for a chance to test our game" is very anticonsumer. Problem is consumers are use to eating dog shit now so it won't cgo away and no one should be surprised that it's a thing.
---
But you arent subbed.  Why would they change internal structure just so you can play beta?   The system requires active subs.   They arent going to rewrite all.that code for a beta test
---
Sometimes it doesn’t stop
---
welp
---
Looks like  youre right
---
They explicitly said its a solution for a smooth launch period. Once server population stabilizes hopefully they go away from this and have one seamless world, but im not exactly optimistic.
---
Classic Winter is upon us! 😂 
---
Lets be real though, it’ll be classic for life.
---
looooooool
---
Be patient... everyone in this sub is so entitled.
---
The day after my birthday!! What a gift!
---
still beats sharded world
---
It can make them much better but there should be a balance between q time and grouping up with totally random/new people every time.  I'm hoping they implement something like battlegroups to at least limit who you're matched with, I want to be able to recognize names.
---
And then a bit to actually play Classic
---
Depends on what you study, but yeah usually. Especially if you gotta work while studying.
---
I am fine with it because they said summer, and the release date is still summer. Sure its near the end of it but its not they are going back  on anything they've said
---
Atleast I can enjoy the sunshine before classic consumes my life.
---
&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account.
---
oh yeah lmfao, blizzard cares about you classicucks, now pay up paypiggies
---
I CANT DUCKING BREATHE. 
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!!
---
OP posted 2 minutes before you, sorry mate.
---
The kids will be back in school tho.
---
:) I'm going to drag my wife into playing with me this time. I'm actually thrilled it's later in the summer. We don't get that many nice days here. I want to spend them outside.
---
Is this “layering aka sharding” only for launch?
---
If not, RIP world pvp and immersion. Getting ganked? Just download the shard-hopper add-on or have a friend invite you to a different shard.
---
Sharding is one of the few legitimate deal breakers for me.
---
I know of people that got BFA and Legion beta without a subscription. Its not required.
---
Hi, /u/corgix3
---
Bummer that you need an active sub to participate in the beta. But still so hype for this!
---
It's for the entire Phase 1.
---
Hmm. I would not call it DOA just yet. This sounds like "channels" in the MMOs of old. Separate shards but still within a single overall realm.
---
I'm cautiously optimistic.  It's not the singleton realms we were hoping for but it could become that if and when Blizzard decides to "flatten" the layers.
---
In any case it'll relieve launch rush issues and be far better than how sharding currently works with players popping in and out anywhere anytime.
---
Reddit itself has a voluntary bias though. The majority of users here are young adults or college aged kids. So those metrics are going to be skewed in that direction.
---
They'll probably just rename it to something else like they did Sharding -&gt; Layering.
---
Hope they add arenas at some point
---
Yeah, and just for a week or two. Then it became for a month or two. Now it's for a phase or two.
---
Horde all day bro
---
Different degrees require different amounts of effort, and time.
---
Yeah of course, its no problem. Positive vibes, 3 months left!
---
phase 2 is almost 3 months after phase1
---
You know you don't have to play until layering is gone right? You could start the game 6 weeks after everyone else and get the true experience.
---
Seriously, you guys are fucking morons.
---
The idea is that they’re gonna have the layers because they expect a lot of people to start playing at release then quit. So this is their solution to servers not being dead after a month.
---
Actually, no. I've played cata beta if i remember correctly. Without active subscription.
---
Great insult.
---
Not the point I was making at all but you do you
---
Mages have very little hard CC? I thought Poly was considered the best in game. To me, Warlocks feel squisher. I die faster as a Lock than as a Mage, thanks to shields, Blink, Nova and Ice Block.
---
105 days away. Pack it up boys.
---
As a teacher, the date has me pretty bummed.
---
Better make the most of the one week I got!
---
The world changed DRASTICALLY in Cataclysm, much of Vanilla is gone now.
---
It's not better, if there is a queue then the system will drop everyone all over the place regardless.
---
Also, they broke their promise already "with only sharding starting zones".
---
I can't believe server technology regressed in this they and age, they are just cheap fucks about the proper hardware to handle enough people.
---
Those are furniture-feet. I bought them on Amazon!
---
Ok, be an asshole because people fee differently than you.
---
Every summer ends in August if we are talking school-wise. Yeah we sure are gunna have a classic summer not playing!
---
Hush up sweet summer child, Enjoy the fine weather this year then play some classic in your spare time when it launches. It won't kill you I promise.
---
No they won't.
---
Bullying? Lol. This world needs more bullying. Maybe there would be fewer fatties.
---
Writing so I can get an answer aswell.
---
yea idk eitha
---
That's pretty tragic, you only get one body. Honestly over the last decade mortality has hit me pretty hard and I'm disgusted at how I treated me body when it was in its' prime.
---
If you are reading this and your teens, twenties etc please, if you struggle with physical activity search hard for something active you don't hate. Walking, swimming, running, lifting, cycling, jumping, climbing whatever. Whether you spend the last 30 years of your life doing whatever you want or hobbling around in constant pain (if you even get them at all!) is basically determined by if you had the smallest shred of motivation to get off your arse and do something for a few hours a week.
---
I've seen a lot of people die in misery and a lot of people die in contentment and the single defining factor has been whether their body was a prison or an asset.
---
I'd like to hear your disagreements on open beta.  Open betas are a relatively recent phenomenon.  And that's for brand new games.  Personally I dislike the recent trend of early access and open beta development.  Classic will do well with a closed beta.  The point of betas used to be to find bugs, less needed on this game, and to stress test.
---
Le epic woke trolly post
---
I’m not saying it won’t. I’m just saying that polls you are quoting are going to skew numbers towards that age range, inflating what their contribution to population would be in actuality.
---
You stated that something that I presume you have been looking forward to for a very long time will just be tossed aside now because you don't want the nostalgia to extend into TBC and WotLK? Yeah, I stand by what I said. If that little bit of information will make you not play, then whatever.
---
And that means you don't even get 1 month of summer. That is also a fact. So it's not a summer of classic. It's a few weeks of classic.
---
Say someone is selling a cup of beer, and it turns out they're only filling it up 1/3 of the way, would you really expect people not to feel at least misled? Would you tell them "technically, there's some beer in a cup"?
---
C'mon guys.
---
So much for city raids. Well, If they do happen, you have less people to recruit and less people to kill. It would be weird to have your city raided and you’re just fine because you’re in a different layer.
---
They're going for that true classic experience where you neglect school and responsibilities to play

Phase 1 will be several months long.

In the northeast September is as hot as August.  If the past couple years are anything to go by, it'll still be hot at the beginning of October.
---
What happened to all these people “expecting late summer, just tell us a date!”
---
Biggest salt mine since 2016 holy shit lmao
---
&gt; Layering, is going to be needed
---
No it won't. Go away.
---
I understand. I just think it’s scummy to that you have to be subbed in order for a CHANCE to be picked for beta.

Lets fill out those time off requests boys!
---
I live in North America and kids where I am go back to school at the beginning of August.
---
Can't wait, just to laugh at all the people who are gonna cry on the forums about how long it takes to do anything.
---
I personally would like it to be a different game
---
So entire beginning of Classic you may often login and end up on dead layers and miss meeting all the great people. Not to mention that Phase 1 is the most crucial one on forming a server community. THIS IS A HHUGE FUCKUP.
---
Okay, I actually like this. There's no drawback from this.
---
The sense of community will still be there because everyone will be able to join your party or guild and if you WANT to play together (which most people will level solo anyway) you can just party. So, honestly, I don't see any drawbacks to this system. 
---
Is there a difference in leveling next to your buddy outside of party and leveling outside your layer ? You guys can quest together and party up for any quests you need help with.
---
You'll get a lot more on a blizzard server than a private server. You might have managed, but there's no reason to have to "manage" when we can actually play the game properly from the start.
---
It's actually kind of cool that they built this whole new technology just because players didn't like the idea of sharding. Makes me feel like they're really determined to support classic and keep it as classic as possible.
---
This is so much worse indeed, you could have literally outlevelled sharding then be done with it if they kept their original promise. Now they fuck the entire world up.
---
Completely different game under the hood, zones are different before cataclysm, etc. Nostalgia is a big factor to be sure, but the people who miss the game have no way to play it without private servers which come with a whole slew of problems. Retail WoW is nothing like Classic WoW.
---
Can also confirm this isn't true.    Hasn't happened to me yet, but I have friends and family IRL as well as guildies that got into legion and bfa betas without active subs.
---
Blizzard is in the entertainment business and WoW is a game. If you wish for a company to entertain you, whether you’re going to the theater, theme park, playing a game or going to see a sporting event you will be paying money for that service. If having to pay for their service and their entertainment is a problem for you, get a job or don’t play.
---
Then, do the rest of us enthusiasts a favor and quit complaining. I have no problem paying the money to participate. $15 a month isn’t breaking anyone’s bank. If it is, evaluate your life priorities.

---
Yup.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo&amp;t=12m16s
---
But as Tips noted, Cross-realm BGs were introduced in Vanilla. So it's actually an authentic feature to provide them.
---
Staysafetv stream, has been going over the irvine summit, interviews with devs. And the thoughts of the team right now.
---
12AM will be the release time for Central Europe. This is midnight between Monday and Tuesday.
---
Then you have to take a small break from the game. Jesus dude, how little life management skills do you have? Did you just not play other games while in college?
---
there will be people who try and quit after a few hours when they can't summon their dragon to fly around. 1 month seems reasonable to make sure there aren't 500 people trying to kill the same boar
---
Didn't Classic launch a month later for EU or something? Do we wanna replicate that too?
---
I'm sure you're going to be playing Classic on 15 year old computer that can only run Classic at 2fps during 40 man raids, right?
---
So you understand server stability more than blizzard. My mistake.
---
I dunno, but I was just responding to your comment that anyone who plays BFA is not interested in classic WoW at all.
---
&gt;I'd rather be level 2 for the first week, not being able to move my character because of lag than have sharding for a month or two.
---
That's you. I'm sure Blizzard HQ would be burned to the ground if people saw a 8 hour login queue on release week.
---
This is literally not a problem in any other game going through a beta phase (where you can easily make multiple accounts if you want, as well).
---
I get WHY they are doing it. I just don't agree with it.
---
Because the extent of sharding went from “starting zones for a couple weeks” to the whole damn world for 1-2 months. People are fired up for good reason... Ion said himself, sharding is *antithetixal* to the Classic experience.
---
Well if this was regular university that’s exactly what I would do, my spare time in law school will probably be studying and what not
---
Gankers want flying removed lmao.
---
All I'm saying is that you shouldn't get upset at Blizzard because YOU decided to take off work because a STREAMER overhyped something for views.
---
It's summer when considering the fiscal year, but most people don't consider their lives a step based around the fiscal year and think more about other factors:  academic year, etc.
---
Most people think of "summer" as June, July, and August.  That's what kids get taught in most elementary schools.  
---
When you go to stores and see decorations, the summer decorations come down in august and the autumn decorations go up in September.
---
So yes, it's technically summer but it's not how most people think of summer.
---
Not always. They were implemented in 1.12, the patch Classic is running off of.
---
You're right don't listen to the people who didn't try in college. Part time job plus a demanding major is more work than a full time job.
---
My job is heavy this month and I'm doing ten hour days five days a week and I still have time for a little games after work and I have my entire weekend. 
---
I had way less time for fun than this in college.
---
NOOOOOOO
---
&gt;	I'd rather be level 2 for the first week, not being able to move my character because of lag than have sharding for a month or two.
---
You say that, until your third evening in a row is a two hour queue just to log in and get nothing done.
---
I don’t like “layering”, but it’s not going to stop me enjoying the game.
---
Never have I had such mixed feelings about a game. Excited for the game that I loved and played so much but also reminded of the fact that it consumed my life. A small part of me hopes it sucks
---
This is no laughing matter.
---
My wife has 3 weeks off, the remaining 4 were going to be wow-time for me and me alone.
---
Now I'm stuck grading fucking papers and watching these drooling troglodytes go home early to outlevel me.
---
Read what I said again. I'm not agreeing with you.
---
Interesting. I took it as layering upon login. Either way though.
---
Finally I can sign in my vacation.
---
3 FREE WEEKS FOR LAUNCH INCOMING, HYPE WOOP WOOP
---
Seasons don't operate around school scheduling, believe it or not.
---
World pvp, community building, what if glass 1 is full &amp; you get put into glass 2 but glass 2 is dead? This is so dumb &amp; no real classic enthusiast is ok with it. Go play retail.
---
Well, sure, but it's also hot right now where a lot of people live.
---
While technically still summer, most people don't see it as such, which we see when we look at things like when school is out, or when the most common weeks for vacation occurs.
---
Summer vacation is June July August for most.
---
The most common vacation days in the summer is the month of July etc.
---
Releasing it during vacation days isn't smart though. As most people have other things planned, like traveling etc.
---
Which is probably why they avoided releasing it in June or July.
---
$34 International priority shipping fee (no basic shipping available). comes to like $190 CAN right now.
---
No it hasn't. You have never needed an active sub before this. I got into previous WoW betas when I was on year(s) hiatuses.
---
Your preference isn't the same as a lot of others. If we want new players to join and enjoy the game, wouldn't it be a good idea to give them a semi-accurate depicion of how the game 'usually' is? I.e slightly less populated zones, not 500+ people fighting over a couple mobs.
---
Fuck off, shill. Private servers with a bunch of people who have to reverse engineer literally everything they do server side can run more people on a single server than a billion dollar company?
---
I'd rather kill myself than take 15 hours to reach level 10, sorry mate, speak for yourself
---
&gt; Technically, no. But it certainly won't help your chances.
---
Sounds to me like the people who have subs get priority. So while technically correct, it pretty much reads as being that way.
---
It might be the end of your summer, but it's not the end of summer per definition
---
Just a quick strawpoll, I really don't think you would be stuck at lvl 2 for a week, but I like the hyperbole and used it in the poll.
---

---
Awwww yeah!!
---
With you, bud.
---
r/alabama
---
Source in that?
---
Wouldn't it be the other way around?
---
Proactive: assigning players to select layers once based off of a certain capacity, but never changing their layer
---
Reactive: if a shard gets too full or empty, then players are shuffled around to balance the shards
---
Autumn starts 27th September, a whole month after the release date.
---
There isn't a complaint - it's about what the first month or so of classic will look like.
---
Confusing.
---
Why are you trying to explain this to me like I didnt live this life 15 years ago? I did all that in college, and played. I don't get your point.
---
Never said that at all. Thanks for completely misrepresenting my comment.
---
What isn't? And probably transphobic because I am assuming gender.
---
haven't played this game in years, but was overly obessed with it in high school. might have to take a stroll down memory lane when this comes out
---
Game time just means active WoW access, e.g. With tokens.  Not like "this person has played overwatch in the last month."
---
I'm with you.  Lots of people are flipping out, but it really beats the alternatives - which is having servers that are dead after the tourists leave, or having multi-hour login queues just because your friends started on a populous server.
---
Ouff RIP. Better late than never but I was expecting an earlier release :P
---
Jesus Christ this is the most pedantic thing to whine about.  It will be released in summer.  They didn't lie.
---
Had gold on retail, so might aswell
---
Are world bosses even in phase 1? because Ion has been quoted as making a hard promise on layering only being in for the launch
---
I'm all for #nochanges but this is something I will bend on. The population influx we saw when it launched will probably not exist. So servers could slowly start dying and with pop caps of 2k-3k it wouldn't take much to dwindle down to unplayable imo.
---
But if somebody WANTS to be on a low pop server I'm also fine with that. I have to add this comment because people sure get mad about this topic. I just don't want to be the one guy playing on the server with them.
---
Then party with someone in glass 1?
---
I am more upset that Blizzard let these man children they call content creators run around hyping us saying shit like "take off work, youll want to be here, skip school if you have to" and then its a bunch of "bad" news. Closed beta? End of summer release? Layering for the first few months? WTF!?
---
you think they do, but they don't
---
Love it's basically September RIP classic summer
---
people are allowed to be happy about the official release but not happy about the date.
---
"To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."

No layering after Phase 1 I heard Tipsout say
---
"MWAAAAAH! I DONT WANT LAYERING! MWAAAAAH! I WANT MULTIPLE HOURS OF QUEUE TIME! MWAAAAAAAAH!" - Morons.
---
It's sad but that's the way software works. Sometimes you don't know how long it'll take to fix something. At the least they focus on making it as perfect for release.
---
Family business. We are just 3 employees, we can kind of agree between us how long we want. We first said 4, but nah fuck that, I want 5. So it ended up being 5.
---
The world isn't going to end because some sheet workers are gone for 5 weeks.
---
I smell a BFA smelly boi over here
---
BGs are crossrealm anyway to avoid this problem.
---
&gt; How many of the ones who are interested are actually still playing retail? 
---
You did though.
---
A free trial isnt an active sub.
---
If that's what it means to have no changes, then so be it.
---
If they are really so incompetent that they can't give us a better launch experience than back in 2004, then I don't know what to say.
---
Just release the damn game without these bandaid solutions. Open up more servers, don't be greedy bastards.
---
On the plus side, schools typically start late august/early september, so that'll thin the herd at launch during the weeks.
---
I think the simple truth is that their current server infrastructure can't, for some reason, handle a lot of people in the same place without dropped performance.  If sharding is around for anything more than the starting zones, this community needs to lose its mind.  You can't have world pvp with sharding.
---
MY EXCITEMENT CANNOT BE CONTAINED
---
*8 year old me nerd gasms with an extra amount of mountain dew and Doritos*
---
It's not the end of the world, I would prefer not having it as a requirement but from Blizz perspective they get a few extra bucks and I would assume a higher percentage of the invites actually gets used. I sort of understand the decision but can't fully support it.
---
it cuts both ways. What if classic doesn't meet some some internal metric and they decide to just "layer" everything to save money on server costs? The reason we are all here is because they made a ton of "bad\wrong" decisions for the game and they had to revert years of dev work.
---
So what is OPs problem if it was in 1.12 why should it be removed
---
People hated but could understand the early zone sharding. Now it’s continent wide. You can’t outlevel it.
---
I played a holy pally from realease up until I stopped playing after cata. Leveling wasn't bad at all... Except somehow I got all my quests done in Eastern Strath and only hit 59.... Had to run around and kill mobs the ENTIRE level to get to 60.... That took a while lol.
---
and I got in legion beta without a sub and it caused me to resub and play again
---
Don't care about this ore due to it being gone after a month or two. That's the shortest phase of the game.
---
And to me, neither of those announcements are worth the hype machine that has been running.
---
Maybe they’re counting beta too?
---
I love hearing about family businesses, that's something I aspire to. Rock on, brother.
---
\&gt; every day when you log in you will see new people and you have no guarantee you will ever see them again the next day. It's basically like rotating servers every day.  
---
totally wrong. you didnt understand correctly. your character is locked to the layer. the ONLY way to change it is if a friend invites you to his party. which means that it will only affect you if you have IRL friends playing WoW.
---
I'm really surprised at the backlash that cross realm BGs get. I don't remember it killing PvP at all. IIRC the original battlegroups were about 8 servers so you still tended to see the same people and get a sense of the community and I always thought the cross realm rivalries (i.e., our top PvP guilds vs. their top PvP guilds) were pretty interesting.
---
Yes, I would like to play a MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER ONLINE ROLEPLAYING GAME.
---
Not a fucking modern single player action game where you get your own little zone to play in.
---
Exactly, I don't see how someone could be that dense when they supposedly went to college though...
---
 ***"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."*** 
---
A subscription based beta test. Well that's a first.
---
Haha! Suck it July 16th people
---
it is going to be a closed beta AND some dates for open stress test as they say
---
ye but what about the person i met yesterday ? gone forever
---
Ya I think a lot of people are worried about being on low pop servers that just keep getting worse and worse. Weren't server xfers introduced in vanilla anyway? So it's blizzlike to begin with? 
---
Even if it's a...dare I say it 'change'... It won't stop people from playing but could prevent people from quitting. Now we wait for the no change club to call us names.
---
Moron, you really want those queue times huh? You absolute fucking peanut brained donkey. How retarded are you? No thanks, I want to play the game, I don't want to queue for hours. But hey, you go ahead, keep asking for it.
---
You absolute fucking retard.
---
Read my username, I stand by it.
---
Completely unacceptable
---
Id rather have slow leveling than layering.
---
Until you stay up too late playing wow
---
Does anyone else interpret this as you can be invited without having a sub, but subscription is required to use the beta invite?
---
Yeah it's just nostalgia, like 800k players on Nostalrius proved. 
---
Get out retail shill
---
Wahhhhh people are complaining about things.
---
I wanna be apart of History so I'm hopping aboard this train.
---
I hope you have your 2000's PC ready with 512mb of ram you #nochanges mongoloid
---
Yeah but nochanges remember
---
It doesn't say that you HAVE to be currently subbed in order to get an invite. Just that you need one to PLAY. There's a big difference there.
---
Mods pls
---
!redditgarlic
---
sucks but hey, nochanges
---
So you get a bad reputation and transfer off? RIP
---
its the whole continent
---
Nice! But if I learned anything from big releases like this, you should have taken September 2 - September 15. I predict the servers unplayable the first week.
---
Its a great decision! Perhaps the best one they've ever done.
---
Now we can all relax and play, and dont actually have to get ahead of the curve (Which I would not be anyways since I cant play as much as most people).
---
Great decision Blizzard. I am proud
---
poggies
---
When 0 is the starting point, it would be awkward to count down, then up again.
---
Ever played on a release day and the days following?
---
I do not understand... why would it need a Beta???? 
---
It has been "playtested" for 14 years.
---
I mean, yeah sharding sucks, but I will take temporary sharding over "*can't do anything because 1000 players in 1 zone*" any day.
---
HOW IS THIS COMING OUT 2 WEEKS BEFORE BORDERLANDS 3. FUCK YOU BLIZZARD. MONTH LEFT OF SUMMER. I HATE YOU
---
&gt; I managed that on private servers and it was fine
---
Mobs are on a 5.5 minute respawn timer. Starting zones can **maybe** handle 200 players each (600 total). If you join a server that has 1000+ active accounts in the 2nd day, you will have to wait 5-15 minutes to tag a mob (depending on class and ease of tagging). Some quests before level 10 require you to kill 10 mobs. They take about an hour to complete at best.
---
Without dynamic respawning (which I would favor) or some type of sharding, the majority of the players will be stuck sub level 10 for a week and sub level 20 for probably 2 weeks.
---
Nost had faster respawning and look:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Nostalrius/comments/3qgjpc/respawn_timers/
---
The game is not fun if you can't complete quests or get XP.
---
I’m the kid yet you’ve never set foot in a uni class? Dream on, retard.
---
It shouldn't. OP wanted the experience to be closer to the majority of Vanilla, where there were only server BGs. And it wouldn't have been surprising if Blizzard made that decision. But it's also not surprising for Blizz to go with cross-realm BGs from the start, since they've said before that many of their other functional components like skill trees and item stats will be based on 1.12.
---
Beta tomorrow and release in 14 weeks. I wish it was 4-6 : (
---
I’m pretty bummed about it not going to lie. Everyone saying it’s technically summer is absolutely correct. It will release and there will be 25 more days of summer. That is true. The preceived summer, at least to most people in NA, tends to go along with the school year and classic will be released the first week of school in my area. So it’s understandable that people are disappointed. 
---
I teach and was very much hoping for an earlier release date. It was my chance to get to play the game more competively for the first time and I was really excited for that chance. Unfortunately it’s not in the cards for me and I’ll only have time to play the game casually. Obviously being the first week of school taking time off is not an option.
---
Sharding is fine, but we just got news that they're doing layering for possibly all of phase 1...
---
They are already bending nochange HEAVILY, I honestly don't know how much further they'll bend it.
---
I like camping, and cottaging, September has less bugs, better fishing, and lately the warm weather around here has lasted almost until october (thanks climate change?).
---
Yeah ... That's what discipline is for ... But I am a fat fuck so that's not one of my strong points anyway
---
Well this aged well.
---
fuck sharding/layering
---
Dumb question I suppose, but I honestly have no idea.  Do I purchase and download the original game, or are they releasing something new that I purchase on the release date?
---
Because layering will be gone (hopefully) by Phase 3 when BGs are enabled.
---
Use your sick days for when you are sick. Calling in sick when you are not sick is fraud
---
Ofc RIGHT when school starts back up. Fuck you blizzard
---
Depends on where you live.
---
this is just wishful thinking, you will not have a chance for an invite without being subbed
---
It's a much more complicated problem than you realize.
---
How to ensure you play on the same layer as friends?
---
Oh right, well if you have the finances to opt for a sub purchase for now I'd do it, but then again you can save that money for the collectors edition and save your hype for the real thing :)
---
Wow it's almost like they made classic to make money, what a shocker
---
I mean beta in the colloquial sense of being a playable version of the game with available prior to launch and only for a short period of time.
---
yeah I'm wondering about this. Is it enough to have unused game hours or something? I don't want to play retail at all, so I don't want to pay for it for a chance at classic beta
---
Classic release before the last day of summer.
---
august 13th
---
Hahahahah homework and studying take up more time than a full time job. You're joking right?
---
Which this THANKFULLY gives me enough time to submit my vacation!!! Here we to boys and girls!!!!
---
because it's fucking trash and made the game worse
---
&gt;to honor it's legacy
---
You must be an awful cook then. I want my meals to taste good, not to "honor the legacy". 
---
&gt;Make more servers and merge them
---
How about we make multiple servers a different number behind them ?
---
Bernie can still win!
---
The prophet
---
Fair enough. Your post just seemed very angry to me.
---
I responded to your post further down somwhere. Honestly, I am happy with a release date. I don't care about Beta (even though I am on the F&amp;F list).
---
I am, however, firmly against picking beta participants solely on the basis of an active subscription. I do not believe for one second that that, somehow, presents the "best testing opportunities", though again, I understand the why. Revenue Stream.
---
Agree to disagree, I guess. :)
---
Europe.
---
No. When you create your character, the 3000 people creating an account at the same time will be in the same "layer" if they log out and log back in they're still in your layer. It's just micro servers of 3000 split up and will be merged into 1 big 15k pop server within a few weeks of launch.
---
&gt; Also enjoy your 10 hour to queue to get into game without some sharding/layering.
---
Queues will still be there even with layering. Queues are for total player population. Layers/shards are for player count per continent.
---
It will completely take realm identity out of phase 1.
---
THAT'S THE WEEK OF MY HONEYMOON
---
WEDDING'S CANCELLED
---
Ye I‘ll probably going to be downvoted to hell, but people overhype classic tooo much imho It‘s just nostalgia guys, nothing else. Classic was not that enjoyable compared to modern WoW. When I was younger (around 2007-2009) I also played an MMORPG called Metin2 and in that time it was like THE best game ever. When I think back to that time, I wish I could jump in a time machine and go back to expirence the feeling again. Well I tried Metin2 again in the last years and it‘s reaaally bad. All the good memories I had about that game are just nostalgia, when life was not so stressful, you could just sit on your PC and play some games all day long. Times change guys, WoW classic will not be the same like it was 15 years ago imo. One big problem to add is that people change, the playerbase change. We are not that „helpfull“ and „social“ today, like we were in 2005 when these kind of games were a new expirence for us and everyone just wanted to have a good time. Well, we‘ll see but I personally think classic will by hyped at the beginning and will go downhill in popularity withing the first weeks after release.
---
wow, i just mistook them for the Highlander's Lamellar Spaulders
---
Random nobody streamer provides official blizzard information yet blizzard does not
---
Where did you hear that?
---
Dude, just go fuck yourself. Better yet, kill yourself.
---
You are toxic to the community. No one wants you or anyone like you playing with them. Quality of life changes ARE NOT TERRIBLE.
---
Then they should have called it "L" haha
---
Youre not getting it.  Betas are linked to accounts.
---
Trial accounts are store seperately.but either way... its their game, and if it were my game, id only reward active players too.
---
The world does not revolve around college students
---
That's nice.  So his comment was about his school scheduling which is what the majority of students are taking about when they refer to summer.  But I forgot the majority of the people interested in this game aren't in school and won't give a shit about school schedules.
---
sharding: servers contain multiple copies of each zone and are moved in and out at will (eg seeing people phase in\out)
---
layering: servers contain multiple copies of continents. players are assigned to a layer so you will generally see the same people and no phasing in\out
---
So they renamed sharding to layering Nice.
---
That's not what it means. It just means you can't see people in other layers until/unless you log out and then later log back in with a different group of people. If you're not playing much, you'll still fall behind the curve in terms of leveling and item acquisition regardless of what layer you're on.
---
Perfect! Living in the northern part of the world summer is for being outside, traveling and such. Autumn and winter is for playing indoors.
---
I'm getting downvoted for saying this same thing to other people. Actually disappointed with people and their ability to be so negative to literally any piece of good news
---
The way around this is to just skip some quests and grind other mobs for xp. It's honestly part of the magic to see a bunch of other players scouring the land looking for things to kill. I'd rather see that than see an empty space with all the mobs I could hope to have to kill.
---
Yep.  It was always a necessary evil.  I'm slightly bummed at the potential duration of layering, but relieved to at least have a final answer.
---
The long night has begun men of the nights watch. Classic is coming.
---
25 dollars every time to ninja. Worth?
---
&gt; Also, they broke their promise already "with only sharding starting zones". 
---
No they didn't there's literally no sharding at all.. you're on one server and will never phase anywhere else.  It's multiple instances of the same server. I don't like it, but it's a much better solution that sharding and apparently will only last a couple weeks for launch.. so chill out
---
its literally not though this sub is so infuriatingly toxic. all you dumb fucks do is complain. 8.27.19 is still a month away from the end of summer. how is this release date a surprise to you?
---
https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=260 4:20 mark layering discussion begins.
---
Ya.  It's not summer 2019, it's end of summer.
---
With layering though you will be able to put say 10k players on server x, instead of capping at 3k and starting a queue.
---
I'm on the fence regarding activating my sub just to maybe get beta access.
---
&gt; This hasnt been required before
---
I'm not aware of any WoW beta that was open to non-subscribers.
---
Realm identity is being able to level in Westfall and struggle with a quest and some priest comes over and heals you, buffs you and runs off. You see his name and remember him...then you guys run into each other in Tanaris questing. You see the same people while you leveling (the majority of what phase 1 will be). Layering/sharding means you will see a different set of people every time you log on.
---
yeah, blizzard dumped a steaming pile on everyone today in typical blizzard fashion but listening to bozo streamers is your own fault
---
 from Tip's stream, a direct quote from Ion Hazzikostas, "There will never be layering after phase 1, period.  Quote me on that.".  
---
They said also during the interview it is dynamic and only as needed.
---
People need to be happy that WE ARE GETTING CLASSIC WOW BACK
---
I swear people just need to CHILL
---
actual storyline, coherent character decisions, actual thought behind anything&gt;epic
---
Server pop will be capped at 3k, you are gonna want cross-realm
---
Don't underestimate the power of the hype machine.
---
I would prefer slower leveling for everyone, make the journey last longer.
---
Were they always crossrealm?
---
I thought that came in later with battle groups.
---
Not may, you do.
---
devilsaur leather is overhyped....
---
You will still play even if they were only 100
---
Honestly let’s skip BC and go straight go LK
---
And then once playing classic realize if you aren't a streamer good luck putting together any grps for anything.
---
You thought you could get an eye of shadow?  Oh sweetie...
---
just gotta up that fortitude bro! resist the elements!
---
3.5 months damn that's longer than I anticipated
---
On the flip side, it could only be the first few weeks, not the entire phase. I'd still rather the entire phase than a shit launch where you can't even play for weeks because people will be fighting for non-dynamic mobs/quest items.
---
Why the downvote omegalul
---
Sharding will ruin the Classic WoW experience. 100%
---
If anything in this comment is to be taken seriously:
---
now I have to live for another three months just great
---
its only for phase 1 - also they will be keep guild players in the same layer
---
I think it's pretty slimy. It's not about the money (I happily bought a demo ticket), but paying for a game you're not interested in just for a slim *chance* of getting into the beta is basically gambling. It also feels extra greedy since this is not something that is typical with other blizzard betas.
---
The sun is a deadly laser
---
I fully expect them to layer chat too. So people reading your message in trade should see you.
---
Alright.
---
So the population caps are still massively higher.  Are they expecting a lot of people to disappear?
---
Correct and funny. *golf clap*
---
How is it “literally infinitely worse”. 
---
Literally.
---
That's not the overall point I'm making ya dumby. There's a lot more to what makes an "ideal release" date for someone personally beyond what hemisphere they live in. And I live in Texas.
---
Of course not. But if layering is a 2-3 month process I might just wait.
---
Of course not, I’m just a potential customer why would they want to make me feel like they are dealing fairly and openly with me? Obviously it’s much better to make players excited about your project feel ripped off by paying $15 dollars and then not getting access to what they are interested in.
---
It’s beta Loot Boxes, seems very Activision.
---
fucking august aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I see what you're saying now, but you're still wrong. The beta is not going to be constant. I don't know why you think there is going to be a 3 month beta lol
---
You're just wrong
---
NMS wasn't bad on launch because it was rushed to a deadline. It's like if they announced a Classic release date, but they had been porting Cata the whole time by mistake.
---
We can be both glad to have a release date and disappointed that it’s so late in the summer.
---
In the US, "summer" almost always means June, July and August.  That's just the common use of the term "summer".     
---
However you define summer, this is really bad for anyone who wanted to play during the summer before Sept. 1.
---
I imagine they're going to combine the layering with the traditional population cap. That number's important too but if layers are 2-3k and realms are limited to 2-3 layers then overpopulation will at least be limited. Maybe at that point they can fall back on the solutions people expected them to use with realm transfers.
---
All the people getting upset are mad they never went to school.
---
I didnt want to have leveling hanging over my head during studies. I aim for top grades, which is time consuming. If I have been 8 hours in classes and then spent 4 hours studying after, I probably dont want to log on just to continue the level grind. But if I had a few active weeks at the start, I could know enough people and be high enough level to hang in org, chatting and still feel happy I logged on.
---
Nice troll post.
---
Layered not sharded.
---
It means you will be able to see 2-3k players at once and layering will persist.. Way more than a vanilla server could ever support.
---
"get old players back"
---
Calm down, it's a stress test for like 48 hours.
---
Nothing in the post you responded to mentioned a "choice" so I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Blizzard can do whatever they want with Classic WoW. They can implement sharding, LFR, cash shop, whatever. But I am going to express my disappointment and appeal for a change, otherwise I'll stick with free private servers that do a much better job of implementing classic WoW. If you want those things then fine, but it's absolutely against the spirit of the game that they're trying to recreate.
---
"These fucking assholes actually want people to be paying for their product! Unacceptable!"
---
Yeah same, was planning on two weeks off before school starts to get my two chars to 60, now I may have to wait till the semester is over to even hit 60 and be able to do content
---
That’s at least a bit better. Still not a big fan of dividing the servers into these so-called layers though
---
Vanilla realms had a cap of 2500 players
---
Shill? Because I want to PLAY the game and not be stuck doing fuck all hoping I can tag a mob with loads of other people? You're an idiot.
---
"when it's nice"
---
*glances at 103° day in August*
---
Not so much.
---
Yea, for me it's excellent. I have a couple of weeks vacation in july and that's when I'm expected to be with girlfriend and family. Now I can actually join at the start without being way behind all the college kid nolifers.
---
Is this an update to the original WarCraft: Humans &amp; Orcs?  Or their original MMORPG?
---
Oh so being in same party will mean they transfer to same layer? And after they leave they will go back to the original layer where they were designated? What about guilds?
---
Yeah kinda sucks that it seems like things are being catered to an audience who cares less about classic, than those who have been pushing for this for years now.
---
You stay in your layer after you are set to your layer. The only time you might see transitions is if your friends you party with (not people around you, as they are in the same layer as you) are not in the 3000 or so people in your Layer (which indicates there may be about 2-3 layers per realm, and is not likely to happen), you get shifted to the host's layer, all with people in your realm.
---
This will only happen for a couple of weeks, no longer than the end of Phase 1 (from Tips's stream). This is not the death of the game, not even close. You will be around only people from your server, and when the layering ends, you'll see more people from your server.
---
I'd prefer to not have it and let the chaos ensue, but it is what it is, and it will be the way it is only for a few weeks, worst case the end of Phase 1.
---
Bullshit. Are we supposed to buy this?
---
Players come to accept it because it's all been incredibly reasonable. Sharding was a reasonable solution to avoid dead servers. It sucked because sharding is clunky and broken and really in-your-face, but it was still reasonable. Layering is much, much better. I'd rather be with a full server of permanent people than only see 50 or so per zone and watch them periodically phase out.
---
It sounds like a practical change. Vanilla WoW probably didn't have the massive onslaught of players that Classic will on launch. This allows Blizzard to gauge the true gaming population for Classic rather than committing a ton of servers and having low populations, or undercommitting and having colossal queue times.
---
The tech is there. The game is running on modern framework. They're going to use it to have as stable an experience as possible. It has worked well for the past couple of launches I think.
---
It was never Vanilla. It was always Classic.
---
wonder why that is
---
It's not a closed beta, it's a stress test.
---
it will be region locked. no reason to be otherwise
---
Yeah and the hundreds of other people wi ll be doing the same thing. It won't help.
---
neat cool fact
---
Yeah how dare they claim it will release upon the dew of the First true day of Summer?  I can’t believe in a situation where a time range goes from 1 to 100 they went with 80 instead of 1.
---
You need an active sub to be considered for Beta. LUL
---
Wait for it to charge... level up... farm something to get it up... possibilities are endless.
---
Create three characters on august 13th for a release on august 27th?
---
Sounds like the game will be ready to launch on the 13th, and should be launched on the damn 13th.
---
Please don't sub and encourage this type of behaviour.
---
Because the player cap is the size of a vanilla server and it's not limited to a single zone so you don't enter a new shard/layer every time you switch zones. It's like playing on a server that will later be merged with other servers...
---
Yes, technically. But when has anyone actually considered September 22nd part of the summer? Football is on, pumpkin spice is everywhere and everyone's back in school. I understand they have every right to use the technical summer window for their release but it's still cheap.
---
ah yes, the 300 interesting players that camp hogger will be the best companions
---
What major?
---
Yeah this is fucking trash
---
Looks like I can play this while listening to the new Tool album.
---
https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Ek6jgeF
---
So server pop will be 6-8k? Once the layers are merged?
---
Friendships will form. I'm not saying that. I'm saying that until P2 you won't really have a lot of level 60s anyway, people won't be so familiar with each others' names, a lot will be in random low-level instances, etc. It's at 60 when a community starts actively forming, and due to how long it takes for the average player to reach level 60 in Vanilla, I don't suspect any more than 5-10% of the entire server population will reach 60 before P2 hits, unless each phase is well over 3 months.
---
There will be a lot of burnout from casual tourists who disappear at level 30. Those people won't be part of a server's community. The community will be defined primarily by those at 60 or close to it and, after BGs are introduced in P3, subcultures of twinks at 19, 29, etc.
---
From what layering sounds like, it seems like there will be several thousand people on each layer anyway, so it's not like you'll be hitting a ghost town. You simply won't see as much permanence in usernames. But people level at different speeds anyway, so anyone leveling faster or slower than you would be as "invisible" to you as people in a separate layer.
---
Guess i’ll be doing my beta on the pservers then!
---
Had 2.5 weeks of vacation booked for August for 2 months now. So glad I'm only going to miss out on a couple of days from launch
---
Here we don't gooooooo...
---
I never once said how long it will last. Beta starts May 14, first stress test is May 22. Last stress test is like July 19. I suspect that the beta will end somewhere around the end of July.
---
It does and it has been explained to you three times now.
---
Is there re-spec in vanilla or dual talent? I can't remember when they added them.
---
Can someone explain to me the hatred towards Tips?  I don't really get it.
---
how long is phase 1?
---
I think it's a fair solution for launch hype.
---
You're still going to get the authentic "OH FUCK SO MANY PEOPLE" experience, but you will admittedly lose out on seeing the same people to a small extent early on, however it's been confirmed layering will prioritize the same people to the same layer.
---
This is amazing I can spend summer drinking in the sun and become a recluse at the end of August when it starts to cool down.
---
Yeah. 3pm PST. So 5pm on the east coast. Pretty easily to slip out of work early especially if you have vacation planned
---

People here whining like they are schoolkids...

But most of us are beyond vacation limitations...
---
*laughs in adult life*
---
OH BABY HERE I COME!
---
How are any of these things tricks?
---
We've known about sharding for months. Layering is an improvement over retail sharding and they've once again confirmed it's only going to be used in a time-limited way.
---
Sometimes release dates are later than you expect and sometimes they're earlier than you expect.
---
Your complaints about the beta essentially boil down to "give me something for free right now."
---
As someone who now has that week off of work.....wooohooooo
---
Expectation: Classic wow Tues-fri then camping for the holiday weekend.
---
Reality: pissed off at shit servers and lags Tues-fri drinking all weekend thinking about playing classic wow.
---
as long as classic stays and tbc, wotlk are separate games, i'm fine with that.
---
Not satisfied at all with the release date. Screw people saying we're asking for too much, Blizzard said a Classic summer. August 27th is the end of august. I start school in September. Really shitty tbh.
---
How are peoples in school and complaining so hyped and mad. They were probably not even into wow when classic existed.. I'm lost
---
Come again? Why should I let YOU make decisions for me then? You are telling me to shut up and then telling me to not let people decide for me, are you fucking mental mate?
---
This is a valid concern. I think a step in the right direction would be to lock a person's account to a layer. Sure they can still hop over to another layer by joining a group, but they would now need a big circle of friends make this efficient.
---
Blind sheep clown. Nice.
---
Alright then my advice to you is to cancel your sub, unsub from this subreddit, and find something else to do my friend. Best of luck
---
Or people are being over-dramatic. The classic team has proven that they want it to be vanilla experience, and if the layers are big enough it wouldn't change anything.
---
!remindme 86 days
---
So do you plan to take up herbalism?
---
Nope
---
Yes, and there is no other reason to do it then to grab some extra cash.
---
Cash grab.
---
No concrete number yet, but Tips threw out the number 15k, but that seems way too high even for temporary servers. We'll have to wait for more info!
---
Exactly.
---
I mean, it's two weeks before.  You're going to need a subscription to play.  You're just starting it two weeks early if you want to secure names.  Not that big of a deal.
---
If they are invited into another layer do they go back to their own afterwards? Only if the same people are supposed to be "locked" into a certain layer?
---
Haha that sounds great actually. No I also do news stuff about the city. So I‘m on the phone the whole day trying to find out where the traffic is going, if something important happened in the city and stuff. Not much time to get those sweet epics in between :P
---
It's also not accurate. They said end of phase 1 as a maximum.
---
Doesn't make it any less shitty. They were happy to change item names from what they originally were in vanilla.
---
Im so happy that we have a release date now, but its the worst date that could have been selected in my case ... feelsbadman.
---
Lmao @ all the people complaining that they wont be able to play now. What was your plan? Playing 2 months and quitting? Why the hell would Blizz even cater to the short term crowd
---
“Bro you cut the line”
---
Every year people don't pay attention in school.
---
Don't think anyone is surprised that all they care about is money. Disappointed maybe. Not surprising.
---
I would sacrifice that anyday! Id rather skip a quest/single mob then possibly ruin the world pvp experience vanilla provided. Sharding in retail made world pvp so scarce. It felt so empty and completely ruined the experience. Not only that no sharding/layering never seemed to be am issue on capped private servers. Yea some wuests were hard to do but so what. Do another quest
---
Harder but if its doable people will do it which leaves abuse open.  Take for example Black Lotus - a high demand item. Why wouldn't someone create multiple guilds to hop into to check for spawns across layering?
---
What if each shard is literally 2 thousand players though?  People are reacting to something without knowing much about it.  Don’t be the anti vaxxers of wow.
---
Summer ends in late September. They probably would have loved to put it out in July, but game development can be a bitch sometimes.
---
Beta's aren't about really about judging the game. It's for mostly for play testing.
---
I think the colloquial understanding of summer is different from the technical definition of summer
---
Would downranking starfire and wearing spellpower gear equate to more damage over a long fight than using max rank starfires while wearing the 3 pieces of T2? 
---
Rank 4 starfire compared to rank 7 starfire has a roughly 300 damage difference, but saves you 110 mana per cast. So using the same 30 starfire example, you'd effectively gain 3,300 mana by downranking to rank 4, but you'd also lose 9000 damage during the 90 seconds (100 dps loss).
---
Honestly I like it 'cause I get almost 2 months devoted to the new FF14 expansion and when that's on "log in to raid only" mode I'll have all the free time in the world to play this
---
You severely underestimate how much people are dissatisfied with BFA while also still being loyal players. A good amount of players, especially on the high-end, are extremely disappointed with the state of BFA and frankly aren't optimistic with Blizzards current direction but as it stands there isn't really a better option.
---
Just because someone plays BFA it doesn't mean they didn't play Vanilla and you can't just immediately invalidate an entire group of people because they aren't exactly like you. That is some next-level gatekeeping shit which I see a lot from this "community" that somehow also preaches how great it will be to see not only veteran players returning but also new players coming in.
---
Now I don't really even feel like playing :/ classes start like 3 days after this. Riiiip
---
Sharding could've atleast been inplemented ONLY to the starting zones (1-10) and not the entire fucking continent. I'm not trying to debate with you, not worth my time.
---
Unpopular Opinion::  "Layering" is absolutely 100% necessary.  I see the unlimited scenarios playing out where the majority of people will be *vastly* unprepared for the slow pace of leveling, and without some way to balance out populations, the first 24+ hours of the game would have easily thousands, if not 10s of thousands of people just chillin in Elwynn Forest trying to get their bearings.    
---
The 2%ers that outlevel the masses will feel alone in zones, but that's not unlike how the game was on first release anyway.
---
Didn't think this thread would make me sad. Sorry man, glad you atleast get to relive it!
---
Yes there is..if you’ve ever played Maplestory or other Japanese MMO’s, its the concept of picking a world, then picking a “channel” on that world. You’ll always be on Shattered Hand server, but you might be on channel 1 or 3 or 5. It’s similar to that concept.
---
&gt; I would still prefer no sharding/layering, but hey that's just me.
---
I'd also prefer dynamic respawns in level 1-20 zones instead of sharding. But that would inflate the economy a ton early on and put people against a wall once they exit the 2nd zone.
---
yes, you do.  
---
To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
WotLK is a perfect blend of the slow pace and in depth of classic and the shallower but faster pace of live IMO.
---
It also has beautiful aesthetic and the best story.
---
My only hope is that if they do make BC/WotLK servers you'll be able to transfer your classic characters to BC and BC to WotLK.
---
Hyped to give this game a try. Longtime MMO veteran (started with Anarchy Online, proceeded to Everquest, FFXI, Ragnarok Online, EVE Online, Warhammer Online, more FFXI, FFXIV, ESO and Wildstar) who has managed to never play WoW, crazily enough.
---
Can anyone point me in the direction of a good basic "things you should know" guide to start on Classic? I know it's not released yet so no one knows exactly what it will be like, but I'm sure it's going to be pretty similar to Vanilla (obviously) so there should be some tips and tricks out there. A class guide would be nice too.
---
Sounds like you can go donate to a private server instead then. If you expected this for free/cheaper, you're delusional.
---
Canada here too... I preordered it but thinking about cancelling. You?
---
Same Boat.
---
Oh fuck off with your whining you ungrateful shit.
---
Bankers used flying mounts to drop in on people. It's people who want actual pvp and same faction interactions. There were alot of world pvp objectives in outland that was just stupid due to flying, like the hellfire capture points. Literally just people sitting in flying mounts capping them flying off at first sight of a player. Ruined it completely
---
It's a new tech, so I imagine that's something they've ironed out. It honestly looks to be built upon cross realm and connected realm tech.
---
Phase 1 at the longest.  Shorter if populations stabilize earlier.
---
&gt; You're right. I would still prefer no sharding/layering, but hey that's just me.
---
I am all for Classic being Classic, however not being able to play the game due to overpopulation is shit.
---
Sharding / Layering is needed for a good player experience. Classic player population will die down after a month or so as it is. Layers aren't cross server, so anyone you meet will still be on the same server, if they even make it after level 10.
---
When did they say they're doing that?
---
HYPE! Seriously I'm happy and hyped as fuck. 
---
With that being said, I expected "Classic summer". I'm a patient person, however I have to be honest I expected it kinda sooner. This way later than I expected.
---
Well, I guess more time to play ESO and it's new expansion. I gave up on BfA and I'm not coming back to retail until the next expansion. I was hoping Classic would come sooner because I need WoW in my life. Oh well.
---
My first kid would only sleep in his rocker, which was foot powered - that meant 8+ hours of virtually uninterrupted MoP time every night for a month.
---
How is it still sharding when on live you can literally phase into a shard without having done anything to trigger it but in layeri g this will never happen. Stop saying it's sharding. It's not. You might need to go back to renew your degree.
---
It's a deal breaker for me.
---
Sure, I saw it in the official announcement:
---
&gt;If you’re eager to claim your character name in WoW Classic, take note: we’ll be opening character creation on Tuesday, August 13.** Players with an active subscription or game time on their account will be able to create up to three characters per World of Warcraft account. We’ll have more information on realm names closer to launch, but rest assured—you’ll have plenty of time to figure out your plans for realm domination!
---
But server caps will be at 2500, no?
---
Come to Denver. Everything is hiring
---
I would rather have a shittier couple of days of crowded starter zones, than have a shitty couple of months with sharding in the game. 
---
People will find efficient ways to abuse this by hopping through layers.
---
If i could upvote this a thousand times over i would.
---
they're are very popular expansions i would be for it
---
Well they could put it out in July, but then everyone currently bitching about the release date would instead spend the following month bitching about the bugs.
---
They're releasing server info 2 weeks early. You can create 3 characters on the realm before the game launches to reserve names.
---
3 fookin months :/
---
I appreciate the old reddit link.
---
Alright, riddle me this. The whole layer thing was an evolution on top of sharding to prevent phasing/disappearing characters etc.
---
So let's say there's a few full layers going. How do they fill a new layer? Do they **PHASE** current players out to fill it? Do new players joining the server end up on a unpopulated layer?
---
It doesn't make sense, because the problem they wanted to solve, phasing, is still there, just not as apparent.
---
Also what's to stop two friends playing, ganking people and when they get into deep shit, simply party up and phase out from their attackers? It's highly questionable.
---
Because most clearly are students.  Get real.
---
“Can I have another one?!”
---
To be fair, we knew the game was coming this summer before you conceived the baby. Your priorities are clearly imbalanced.
---
“Layering”
---
Also knowing as sharding without the server xfer cash grab.
---
Why don't they just layer the fucking starting zones and not the whole game...
---
Launches are always unknowns.  I imagine this is there to prevent overloading issues.  Without any additional measures to ease performance, the entire server could crash otherwise.  
---
Other options are basic looting and questing issues.  Tagging mobs will be back and if there are 200 people in one area, you're never getting those Zhevra hoofs.   If they don't take their precautions, it could be a disaster with crashed servers, overpopulation, no one getting anything done.  You could argue that it's part of the WoW experience, but launch for WoW Classic is going to be much bigger than WoW launch in 2004.
---
Is this real?
---
Wallpaper if anyone need [https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template\_resource/J3YI57J7K5TB1557767431134.jpg](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/J3YI57J7K5TB1557767431134.jpg)
---
If they stick to the "only phase 1" promise, then the impact will be minimal.  There may be a bump in the beginning (though during which most people will be leveling anyway, and not farming), but over time it will even out.
---
Thanks for this.
---
This is the answer right here. I really, really do not want layering for maybe more than a week.
---
No it was confirmed that when you invite someone to your layer they stay in it. They are locked to that one. Unless they get invited to another one. So if they leave your group, they are still in your layer.
---
it's only for the first damn phase! You people are fucking psycho. "REEEE layering during launch ruins my nostalgia!!!!" Yea go be stuck in Goldshire for 2 weeks due to massive lag and overpopulation and complain about that.
---
if you truly believe that then i dont know what to tell you
---
&gt; I really do, but the sacrifice of the community to be able to kill mobs faster is not worth it in the long run in my opinion.
---
Nothing is being sacrificed.. Layer populations are 2-3k players, any people you might not meet because of layering are people you wouldn't meet because of server queues.
---
Adding them will keep people playing. If they don't people stop playing. In both scenarios classic loses players.
---
So all of phase 1 then lol, stop apologizing for Blizzard.
---
So here’s a crazy idea. Classic could have a cap a cap of 2500 and no sharding.
---
Do you have a source for that?
---
It's much more. The server problems are due to the mass sharding and phasing in/out constantly every different subzone/quest area.
---
I have a wedding the previous Friday, an archaeological dig over the weekend, but fortunatly Monday is a bank holiday. Either way going to be tired but fuck it!
---
I am not locked out with you, you are locked out with me! \*Destroys the button\*
---
Disappointment.
---
And that's their fault for making a completely stupid decision.
---
People are just looking for a reason to complain. I think it's ridiculous and that people should just appreciate what they have instead of looking for a reason to be negative.
---
The classic solution is to allow server transfers off the server. You accept it or you wait in que.
---
Each layer will be 3k
---
essentially the server will end up at 3k server cap once layering is removed.
---
Especially when the nightmare fuel was end of September.
---
It hits a month before the nightmare fuel final day of summer. They were never going to release 8.2 and Classic near each other.

"You're gonna be real upset when they save Classic WoW to be released right when people are feeling the 8.2 content drought.

If I were a Blizzard exec, there is no way I'm launching Classic before 8.2"
---
Can I get all the upboats for that post yesterday
---
Playing on a private server now to get ready - starting zones, and then zones up to lvl 30 are so packed you'll join a group of 4 for a named quest mob kill and there are 4 other groups of 4 waiting for that same mob. 
---
I played on Illidan during vanilla -&gt; TBC and it was almost impossible to level during the first few weeks because almost all mobs didn't last for more than .5s. It can get really bad
---
Love the ret pally up there
---
I dunno bro, with no barbershops I gotta make sure my guy looks fly from the start.
---
Can someone explain layering/sharding? I assume it’s in conjunction with server population but I’m not quite sure.
---
I mean when I actually played retail vanilla - the real thing, not a private server - the zones were not completely full of people. How many posts are we going to get about how classic is going to suck because it's not like the private server you played on 2 years ago?
---
Good choice getting the people who are subbed to retail because they still enjoy easy mode wow to be the ones testing classic /s
---
Gz! Need it?
---
I can't tell you how to fix your situation if I don't even know your situation.

I was fishing for your budgeting/spending habits.

"releasing in summer 2019" -- literally releases in summer 2019.  Don't see the issue here.

All valid points. We just have to make sure we put in effort to keep track of the characters we enjoyed meeting!

There is almost 1 full month of Summer to follow the release date,  
---
June-July  July-Aug  Aug-Sept.  
---
Its absurd people consider an entire 1/3 as being too late.  I get everyone is excited to play but saying it’s basically not even Summer is like saying on a scale of 1-100 anything over 70 doesn’t count.
---
Any information on the collector's pets for vanilla?  Looks like you get nothing from vanilla with the collector's edition?
---
Downvotes for encouraging people to tourist classic. Tourist can potentially kill servers if there is enough of them.
---
I wonder if they'll apply layering to retail servers at some point, then?
---
As if students are the only players in the world wtf lmao. Might be one of the most entitled posts I've seen.
---
Failing out of college is part of the WoW Classic experience. Ah, I remember it well.
---
That's a lovely map! :D
---
I forgot to turn mine off, been running about a year untouched...
---
I don’t think you understand how the concept of sharding works outside of what you see in WoW as the player
---
Still probably gonna have lots of issues on day one lol
---
Ret Paladin lol
---
I wouldn't say 'needlessly' but whatever. It's easy to argue that many retailers are the reason that retail is viewed with such derision in the first place. People clamoring for QoL features over that degrade the MMO aspect of the game.
---
It was a dumb theory anyways.
---
You really arent too bright are you?
---
The amount of players that played private servers will be nothing compared to the amount of people who will be playing classic wow for the first month.
---
As long as they don't force the server to progress like how it actually happened I think it'll be fine (I don't think they will)
---
I love both Vanilla and TBC. Can't wait to play both.
---
This literally makes me sick. This might be a deal breaker for me.
---
People forget that battlegroups were a thing back in vanilla...
---
The chance somebody will take my handle is really low. I'll still sub two weeks early just to make sure I get it.
---
Goldsellers.
---
Then sell it to people.
---
he clearly stated in the interview if you're leveling and you see this one person you'll always see that one person.
---
Discord lmao
---
I'm not a student.  Most people consider June the start of summer.  People talk about equinox as the "official" start of summer.  
---
The entire western world has not agreed on what summer is.  Southern Hemisphere it's in December.  Some countries consider it officially June July August.
---
At the same time, those playing retail getting access to beta first will allow them to decide if they’re actually willing to put the time into Classic. This could effectively prevent a lot of the dwindling sever population issues after the release date for those deciding that Classic is “too hard”/“takes too long”.
---
Hell yes!
---
Can anyone explain why they decided to release on a Tuesday? Wouldn’t the obvious choice be Friday?
---
Thanks for your reply. I definitely see and understand where your coming from. I guess I'm just kind of bewildered by the backlash to this policy. Correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't almost all recent WOW betas been an opt-in lottery requiring a subscription (with preferential treatment to media)?
---
JuAugustly 16+11
---
Gap year confirmed
---
So, can someone join a group and be transported away from a pvp situation? I am new to this concept.
---
Just 22 months to go!
---
people are serious apologists.  This is a legit case of slippery slope, they fucking told us only the first couple of weeks, and starting zones only.
---
They said free realm transfers to solve pop issues if needed
---
Definitely can’t play as I was expecting to. I had July and August clearly booked off, but I can’t afford to be fully addicted at the beginning of a new semester. I hope everyone who gets to play enjoys it, but I do feel thousands of people including myself just went from super pumped to extremely let down.
---
see u in august
---
That's part of the experience.
---
"I remember launch. It was fucking madness."
---
Tell people classic will come out in summer . Give it a release date days before summer ends . Gg blizz
---
So why not allow bigger servers so they're populated. It's just as big of a community aspect as the rest of the game. You formed intimate bonds with the opposite side and it was great to get revenge or hunted if you crossed paths in another area of the game.
---
And? That'll still be possible with layering...
---
2 days before my 21st bday! HELL YEAH!
---
They should roll those shards into individual servers then and then allow transfers for low pop realms. I don't see a reason why a single classic wow server should invisibly support 2x+ the number of plays a server can reasonably hold.
---
Instead of zone wide sharting, it will be world wide sharting for all of Phase 1.
---
you join a layer at login time and leave at logout time. the layer you join is randomised, with a weighting towards underpopulated layers. if you join a group, you will migrate to the layer the leader is on
---
Well, that helps handle concerns of PVP gear making PVE content too easy (due to the content release schedule).
---
The only depressing news imo is the sharding/layering news imo
---
Launch right in the middle of my vacation - when I'm away from home. Damn you 17th of july conspiracy people for getting my hopes up (I'm kidding, should've known blizz would aim for a late Summer launch to keep building up the hype)
---
&gt;First things first, this is still sharding - they're just changing how they balance load. There's no two ways around the fact that this is sharding with a different name. A quick description of sharding is a partitioning of data, whether or not you front-load each shard or do it dynamically, as is done in retail, doesn't change the fact it's still sharding.
---
At the end of the day it's just semantics. They're obviously very similar systems built on the same underlying tech but they also differ in a pretty significant way. One is dynamic and one is fixed. Blizzard has chosen to give them different arbitrary names. It's their software and they're free to name it and define it as they see fit. Saying "it's still sharding" doesn't really mean anything.
---
this, x 100. private server population with their 10k queues has nothing to do with vanilla.
---
What a weird deal breaker.
---
Guess its a good thing the majority of the target audience is out of school to begin with.  If you move the goal posts enough a June 22nd release would have been equally as disappointing.
---
No, I miss the old PVP ranks. If you saw someone coming at you you knew if they would rock you or not based on the rank they were sporting. It actually made grinding BGs worthwhile.
---
Yeah you say that until you have so much lag to the point you can't even move, and you're trying to complete the same quest for an hour. This sub is so deluded..
---
Isn't that how it's always been? 
---
Of course they're not inviting inactive accounts who might not even care to play anymore to a beta.
---
It’s priest-stealth and unless you’re leveling with someone, you need it.
---
It launches in August, August is summer.
---
"It's only the starting zones!"
---
"It's only for a few weeks!" -------&gt; You are currently here. 
---
"It's not that big of a deal, it's fine on retail!"
---
I never said dynamic spawns weren't good, I specified they weren't in then nor in Classic, but they are in private servers which a lot of people play and are used to faster spawns, which could very easily sway their judgment into thinking it'll be okay because it's not bad.
---
But it will be bad, because you'll be waiting 5.5 minutes per mob to respawn. Factor in hundreds/thousands of players....Well, good luck getting to 20 in the first 2 weeks never mind 60.
---
Sucks for people who leave for military duties etc.
---
The "lol im at school then" can stfu, nobody cares. You're the ones with the most free time.
---
What more information do you need than "sharding with a new word because everybody hates it"?
---
Now you're putting words in my mouth and still misusing the word. 
---
I'm not upset at all.   I work way too much to care when it comes out.  As I said in my first post, it's just nice to have a date.
---
If they do it right (and that's really the key here) then it will still at least guarantee that the problem is OVERpopulation and not UNDERpopulation. They can solve overpopulated servers by making new ones and offering free transfers voluntarily. They can't solve dead servers except by merging them into other dead servers and complicating things.
---
You're definitely not wrong. It's just a philosophical debate really. They can do whatever the hell they want and they will get away with it too haha.. they've got the goods and we all want it.
---
Well that’s good to hear I’m probably overthinking it, I just hear horror stories about how busy law students are so I assumed I wouldn’t have the time.
---
Very comforting to hear a differing story
---
Either hell yes or hell no
---
Hell yes: You get in
---
Hell no: You have a Vanilla account and STILL didn't get in which makes you even angrier
---
I see your point. I guess it would have been more fair to let everybody opt-in but require a sub to actually play
---
It's a stress test, what do you think is the best way to do it? By getting active players to log in, or people who quit the game 10 years ago?
---
No shit lol.
---
That PCGamer article quote should be blasted on every post on this sub. Fucking false advertising.
---
no, false.
---
the world doesnt revolve around you and your schedule, no matter when it releases people will be getting fucked over
---
Just out of curiosity, what would you do playing classic after like 2 years? At that point you’ve done everything. I guess I don’t see the point in not progressing *eventually*
---
Removed as a repost (we've got a few of these notifications floating around as posts already).
---
If you like rpg games yes. If you like to spend long hours wandering around a digital world, yes. If you like a solid adventure, yes.
---
Agreed. This has excited me greatly playing warlock as for the first levels I have no instant cast so every mob will get sniped
---
mmmm I'm taking 2 weeks off. I've got plenty to spare. it's good to be old haha
---
True true but I want to experience it all
---
We will see, we....will....see
---
They specifically said that they never wanted a big beta test for everyone to participate in. They want the most loyal/dedicated members of the community to beta test the game prior to release. They will however have stress test weekends for the other people.  
---
It'd certainly be a headache to check and see if all the people they've given beta access are actively using it. What did you expect? To have them give beta access to literally every dude in the world? They need dedicated people to test and give feedback; the vast majority of people will just play the game and not report anything, that's why they need dedicated people for this.
---
totally agree
---
Have you considered that you got downvoted for the retarded second half of that statement? Also, we dont care
---
&gt;Beta available only to active retail subs
---
It's always been this way.
---
Sharding: You're shoved in a small shard of a zone with random people. These people, and you, can phase and and be shoved to a new shard randomly as population fluctuates. As you cross into a new zone with a friend you met in your current zone, that friend could phase away as he gets shoved into a new shard of the new zone.
---
Layering: Literally none of this happens. It's a regular server that will be merged with other regular servers later.
---
Lets cross that bridge when we get there.
---
A good 6months from now until they see the commercial benefit of WoW:C and community feedback. When could BC launch? Good 18months after at least. And that’s being optimistic.
---
Can’t please everyone
---
I don't think they would do it that way. I only see Blizzard doing one of two things
---
1: Making new content for post Naxx
---
2: Progressing WoW Classic into BC content.
---
I'm so excited about this but the date is not summer for me. I'm a 7th grade science teacher &amp; students return from summer vacation on 8/26. I have been greatly looking forward to playing this during my summer vacation but that will definitely not happen. Hopefully, I can get into the beta &amp; at least play something while I'm home.
---
it actually doesn't at all, it's still competition purely with your own faction, it just means people who want r14 are going to have to spend more time each day competing for it, it does nothing to the total number of r14s earned
---
Lineage 2 (released in 2003) was the strangest "beta" I've ever played.
---
They said if you pre-ordered the game you got early access (about 2 weeks). About a week into the early access, they said when the game goes live everyone's characters will be deleted, since the early access was still in beta testing.
---
Quite a bit of backlash afterwards, they said they won't delete anyone's characters.
---
I think there was some translation issues since it was made by NC soft, which is a Korean company.
---
Semantics.
---
All these people who want to save "Legolas" for their Elf. lmao
---
Spending over 38 ish euros for a small chance to play a 10 year old game? You must be either very rich or very poor.
---
Uh, that's on my birthday.
---
just watched an interview where he said it would only last a few weeks to cut down on exploits between phases.
---
&gt;"not being able to play is just part of the game!"
---
:thonking:
---
Cross realm BGs are confirmed =/
---
I’ll have to ask qanon
---
I’m actually pretty pleased. It gives me more time to build a PC which I’ve been putting off because I’m lazy and playing console
---
How is that money out or their pocket if their subbed for retail and just trying classic.  Or do you mean they will get so frustrated at classic they will stop playing retail too?  Lol
---
Nice strawman.
---
BY FIRE, BE PURGED!
---
You forget one thing. 
---
Those streamers need to keep the attention of their followers. The day there is a new update on another game or on retail, they will leave classic to play the game where they will get the most viewers. And your server will die.
---
Burn this treator
---
I suppose, but a matter of hours makes no functional difference over the time it takes.
---
I didnt even complete it. Thats a shit load for a CE, waiting a bit to see if they put it into any Canadian stores like best buy or eb then maybe through that way instead.
---
You can't phase, that's the point of layering.
---
Mine is death around that time! Time to find a new job for WoW!
---
I would actually hope they would, but the concept of server identity is already too far gone in retail for me to think it would really do anything.
---
Right so I’m going to stay unsubbed hoping I get an invite then I’ll sub. Not going to sub in hopes of getting an invite. Whatever happens I either A.) Get to play to test the beta or B.) no invite, saved $15 and will just wait tell Aug. 27th. I’m fine with all options.
---
so many angry people but honestly i'm pretty pleased with the info they released. 
---
you'll need the sub to play the game i understand why they want beta testers to have a sub as well. 
---
people are freaking out over layering for no reason. if each layer is 1k+ players you really won't be lacking in people to play with. there will be plenty of guilds etc and to see other people on layers you just group up with them. either way, its only for like a month so you'll be able to see everyone soon anyway
---
&gt;you just don't understand it.
---
I understand it completely. This solution makes more problems, there's a chance you can end up on an unpopulated layer. There's going to be people logging into a ghost town because the other layers are full.
---
Population caps being higher is fine if the server is full. A lot of servers probably won't be. 
---
Some servers back in Vanilla had long queues for BGs, this is why cross realm was added back in the day. I don't think cross realm really hit the community atmosphere too much, as it was usually a much smaller number of players in BGs anyway, so you generally knew a lot of the other players if you PvP'd often.
---
bottom text my man, bottom text. That's the way to go if you do in fact live in a society. 
---
That being said, what's your take on the layering issue? I'm not happy about it, but OK if they turn it off after a month, but it feels like it ruins the possibility of making friends along the way a little.
---
I’m glad to have a release date too. Just have a classic case of expectations vs reality situation. My recollection is not “classic will be released during summer” but rather “get ready for a classic summer”
---
To me a “classic summer” meant getting to play throughout the summer, not squeezed into the last 3 weeks of technical calendar summer. 
---
I guess people who play the beta however will get a classic summer
---
This is by design.
---
its the entire contintent dude why do you think that is positive please tell me
---
No. It's just a chance at getting in, costs $15/mo, and you're paying for a *beta test*. That's gonna be a pass for me dawg.
---
Not at all. The chance of getting an invite is really slim.
---
Ok sasuke
---
Nostalrius\*
---
Did you complain as much when every other xpac dropped with a similar release date?
---
This is great! Thanks man, going to edit my original post
---
Stress test and beta are different. WOW. So many people dont understand this
---
Yeah I'm in America and allergic to that corporate work culture. Kind of why I'm holding off having kids until I find a life situation that works for me, tis a mystery for now though.
---
Kreygasm
---
I hope they don’t consider those with active BFA membership streaks over those of us who migrated to other activiison games but are now resubbed. 2006 account that has been Unsubbed for a while but playing ow daily. Now re subbed. But I’ve never made it into a beta despite trying every time.
---
If you group you immediately enter the same layer, and can level together. If you are I grouped chances are you’@“ be in different layers.
---
&gt; ~~Devils advocate~~ Not a fucking retard: could it have something to do with the player population they are expecting?
---
It'll be good for anyone that wants to play TBC and Wrath. That's me, for the first one.
---
I feel like you're lying about something here. You could've also went to a tame school, or had an easy major.
---
I did it on a private server. No idea on other sources. The downside is that there are no numbers for the settings you've chosen, so you should screenshot the appearance.
---
so no then
---
The difference is that your opinion is anti-vanilla. 
---
I don't care if you think if I'm being a dick or not. But if you spread misinformation like we need sharding then I'm going to call you out for it. We didn't need it 15 years ago, private servers don't need it, and Classic doesn't need it. It's an unnecessary deviation. End of story.
---
If their server architecture somehow depends on it, then they need to alter their architecture to support classic wow, not the other way around.
---
If your okay with this deviation from classic, then you're just sending Blizzard a signal that you will be okay with future deviations from classic.
---
I hope this is the case but i'll remain skeptical. In my opinion server reputation is one of the pillars of Classic WoW and if layering is implemented poorly it could destroy it. :\
---
Appears so.
---
I knew it.  I re-upped my sub last month even though I'm not playing live.  I figured they would prioritize subs for beta.
---
And then watch it die because they are no longer playing Classic as the hype is gone.
---
Which means the people that joined the server just to be close to the streamer will also leave.
---
If you actually think beta characters will transfer to retail, I'm gonna have to give you the harsh truth. No.
---
So you want dynamic spawns and faster respawn in general? Because thats how p servers solved the problem.   
---
Without ANY kind of sharding, now matter how you call it, you have to look at an unplayable game (big realms), ghost realms and/or merges (small realms).
---
Yeah I figured Deathdealer set bonus + weapon skill from Death's Sting would make a big difference; didn't even account for Backstab rank 9. Thank you all for your replies.
---
Why are you so naive?  Phase 1 will include most people getting to 60 and starting molten core.  You would rather have sharding for all of that instead of a few uncomfortable first few days in elwynn forest?
---
Yeah, another slot machine designed by ActiBlizzard to get money out of people without giving something back.
---
These anecdotes are also besides the point of the argument I'm making. Jesus Christ people.
---
First you want em to delay the release so it can be done properly and now you all complain
---
They’re. It asking anyone to pay for a slim chance at beta. They have more than enough people in the pool of active subscribers to beta test. They are simply stating that’s the pool they are using.
---
I'd say its atleast partly A, on various occasions, i think even during Vanilla Blizzard dev's have stated that both the US and the EU launch weren't the experience they wanted to give their customers with all the lag, crashes, downtime and queues going on.
---
6pm east coast
---
See ya in STV Mr. Softclocks as I gank you with my lvl 55 Rogue and tell you I slept with your mom!
---
phase 1 is the most vital part to establishing a community and making friends
---
this is completely idiotic
---
Cheers mate happy birthday
---
So just because you got put into Layer 2 when you logged in, you will get moved to a different server, away from your guild, which happened to currently be on Layer 1. You thought this through, didn't you?
---
seems that way
---
I really hope so!
---
I heard that say I login I will be placed on say "Layer 1" and if that gets filled then "Layer 2" is created. If I logout is my place on "Layer 1" replaced by someone else logging in and if I log back in at another time, there is a chance I will be placed in "Layer 2"?
---
These days betas are less about play testing and more about PR, actually.
---
People not understanding how seasons line up and getting mad is really dumb.
---
People won't be poping out of nowhere and won't be vanishing into thin air.
---
I played from right before the BC release through mid WotLK. I loved the early leveling experience, it blew my mind. 
---
The thing I don’t really get about classic is why not integrate the things that made the game a little better as time went on? There were good spec rebalances, fun abilities, and QoL changes over the period I played. I assume there have been major graphics improvements since. Wouldn’t making classic a sort of “best of” rather than a “rewind” create a really great game that’s worth getting back into on more than nostalgia? 
---
I just don’t quite get it.
---
What an absolute fucking joke
---
you're exagerrating what sharding is.
---
My guess is most people don't even know what it is, as they don't notice it... if you aren't running in a 40 man raid ganking people / following a streamer, you hardly see people phasing in and out.
---
Without knowing the odds, probably not.
---
There is gonna be a lot of QQ here tomorrow.
---
Let's be generous and say only 10,000 get in tomorrow, sans streamers/media/figureheads.
---
Let's say there are currently 2 mil at worst retail players. Just to improve our odds, let's say HALF of them didnt hit the Classic Beta new preference.
---
So you're fighting potentially 1 million retail players, + the flood of Classic players who are subbing today. It's hard to imagine anymore than 25,000 are getting into closed beta tomorrow. 10k seems logical.
---
Even 1 in 100,000 odds is 0.001%.
---
If you are literally only going to sub for the chance at closed beta and not play retail, the odds aren't in your favor. But that's for you to determine if you're okay pissing away $15 for that chance.
---
Peperridge farm remembers, as do the member berries. 
---
Honestly, I'm mostly afraid about what it does to the economy and the sense of community along the way.
---
"POSSIBLE" beta invite. Dude, this is exactly what Blizzard wants to do here. Desperate classic fans = sub money. We saw this shit happen with the demo.
---
3-6pm depending on where you live. Or like 3 am in hawaii lol
---
I started with beta in 2004.  I left after the beating Arthas.
---
Is this just a reboot, or are they trying to pull a GTA 5 and re-sell us the same game?
---
Do I have to dust off my old Anathema and 0.5 Tier priest armor again?
---
Got a source? What exactly are they changing? Or could it be a bug that will get changed back once reported?
---
Probably a safer route less traveled anyways, going through the barrens. There are a lot of chances for things to go wrong, especially if you're alliance.
---
London is in USA? Nice line :&gt;

---
thats good to know, thanks
---
I read it as they would have beta AND additional stress tests on top of that where more people can access those.
---
Lol wrong beta will not be for longer than a couple days

Joke's on you, you'll be 60 long before i reach STV!

August is the hottest month for me so I sure think of that as summer.
---
Watch the developer interview. They say that they’ll do as much as possible to sticky you to the same layer.
---
Be happy they are making the game for you and stop whining. Blizzard are doing everything in their might to give us the best possible gaming experience. You should be grateful.
---
Don't worry, you can still wait until december before you start playing.
---
wow and gaming in general is much more popular now, so while servers are entirely virtualized now, nostlike populations mess with the gameplay
---
On the larger projects the launch has been a horrible experience all the way to Un'Goro. Optimal solution is to cap the servers at 3k and leave it at that but it is an impossible logistically. Imagine how many servers would be needed even for one region with the amount of players that are going to play this?
---
It's a joke nerd
---
Hype
---
Blizzard isn't exactly asking "PSA: everybody pay a subscription for a chance to get in the Beta", some people of reddit are just extracting too much "assumed" information on a pretty logical solution. If it's free 100% chance for subscription then the goal for an accurate beta test goes OUT the window. It would be a 24/7 stress test filled with streamers along with their horde of followers. Also not to forget the random people who never really cared about the game to begin with but are just trying it out and all of a sudden these people have a public voice with convoluted opinions. 
---
Let Blizzard hand pick the qualified candidates to test if you want to see efficient beta testing. This is important for them to get this right. My guess is there will be one day where they do a legit population/server stress test and it's 100% chance of access for subscription.
---
Here is a true story that happened to me back in 2005 when I first started playing World of Warcraft. Back then when I first started playing this game, I was pretty young and was bad at the game. I did not know about websites like Allakhazam or Thottbot to find out where some quest objectives are. So I always asked the chat for information. 
---
One day a gnome female mage replied that she knew the quest and wants to help since she was bored. So we grouped up and did the quest together. After that quest we decided to do a few more quests together. She started to open up about her real life and her abusive boyfriend. We sat down on a hill at Westfall and talked for hours about her issues. It was getting late so we decided to talk again another day. 
---
I think I started having feelings at this point. The next day I decided to see if she was online so I checked the friends list. I could not find her name, only this message: "This user has been layered". From that point on I tried to find her but never could. 
---
So if you are still out there and layered, it is me, Bigbonegnome. I will be playing classic so please DM me if you are in this chat so we can play together and catch up on life!
---
qq more plz
---
Ah perfect. I glanced at the rules but missed that. Sorry and thanks! :)

---
No person on Reddit has annoyed me more than you.
---
I would love to see WOTLK at some point but with some changes like no group finder and one raid difficulty.
---
I'm specifically asking about the grind/pacing
---
Not really persistent, I expect player to change shard when he relogs.
---
&gt;Clearly I don't mind tedious grinds.
---
Wow has less tedious grinds, as you are actually doing stuff with your character, and if on a PvP server also watching out for the other faction. Wow grinding isnt a click and semi ignore its takes a majority of your concentration if its mobs your are focusing, and if it is proffession nodes like mining/herbing you need to be actively searching your route to make it good.
---
With layering and stress tests confirmed, it’s almost guaranteed it will.
---
You ok, urbanK? Or are you joking? Just wanted to check in case you're having a rough time. I've been there.
---
Hell no.

Need a 1920x1080 version, this resolution is bizarre.
---
Fall semester for me starts exactly one week before release. This sucks lol.
---
I feel for you, man. My classes start early August so I will just be getting to the real content by release and likely have little time.
---
And that needs to change. The US has the most toxic work ethic in the western world. The Europeans get sensible vacation time so they don't break down. We're not so lucky in the US. You can thank corporate lobbyism and false patriotism for bolstering a harmful sense of *arbeit-macht-frei* work ethics.
---
guess ill wait lol
---
Aww man it's 22 months away!!
---
Lol alright enjoy believing that :)
---
no love for the warlock?
---
!remindme 104 days
---
Thanks for the help guys, I’m actually curious to try this thing out. Dibs on the sword of a thousand truths.
---
Fuck streamers. Seriously, goading people into taking off work and calling in sick and shit just to tune into their super-important stream which turned out to be *SHOCKER* just news.
---
Fuck wow classic streamers.
---
those sub numbers fund world of warcraft and it maintaining this. I dont think you realise how it works
---
I was impersonating one of your students outleveling you.
---
I’ll be in STV with you my man. I work 50 hour weeks August to December every year.
---
We’ll embrace the suck together.
---
Yes, fortunately we didn't have to wait 5.5 for hundreds+ people though.
---
Do you have to use all your vacation together like this? I prefer doing a couple of 1 week breaks and then sprinkling in lots of fridays off and also adding days around the holidays.
---
Classic Summer!
---
&gt; You're probably more likely to be interested in classic wow if you're still playing
---
Unfortunately, this logic does not check out as evidenced by the many people of this sub.
---
I still have a 2014 blizz con polar bear mount code that's unscatched. Ebay is gonna be very good to me lol
---
Didn't Lore come out and say that sharding will be used for the starting zones since they will be literally flooded with players and thats about it. Makes sense that the 'sharding tech' would stay in until phase one is done since they would have to patch it out of their system.
---
Ahhh, the good old Battlegroups. I remember refilling on servers for a specific Battlegroup. Those were fun times.
---
would you prefer group members are split across layers? it answers all of the concerns people had with sharding apart from the fact you will have less chance to see the same randoms running around longitudinally. but with layering that chance is much more likely than sharding. if you want to see the same people, friend and group up with them
---
its a good system that deals with initial population boom/bust whilst maintaining the classic community atmosphere
---
There is no need to say "deal breaker", you and we alllll know you will play it.
---
May I ask what layers are?
---
Wow! Incredible! You're like, so special that Blizz should cater to you specifically!
---
wildstar i think and wow probably has character copy functions for their beta servers, so it must be possible
---
Can you post source?
---
The friend can just be on the other continent.
---
We have a sticky in our feedback forum debunking this. It has been stickied for several years. 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/forums&amp;topic=143&amp;p=1319
---
Not sure you're going to get an invite from some stranger who happens to hear you, accept the invite, then get lucky enough to switch layers or you stay in the same one anyway.
---
Also we have no idea if other layers can hear what you say.
---
I'd calm down a little.
---
that really sucks
---
You would cry too if it didn’t line up with your expectations. Don’t act all macho because it works out for you. So shhhhh
---
The original game launched during the school year as well.
---
Dumb take
---
Shoutout to my former Wow self trying to get as much questing and grinds done BEFORE all the kids got out of school and online at 3:30, and the trolls got out at 5:30.
---
God/Hakkar bless you
---
Yeah, you're so smart. I'm sure they haven't thought of that. It's not like this technology is well understood or anything. Nope, surely they didn't realize this obvious and simple thing, but you did. Genius!
---
For stuff like that I'll definitely use a guide lol, thanks
---
I was mad at the beginning, like a lot of people were, but now I am thankful we got a release date. Time goes and august is just around the corner.
---
I want huge population realms, 10k+ at least, and if layering for a limited time (2 weeks - 1 month) makes it a reality then I find it acceptable.
---
And I had to go to summer school before I got my HS diploma.  Welcome to the club, friend.
---
Its all anyone wants. Give a person something to bitch about and it distracts them from the shit sandwich they are eating called life. Everyones got problems and its easier to shit on a game company, tv show, movie, whatever than it is to change whats really bugging you. I dont fault people for it, we all deal with the cards we were dealt in different ways. Personally I bitch about MMA because its a sport I love and has lots to bitch about.
---
&gt; Not being able to meet everyone on your server isn't the issue. It's meeting someone one day, and then not being able to see them again in future days. That decreases the feeling of community.
---
Perhaps, however you will most likely add them to friends list and invite them if you wish to group. Seeing them in the world won't matter much outside of "hey, I remember that guy" but layering will be disabled when its no longer needed, provided they get passed level 10.
---
I'm gonna try to take off wed-friday. It comes out at 6pm Tuesday EST and that's after I get off work anyways.
---
Wait! NO! That's my fucking anniversary! Are you fucking KIDDING ME?!
---
I'd hope so but doubt it with how WQs work. They phase individual quests in super small areas and it's buggy as hell. For example if you haven't played BfA: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lPBqj8pYyx0&amp;t=1s
---
Your allowed to be upset man. F everyone who says your not
---
Have we really mangled the definition of "whining" to the point where anything other than relentless unbridled cock sucking of the devs is consider "whining"? Christ almighty.
---
One of my favorite past times in vanilla was “Can I kite that?” 
---
The end goal was always Goldshire though.
---
My favorite thing though was that one time I was running through Swamp of Sorrows and saw Teremus (that dragon in Blasted Lands) in the middle of the road, oh and my good friend just happen to be the one kiting it. 
---
So obviously I helped him.
---
I would highly think that code won't transfer over to classic wow.  from what the devs said in the video was ONLY referencing the original vanilla wow Collectors Edition pets.
---
I met my husband via WoW. We started as just friends, then started dating and got married 4 years ago.
---
We didn't spend all that much time together in WoW (I was a busy raid leader, and he dinged 60 around the time we were working on AQ40). We met IRL at a guild meetup and hit it off. This time around we're playing the iconic warrior/priest duo.

This summer my ass. Can play like 15 days and im out, bbye being active in a guild or something. Uni also starts, im pissed
---
Unfortunately jumping stuns doesn’t work on Classic, unless they changed it
---
Thank you haha
---
So then when youre on the border of one of these zones people are just phasing in and out, left and right. Yea that is *soo* much better than a full continent.
---
blizzard had to change the term "sharding" as it got too much flack
---
That only shows the history of subscription, is missing out on the duration paid by pre-paid gametime. In my case  I paid with pre-paid gametime january to november 2006, on that page it shows me december 2006 as the oldest month.
---
It seems a fair and reasonable solution.  I'm surprised and pleased.
---
shit this release is perfect for me i write all my exams in late july and next semester starts in octobre.
---
literally all of semptembre to go mental 
---
y my peepee hard
---
This is what I've been wondering as well. If they layers are consistent, I don't see any problem with it. If the layer is random each time you log, it's a lot worse. Sure some layers are less populated than others but thats the way it was back in the day too with different realms.
---
for the most part, yes
---
2/12/2005	N/A	Free Month
---
Just like the rest of us with jobs all year long :)
---
I guess it's better than waiting in queue
---
Lol have you not been around long? Literally every launch is shit, people complain they took off work for it every single time. Going to happen again 100%, always does.
---
With server mergers you aren't placed into different servers each time you log on. This significantly reduces the chance you'll encounter the same player repeatedly while questing.
---
change .eu. to .us.

I didn't play runescape but I came to WoW by way of MapleStory which is another grind-fest. WoW isn't that grindy at all. There are a few level brackets where you have less quests but if you move from zone to zone you never have to grind unless you want to. 
---
It still has that old-school charm where you feel like the game is constantly keeping you on your toes and punishing you in little ways, if that's what you're into.
---
"One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different [server] sharding options that we have available to us today. There’s a lot of desire on part of the community that this is something that they don’t want." (J Allen Brack.)[https://www.pcgamer.com/this-is-how-blizzard-plans-to-finally-bring-back-vanilla-wow-servers/]
---
(How about this one?)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=113] 
---
Which promise should we hold them to? That one? This one? The one they make 1 week before launch? The one they make 4 weeks after launch? 8 weeks after launch? None at all? At what point do we admit they got enough people convinced that sharding/layering whatever the fuck you want to call it is an acceptable part of the 'authentic classic experience' that it won't matter anymore to point out the hypocrisy...
---
There’s the kicker
---
Haha yea, the Geniuses at Blizzard. WoW subs at an all time low.
---
&gt;You think you do, but you don't
---
They also said tops 1 month.
---
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
Your Whiney
---
Exactly, and who wants a shot of water?
---
Glad I'm taking a Gen Ed semester then? Hopefully easier than physics and calculus...
---
So there’s going to be sharding in Classic then?
---
Rip my feels
---
Thats not how the layers work. Eveytime you log in and out of a given server you are put into 1-x layers of the server. The only way to switch layers is to relog or get invited by someone in another layer, ie a friend. This allows situations like OP, or switching layers for mob spawns for questing.
---
By locks, I mean it doesn't allow people to be permanently added to it anymore. Your Layer is the people that you *see* running around. The people you physically interact with. A full servers worth of people. These people are physically locked to your server and will never shard or phase around.
---
The multiple Layers can still manually invite each other to group (just in case your buddy who started playing a few days after launch gets put in a different Layer), but you wont see the other Layers running around the world. At least until the merge happens.
---
I'm treating it like a shitty $15 raffle ticket. I'm hoping that having an account from 2004 increases my chances but I'm not expecting to get an invite tbh.
---
How much did you get?
---
I was thinking about this too. But so many memories... So many collections. I’ve got every game, all overwatch cosmetics, sc1, wc3 rock and tft, d2.... I would cry if I would lose this account. 15 years of fun, finding friends and experience adventures... 
---
Was it worth it?
---
Yeah it will
---
?
---
They just launch new classic servers alongside the new TBC servers if they come.
---
Just play old school runescape, this will be dead on release especially since it's late summer
---
As someone who was pretty opposed to sharding at all, I think I can take this compromise. At least it'll still retain some sort of server community in the beginning as compared to traditional sharding. Overall, I'd say a lot of the details so far have been great so I can live with this.
---
What if they did the first day of Autumn? Would you say it's closer to summer? Doesn't make sense.
---
Are we sure this is correct? Seems to show 2007 as my oldest account which I know isnt correct.
---
What's your solution then buddy?
---
It's more of an issue with server economy. There will be inflated black lotus and devilsaur leather due to there being multiple layers of the same area. Same probably goes for most, if not all, gathering materials
---
its good and bad. Moving out and getting my parents off my back is the main point haha
---
Have you met the WoW/Classic community? People will find literally anything to complain about.
---
Both BFA and Legion had crazy smooth releases. Admittedly that was with phasing rather than layering but the last time we had a decidedly bad release from Blizzard to my recollection was during WoD and that was a lot worse than Mists.
---
Oh well that's me out lol
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/BlitheIntelligentEchidnaDBstyle](Informal, but valid.)
---
lol ur joking right?
---
OK, but what about the economy part? You can literally farm a zone empty, get invited by a friend in a different layer and repeat the process - seems pretty unvanilla to me.
---
LOLOL On September 22nd with the leaves falling and changing and its fucking freezing out:  
---
ENjOYing THIs SUMMer WeaThEr??!!?!?!?11
---
Tough it out on launch queues and starter being shitty for the first week. Hell, do dynamic respawns in those zones for the first week.
---
The influx isn't going to last for months, and either option avoids all the shit sharding causes.
---
It's not like Blizz server's can't handle the load, they managed back in 2004 and technology is miles better than it was.
---
It can be, it depends on the person. If you get really upset over things and rant and rave then no thats not good. But if you get to give your thoughts and opinions to other like minded people about something trivial like a game, a movie, a sport then it can be really healthy. However this doesnt apply to politics or religion.
---
10k+ pop has nothing do with vanilla population
---
You're looking for other people to tell you to go have fun now?
---
Guaranteed if you play now you will have less desire to play in August.
---
the people who were going to hit r14 were going to spend 14 hours a day doing it, now they're going to spend 17, it does nothing to the total number of r14s earned because there is no honor threshold you have to meet, it is purely based on standing within your faction
---
Medallas al campeon.
---
I think the timing sucks for a lot of people (myself included), but I'd rather wait if it's not ready.
---
&gt;And then watch it die because they are no longer playing Classic as the hype is gone.
---
That's going to happen regardless, Classic takes a shit ton of time to do anything, the majority of retail players will stick with retail. Those that specifically come back for Classic are a very small portion of the WoW playerbase and those are the players that will make up the Classic community. 
---
&gt;Which means the people that joined the server just to be close to the streamer will also leave.
---
Perhaps, however they will know that they need to play Retail and Classic as that is what their viewerbase enjoy. Even if the populations die down, those with streamers on them will buoy a bit as players will naturally flock to them.
---
have to have a paid subscription to be even in the list for the beta... TOP KEK , fuck beta

---
That's what they originally indicated but now they've indicated it's going to be continent wide at least.
---
That what classic WoW is for, to fill the void of an unsuccesful life :)
---
Sucks that phase one will be so long.
---
Cross realm BG's are good. I don't get why people are always up in arms about this. It's not fun or authentic to wait 30 minutes for a bg q to pop.
---
I’m not taking any chances, and I’m taking week two off. I’ll still be playing week one regardless.
---
Layering in all of phase 1 woot! Easy aoe grinding  leveling for me hype! It’s gonna be like playing on a dead pserver!
---
Layering isn’t sharding, which I think is the biggest misconception here.
---
Yeah, joining their group will switch layers over.
---
My birthday is August 28th, I've always said I have a summer birthday
---
I get that, but even playing on pservers with 10k+ pop you remember names and make connections. If I'm understanding layering right, it's like sharding except sharding entire continents? Which means, from play session to play session you might be on entirely different "layers" or shards.
---
The leveling process is really, really long and it is absolutely part of the journey. Assuming phase 1 lasts at least a few months, most people will probably be at least close to 60 at the start of phase 2.
---
Maybe I'm just misunderstanding. I was just expecting a shorter period for sharding, like a few weeks.
---
It's a month minimum and could last all of P1, and over the entire game world. You don't see the problem with that?
---
&gt;its just a troll bro
---
yikes
---
It's per server though. So you only phase with people on your server.
---
Whos to say that you get the same layer next time you log in?
---

---
I, personally, am hoping that Blizzard entertains the notion of bringing back at least TBC and WOTLK. I didn't get a chance to experience them when they were initially released and really hope to be able to at some point.
---
Guessing that people who played in the demo will be higher priority since they are the most dedicated.
---
Nope, this is great, people just want to have sour grapes. Requesting time off now, brb
---
people who are complaining about this and saying that its sharding 2.0 likely dont even know how sharding works because if they did theyd understand that layering isnt the same
---
But there's no phasing with layering?
---
Not that it affects me, but I feel bad for the college students.
---
Is this real? I kinda want to play the standard WoW again without all the bullshit world events that changed the world.
---
I'm quit chill. I'm just having a major laugh tbh. 
---
Because gaming companies keep doing anti-consumer practices, milking players for every bit of cash they own, and you all applaud while getting robbed like this kind of behavior is ok. 
---
I've seen what happened to RS3 and futurely Old School Runescape. Blizzard is going the same way with shop items (that are magically one time only, and now keep popping out again) and Classic wow.
---
Classic ain't worth 13 bucks. And Blizzard as a company is just a shell of its former shell that you all cling unto because nostalgia and muh vanilla wow.
---
fuck off it has nothing to do with making it great, it has to do with investor earnings call and maximizing subs through the beta/bfa patches
---
No. He just described 2.88 million gold in subs using a wide open market. And that's only if token prices hold at the current 120K (US) for the next 6 months it takes you (more if your market is absolutely saturated in herbs/pots, which unless it's dead it certainly already is). I forsee the token fluctuating once 8.2 drops, because the introduction of BFA flying will tank herb and ore prices even more than they have in the last 6 months. There's money to be made, but not 3 million in 3 months unless you have a solid niche market. It's certainly possible to make at least 2 tokens a month starting from scratch, just by gathering. It's boring, but doable. 
---
I'm grinding what I can on and off til August, but I'll probably take a long break in August, and then when my tokens run out, if I'm not burned out from classic I will just pay for it again. It'll be worth $15 a month again.
---
I have “summer” off, so i was exited to have all “summer” to play this. Now I have a week, thanks for the “summer” release blizz :(
---
"However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days."
---
This is also a blizzard quote. There is 0 reason to believe that this time they are telling the truth.
---
Serious question. I wanna no life this at launch. How long should i request off work?
---
Source? I was under the impression every layer covered the entire map, regardless of continent.
---
If you form a party you will be
---
Old
---
Eh, goblin teleporters between locations. Levitating moving platforms like thunder bluff, portals, flight paths, be creative.
---
Yes. Layering will create multiple instances of resources and mobs.
---
It's possible they disable layering for areas around rare spawns but who knows.
---
Every time I level up my GPA is going to go down.
---
That's one advantage. The other is giving everyone the same Chance to even create a Character because normally you would have to access your actual realm to Do so. But what if your realm has a queue? It would result in a mass rant...
---
Omg man, me from like 5 years ago is so pumped. But I just kind of, like, don't, any more.
---
It's really not a paid beta though is it. It's a closed selective beta, which is completely the industry standard, it'll be fully accesable to the public in 3 months.  
---
Closed beta's are the norm, and actually have purpose other than giving people something to review. Also, it's not a fee to access the beta, it's a fee to access world of warcraft, which has always been subscription based.  
---
Are you genuinely suggesting the CLOSED beta for wow, should be accepting non paying members, something they've literally never done?  
---
No, let's be real, Blizzards doing something awesome here and /r/wow users are leaking their toxic shit here because the mere idea that they don't get to join in with people who actively gave useful feedback to developers in the last beta (You know, the POINT of a closed beta.) get priority as opposed to xxNoobmaster69xx who was too young to play classic wow but should totes be given a spot in a closed test of it because "Fairness man".
---
Nostalrius had dynamic respawn rates doe edging on population in an area.  Classic won’t
---
This makes you form a party, chat with people and ultimately make friends and bonds that will last. This is exactly the feature I was waiting and hoping. I remember people I met at level 10 then at 20 then later at 40, 50 and finally in the endgame. A shared world is the Feature of classic and they want to take it from us... I can understand if they enable sharding for a first week or even month, but 1st phase sounds INSANE.
---
Seriously.  Too much qq in here

---
Did you actually fast until this date?
---
11/2/2005. 
---
It sounds... later than I thought. That's the EU release date, but I like to remember I played a bit of beta before that. 
---
/huh
---
That's me. I started in 05'. Dont get me wrong. I love Classic and am excited to play it. Guild is already formed and DKP costs and loot tables are already built for the guild. BUT. I like TBC more. I enjoy Kara, SSC, TK,Hyjal, BT, &amp; Sunwell more. The heroic dungeons and long attunement grinds are something I cant wait for. I forsee most of the Classic community moving to TBC, and then Wrath. Now, what happens AFTER that is anyone's guess. My hope is they would reset the vanilla servers and let people start the trilogy over again. By then my 5 year old will be old enough to play with me, and the prospect of that makes me really happy.
---
Meteorological summer fkin ends August 31st.  Fuck you. Suck Blizz cock more, shill.
---
Death rate drops to 0%
---
What was the respawn timer in Vanilla, I really don't know? Will the layer selection be random and will we be able to switch between layers? Is this known yet? I mean what if I want to play with my buddies but we get thrown into different layers? That would be disappointing.
---
Not Closed Beta's by reputable studios with little problem marketing.
---
How is that different really?  It seems like that was what they did before, and this time they are taking a different approach.  If the servers are not all packed to the brim, there will be multiple shards per server if needed.  If the population tapers off before p2, there won’t be shards.  
---
I don’t know if you were around for vanilla release, but the amount of players directly in your field of vision is a lot less crucial to enjoyment than server stability.  
---
If you level slowly, it won’t affect you at max level (or for long at least)  If you level in a week, same idea since there will only be 4 other people in those zones to begin with.
---
This isn't sharding as it is on retail.  This is essentially sharding on a scale so large that we should never notice it 95% of the time.  The tech looks the same, just bigger.  Still a good thing.
---
The problem is that people see this and go full "REEEEEEEE" without evening thinking.
---
Different layers are basically different realms in all but name. They are basically implement cross realm functionality except just numbering them instead of making them new names.
---
Old news...
---
I guess you wouldn't know for sure, but in my mind, you just get an invite, switch layers, and check the zone anyway. You know your original layer's respawn timer, so you might as well check the others to see if you can get those too.
---
I don't think we'll be seeing a mafia, as you said it's too difficult to coordinate (until phase 2 that is), but you're still doubling up resources for every new layer. The first 60s are going to have free reign over multiple layers to mine and farm the resources.
---
It's going to be a completely different economy compared to private servers, that's for sure.
---
Is there a source for this or is this just a rumor?
---
Victory Burrito?
---
Haha this guy nailed it... Hit that bell!
---
On this sub? No way!!
---
I knew they wouldn't just keep it to Starting zones. Pro sharding people were actually using that as their argument. Blizzard does this all the time with 'unpopular' features. They announce a lesser version of what they're actually planning on doing, and gauge the level of backlash.
---
Next, watch as these white knights try to convince us that "They said only Phase 1!" When in reality Blizzard will use this as a precedent to normalize Layering (aka Sharding rebranded) for the classic audience, for things like AQ, phase releases etc. and only truly stop using the technology when the game barely has a player-base BECAUSE of this sharding bullshit.
---
Summer starts late June and ends late September. Stay in school.
---
It's sharding with less steps. It's sharding but only on one server.
---
Cant tell if troll or delusional
---
Jan 2006, which means I DID have another account on 2005 that I've lost. Oh boy. Wonder if I can get that thing back...
---
... MOST likely.
---
I believe I heard somewhere that the layers are on a per-continent basis. I could be wrong though.
---
But you'll DEFINITELY see the Priest anywhere in the Eastern Kingdoms, like Blasted Lands, Eastern Plaguelands, etc. And of course, after Phase 1 finishes you'll see him/her anywhere.
---
I can see it now
---
"Hunter LF layer 2-5 group PST"
---
Authentic Vanilla experience!
---
Phasing is having people split across multiple different story progression points. Ie post and pre wrathgate or before the burning of teldrasil. 
---
Sharding is multiple instances of the same world content. 
---
They are quite literally different things. Phasing is actually pretty great and allows for progression in a story or area. Sharding splinters communities.
---
Yes, if you use your sub to make gold and spend it on the sub token. You could earn 2 years of sub to WoW by the time Classic is out.
---
Esfand is an Activision-Blizzard shill that will a way to put whip cream on top of any pile of shit the company dishes out.
---
A man can dream...
---
Then you don't need you to tst a game they already made once. It's a privilege they're letting subs have to play early. They could release the full game for everyone weeks ago, but that isn't how a business makes money.
---
I mean the game will be ready in early July but yeah, grateful is good.
---
I'm actually happy about this release date. Now I wont waste my summer locked in my room.
---
Y'all are forgetting to mention this will be removed in Phase 2.
---
It may even be the opposite tbh
---
Then I’ll wait a month til shit dies down, worst case scenario.
---
Who’s to say that you don’t get the same layer?
---
Again, 3,000 players to a layer is a lot of players, much more than it’s being made out to be.
---
Well to play right now you "need" the Battle for Azeroth" expansion, and all the others leading up to it. You can technically play without expansions but you will be very alone and be very bored I think, and yes BfA is very different from WoW classic. You cannot start a character for classic right now as it will pretty much be a separate game from current WoW and as it doesn't launch until 27th of august you can't do anything until then. However they will open up character creation on August 13th, so then you can make a character, but you can't play it until the 27th.
---
I want to know the word for this because I'm the exact same fucking way and it's not fun. Like is this defeatism? I was ready to play they, they said summer, I had the whole thing planned out. This release date drops and I have a hard time convincing myself it will be worth it. My friends that only work part time will now vastly outpace me and at best I can hope to get stuck with the crowd with no ability to pull ahead even if I spend all available hours playing WoW. This change in realities is so fucking disheartening that I too question if I even want to play.
---
I'm Canadian, would need a visa to work there
---
Someone quoted the devs saying you could manually invite your friends to a party.
---
More change of getting Ironfoe on the week of release than that I'm afraid 😥
---
"Layering is nothing like sharding guys, it's much better!"
---
Well, bye? If you can’t wait a month or two tops, you can’t be pleased anyways.
---
I'd love to see the source if you find it. I keep seeing people throw around random numbers for what constitutes 1 layer lol.
---
It's actually simpler than sharding the zones, since the zones connect together so you have to handle the cases where users go between shards. Layering the continent is easy since it's already one big instance, they just have to create multiple instances of the continent and choose one on login(plus switch characters between them to keep groups together).
---
Here is a NASA for kids article on how seasons on Earth work. 
---
https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/
---
Mine seems to work says free month April 2005 and I’ve had an active account mostly since then
---
Its shitty for me personally, living next to a preschool my house is pretty much uninhabitable from 8am-6pm every weekday with the exception of summer break and winter break.
---
This makes me pretty much unable to take a vacation and play now.
---
The difference is that you interact with the same people across the server, so not just your guild, day after day after day.
---
The server community can build organically as opposed to being handicapped until merge, then basically restarting once the merge happens.
---
IMO, they just need to give you rez sickness for hopping, maybe flag you for PVP.
---
Each layer is a totally separate continent including all resources and mobs. That seems pretty clear from the info so far. Don't know if that means the AH is specific for your layer or includes all the layers
---
Ok, I removed it. Maybe I said that out of anger. :)
---
Yes, that sounds like what they're describing. And yes, it's different from sharding in that the players you see will have session-long permanence as opposed to blinking in and out of existence like what happens with sharding. The problem, if it were permanent, would be that it would completely undermine community cohesion on a server. But it's not permanent, sooooo... Meh. Not the worst thing they could do.
---
this is so annoying for europeans, just like bfa release sucked
---
Lol, for real.  I can't wait to just have a full time job and other "real life" (I guess my life now is fake?) responsibilities.  
---
I'm a grad student with two jobs and was hoping I'd be able to nolife for the few weeks between the summer and fall terms since that's basically the only time I'm not working 60-70 hours per week.
---
Oh well.  I wish release were earlier, but that's not what happened.  So it goes.
---
Were you ever horde on illidan? If there were 10k realms. the trade chat would be completely unreadable. I moved off of that server because I could barely read anything that was going on in chat when I was in a city. No thank you.
---
I see Layering being a solution to dead servers. There's not a static cap and then players will stop playing and suddenly the server is at 50% capacity. With Layering the server will have ... 200%, 300%, 400% capacity and then when people stop playing it will still be a high capacity server.
---
Yeah, but 5man parties where quest loot is still not shared, so you still need to kill 5x the mobs - it makes no difference. For kill quests alone it will help, but you'll still be fighting a LOT of groups even if everyone is forming 5 man parties.
---
They will not be getting 15 USD from me until launch.
---
I would agree with most of your points. Cross realm BGs also introduced more variety to the player pool and in turn made it less likely to match against the same GM/HWL premade that roll through BGs over and over. I don't think it brings down the experience all that much, good pvpers still had name recognition across battle groups.
---
That's right
---
Haha haha nice troll post XD good luck getting more than one mob at a time if you're lucky for the first few days. Consider any starting area, what is the mob population? Maybe 40-60 mobs/zone. Literally 2500 players on your layer will spawn and continue spawning divided among the starting zones. 5.5 min respawn timer for mobs mean if 1% of a layer cap is in your zone at 2500/layer, your talking 25 players in your zone, that's 2-4 mobs per 5 min IF you're lucky. Realistically, 400 people will be in your zone and you will be excited to ever even get a mob.
---
Summer ends September 23rd
---
I meant that's what would have happened if phasing was a thing
---
Community-voted content would be amazing.
---
Give us Azhara crater, Dragon-Isles, and Kara Crypts plzzz
---
Very authentic experience
---
Just group with someone in another layer and you will move layers. Or at the very least it will pick one every time you log in, so not exactly months.
---
Oh, no, I don't think 6 hrs is very common anywhere. I just think it would be a good change overall – studies have been done on the subject.
---
I'm in Sweden.
---
I can't wait to flex with my zergling again 8)
---
Troll shamans are sweeet, my shaman will be troll. That casting animation is amazing.
---
Yeah I just wasnt sure if it's game specific or if that throws you into the overall pool and until removed, is in there
---
I never fully asked about the process. Like, did they (employee) email it to something like FFWarcraft@Blizzard.com or something, while  my email or whatever went to the Overwatch directory, no idea.
---
Pretty sure you won't be able to queue with people from other realms, but other than that I'm pretty sure their intention is to have it work like retail. 
---
We have until phase 3 when BGs come out, hopefully we can get them to re-evaluate by then.
---

---
Many of us are trying to play WoW Classic as a substitute for vanilla WoW. New content is not vanilla WoW, making WoW classic actually a substitute for new expansions. 
---
If private server players wanted new expansions, they’d play new expansions instead of private servers. You people don’t want WoW classic. You want a different expansion. 
---
Imagine waiting for WoW classic since the release of burning crusade. I want to play the original world of Warcraft. Once more is added on I will be gone. And the cries of “we want vanilla WoW” will return. Best to just release a burning crusade server.
---
Yeah I play in first person and use a command to extend my FoV so I don't get shit on my gnome rogues.
---
Yeah, because this will never be an issue of, people are coming at you right now and you really quickly switch layers. Unless you can do that, but you might have to log out, and you know, 20 seconds to logout you're probably dead by then. But aside from that, just switching to a different layer doesn't mean you won't be in any less danger of dying. There's no way to know how much of the opposite faction is on other layers in the specific area you are at.
---
I feel this is how a bulk of users complaining about not getting free stuff right now.
---
people dont understand it's not feasible on first login to have that many players at the same spot at the same time trying to kill shit, and forget that mobs have 5 minute respawn times
---
Scholomance in Ras Frostwhisper room, and BWL in Firemaw room
---
Flashback to being at a LAN party thinking we were cool for drinking Bawls out of plastic champagne flutes.... god the cringe
---
You can. You guys are still playing on the same server. Just invite them separately.
---
Acting like the majority of people even know what a solstice is let alone when they occur is really dumb tbh.
---
They said "just the starting zones". Fucking liars. I signed out 2 weeks from work the minute I heard the date. Retracting it now. Fuck Blizzard and 14 years of loyalty. I'm out.
---
I am only opposed to abuses, which are not classic. If there was a dynamic way to avoid those, while not retaining the static servers of vanilla, I’s be all for it. From the information that we have, there will be unintended consequences that will just have to be “understood”.
---
People were going crazy to be sure that it wouldn't stay no matter what. Now that it's confirmed, and confirmed for how long it's all good i think :).
---
What if it's "artificial" different servers? You create a character and stick to the "layer" forever until they decide to merge it with another layer? Or I got it somehow wrong? And If I am correct I wonder how you going to make sure that your friends on the same "server" are on the same layer.
---
Seems like Tipsout is the main source of the info, take that for what you will
---
you do realize that yes the game was once this way, but so much has been added that they then had to strip away? testing will make sure older assets won't fail because of their reliance on updated and now removed framework.
---
Respawn timer is 5.5 minutes and no dynamic spawns. So 1 person or 1000 people, it will always take 5.5m to spawn in Classic.
---
Layers will be random, and the only time you'll switch is if you group with friends/guildies. Logging in/out might change it, I'm not sure. No other way to do it. So you'll be able to form parties and quest with friends still.
---
That's fair. For me mindlessly grinding while I ride the bike for an hour helps me not talk myself out of riding but I get it. Good luck man! Remember to take care of yourself!!!
---
I was heavily against sharding but I really like this solution. This way I know sharding is neccessary but it is only a temporary solution.
---
Honestly? Deal
---
Hes the amazing fasting fat man on YouTube. Look him up
---
Yeah sorry I drop from reddit every so often. I have that post that should have everything including the Vorpx forum post I made as well
---
No you wouldnt. You’ll maybe remember 3-4 names from launch day outside of people who piss you off or whom your group with. 
---
On my last private server run there was one guy who I kept competing for tags with and he had similar hours to me—sort of friendly leveling rivals. 
---
There was also a alliance who had similar hours to me, so we are kinda in lockstep —so much pvp against eachother. 
---
Other than that, I f-listed a couple tanks. 
---
Beyond /world trolls, (which I hope isn’t allowed in classic) who is memorizing the names of the ransoms they run by in Westfall?
---
If you thought that classic was going to be a 100% authentic experience, then you have not been paying attention.
---
You won’t be able to do anything on launch day with this system. There will be a full server worth of population with you.
---
+1, its scummy no matter the way you phase it. There's no issue with having names be a first come first serve once servers launch
---
I'm too lame and busy these days to again experience the early days of WoW, but I'm excited to watch everyone's streams of classic. 
---
Playing at launch with my buddies in high school back in the day was awesome. These days I'm lucky to get an hour of gaming in a week unless it's late at night after everyone else is asleep and I'm too tired for that shit.
---
Yo can we build a bunker reddit gaminghouse where we can live for the next 3 years safely without getting hit by cars or some shit?
---
What are they doing during that time if they haven't done any changes to the game?
---
 Are they prepping the servers, etc?
---
Ah yes the white knights for a company that shits on your plate and you thank them for it. Beautiful.
---
FRANKNFURTER, IT'S ALL OVER!
---
thanks man
---
top notch vanilla experience
---
nost relaunch couldn't come soon enough
---
I was here
---
Congrats, RIP ME THOUGH
---
Blizzard knows that tourists will inflat servers. So instead of merging three servers literally a month after release when they leave making it a ghost town and losing the realm name you chose, layering sounds like a premeditated built in tri-server merger. 
---
Honestly, its pretty smart.
---
At least we get almost a whole month of summer 😅
---
I mean, 8-24 hours, maybe 12 hours in class, and studying is still less than 40 hours. I get that you work part time on top of it, but generally if you're going into a medical field there wouldn't be a reason to go part time unless your family has the funds to put you through and won't pay or you didn't have good grades as an undergrad.
---
Legend
---
My college starts august 28th.
---
I’d lie if I said my heart wasn’t broken.
---
This doesn’t really bother me. Shorter queue times for my twink once they release BGs.  Honestly the only reason I will even level a character is to support my twinks.   All PvE is scripted to be defeated once mechanics are understood.  PvP however is not.  End game content is fun and all but a good BG is the draw for me.
---
10k population is insanity. maybe blizzard can make one server with 40k pop cap and all nostalrius fans can go there?
---
It will probably be a one time copy is my guess. 
---
To make sure you can still play classic.
---
It's layering as needed, there is no minimum. There may be servers that only need 1 layer, making this whole thing irrelevant for them.
---
So you'd rather community destroying technology from modern wow to exist rather than dealing with a realm that isn't full. Got it.
---
Yo dog, I heard you liked servers.
---
So I put a server inside your server.
---
Just think about how much you're going to miss!!!
---
Then go back, no ones gonna miss close minded people
---
Bye? Really that's stupid grow up. One can play a game and be critical about it. 
---
I can be pleased by a full realm of players that all play on one layer called the realm lol. Either way I'm still gonna play the game, its just definitely not vanilla and it's a stupid decision on Blizzards part no doubt about that one
---
The video is on repeat (I think this is normal on twitch?) and I watched the vid 4 times until I got it
---
Lots of comments here an elsewhere to the effect of “Yea it’s TECHNICALLY summer buts it’s not really summer becuse I will be in school.”
---
Either a date is summer or it is not.
---
This is the same as layering minus the ability to directly interact with the other permanent shards. What would be the upside of that?
---
Only for phase 1. Afterwards it's gone. It's just so servers don't crash at the beginning
---
By fire be purged.
---
"Phase 1 is over and player fall off hasn't occurred like we expected, so we can't condense 15k players on our most popular servers into an unlayered world."
---
These are still the people who told us we thought we did "but you don't"
---
Same class, same race and (hopefully) same name. Human Warlock
---
Yea thanks a lot for making me think about it..
---
You understand that you stay in the same layer while you're logged in, but can change layers when you log out...right? You're not permanently assigned to layer 1. Nobody is. You're still going to get a huge mix of people coming and going. Add people to friends like we used to back in the day and enjoy your thousands of new gamers. Stop being a bitch :)
---
I like it because I'm an adult who has a job so it really does not matter to me in the slightest anyway.
---
We don't know how that'll work yet, as far as I'm aware.
---
Phase 1 is now basically Retail and will negatively impact community feel. The game will have to recover in later phases assuming they stick to their promise and remove layering (which they most likely won't remove it completely).
---
It's a DOA for an even remotely genuine classic experience because Blizzard can't cough up the money to invest in servers. Lame decision from a multi-billion dollar company with deep pockets.
---
Check out vanillafriends.com. Spread the word, we need to find our old friends!
---
Day after release in 04, however my account was compromised back in 2009 and after a phone call with Blizzard I was able to get my account fixed but needed to change my email, so everything was wiped before that according to my account.
---
I disagree. This may as well be a beta for Hearthstone for people who have only been subbed for 5 years. The game is THAT different in classic.
---
So you never spoke to anyone while in the major cities? Never had discussions in General of leveling zones or Trade?
---
&gt;Let Blizzard hand pick the qualified candidates
---
im sure bfa babbies will get great feedback
---
Why is that an issue? I played a shit ton of WoW in college. People are acting like video games and school are mutually exclusive. They’re not. 
---
Besides, I had MORE free time in college than I do working full time.
---
&gt;Position in queue: 218
---
&gt;Disconnected
---
&gt;Could not connect to the login server
---
&gt;Position in queue: 1,029
---
Sure it'll be "fine". But itll be a shit kind of fine, just like how retail wow is "fine".
---
I think they can see who has a active sub.
---
Well that sure killed some of the hype for me.
---
$45 for just a chance to get picked to find their bugs? Pass, hard.
---
Inb4 even the product that comes out in September is rushed
---
Your claim that I'm speaking for everyone is literally a strawman. Enjoy your entitlement.
---
So if someone is on a different layer, you simply cant join them at all then? You can only have it one way or the other.
---
Not telling you how, but I average 12k an hour, if you study the AH carefully and do some test runs, it's not so hard.
---
It will work on some servers, but make others much worse. When the numbers drop on that server so that merging all the layers will make a normal pop you will be fine. But there will be servers that the numbers don't drop mush and you will be stuck on a server with 6 hour queues when they merge and the 12000 people who are playing on all the different layers get merged down to one 2500 pop cap.
---
How will this impact trying to level with a friend?  Will there be times we log in and are in different layers?  How will this work?
---
You had so much time because you were doing the literal bare-minimum according to your own resume. 
---
I also went to a state school in Ohio for STEM, and literally every single person in our work group had a more impressive resume by the end of freshman year than you did at the end of your Masters. lol get the fuck over yourself.
---
When people say 'I dont have enough time' they're really saying 'I dont have enough time to do both things the best way I'd like to'...I'm sure each and every one of them knows they can slack off elsewhere and find the time like you did.
---
Well you would have to be friends with someone in a different shard than you, and since the only people you'll meet in the world would be on your shard, that only leaves IRL friends.
---
So I guess there is AN out, but it might be easier to deal with corpse camping by logging out entirely and playing an alt, like how most people did rather than hope one has an IRL friend available and not grouped up already for an instance.
---
When you join a group with them it will phase them in to the same layer that your on, and keep them there. So if you get stuck on two different layers of the same server, you'll still be able to see eachother while in a group.
---
Being a student means you have even more time to play! Just don't show up to lessons and figure it out at a later date.
---
LOL I am one of those that never played until MOP. So I definitely want to try Classic out.
---
Nope. Everyone else gets it and are already discussing it to mean both length of sub and when you started on the official forum. I'm not the only one that read that intent and it's patently obvious by the end of the quote.
---
Read it again to the end.
---
I printed this tweet and rubbed my weiner all over it.
---
Seems great in theory but how do they know exactly what the population will be when the layers are all merged? What if it turns out not enough people have quit and there are still to many layers?
---
The part I don't get about the explanation is, does person in Layer 2 phase into Layer 1 when invited to group? Because if they are in different layers but can see each other, how does mob tagging work? How does pvp work?
---
how is that even relevant
---
and no to your answer
---
I think it's fine. Have a nice day on my birthday then at 11pm open up Classic for a 2-4 hour session! Roll into 5 or so days off work ;)
---
What long run about classic? Classic servers will run in classic for 18 months tops. After that it will either be new content or they will move onto burning Crusade.
---
We don't yet know if they are going to have any classic servers constantly refreshing every 15 months or whatever, but they will never have a classic server Frozen at the end of content and keep it there in my opinion.
---
Bro we are all working over the summer. You know there is no summer holiday from jobs ya?
---
True. I’m honestly happy they just gave us a damn date. I was terrified that they were going to be like, “lol...it’s being released tomorrow.” Which would put a huge strain on existing guilds and friends landing on the same servers and such.
---
This gives me 3 months to prepare people and get everyone sorted.
---
"Tu" sin acento
---
Sounds like gambling bullshit to me.
---
I kinda missed out on the gravy boat and don’t understand: what is the difference between Classic WoW and “regular” WoW?
---
In this situation it has nothing to do with abusable it has to do with an inflation in resources. Whether its easily abused or not, if there are 8 layers, and it spawns in every layer, that means that 7 more are spawning on a server faster than it should be. Whether you can layer swap easily or not, you are still in a world where 8 hunters are getting an extremely rare pet every spawn cycle, instead of just 1. In inflates how many hunters get it, and eventually everyone will easily get it. Whether thats a problem or not its up to the person in question.
---
Will there be cross realm bg? Then that means pvp servers will be alliance or horde only as it was before BFA. So no world pvp or a lot if you play at the losing faction (alliance most likely). I don’t like this change. I wanted 50-50 servers
---
So you can basically "layer hop" for fishing black lotus/devilsaurs.
---
I'll be coming home from a legitimate vacation Monday afternoon. Perfect! Sympathies to Euro and Russian players though.
---
You will have a much lower limit on the realms, making it even more stupid to split the community up even more. If they keep the vanilla cap of 3 k, you will have about 1.5k player split among each factions starting zones. If you cant handle that for a limited time, you are running these realms on a potato of a machine
---
I disagree. I’ve been taught since as far as I can remember that seasons break down into even 3 month periods: December, January, February is winter; March April May is spring, June July August is summer, September October November is fall/autumn. Try and tell someone that June 20th is spring - that’s bananas crazy to me. I have never even heard of solstices and equinoxes until religious studies in college - that was the first time someone explained to me that seasons break down based on solstices and equinoxes, and it’s based on Sun worshipping cultures. My reference for seasons is the globally accepted Gregorian Calendar, not worshipers of Mithras.
---
Well they did say that you can see people from other layers if you group up with them, and I can't imagine they would make that work differently from how joining a group on retail does. What would happen if you join a group with someone from a different layer to help you kill hogger? Would people from your layer see you fighting hogger solo and hogger losing hp as if 5 people are hitting him? That does not seem like the plausible solution.
---
As it was explained layers persist so they only way to exit one would be by invite or at least thats how I took it from Tips interview with the devs.
---
I started in TBC and am still dying to try classic. I was too hooked on dark age of camelot to swap when wow released.

I demand 2000 players crammed into Elwynn Forest!
---
Well now you have to order a buffalo chicken pizza. It's literally required

Well whats the alternative. Give the beta to accounts that haven't subbed in years and hope that they become active again? There's probably thousands of dead accounts from vanilla that won't be used again.

Summer is jine/July to most people since that's when their major vacation time lines up.
---
Tbh I'm not playing classic to play classic but playing it because that is the type of MMO I enjoy, I HATE cross realm and duty finders, I hate welfare epics, pretty much I hate what MMOs are today, now if I can get new content with the vanilla wow status of gameplay I'm happy.
---
I gave you an upvote my dude!
---
This was undergrad a paramedic student. lectures were 20 hours a week clinical were another 20. I only said 8-24 because different degrees call for different hours. And I found it tough to keep up even studying close to 30 hours a week. Most people in medic school work fulltime because that is the only way they can find jobs in the field, and they don't have their parents to piggyback off of due to having families of their own. And this is only the bottom of the barrel nursing, NP, PA, and of course med school all have a much harder curriculum.
---
How do you ride and use a keyboard? Console controller? One of those sit down bikes with your legs stretched forward?
---
Yeah dude everyone that has an academic style work schedule must be an entitled brat.... /s
---
Ok so 100 people in 5 man groups is 20 tags for a 5 min respawn. So you can potentially be there for 100 mins trying to finish a quest, even with grouping. 
---
I understand the fear that any changes will cause Catastrophic failure and a Cataclysm in the real world to occur. But srsly, stop freaking out over a system where you’re still going to have 100’s of people of your layer,
---
Thanks for your support :)
---
There's a saying among programmers. "I finished 99% of the project now I only have the last 99% to go."
---
The last 1% of a project is always the longest. Fixing the tiny bugs here and there, the tiny inconsistencies with vanilla. Those things take a LONG time and Blizzard has never been one to say "fuck it, release first and bug fix later."
---
So not particularly worth it then if you dont own BfA.  Which I guess makes complete sense, but I was briefly considering if it would make sense to try and use my NEET energy to get sub time
---
Started at the same time. Did the same thing. Still blowing things up and still skipping dialogue, but a part of me wishes I was a lore fanatic.
---
Fair point.
---
Tips talked with Ion during lunch and he said they actually consider to bring pre-nerf C'Thun for a week or so just to fuck with players. They are cheeky and giddy as fuck and I love it.
---
Sure, but that involves them knowing ahead of time what layers their friends are on which can apparently change every time you log on.
---
I know I'm totally stoked to be just another PVP hiding invite throwing minion for one of my friends to come running to. LOL.
---
To anyone making tinfoil hat theories that they plan on pulling a bait and switch into having layering for all of classic:
---
Blizzard never broken a hard commitment / promise. They have plenty of times changed directions, but never have they done so after making a hard commitment. 
---
They didn't leave the backdoor open on this one because they want to reassure people this is only for the start and the absolute latest time-frame for layering ends when world bosses start spawning.
---
16th of Jan 2007
---
I think they added that in Wrath.
---
I have been thinking about this as well. Where does it stop? Do retail scarab lords get their mount in Classic as well? Meh
---
this... would probably work
---
honestly i feel more compelled to do this than see their new content, they don't seem very good at it
---
Well I guess we are both sitting here feeding each other words.
---
How romantic.
---
How many remember the original release and how long some servers were down for, it was days in a few cases of memory serves.
---
Someone's going to get laid in college.
---
Right! 1 month slip on a 24+ month software project is pretty good. Source: am software guy.
---
Doesn't matter how different the games are. What matters is Blizzard getting the data that they need to ensure a smooth launch. 
---
They will only send out X amount of invites. If they send a bunch of those invites to people who have no interest in WoW anymore - people who might not even use the email account that is registered to their WoW account - then that prevents people who are actually playing the game from getting invites, which prevents them from getting their data, which prevents them from ultimately delivering the product with the level of quality that we want.
---
I could have told you that they were going to require an active sub for a beta invite.
---
So you’re telling me you have a raiding group of 40+?
---
zone into layer 2 and get smacked by a zerg, i am surprised group members dont get pulled to the same layer anyhow
---
I personally am outraged that Blizzard didn’t release the game during my non-existent summer breaks from my full time job.
---
/u/darkphenomenon I guess this is better than any post I would have found lol
---
I hate this time because my annual vacation time expires August 12. Guess I'll go outside and have a fulfilling life instead or something
---
&gt;Lawl. "summer" Blizzard I don't think you know what that word actually means.
---
I don't think **you** know what summer means.
---
nah they wouldnt have enough players to keep each expansion going separate from each other
---
3k pop cap for a server without any layering would be the best choice but it was never going to happen. The amount of servers needed would have been massive.
---
It ends here, it is literally the only thing that "carries over". And even then, it's just like it was in vanilla. The only difference is that people don't get a chance to buy it *again*.
---
Mostly that he gets some things totally wrong and that seems to stem from the other gripe which is he claims to have played since vanilla now, but earlier on he had admitted that he started in cataclysm.
---
They're not going to release the collector's edition so you couldn't get them anyway. And didn't they say that nothing from classic would carry over to retail?
---
It's phasing, it's just large phasing. It's dumb.
---
You are dumb. How can you know that it won't be even better?
---
Eh, I trust it will work and that they will figure it out.
---
I am sure they will want to get rid of it as soon as they can. Its a means to an end
---
I quit even looking at r/wow...it is one of the most negative places full of bitching I have ever seen.
---
blizzard is smart!       
---
sending out informations via streamers, gives them the community feedback, without taking the heat on an official statement.. its all rumors so far.
---
Damn now I'm imagining what vanilla would be like with the loosened class restrictions Cataclysm brought.
---
AKA I want to be a dwarf everything.
---
tfw you won't have to compete with a bunch of school children for quest items
---
You’re right. I’m a corporate shill because I learned how to read a calendar when I was in elementary school.
---
&gt;Winter is when you sit inside and play WoW
---
*Sweats in Texan*
---
trade/general may be unified, and the only people who get known in those channels are the purest of retards. i think you might be in with a chance there. either way, its not different people every day, its maybe different people every day
---
&gt; friends list and guild
---
thats what the overwhelming majority of your network is dumbell. it functions as normal until the merge and then theres a slight adjustment period after the merge as the now stable population mixes together. why do you think the community will not be able to recover from a small number of dedicated sub-communities merging but a low pop server will?
---
There’s always money in the banana stand.
---
Layering will make me play with people that I will not meet ever again. That kills any incentive to be decent in the world or dungeons. If people I shard with at least eventually end up in the same permanent realm with me it will be a whole different story. 
---
Perhaps I did not geting the idea of layering?
---
I bought a 3 month sub, so hopefully I get something. I realize it's shitty but what can you do?
---
Besides, if I don't get it then I'll cancel and hopefully get some money back for unused months.
---
based
---
&gt;Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account
---
&gt;We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game
---
That means people with more subscription time will be choosen over someone who played Classic and stopped right after.
---
And what about re-spec? Is it gonna be like Diablo2 where you had to start a new char if you cocked up?
---
People are massively exaggerating the subject. 
---
Keep in mind that the private servers with 10k online are GLOBAL. Its ASIA/US/EU/CN/RU whatsoever, everyone mixed in the same place with no downtime. Within ONE realm. 
---
Now there will be MULTIPLE realms and actual non-peak hours, there's a good chance you won't EVER experience the new technology on your realm, lol.
---
I'm glad :D less people to congest the server, I'm sure they planned it exactly for that reason to, GET CUCKED LULW
---
This just in people who have time don’t care and people who can’t play during that time are upset. With the former telling them to calm down. Almost exactly what’s wrong with the world , fuk you got mine.
---
Would love to see you link me a blue post where they say as much
---
&gt; Layering will make me play with people that I will not meet ever again.
---
You will, after it's deactivated. If you do not level hardcore, you will not hit 60 before they plan to disable layering.
---
&gt; If people I shard with at least eventually end up in the same permanent realm with me it will be a whole different story.
---
**IT'S ALL THE SAME SERVER!** After 4-8 weeks you will see everyone you met during the layering phase at the same time. Did watch the videos where they explain how it works? If not, I do really recommend watching them ...
---
Hi, /u/Rizzlu
---
Doesnt this mean starting zones are going to have 1000+ characters on launch?
---
They’re really not at all similar IMO.
---
The only layers he's in is a burrito.
---
So I get ganked by some d-bag and his friend and I want revenge. I invite my buddy who's in the same zone so we can team up and kill them. I get transferred to my friend's layer and the enemies disappear. How can group world PvP function with a system like this?
---
And he turned me into a newt!
---
They paid for it. If I had them, I think I'd be bummed if they were unusable. You say "no changes", but for the players that paid for them, that IS no changes
---
Just make layers static.  First 3000 people get put on Layer 1 and will always be layer 1 regardless if you log out and log back in.   Only way to hop layers temporarily is by a party invite and you return to your layer once you leave group.  And make guild members always be on the same layer.    
---
This solves server inflation problems and also allows for layer merging down the line once population deflation happens.  There's still the capability for people to shard in front of you by joining parties but its NOWHERE near as egregious as being sharded everytime you login.
---
Server capacity costs them either way; I doubt it is purely a money concern.  The alternative is hundreds of realms at launch followed by likely hundreds of dead realms a couple months later and the logistical headache of merges, character renames, etc.
---
It's true it will not be a genuine Classic experience at the outset but I believe it will be better in the long run.
---
It's not that there's no reason to group with randoms (or else LFD and LFR wouldn't be as massively popular as they are). Its that with an ever changing pool of players across multiple servers, you can't build a community.
---
That’s when I’m starting my masters. le sigh...
---
“Summer release” and actual release on like the last couple days of summer 
---
That’s misleading af
---
I would have upvoted you had it not been for that ridiculous edit.
---
Yeah at Classic University! Put in that time, boy!
---
It was strongly implied in the tipsout interview. The lead engineer used the work stickied. It wouldn’t make sense to not persist through logout since it’s a single layer that would by default always keep you in it for the session. I may of course incorrectly be assuming things but that’s how I understood it.
---
Have fun in basic as I am smoking a bowl playing wow classic with my DD-214 blanket
---
Hi, /u/immunetocute
---
 Why would people be upset about a new collectors?  Why have classic with retail rewards?  I have the BC Wraith and Cata collector's and don't give a shit if they have those pets attached to another release.
---
I re-subbed for a few reasons.
---
1. Beta sounds cool, why not?
---
2. I want to reserve my character names.
---
3. I’m about to get surgery and will likely be bored out of my mind.
---
No. Horizontal progression.
---
Just saying there are other options, so people know. Its not that you have to decide now or forever be screwed. If you prefer another factions mount more than your own, yes start doing their quests early on. If you kinda like the other mounts and want them later, there are options later on
---
No, its not like that. New layers will be created when they are needed. Lets say you have 3k cap on one layer and then 5k ppl join the realm so 2k people spill to a new layer. Lets then say people from the first layer log off so now its a 1k/2k split. The layers will join up to 1 3k layer and the 2nd layer is now gone. The creation of layers is dynamic, not a set amount like "realmname 1 realmname 2 realmname 3"
---
Dude you are living the life! I’m putting in all the hard work now so I can someday live like you lol. Have fun out there :)
---
I honestly want them to take as much time as possible to make sure everything is right, so I'm not upset one bit.
---
When you fuck the game up so bad you gotta git-revert back to the beginning.
---
Real talk?  I'm gonna roll as my wife's former main, a mage.  Because only one button is required.  And I have a kid now, so after he goes to bed now I mostly drink until I go to bed myself, and a feral rotation with whisky is a nightmare.
---
GET FUCKING HYPEEEEE
---
LFR was added after WotLK which is also when subs took a nose dive.. coincidence lol?
---
Yeah its like they could have said, a late classic summer instead of summer and you would have known.
---
Dont make a post putting you on a high horse for something thats clearly not what anyone considers as summer.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
As a current student, I'm honestly just gonna skip fall semester lol. I know it's a stupid idea butt fuck it.
---
I feel ashamed i put sub on my account just for a shot at beta lol
---
Ok so would you recommend i reevaluate the entirety of expectations for my life or just video game related stuff?
---
You don't seem to be able to see the difference between *items earned in game* and *cosmetics obtained by purchasing the game*.
---
Nothing earned in game will carry over, obviously. There is no reason to believe that anything other than the CE pets will either. Put down your pitchfork until it's actually needed.
---
That's true, but I'd rather just have them not offer that "service" at all and give us all a fair chance at our names when the servers hit
---
You can Moonkin everywhere but 99.9% of raid groups. Solo, dungeons, WPvP, BGs, have at it.
---
Compared to the millions of accounts that haven't been active in years? Yeah the active player base, probably more likely than a non active one.
---
The fact you even think this is contestable is what's really mind boggling.
---
MATCH ME
---
I love it I will fuck up my sleepschedules so it lines up perfectly and all the family dads are gone after 1-3hours of playing. EZ 60
---
They're using BFA raid frames it's been confirmed multiple times.
---
All it means is that you need to put people on friends list if you want to play with them again. Generally while leveling you don't see many of the same people anyway just randomly in the world.
---
Oh hey that’s my birthday.
---
So you can’t speak to people from other layers?
---
You wouldn't need to know. The devs said that guilds will be pulled into the same layer. Unless they're actually lying, there's no reason to think otherwise.
---
What I mean is that you can't *select* to switch layers while in-game, like with... I dunno... Aion? Aion had a feature like what, where you could jump to different "channels" within a server. The game will still shunt you into a certain layer on purpose, or in the case of guilds, make you log into that layer from the outset.
---
You’ll be waiting to play still with server queues
---
Get a random shit paying job for 1 week = more money to buy wow game time which will take you 1 year to farm in gold.
---
O word? Might have to give it a go then LOL
---
That is a fair point. Although the whole leveling process itself is usually brought up as one of the good parts of vanilla, isn't it? Surely you wouldn't be missing out much on the experience?
---
That dude is actually inspiring.
---
Stress test? :)
---
Where did I use the word 'entire'? Enough of the WoW community (and the classic community in particular) are entitled to make my statement valid. Anyway, I'm out, got better things to do than argue with you. Enjoy your entitlement.
---
I’m glad we’re on the same page lol
---
Can someone link the source or clip of Ion confirming it being limited to Phase 1? i'm seeing that information repeated everywhere but can't find it. 
---
I much preferred smaller weekly updates to this everything at once shit show.
---
All the video say these layers are over 2k players per layer. That’s the size of a classic server
---
It's ok, I heard they're gonna make a mobile version. * Ducking from the rocks fixing to be thrown *
---
Do you have advice on how normies like me can improve their understanding of blizzard entertainment?
---
Once more the inch has been given and the mile taken. People jumping to Blizzard's defense without considering the implications.
---
Except in vanilla it took many, many months before you got that option.
---
Vanilla had dead servers and faction imbalanced servers for a literal year before Blizz tried fixing them with transfers
---
Y'all are forgetting that phase 1 could be fucking months
---
Reddit in general tends to be the exception to the rule. If you're subscribed here of *course* you're interested in classic.
---
I'm talking about the entire bloody population of WoW here, not a forum specifically dedicated to classic.
---
It is functionally sharding, and I'm certain that they will also shard the starting zones because otherwise nobody would be able to level due to the overcrowding of a full server on each layer.
---
Its not all great and grand. I joined the military young and ran into some major problems in my early 20s. I am now 100% disabled veteran. There are def upsides, there are downsides too
---
Keep grinding tho, youll have your day :)
---
Let players deal with overpopulation and competition in starting areas for 2 weeks. Let the player community fix itself over time. Place limits on concurrent players for servers. Allow selective server transfers later if population drop off makes it necessary. Vanilla solutions for a Vanilla experience.
---
Got em
---
alternate timeline wow with no split difficulties and no LFR is my dream
---
No it's not, they said that the end of phase 1 would be the absolute cutoff for it, they plan to end it much earlier. Every fucking day you kids are saying somethings going to kill the game or ruin the community. You losers are the ones ruining the community, just go away for awhile.
---
lost my bet with a friend on whether tool or classic comes out first.  by 3 freaking days!
---
Knowing Blizzard they'll use it as many times as they can and try to write something reasonable to the community that defends their decision.
---
I’m kind of upset with how late it is, too, but it’s still technically summer.
---
I've played Pservers for around 8ish years now and I have to say I rarely remember anyone from zones I level in, chat or groups. Unless the guy in the zone was chill and talked (then we just flist but that was rare) or he was constantly shitposting in general, I wouldn't remember them. 
---
So my point still stands, unless you're rainman you're not going to remember anywhere close to 75% of people and if you don't see them you can easily chalk it up to them not always being on at the same time as you....Not to mention you could easy end up on the same layer again because its not like they're going to have 10 layers per server...
---
you're looking for something to be angry about, this is 100% a non issue if they keep their word. The servers will be flooded with tourists anyways where the majority of people you meet (this was the same in vanilla) you'll never see again. 
---
The game will be different from your memory of vanilla, the gaming sphere is nowhere near the same and never will be.
---
I'm not the girl in the video. She's from 2004.
---
To be fair it was absolutely a shit show on 11/23/04...so both are sorta authentic.
---
Relatively speaking MANY more people entered wow 1 day 1 week 1 month, nearly 1 year after launch than there are those of us who’ve been here since us launch day. 
---
A smooth world without 500 people competing for tags is more authentic to a much larger portion of the audience.
---
I did 5 days one time. He has way more determination than I do.
---
Thank you!
---
they may not hear how negative layering is from players used to far worse, however
---
ok dude, gl competing with shitters for a beta invite that dont even care about classic
---
Bunch of cry baby piss pants holy fuck. Be happy we got a release date.
---
And shout out to all the non parents out there, who are largely unaffected by this.
---
That really doesn't matter. Phase 1 and the leveling is the most important part. 
---
I don't get whats is the problem. Yeah, on Day1 there would be 3425234 People in Elwynn and you would have to get creative to level quickly, but thats the fucking point.
---
Okay, even if they are merged, i assume they will still have cap. What happens if your friend couldn't "fit" after that merge?
---
And I'm willing to bet they're all streamers and not Blizzard employees.
---
"Bizzare Sexual Appetite"
---
So are all players always in the same layer for the entire duration of phase 1, and do we get to choose what layer we’re in?
---
For example,  if I get put in ‘Layer 1’ upon creating my character, and my brother gets put in ‘Layer 2’, is it essentially the same as us playing on two completely different servers until they’re merged on Phase 2?
---
The only issue with a server merge is player names. Players either are forced to change their name or have their original server show up after the name (so you could have Facestabber-Mankrik and Facestabber-Mankrik's Wife on the same server.)
---
Right? As an educator who will be (mostly) off work from June 14 to August 14, I was hoping to get some quality time in over the summer.
---
you're not up against people who don't know everything mate
---
you're up against *all the people who know all the things*
---
this is what main tank means in vanilla
---
The name of September in my language is literally fallmonth. How much are you willing to bet if I go asking people if they think September is summer?
---
For hardcore raiding it's mostly the grind for consumables each week to have enough for each raid. Then you'll probs be looking at min maxing spreadsheets that should already exist so that's easy.
---
Keybinds are preference really. I swear by them yet I know I used to get whomped by a guy who was a clicker.
---
I key bound T,R,F,G,V and their shift variants / shift spacebar / control space bar / shift 1 through 6 / tildia for mount. Yet as a MT I had to also keybind Q and E to get all spells needed.
---
&gt; With server mergers you aren't placed into different servers each time you log on.
---
-Will relogging change my layer?
---
No you are bound to your layer unless grouped or joining a guild of another layer.
---
In Vanilla all my friends were Alliance with a strong sense of faction pride so my little guilty pleasure was a Troll Shaman who made it to level 30 and then kind of died there. My wide would much rather play a healey pally again but I'm not about that life any more. As one of the greatest hero's said "I just want my horde back. "
---
It comes out just in time for the fall semester. Hooray
---
I get it, am just curious. Are you able to speak to people cross-layer? Pay someone to be transported away from pvp or towards a rare spawn?
---
What the hell is wrong with you people?  I was in support of complaints when it was about streamers but holy hell you guys really broke the first rule of blizzard. It will never release until it’s ready. When they say summer, they mean it could literally come out on 9/19 still.
---
Several people on this sub bought the blizzcon virtual ticket last year to play a 2 week, 2 zone demo, so.. I fully expect to see people livid they resubbed and didn't receive beta invites.
---
Personally I've been subbed to retail all along, so it makes no difference to me.
---
Do we even know that? If it changes your layer every time you log in and out, maybe that could make sense (I still don't think it's that bad to not consistently see the same players every day for a month tbh).
---
It’s not just cliche when people say play what you what, maybe not every spec is viable, but every single class is 100% viable, you can always find a group, I wouldn’t worry about it, and 75% of your experience will be leveling, so raid viability matters little
---
It sounds like separate servers with the same server name. What this does do is make server merging easier because character naming will be unique inforced across layers up front instead of when they are merged later. It also lets them balance the load more dynamically for their servers hour by hour, day by day. They can add/remove layers for a server as needed. My guess is they are reusing some of the server cluster tech they already had, tweaking it a bit.
---
... With that said, I still think it's a bad idea. If enough people dont quit playing during phase 1, they'll not be able to merge the remaining layers... what do they do then... leave layers running of course. This approach also seems like it would have community/social impact. Exactly what, I need to read the details of the tech. Also if we log into a diff layer every time, you lose consistency of running into the same people every day.
---
Also how do layers impact the AH? 10 layers means 10x resources? And if the AH is layer specific, I guess that means you have to end up on the same layer everytime you log in? Which I though people had been saying was not the case. So maybe you could be selling something on a layer you are not on. So if you could detect which layer you are on, you could purposely impact specific layers AH by farming on 1, but selling it on 3 where people who farmed it on 3 also sell it...I'm not a market's guy, but bet it could be abused somehow.
---
Just my initial thoughts. Need to read the official released info after work.
---
Hi, /u/Soskasos
---
I just want a horse tbh, I'm boring like that
---
Could also be potentially motivated by the continuation of subscriptions. The hype they have will likely carry subs until August that might drop off, then the release will continue the subs. Like 5 months of subs from the flaky players instead of 3. They have done that kind of thing before, launching huge updates one month and a couple days after the full release of x-packs.
---
Can someone ELI5 this quick for me? I am lost
---
Blizzard is particularly fond of releasing WoW xpacs in late August. I have a huge backlog of games so it's not really a big deal to me, but when blizzard hyped the game as a summer release late August isn't really what I'd expect, even if it's technically still summer
---
From what I understand, he can only hop if he gets an invite, if he logs back in by himself, he will be on your Layer again. If he has other people who can constantly invite him to a new layer, ya thats unfortunate. I would personally rather have the layers than not have them. Its a means to an end
---
It’s only for release.
---
glad u like it Mr depressed
---
What's wrong?
---
If there are still more players than the population cap after the layer merge, then there will be queues, just like in vanilla.
---
The first polar bear codes were for like the 2008 blizzcon, the Big Blizzard Bear wasn't added to the game files until wotlk, sooo :p
---
The layers are just for partitioning what data you see on your screen.. all your friends and people from different layers are still on the same server as you.. they will merge them down.
---
The assumption without real numbers just yet is that, we may get layers that hold up to 3K people, but the server population will be at say 6K or 9K.. after layering is removed it'll be like having a single layer at 9K.. they wont fill the server past whatever the server's hard limit is.
---
I THINK it goes like this so don't kill me if im wrong
---
Server (Dalaran for example) has multiple (lets say 10) layers, you can get shifted around in these layers for phase 1, after that all 10 layers get collapsed into 1 layer (Dalaran server) and the players are together.
---
Yes you would be able to, but you would need a friend whos on the same server as you that is on a different layer to bring you over. I imagine it will be stimilar to the way where whenever you join a group with someone of different levels, it will put the whole group on the layer of the highest level player, so having a friend make a level one just to layer hop shouldn't be abusable. You'll basically have to have two people who are battlenet friends be at the same level in these zones, which during phase 1 is probably unlikely. I'm not saying that it won't be abused, but based on what we know it seems like it's going to be a bit harder than it is on retail. Afterall, the reason the system gets abused so much on retail is because of the cross realm and group finder.
---
No way. I have way more time to play now that school is done and I'm married on top of that. I will probably still have more time to play after I have a kid then when I was in school.
---
"You're not leet enough for Molten Core!"
---
Considering the classic option for the beta opt-in was just added, and you have to manually log and enable it for a shot at a beta invite **tomorrow**, I doubt there would be a huge problem of beta attendance.
---
School starts in September for a lot of schools in the US. Especially Universities.
---
Traditionally Sept/Oct/November is considered fall, and Dec/Jan/Feb is winter, Mar/April/May spring, and June/July/August is Summer. 
---
Doesn't affect me, but i can see the point.
---
I had more free time in college than nowadays working. If you do college right you should have plenty of free time (assuming you’re not also working full time) with some exceptions
---
You puking right now? Dizzy? And I bet this won’t be a deal breaker. You will play regardless
---
Are you guessing this is how it works or is there a source for this info? There must be a threshold a layer population gets to before a new one begins to be populated. Otherwise, theoretically if there were only 3 people on a server, they would each be put on their own layer. Alternatively, if there was say a 3000 player limit per layer, will the 3001st player be put on their own layer, or will 1499 players be sharded into the new layer with them?
---
Trying to find a patch that supports your claim here. I was glad throughout TBC and seem to remember the 2 minute trinket being able to remove cyclone.  
---
Then again, druids didnt become FOTM before S2 so my memory can be warped.  
---
Cyclone had DR as said before.
---
Good point! I've been skimming videos, and it seems to be that you can swap Layers under certain circumstances. I misunderstood the way I first heard it explained.
---
Go to Hinterlands.  Start farming mobs in a tiny area, like maybe cast range x2 as a diameter.
---
Kill those mobs over and over, waiting for respawns instead of moving to another area, for four hours.
---
Every four hours, fill up a small rectangle with purple on a sheet of paper.
---
When you have twenty full rectangles, say in guild: 
---
*Ding.*
---
&gt;The devs said that guilds will be pulled into the same layer. Unless they're actually lying, there's no reason to think otherwise.
---
That would be switching layers, though. So how does it work, you can guild invite someone on another layer and then once they accept the invite they get pulled into your layer? You get pulled into their layer?
---
&gt;What I mean is that you can't select to switch layers while in-game, like with... I dunno... Aion? Aion had a feature like what, where you could jump to different "channels" within a server.
---
But what about the above example, can I just guild invite someone to swap them to my layer? What if I group invite them? Raid invite them? 
---
&gt;A player who logged in one hour after you and was put into Layer 2 on a Thursday could be in the same layer as you on a Friday, or on a log-out-log-in on that same Thursday if player population drops off later in the evening.
---
What if I want to keep playing with that player?
---
This all sounds awful. And it doesn't solve any problems with the game. What a disappointment.
---
Sounds like sharding.
---
Yes. Rogue, and I’m making him a night elf, as he was all those years ago.
---
It was probably the best one, but there were still some login issues, their Authenticator servers are trash. Lately in retail they’ve been going down very often.
---
We can't trust the sword of a thousand truths to a n00b!
---
Vacation been put in....6 days....should I add 2 more?
---
Sounds disingenuous, I like it.
---
Or they could just not fuck with the community, which is the biggest factor to why people love Vanilla so much?
---
Define "pretty much exactly."
---
They will likely merge layers on a per realm basis with the last realms being merged just before phase 2
---
You can't "just hop layers". You'd need to log out, wait, and then log back in after population density increased or decreased enough to put you in a separate later. Otherwise you'd need someone to invite you into a different group and pull you out of that layer, and then, well, you're still on the same server. You just won't be visible to some of the players some of the time. Blacklisting and bad rep will still work.
---
Because anything you do as a freshman is relevant by the time you finish school? I love how you went back to an old ass resume and are trying to use that as evidence that I did the bare minimum. 
---
The only thing I didn't do that I really should have is work an internship. Instead I worked full time through the summers doing other things I enjoyed because I wanted to. 
---
As far as anything else is concerned it's not really something to put on a new grad resume. No one gives jack shit if you were apart of a club or organization. No one cares about the part time jobs you work on the side while in school.
---
Not once while interviewing have I ever been asked about those nor did they care.
---
High school was my serious peak of game time. Especially before I had a job.
---
man really? not even an option to have the classic ones? that fucking blows. I like to see the character portrait as a raid frame..
---
World PvP after phase 1 when sharding is turned off, will be alive and well
---
They definitely didn't say that
---
Well when you're in marketing you can't really blame people for how they interpret it. If a huge portion of people interpret something a certain way you should have found a different way to brand it imo.
---
Kk cya dork
---
I have. Guess what the literal translation of September is in my calendar? Fallmonth.
---
Public beta? Is that a thing?
---
Classic was a lot harder than people remember. Don't be surprised if you lose a 1v1 fight to a mob or quest boss while questing.
---
This good news has lifted my spirits after being disappointed from game of thrones
---
It is also "just a game" that the community has been asking for for like a decade. People are experiencing the culmination of their wait and it's falling at one of the worst possible times for a huge swathe of the people who want to play.
---
Fucking boomers.
---
we're all gonna be ok
---
LAYERING IS JUST DOGSHIT SHARDING REPACKAGED IN CAT SHIT
---
You don’t need to ask them, just look at a calendar.
---
Pretty much! You just don't get all the worst parts of sharding.
---
still gonna have more time to play than boomers
---
Where did they say cross realm BGs?
---
And I truly love the "its not a summer release" comments, "call it early fall!"
---
I guess they need to learn the season as well before the August release.
---
Yikes
---
I'm not talking about summer break from school. I'm talking about summer. Summer ends at the end of September in the US.
---
ZUG ZUG
---
Haha yup I feel ya man
---
One of the videos specifically mentioned you may phase whenever you relog or even just switch continents.
---
I’m totally fine with this. Waiting for BGs 10+ minutes gets old rather quickly. Cross realm guarantees that any player in any time zone has people to play with.
---

---
This is a pretty interesting question on sharding/layering directed at the devs.
---
Well I took a day off, had already planned a week long vacation this year, but it was approved. My boss also plays WoW so he knows.
---
It seems I have my terminology fucked up. Time to go read more. lol
---
You’re the worst of all of them!!!!!!
---
This has never been true.  Link official sources or you're just spreading misinformation
---
I've already accepted that there will be sharding and layering sounds like a better version of sharding (people won't be popping out of nowhere and won't be vanishing into thin air - means better immersion).
---
But it's not actually Vanilla.
---
Anyone with a valid Wow sub can play, it's not like when Vanilla launched where someone had to purchase the game to get in.
---
This means you will have a MUCH higher amount of "tourists" that will try it just to see what the hype is about and will quit after a month.
---
[Vanilla WoW steadily gained players over quite a few years.](https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/t_original/1241945255815773287.png)
---
Classic Wow's player graph will NOT look like this, it will spike in the first month and then collapse down to a steady player base.
---
If you apply Vanilla tactics to the Classic launch, you will end up with many spread out dead servers.
---
Clap
---
there was $250,000 LINING THE WALLS OF THE BANANA STAND
---
AND YOU BURNED IT
---
it's hillarious how hypocritical you are being with that edit lmao
---
Layering is bullshit. Classic is classic.
---
https://www.everquest.com/news/eq-what-is-a-progression-server
---
Jesus dude, if you want to have a conversation that's fine, but at least put a little effort in here.
---
I am so excited
---
Yeah, but you can't beat the freedom of summer break.
---
So how far do you think you could get in a week?
---
Hyped af for sharding! Can’t wait to aoe grind in peace!!!!! Woot woot
---
This is less than a third the population that private servers can handle...
---
By then we may have experienced the real thing and wishing for the days we played video games. Thank The Donald.
---
I don’t like it so it’s terrible!
---
Classic will be a thing for years and years to come. There is room for more potentially towards the end of that. People will have naxx on farm so who cares.
---
Yeah, as we know what blizzard intends and how players twist that to suit their needs aren't always the same thing.
---
Exactly. It’s just interesting they drop most of their content in August when I feel like a couple months earlier and they would see more subs, but what do I know haha
---
According to Ian he very clearly stated that layering will only be on for a few weeks. Under no circumstances will it continue past phase 1 at the latest.
---
I'm working full time *and* going to school. Kill me :)
---
Well, they did say it was gonna be for the starter zones first too. Having concerns about the state of the game in future =/= being toxic. Bowing down for any decision that comes from blizzard will be toxic for the gaming experience though.
---
Good thinking.
---
I’m not going to argue with you. Summer ends September 23rd. That is a fact. Believe it or don’t, I don’t care.
---
Well, none of this matters anymore when you got a job. No more summers with late night/early morning wow.
---
Still extremely hyped though.
---
Thanks, dick...
---
nolifers cant take a joke. 
---
fucking peasants
---
I'd be more generous and say 10 out of 100 raids would take him.
---
Here is a true story that happened to me back in 2005 when I first started playing World of Warcraft. Back then when I first started playing this game, I was pretty young and was bad at the game. I did not know about websites like Allakhazam or Thottbot to find out where some quest objectives are. So I always asked the chat for information.
---
One day a gnome female mage replied that she knew the quest and wants to help since she was bored. So we grouped up and did the quest together. After that quest we decided to do a few more quests together. She started to open up about her real life and her abusive boyfriend. We sat down on a hill at Westfall and talked for hours about her issues. It was getting late so we decided to talk again another day.
---
I think I started having feelings at this point. The next day I decided to see if she was online so I checked the friends list. I could not find her name, only this message: "This user has been layered". From that point on I tried to find her but never could.
---
If you need an active WoW sub to get a Classic Beta invite then most people getting into Classic Beta will be current retail players who don't really care about Classic.
---
ah only for literally the most important phase for establishing the economy and community got it
---
Well if they anticipate overpopulation even after a couple of months then it makes sense to have layering. The layering is dynamic, right?, so there will probably only be one layer for Azhara 3 months into the game, but there may be multiple for the Barrens.
---
Seems so. IDK why the people bitching about layering are bitching, it's going to be nearly identical to Vanilla wow with respect to number of players on one server/layer.
---
Aww yeee.
---
Where did you see the 3000 player for a new layer?
---
What about guilds? Always on one layer? What if we form a massive counter-raid only to find the enemy raid is on another layer?
---
Or maybe it’s just a good thing.
---
Unlikely, not like there's gonna be 300+ people in Ungoro or Winterspring at the same time. I don't know the number for layering for it's gotta be in the hundreds.
---
Your 2 statements contradict themselves
---
being in college is the easiest time to play games in your whole life tho
---
Well  in an interview with senior software engineer Omar Gonzalez he specifically states that layers are continent wide.  So all of Eastern Kingdoms are on 1 layer and Kalimdor is another another layer.  So switching continents will switch your layers.  I've also seen a lot of people quoting devs about how layers are chosen on each login but I'm looking for a direct quote right now.
---
Well, since all the content will be divided into six phases, phase 1 will probably last from two months up to five months.
---
It's basically Blizzard's way of forcing half a month of subscription out of people like me who has no interest in play retail and will use that half month of subscription doing nothing. I'm not a teenager anymore, so a few bucks worth of subscription cost means nothing to me. It's just the feeling of getting nickle and dimed that I don't like. I've supported Blizzard games since I was 10 years old. Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, WoW, TBC, etc. They used to give you value for every dollar you spend with them. I was always happy to spend every dollar I spent on them. I still want to support them. But there's a right way to do it and a wrong way, and this feeling of getting nickle and dimed is the wrong way.
---
This is just my opinion, and yea, I'm still going to play Classic no matter what, but these kinds of things Blizz is doing just feels petty.
---
Except that your layer changes every time you log in, so its not always the same 3000 people
---
Ah that's what I figure thank you very much!
---
Well go hit it with a dagger, dude.  Several classes don't have any ranged, instant-cast, instant-damage abilities.
---
Referring to the chat channels or auction house? I can't imagine they would shard the auction house, chat channels I wonder about as well.
---
Well good luck all getting in, unless you are all popular streamers

Heyhey :) 8/27/19
---
Just in time for my teaching job to start back up....
---
For real, my ignorant self thought after the announcement there would be rejoicing and hype and instead it’s just salt and complaining and dissatisfaction. I would hate to be a Blizzard employee who had to interact at all with the community
---
They have never required a sub for betas in the past. I have gotten into the MoP, WoD, Legion, and BfA betas without an active sub. This is a new rule. It is unwelcomed.
---
Thanks for the heads up! I'm a Euro though so it's a day of work, naptime when I get home before getting up for an all-nighter. Good times ahead!
---
Nobody has ever figured this out. You're the first. Congratulations on your award!
---
Do you want a bunch of people who aren’t gonna play the game take the best names?
---
It’s not a big deal, I agree. Mostly because gamers are used to tactics like that, though. I mean, look at the subscription mount they released in BFA. They gave people a free shiny mount if they subbed for 6 months, when they knew a huge sub downturn was imminent. It’s a smart business tactic, but it puts this extra layer of distrust between the players, and the publishers.
---
Here's the view of the EU store page.
---
What replaced your video game time after graduating? I kind of did the opposite when I'd just started working full time and felt a bit empty, would get home and spend 6 hours in front of the computer every weekday and binge even harder on weekends.
---
👌
---
Wrong, you know a boat load of people paid for a virtual ticket to just pay the demo yeah? If you need a active sub to get beta people WILL resub to try and get in as well.
---
In other words, until phase 2.
---
Layer will be in up until phase 2.
---
It sounds like a drop end date for realms whom population does not subside.
---
Some servers might not experience Layering as it's intended to solve high pop realms. Some might experience only for a few days or weeks.
---
But yes - for those realms whom have high pop consistently might experience Layering up until phase 2.
---
Please, and I can not stress this enough, keep twitch chat out of world chat.
---
I am just sitting here loling at all the people who think they could save enough for epic unarmored mount anyway
---
no, EAST STAINES MASSIVE is bettah
---
In your example they would split up the 11k into 4k 4k 3k server.  It's not like if you go over 5k, the next person gets a server entirely to themselves.  The first few days they will place you on a realm which only lasts for that session.  After a couple of days the population will stabilize somewhat and they would then "freeze" which realm everyone gets assinged to.  Months after as less people log in they would merge the realms down until they have a single one.
---
So what's your solution?  Every server will be flooded initially, then the population will drop dramatically weeks/months later.  How do you balance that huge initial influx with dead servers later?
---
Adjust how though? Everyone who originally joined the realm will still be on that realm regardless of how many layers there are. When they do away with realms there is no telling how much pop that realm will finally have, right?
---
This is not just about starting zone. The majority of players will be doing the same route for the first 30 to 40 levels which means that the problem will not take care of itself; rather, it will be moving with you from zone to zone.
---
Nah it wont
---
NO TOUCHING!
---
I might actually wait out the first few days of launch so I can avoid streamer servers. Just watching Asmongold play the demo confirmed to me that even sharing a server with a streamer is basically guaranteed to screw up your experience, especially since classic is highly community  based and things like world bosses and world pvp is so important.
---
I'm actually really happy about that. World chat was absolutely unbearable on some servers, but on others it was wonderful. With Blizzard rules and oversight I think it's going to be a good thing. It brings the community together and since we'll have sharding/layering that's even more important. 
---
Does he say whether that's Blizzard-implemented or will it have the limitations of a player-created chat?
---
Good bot
---
Original wow classic had paid beta as well. If you bought GameSpy service you would get access to wow beta. Source:I did it.
---
It's about what you're _not_ seeing, dude.
---
Glad they're letting us reserve names!
---
Very upset they said they're "open to the idea" of tbc and wotlk servers in the future.  I'd be much happier to see them take the OSRS route.  Time will tell.
---
People want to be annoyed at something
---
Summer ends September 23, so they got in with almost a month to spare.
---
I've waited years man, I can handle couple hours on a queue too
---
It takes a long time to regress huh
---
If you're a rising college junior or senior and not doing an internship in the summer, you're likely to fall behind your peers come graduation, at least on paper.
---
Call that /r/gatekeeping, but I've done *many* *many* *many* interviews of college kids and the ones with hands-on, real world experience run circles around the rest.
---
Also: go ahead and queue up the IASIP gif of "Let me go get a job from the job tree." Yes, I know internship aren't always easy to get. If you're free during your summer and didn't land anything (or your internship is garbage), **try** to apply your knowledge to something in the real world. Invest that time now!
---
2017: no sharding whatsoever
---
2018: sharding for launch week only
---
2019: layering (new designation for sharding) during Phase 1 (about 6 months I guess)
---
Wait weren't we supposed to have an authentic Classic experience?!
---
Yes, I have a pretty big group of friends both IRL and from the internet. We plan on making a small guild and probably raiding later on with our 15 man core. I know that I'm not alone in that sense. Being in the same "layer" as your guildmates seems like a pretty ideal way to play the game don't you think?
---
Just let the game be crowded for two fuckin weeks. It's not that bad.
---
my man
---
ye disappointed for real but a release date is closer and more informal than no release date at all so.. roll on 27/08 i say.
---
As someone who never played WoW but was often vaguely interested, do y'all think there's any value in trying out classic when it releases?

---
Blessed day.
---
The majority of the "server community" will not know each other or recognize each other, you remember interactions with a small few. The only way a server would mass know someone is if someone caused a big stink and posted about it on the forum. 
---
There's no reason to expect that you'll meet someone then never ever see them again, thinking about it this way is looking at it very blindly and one dimensional. The beginning phase of wow is not going to be a large community building period, if you think it is well then that's too bad for you. The real community will be when the normies start making it to 60. You'll see them again no matter what.
---
Not to mention you should be mad that the population of these servers are going to be much larger than vanilla as well since that has just as big as a role in community as layering does. Remember people aren't going to act the same as they did when vanilla was released, you're not going to have the same amount of interactions as you did.

Layering is sharding.
---
Shaman debuffs aren't really that meaningful, honestly. The 16-slot change affected SPriests the most of all hybrid specs and also made Warlocks more viable with multiple instances of Corruption. Windfury in Classic is an enchant-overriding weapon buff, not a debuff. And yes, if you had good gear you could theoretically "one-shot" someone with bad gear. Many burst combos can do that.
---
I was surprised. Level 42 prot pally in 5 1/2 days? Not too bad, haha.
---
Yes, there will be shamans in classic wow.
---
You will not be disappointed today then
---
Is there any way you could make something to fit 5760x1080?  If not, I'll just have the same on all 3 monitors.
---
The eitth of... what exactly is the month number 27?
---
I think people are just bummed because summer would have been the perfect time for a lot of them to really sink their teeth into WoW and get a head start when they have less school obligations.
---
30 here and doing the same.
---
Well, I resubbed myself, but I'm pretty sure beta characters won't transfer over to the actual live game... never heard of a beta that works that way, anyway

What are you even talking about? He streamed private servers against Blizzards will forever before he was finally banned.

More like an upset stomach, the kind I need some pepto with. I might have a little bit of the squirts a little later because I am having to swallow all this fubar but true news. But, thank you for your concern. 
---
As far as whether or not this is a dealbreaker, it's not, but it dramtically decreases my interest in general, but more specifically, in PVP. 
---
Cross realm BG's ensures that rank is tied to hours spent in WSG.
---
Soon(tm)
---
I wonder if auction houses will be linked. That would create an interesting dynamic. If they are linked, then the auction houses would be flourishing. But at the same time, you wouldn't feel like you could control any part of the market anymore. You're dealing with people you can't physically influence anymore.
---
or have names be reserved across all realms of the region on creation. So every name will be unique and merges will be completely unproblematic.
---
That’s a gross oversimplification, but whatever some of you people will complain about anything.
---
In PvE Enhancement shamans aren't a thing really. You cant even Stormstrike because of the debuff limit. Ocassionally a raid might bring one if they have Nightfall.
---
In PvP Windfury will still work like a slot machines so sometimes you can just one shot melt people with it.
---
Respawns were definitely multiple minutes long and Nostalrius also had 5x the population classic wow layers will have so I think it's fair to say it evens out at the very least.
---
When a realm adds layers, because the playerbase gets to high a percentage of the playerbase will be splitted into a new layer.      
---
The new layer will still stay in the same realm and people in the realm layer can play together.      
---
After the playerbase drops down the layers CAN be removed by blizzard and the playersbase will merge together again.     
---
     
---
Its basicly dynamic* sub-realms connected inside one realm.     
---
*controlled by blizzard
---
Your logic makes no sense. Because they are already playing 14 hours, they're all definitely going to be fine with playing 17 hours?
---
Each layer is 3000 people, nearly the same as the max for a server back in the day. This will not help congestion it seems. You might have 500-1000 fewer people concurrently on any given layer compared to a Vanilla server. From what I've read, vanilla servers were dynamic and could handle a max of 3.5-4k. Maybe 160 fewer people per starting zone, average. Obviously it's not exact as some races are going to be more popular, but it's not that much of a difference either way.
---
Tool?
---
didnt take long for a world of warcraf announcement in 2019 to turn into a spiteful nerd disaster
---
That's exactly the kind of launch I want.
---
I mean you may not be able to. It’s a function of the number of players in a zone when you enter it if I guess correctly. Theoretically you could run back and forth across the border between say Redridge and Elwynn but if the player number hasn’t changed drastically it’s highly likely you’ll just keep jumping into the same layer you just left.
---
Or people don’t like sharding and layering. That probably seems like the more reasonable conclusion.
---
omg can anyone edit this!! i have no clue how to do this haha
---
They saidt hey would keep the player locked in the same layer, unless that player joins a guild or a party in which case the player will be prioritized to that certain layer.
---
It's actually drastically different...
---
You're not getting thrown in different shards everytime you go to a different zone, and everyone in your layer is  following that rule too... You won't see people randomly dissappearing at all 
---
The only real question is will layers share chat, and if you invite a group of 4 into a capped layer what will happen
---
Dear God megathread
---
Well, that seems like an inordinate amount of time beyond 'the beginning' of the launch.

Not really, theres still plenty of people to play with.

Any word on when beta invs are going out?
---
By 1.12 I think so
---
You can no longer access a raid, a bunch of dungeons, an entire faction/mount group, etc.
---
What do you mean character portrait as raid frame? This was never a thing in Vanilla. The party frames still have the character portrait though.
---
Except it’s not, if you read/watch the information that’s been provided to us.
---
The fact that you're required to have an active sub to play the beta AND get your name later is SO fucking stupid.
---
Will auction houses be shared?
---
"nO oNe WaNtS tO pLaY oLd CoNtEnT"
---
This will be abused to hell and back again. People will switch Shards to level faster, avoid PvP and farm more efficiently!
---
He's like the Trump of this comment thread. While he may make a good point every once in a while, it's made completely null and void by some out of touch bullshit.
---
105 days til launch.  
---
130 days til the community finds something to complain about.
---
WoW is too popular and changed too much to have the same system they have in OSRS
---
1) I made a meme. That is not crying. 
---
2) it’s certainly not unreasonable to hope for a mid summer release.  I hoped for as early a release as possible. 
---
It just seems like many people are acting like blizzard straight lied to us and that is simply not the case. People made assumptions and those assumptions turned out to be incorrect.
---
HERE WE FUCKING GOOOO!
---
As a 31 year old with a full time job I’m sad I only get to play 6 hours a day.
---
Yeah, Xrealm BGs in phase 6 please, not a god damn moment before.
---
You misunderstand. All layers except one will be removed meaning that if you have 20k people spread out over 10 layers they will all have to fight over a single 2k layer once phase 2 goes live.
---
Not guaranteed to change. You can always invite/join others to change to their layer. Changing layers/not being on the same one wont matter until later anyways.
---
Haha, good for you. I've only ever \[seriously\] played Warriors. I keep telling myself to playing something else, but I can't. I'll play a random class for a couple days after launch and end up crawling back. I'm not even kidding myself this time.
---
Of course they will. Even private servers run multiple expansions and have enough population.
---
that makes no sense.  If the enemy raid was on another layer, you would not see it and you would not form a counter raid...  your faction bros and sisters on THAT layer will counter raid it..  
---
Just see each layer as a different 'server.' you socialize with the people on your 'server' (layer)  but the only difference is that if you really want you can contact people from other layers of your world-system, which you only want if they are real life friends that happen to be on a different layer.
---
what makes you think blizzard's infrastructure can handle big populations? The whole point of their sharding/layering is to deal with the fact that their servers are not built for those huge populations anymore
---
Which patch 1.12 had and I'm damn glad they are going with that option since it dilutes the chance of matching with a premade repeatedly.
---
You only need an active subscription to play Classic.
---
I love how this thread has more comments than the one in /r/wow
---
Hopefully the tech is in full swing for the beta tomorrow and we can test this stuff!
---
Remember to put aside some gold for the mats to make your Hand of Rag too.
---
Agree, the hype is real and a lot of people will quit classic after 3 months and blizzard is going to have to find a way to handle the demand at launch with the reality of population drop 3 months down the road. My guess is they will just combine realms but I'm sure they have a plan and no matter what that plan is it's gonna piss someone off
---
From what I understand, everything will be the same. The only difference being that once server reaches cap, instead of a queue, you will be placed onto a different layer. You will still see the same General/Trade chat, auction houses, etc,.
---
Could be wrong but I hope to god I'm not.
---
Love how much they're listening to the community. I'm interested to see how the debate on layering goes. Personally, I think it sounds better than sharding as it's less jarring and it should allow the servers to feel really alive as a new layer is created only after the previous layer is filled. I'm glad the layers collapse after phase one however.
---
They took steps backwards from BC on.
---
The problem is building a server community is impossible when the "server" is constantly shifting.
---
The community is the biggest appeal to Classic, why are we forced to wait 1-6 months after launch to actually start building it?
---
Yep, you’ll need a subscription to play. It’ll cost $15/month, or slightly cheaper if you buy more months at a time.
---
You either get same server layer for 2 months or 15 hour ques. Pick one.
---
Logical discussion dies every time someone uses the word "agenda" like it's something nefarious
---
Blizzard never has a clear time limit on anything.
---
You think people care? If they can spend $15 for even a chance, people are stupid enough to do it.
---
everyone knows actual summer months are june july august
---
Oh, fuck off you hopeless contrarian. "Be happy we got a release date." They literally have to tell us when they are releasing it at some point. IDGAF about the fact that information was released today instead of a week from now. I only care that they hyped it up as a "Classic Summer" then revealed that it won't actually be available during what almost all people would refer to as summer.
---
It's lurking around the sub somewhere. Tips did an interview where devs confirmed.
---
That was my goal, 20-25. It's been years since I've done vanilla leveling, I've forgotten pretty much everything.
---
Yeah I agree with you.  Like a lot of players I love the feeling of getting everything in a game and one of my favorite parts of any MMO is collecting, be it gear, achivements, or in this case pets.  Knowing that I can't even if I wanted too just feels like shit.
---
Did that guy on a hunger strike already die?
---
Except it's not like playing on a vanilla server.  There could be an awesome PvP battle happening in Hillsbrad in a different layer and you wouldn't be able to participate without being invited to a group in that layer.  It's garbage.
---
I think a lot of people misunderstand what community-voted content means in OSRS. They have such small impact on anything. 
---
It's basically a bunch of "Should be change the cost of Symbol of Kings to 100/2g from it's current 75/2g?", "Should we change the look of Helm Of Wrath to better fit the rest of the set?" type of questions.
---
There isn't a "What content should be build next? The Emerald Dream, Kara Crypts, or Mount Hyjal?" kind of question.
---
What you're talking about is sharding right? If i'm not mistaken they said layering will be continent wide so once you login, you'll be but in a layer and stay in that layer until you reload the continent.
---
I also assume they'll merge layers if the populations get to low.
---
You won't be forgotten, brother.
---
most are pretty chill on the first few days but I've certainly had classes that start pretty rough within the first week. I dunno maybe it's different in Sweden

I actually think the main reason behind the name reservation is so that they can get a rough idea of numbers they should expect so they know how many servers they need. Usually they'd get this information via preorders, but there's no game to preorder.
---
Never seen this level of cry baby piss pants before. It’s wild.
---
Are graphics updated? I was under impression they were old-school.
---
Didn't they say it was just for the first few levels? I mean just imagine coldridge valley tring waiting for those stupid baskets to spawn with a respawn of 5 min each?
---
Where was this said?
---
When you put it that way, sure, but I'd totally spend hundreds of euros for a chance to play Star Wars Galaxies (released in 2003)  again on stable servers with a decent population.
---
Good games don't get too old.
---
Yes. The subscription covers both Classic WoW and Retail WoW.
---
For the people complaining it didn’t come out during the summer when they “have so much free time”, it probably doesn’t differ very much.
---
This was always my understanding, I'd rather be able to enjoy the launch without lag so there was gonna be some sharding/layering but once the first couple weeks or months pass it goes back to like it was in vanilla
---
It has little to do with money and everything to do with not having 500 people competing for level 2 wolves in Dun Morogh.
---
Plot twist.... he's actually one of the people that went to the media day in Irvine last week, and knew 100% we'd have a release date today.
---
Expand on this a bit for me. 
---
Are you saying he is completely feigning excitement for Classic?
---
It's not like layering is a completely one sided issue in the community either. There are tons of people on this sub that think sharding / layering is a necessary evil. Are they all shills too?
---
It's not even in the realm of possibilities in your mind that he's expressing his opinions autonomously?
---
Vanilla wow wasn’t like retail. You may not get to experience everything. Matter of fact only a small portion of the population saw all of Naxx. That is the way it should be though. Everyone shouldn’t be able to experience everything just for existing. As you said you can still get those pets if you want to shell out the money. Those people spent extra money back then and they were the only ones that had the pets.
---
Months
---
i don't understand why anyone would want to play this
---
You are nicer than me
---
Summer is 3 months long.  June 21- July 21   July 21-Aug 21 Aug 21-Sept 21.  It was already know/assumed from a sales call it would not be released in Q2, April/May/June.  The earliest it was ever coming was July,  I get people who have school are upset but you played yourself thinking it would come sooner vs later.
---
If rather have layering then 6 hours of que and not being able to play.
---
Most of us don't care about a little bit of temporary inconvenience if it means having a cohesive game world, you half wit.
---
50,000 bot system osrs
---
Yup. I can tell you that summer is OVER on the last day of August here in Finland lol.
---
blizzard has spent the last few years refining tools to import their old data and easily churn out previous expansions, you're absolutely kidding yourself if you think they arent coming
---
Phase away from you for the first two zones... which high time players will be out of by the end of their first day of play. Layering is absolutely worse.
---
No, you could only get the ilvl 251 tier 10 for badges. Good fucking luck getting that from just the daily though haha.
---
Server crashes are the vanilla launch experience. #nochanges
---
Not guaranteed to change, but possible to change. Do you really think all 3000 people will always be on the same layer all the time? You really don't think there's going to be shifting around on a daily basis?
---
I think it sounds good in that there won’t be waiting lines for spawns, but what if I want to play with my friends? I hope there’s a way to level with them, especially since we’ve got more than 5 wanting to play.
---
wait what? how can u reserve a name if the game isn't out yet?
---
Light forged Draenei Mechs. It’s their version of goblin shredders.
---
So you are you saying that you are ok with either massive initial queues (far too many players on one realm), or normal queue times initially but dead servers a month later?
---
You can change layer by grouping with someone on a different one.
---
Chat channels and auction house will be server wide. Would bet my first born son on it.
---
It wont be constantly shifting. It's not like the game/servers are going to go out of their way to make sure you go to a different layer than you started on. If anything, it seems like it will try to keep you in the same one. You can also friend/invite/join people and change layers if needed to group up.
---
This is The Undercity and Thunderbluff for me. Capital cities being completely empty is depressing.
---
Curious what degree you got.
---
Think of all the people you wont meet while you're stuck in a log-in queue?
---
Discoteca, muñeca, la biblioteca
---
Es en bigote grande, perro, manteca
---
The only change to content they've said they've been open to is post Naxx. Either they'll do nothing, move to aBC, or create new post Naxx classic content
---
Dev mentioned beign 'stickied' to a layer, so it's likely assigned on first login, not subsequent. One AH cross layers was also mentioned.
---
If chat will be layered as well  the only way to switch layers will be to be invited by a friend on a different layer.  Forming groups through chat or world chat would not switch your layer.
---
Damn. Sorry man. You'll find a new wife, I'm sure.
---
Most likely no.
---
If you listen to the exact sentence after he uses the word "stickied" he clearly clarifies that they'll try to keep you in the same layer during a single session, he made no implication that that would persist through logout/login.
---
Streamers  who got to test the beta already are doing the number crunching as we speak and there are lots of little surprises so I'm sure over the next week we'll finally get some realistic data that is interpreted for the plebs like myself
---
Big oof
---
Will we see the loot bug again?
---
Well nost was not the true vanilla experience. True vanilla didnt have 10k people, didnt have people spamming global chat, didnt have dynamic respawns which nost did. 10k people would be horrible in a real vanilla realm.
---
What I like about BFA is the voice acted parts, that reads to you while you are moving between quest places, meaning I personally got to experience more of the "RP" elements.
---
Both have their pros and cons.
---
My point obviously is still applicable. Cry baby piss pants, addicted to outrage.
---
Layering is only temporary to help with the huge influx of new characters that will be created at the start. I bet most of the retail WoW playerbase will create a character and level up just a little bit even if they don't plan on going all the way to lvl 60. Layering helps prevent the first few days/week of WoW from being a terrible experience.
---
There are far more players that know about and will likely play Classic WoW in the first week than there was back when WoW was released.
---
What I am worried about is the rank 14 grind. Back in vanilla, there would be downtime for BGs (when the premades are sleeping) With Xrealm BGs, there will be games going 24/7 and the only way to get rank 14 will be to account share.
---
Same brother. People saying otherwise just aren’t trying. I can see being okay with Cs and having the free time to play wow lmao. But with a full time job you work 8 hours with maybe 1-2 hours commute at worst. Still leaves a bunch of time
---
So Blizzard decided to unprecedentedly fuck us on this one
---
[You'll be able to reserve names on Aug 13](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) \- character name info near bottom
---
aaand it's gone
---
Oh how did we ever cope when vanilla wow was released....
---
Cooldown? Iirc only tranquility had a cooldown. If you mean when they are out of mana that makes sense.
---
According to streamers, this layering will be around depending on circumstance. If the launch goes smooth then only for the first few launch days or for the first few weeks or for phase 1 after server populations settle in.
---
I'm ok with it as long as it's not a forever thing or sticking around any longer than it needs to.
---
There are people who are blowing this way out of proportion. It's a game. If you don't like it then go some where else. This isn't your game. Grow up.
---
"your" being who ever this is pointing fingers at. You know who you are.
---
Which means we’ll always have to be in the same group to see each other, which kinda sucks. Hopefully layering doesn’t go on for too long.
---
I think the difference is the amount, I would love to spend the same amount as those people did in the months before they got to play.  I also love that people don't get to experience everything in vanilla wow but to not even have the chance is what feels bad.  I can reasonably spend a lot of time and get a ton of friends and devote my life to being a scarab lord.  There is like 0.00001% chance I get it but it is possible.  There is no world where I get 8000$ for a chance to get scammed on ebay to get 3 pets.
---
&gt; because its biased towards putting you into lower population layers.
---
Oh? Did I miss something?
---
Also, the world pvp/bosses will not be until Phase 2, which is when you really need to start worrying about a server community. Obviously it's not perfect, but it's better than straight up sharding.
---
&gt; The classic team has proven that they want it to be vanilla experience
---
And sharding/layering is antithetical to that.
---
&gt; if the layers are big enough it wouldn't change anything.
---
Really?  So if an adjacent layer has an awesome PvP battle going in in Hillsbrad but you can't participate because you're not in that layer and nobody is inviting you to a group in that layer, that's a good "vanilla" experience?
---
He’s a fucking streamer dude.  Everything they do is fake as fuck.  Monkeys dancing in the circus for the audience.
---
I’m saying he has been doing nothing but pro Blizzard shilling recently, specific to classic and the way Blizzard is handling it.
---
Show me him criticizing it.
---
Yea that’s what I’ve seen. Which is fine, I’m not looking to raid with this char at all
---
Ehh, they most likely didnt run into any bugs, they just needed to not collide with the 8.2 release, to make those extra bucks on the people that would otherwise unsub after the content runs out. They probably knew it already during the announcement that it was going to be August/September.
---
Maybe not switching zones, but how about logging out and back in? Will I see the guys I was leveling before or potentially a whole new server of players. I think this could be a huge community hit for months... the important time when the community is building. Well basically have to wait until phase 2 now for who you see to stabilize.
---
It opens up a huge can of worms across the whole world. I want to know how it impacts AH, chat, rare spawns, grouping, friends, resources.. etc. A million freaking problems potentially arrive with this approach over a simple sharding for first starter zones... which would last a day or less for most in this sub.
---
They are "rewinding" to the last patch of Vanilla WoW, 1.12.1.
---
However, they have stated in interviews they aren't oppposed to the idea of adding content later on. This could be done by commitee but we have yet to see. I'm pretty pumped about it.
---
In other words, when it's released.
---
Exactly, I think I might have come across as not liking layering but I think it should be really good for the game.
---
You've clearly never played on one of the large Vanilla pserver on launch week - horrible horrible experience, nearly unplayable except for 10% of players ahead of everyone.
---
In the US I'd say most people consider summer to be over at the end of August. I'm willing to bet the same people saying summer ends on the 23rd of September don't wait till December 21st to start claiming it's winter.
---
And that's exactly why you won't get an invite. You're not a loyal customer.
---
Blizzard is rewarding the people who stuck with them through the shitshow known as BfA with (potential) beta invites. I support companies that treat their loyal customers well.
---
Tips didn't mention whether or not it would be played generated or actually implemented by Blizzard. He also did not make comment if it would work between different layers on the same realm.
---
They going to setup a classic server ? is that all there is to it  ?
---
That can easily ruin world pvp and server economy if its possible to exploit it :D
---
absolutely
---
Not true. If you leave a party on retail you can find yourself on separate shards again in just a few minutes and can hop again. Especially between RP realms and non RP realms, since RP realms have no cross realm stuff besides with other RP realms.
---
I'm really happy it's August, away all July on holiday!
---
Apparently quoting someone means you can make up whatever you want now.
---
The idea was that people would be playing Classic over the summer.
---
Not that you'd have "2 weeks" of summer remaining while it becomes available to play.
---
But this does play in my favor as a office white collar worker. Now I can actually have a summer and get a tan then play classic when the weather slowly becomes shite.
---
As I said you don't have to download a CD timer or raid frames, it's gonna be in Classic.
---
Say that to people obtaining a grad school degree.
---
This aged well
---
I don't think the point of the beta is to get a ton of people playing though. They needed to gate it somehow any way you cut it.
---
&gt; Why do people look for shit to get angry about?
---
Is this your first day on the internet? :P
---
Though i guess i still dont blame you for wondering...
---
&gt;There isn't a "What content should be build next? The Emerald Dream, Kara Crypts, or Mount Hyjal?" kind of question.
---
Not entirely true; those questions are brought forward by either developer or community suggestion by the weekly Q&amp;A streams. Those suggestions are then polled.
---
Private servers also implement dynamic respawns to compensate for the high pop.  Blizzard servers will not.  I'm sure you'll change your tune when you realize most mobs in vanilla were on a 5 minute respawn timer.  Private server pop with no dynamic reapawns?  Youd never make it out of the starting area.
---
Also remember that the very elite players on the server, who are the very vocal minority, are usually in a high end raiding guild and they can claim that they are the best guild on their faction. When you merge this is threatened and suddenly all your achievements are undercut from people who had an entirely different pool of raiders to take from and potentially had an easier or harder time getting their loot which either trivializes or diminishes your own achievement. On top of that servers tend to have different economies. What can be rare and expensive on one server's auction house might be underpriced or overpriced on the other. This has real time effects on a servers eceonomy and again the people who play the AH the most are going to be hit the hardest and be the vocal minority on this matter.
---
&gt; My concern is how it affects farming and crafting. Ex: an enchanter stuck on a low-pop layer might have difficulty finding customers, so they try to switch to the high-pop layer.
---
On retail with sharding trade chat is still realmwide/realmbound. General chat is unique to each shard though. 
---
&gt;Or if you're trying to farm herbs, you want to switch to the lowest population layer.
---
Not necessarily, you want the layer with the least people in the zone you're in, which is very difficult to know. 
---
&gt;People post in guild chat "NEW LAYER JUST OPENED UP. Everyone go farm before it gets picked over!"
---
How would they know that though? you can't just assume it's a new layer because you don't see anyone around you.
---
Literally this. Acknowledging that Classic is its own alternate timeline which allows us to add unique content with Vanilla's design philosophies would be amazing.
---
No one really knows. Ion alluded to 200 shadow resistance boss fights. Sure will suck for warlocks.
---
What it means overall, we don't know.
---
maybe we are at birth seperated twins?!
---
That would be awesome
---
lol me. its gonna be super tough going back on the 2nd as well
---
Dang. I was hoping fir a Classic summer.
---
Thats just one layer to her
---
Good answer. I guess maybe to hone in on my intentions for wanting to complete all the quests is that I want to A) absorb the Warcraft world prior to Cataclysm's changes and B) absorb as much of any storylines that are in the game pre-Cata also. That may or may not reduce the amount of time, not sure. My initial guess was that I would at least need to play both a horde and an alliance character.
---
....why would you do that when we had no date yet? 🤔
---
I don't get it. As realms shrink or grow, adding and removing layers allows them to always feel populated, but not crowded. 
---
What's not to like?
---
Imagine being this meticulous.
---
Cow girls are best, BiS dance.
---
What people don't seem to realize is:
---
1 - Your layer changes every time you login.  
---
2 - Your layer changes every time you change continent.
---
In terms of how long this lasts.. all they've said so far is that it won't be in phase 2.  So it could potentially be all of phase 1.... which is quite a long time.
---
&gt; servers are entirely virtualized now
---
I think Blizzard Activision can afford bare metal servers this time around...
---
Yeah compared to what they wanted (PRISTINE REALMS??? WOW TOKEN?? HEIRLOOMS?) it basically IS no changes at that point. You just need something to complain about right?
---
They’ll likely always have a Classic only server without the addictions
---
It's not as fun when I have to explain it.  I meant druids should never DPS because they have heals without CDs.
---
If it worked as an overflow then you would have 3k in one layer and a 100 people in the next if it worked like that then they just created an empty world. It can’t work as an overflow otherwise you would have complete imbalanced layer composition. If it is not an even distribution then you’re going to have complete population imbalance worse than sharding.
---
Ya, um, bro!. If you log in @ 3pm on the 27th, you will be 24hrs behind.
---
Thank you
---
Hi, /u/Toto1191
---
When does school start in your country ? Honestly curious, here in austria it starts on 7. Sept.
---
The people complaining are the turbo nerds who sit in basements playing video games from 3pm to 5am every day when they get home from college and whine about not having time to study or work.
---
Yeah ima let them iron out any queue times and latency bugs on  the 26th and 27th (east cost USA gets it at 6pm on the 26th.)
---
I will be taking 28th, 29th, and 30th off and I have a payed day off because September 2nd is a holiday.
---
What they mean is "the release date isn't during my summer break from school, no fair"
---
Great comment.
---
You smoking crack bro
---
&gt; These same people forget Vanilla never experienced the starting zone bottleneck that a Classic launch is about to present.
---
Lol, what?  Clearly you weren't around in 2004.
---
August 30th
---
I ordered this and then canceled as soon as I realized it had nothing to do with Classic WoW. It is just a Blizzard/WoW anniversary thing. Nothing about it has anything to do with classic WoW at all.
---
That was my Internet Overreaction (Mis)Interpretation.  
---
Honestly a "reset" could have potential if handled correctly.  They could fix a lot of issues that were created from poor precedents being set with expansions.  Leveling, Skills, Stat inflation, talent, class development, have been constant issues.  They've done a lot of things right, but a lot of foundation elements of the game are readjusted every expansion and a reset could give them a way to re-approach these issues with a more sustainable/controllable model.

What is layering I keep hearing about.  At work cant read stuff. Doing this quick before some one sees
---
That's our culture, now. We have to get all angry about things. We have to watch YouTubers get red-faced and cuss up a storm, "FUCKING VAGINA FUCK SHIT PISS THIS AND THAT" to get satisfaction. We need to go to the streamers altar and pray long and hard for them to scream in rage at a developer because the game doesn't cater to their personal, fledgling business model. That, or we have to be Asmongolds and Preaches where we make half hour, quiet, upset rants about how the game fucking sucks, Blizzard fucking sucks, everything fucking sucks, we can't be happy because life fucking sucks, etc.
---
I don't even know. It seems, just like IRL, people aren't happy unless they're unhappy.
---
Let's see how badly they butcher this. I mean, all they needed to do was open servers with code for those patches, but nah, they wanted to go rewrite stuff. RIP.
---
Okie dokie 
---
Declining to continue to pay 15$/month for a subpar product is not disloyal
---
But, whatever you say, friend
---
No, the AH will be server wide as will chat.
---
Or maybe that wont be the case, and lets assume we play on Balnazzar, it starts with 5 layers, and gradually they merge them. Do we end up with  overpopulated servers, big queues or simply they will make 3 layers instead of 5?
---
I don't think they will simply cram everyone into one place or introduce 2 hour queues. Then again, i also don't see them just getting rid of layers. Balnazzar might have 10k people and Stormscale might have 2k. If they open free transfers, this might help but simply "merging" these layers might not work very well.
---
So I'm bummed about layering, but to those who are also bummed let me say this
---
If you have a large group of people playing, get on discord, make a raid group, invite everyone. This should get you with all your people on the same layer, and then I'm assuming you can break the group up and  everyone go do what they need. 
---
My big concern is that I have a lot  of friends rolling horde and my goal is to hunt them down once we all get to STV. That's really all I want for my leveling experience, and I think layering brings obvious problems to that.
---
&gt; September is when I go back to school and is the busiest time of the year for me as a teacher. I imagine it's the same for many people.
---
Maybe I'm wrong, but Classic WoW is supposed to be a **GRIND**, right? Isn't this infamous for being a game you're supposed to be occupied by for months, if not years?
---
Exactly. This choice is 10x worse than starter zone sharding.
---
Probably, but I'll be expecting some other vendors to sell them. 
---
And they will be restocking later on, from what I've heard.
---
Hilarious
---
I really can't buy into this reason because they used to do beta without the subscription requirement. It seems like if they want to test how many people are interested, they can just open it up to everyone like they do for every WoW expansion. And how are they going to know how many servers they need for all the people without a subscription who can't reserve a name or qualify for beta?
---
Thanks. That’s what I was trying to remember hahah
---
In that case Vanilla was never a clean slate, as these pets have existed since the game first launched.
---
It won't cause inflation because you'll have more demand with more people as well...
---
I got into MoP beta without subscription.
---
I dont think this problem is as big aa you make it out to be. If you like playing with someone add them to your friends list and invite them when you want to play with them,  that takes care of the problem. Sure, you cannot do that with every person you meet, but I guess you do not talk and form connections with every passerby either.
---
Just lean over the front of the bike which is how I usually ride anyway and click mobs, probably hotkey my leveling combo macro to a mouse button. 
---
So basically all you need is mouse access because you can run and click everything with just a mouse
---
I doubt kids who are in/starting college now were playing Vanilla is what I was getting at in an extreme over-exaggeration.
---
even if these are optionnal servers ? are you serious ?
---
Tips mentioned it on today's stream.
---
You are welcome to wait until next year
---
Your life is easy mate, enjoy it. I'm gonna make classic work for me on just a casual basis as I have kids and work 3 jobs 😜
---
true true
---
Because the world ends on that Tuesday and there's no other day to meetup after.
---
well, I was hoping for a July release date because I start medical school late july.... Good thing classes are pass/fail I guess.
---
What's so bad about flying mounts in outlands? The whole area was designed with them in mind. At least you still couldn't use them in Azeroth.
---
People aren't angry about Layering in itself.  Layering is actually a very nice solution to the obvious server inflation / deflation problems classic will have.  What people ARE upset at (and rightfully so) is that layers are dynamic.  Meaning you will switch layers whenever you relog and whenever you change continents.  This defeats the entire point of classic.  
---
Imagine getting on a school bus as a kid and being sent to a different school every day.  How are you supposed to build any friendships / rivalries / any memories worth a damn if you're not consistently seeing the same people?
---
Who cares
---
Take my money Blizzard
---
If you pessimist AF there isn't, if you rational then maybe, just maybe they just wanted to take some stress off the launch and make ppl secure characters so that everyone and they mother didnt have to do it at launch and thus stressing the servers?
---
And another one!
---
exactly.
---
go do your homework, kid.
---
Incorrect
---
I will reactivate my account. But! I actually still have a wow token on my char I bought cheap with ingame gold before my sub run out.
---
So idiot have to waste actual money, and in the mean time, I will slowly level a warrior or paladin to 60, use XP stop and try some classic raids maybe :)
---
you are still injecting extra black lotus and arcane crystals to the economy, so at least for me is the same shit that sharding
---
Server community you mongoloid, not total WoW players.
---
Sure, same server, but tons of players you might not see again, not even in chat, until the merge, even if both of you are being active on the server. Some players you might not see, even in chat, until the merge. In what way is that different from retail, where server communities are garbage?
---
If it's realeasing on summer, then you can have a classic summer.
---
True, I guess they could offer the pets in a revamped collectors edition but it’s also a way for timeworn fans to show off. The pets show that they have been a fan since the beginning. But I can see where it being almost impossible to get would bum people out. I guess I just see it as sticking to the “you may not get to experience everything” vanilla life.
---
 they could do things to make it happen less though. Make it so if you are in actual combat with somebody from the other faction you cannot receive invites specifically from other players in other layers. Anyway, it feels like some people maybe conflating wow with Diablo 3, where Diablo 3 has a request party invite feature and Warcraft has never had that. It's always been, you ask somebody if you can join their group so they send you an invite.
---
Because really, the only way I see it happening is if somebody knows they are in immediate Danger. If they are on a PVP server in any of the layers and they just see another faction member ride by, unless they are the most paranoid person on Earth they probably won't try to Escape to another layer. But again this just goes back to, what kind of player so mortified by PVP would roll on a PVP server?
---
Then we'll have a player do this and start to get labeled a PVP coward or something, then they might decide to make up a story. Oh I was getting trolled by 17 horde and they all just kept killing me over and over again and it wasn't fair. So I went to another layer. I foresee messy hilarious tradechat screaming.

---
Crap if its 3k per continent I wonder how many will be available to the whole server. I mean are we possibly talking 3K EK and 3k in Kali... that be 6K population before possibly seeing "layers"
---
University starts in september :) At least i get a couple of days of nolife
---
US players: sept 2 is Labor Day. Many businesses are closed. Pro tip: use your vacation the week after launch. Many of you like me get that Monday off anyway. 4 days of vacation gets you a work week off. Plus this gives the dev’s a few days to work through any technical hiccups. 
---
Personally I’m taking off the Friday after release and the rest of the week after Labor Day. 10 days off, fuck yes
---
I take my vacation every year during this week. This is most excellent.
---
For the rest of the world that's 27/08/19. It's just nonsensical.
---
My best friend always played Priest. He was able to basically farm anything he wanted to. Also, guildies and friends are almost always down to help farm stuff.
---
I did what I could to upscale it to [5400 x 2160](https://imgur.com/dHzPn8b) so if anyone wants to use it as a 4K wallpaper they can crop the width.
---
yeah but as soon as you join a group or a guild in another "layer" people start flip flopping and it becomes server transfers and sharding.
---
The old phasing debate was assuming we would have blizzlike server populations. That's not the case any more. As it stands now servers will be infinitely big at launch, and each layer will be roughly the equivalent of one server (probably). Layering does not solve the same starting zone problem as phasing would, the no-phasing guys "won" that fight it seems, an entire server worth of people in the starting zones at launch was apparently acceptable. 
---
The alternative to layering is having several separate realms that later gets merged as population drops off (which will certainly happen). Or having absolutely massive realms with dynamic respawn rates and stuff like that which is extremely unlike classic.
---
I am well aware of that, but they were not added as soon as BG's were added into the game.   He also presents a list of why cross realm things in classic take away from the classic experience, and cross realm bg's right off the hop are going to take that experience away faster than it should.
---
What exactly do you want to know?
---
I spent my college raiding MC/BWL/AQ40 and was in a top 5 US guild.
---
So much for my plan on playing this on summer break lol.
---
Yeah same, "prepare for a Classic summer", just from that statement I expected mid July at the latest.
---
But no, we'll release it the last 3 days of summer AKA practically autumn x) rip uni
---
As a new uni graduate as of yesterday. I feel like Indiana Jones’ hat after he slides under a collapsing door.
---
According to the Gregorian calendar, summer ends on September. In fact, if you Google summer it will show you the start and end date.
---
No disrespect but you've been taught poorly, it's not Blizzards problem that people assume that summer means something that isn't the official summer. I was taught differently in school. Maybe it's differences in cultures, but officially it is what it is and unofficially, based on this thread, you see plenty of interpretations. A company should follow what summer actually is.
---
Look at the top post in this thread.
---
Dude they won't hold back on releasing DM for 6 months...
---
At least phase 3 will be a long ways away!
---
I understand people's concerns about sharding/layering but IMO, would you rather not be able to play on opening day because your in a double-digit hour long queue?
---
I dont watch those people, I let the twitch kiddies weed out the interesting info for me
---
Since it's rare to get into betas you should get in first then ask around for others in the beta from your part of the world.
---
I did a d I loved it. Just sat around shooting the shit with people and messing around because I didn't want to have to fight to tag mobs but even if I did it was not that bad. Now it's going to be rush to 60 so we can quit the game, phase every zone. I'm sure I'll be able to abuse the phase system to farm rare materials anyway.
---
this pretty much sums up blizzard as a company at this point
---
I really hope they didn't spend all their time on this stupid re-release
---
Will the 3000 cap layering mean that when another layer is created, there can be another layer with 3000 people, and another with couple hundred, leaving you basically alone in the world?
---
Not sure what people were expecting...
---
After a year of not understanding the no changes people I start to see why there really is no 100% great way to lauch a vanilla server.  Personally I hate this but it doesn't matter to me as much as no collector's pets but overall I think they are making hard choices as best they can.
---
cringe
---
Can’t wait to punch a Murloc in Elwynn and get they Unarmed skill +1
---
I would have liked to get one of the unarmored Level 60 rams, horses or wolves personally but it’s not that big a loss to me. At least now I don’t have to race to 60 just to scrape enough gold together to buy one before they inevitably are removed disappear in a few months. 
---
Blood Plague and post Naxxramas content could be interesting but I’m not worried about having nothing to do. There’s so much to do in Classic anyway and I’m making one of each character.
---
Another genius reply, no one would have thought of that!
---
This is going nowhere, you're doomsdaying off little information and not actually replying to my posts.
---
This is a waste of both our time.
---
Correct! I misunderstood the wording. I still don't think it's going to be very abuse-able.
---
Then how will it work when you talk to someone on another layer through a server wide chat channel and invite them to a group, will they do what current does and phase off their layer? If that happens then it's just sharding.
---
As some with the Ivory Raptor, I'm a little sad I can't get it again. :(
---
And since they added a very similar knock-off version in retail, I can't even enjoy it there. 
---
But I'll still play tho :)
---
Well at least  you have 3 months to get rid of your family.
---
Wtf is an unarmoured mount?
---
This was a good example hahahahahah
---
Layering is the form of 'phasing' they are using for the starting zones. Thats what makes me feel that the the layering numbers will be closer to 1k
---
Yes, everyone knows the actual summer months are june july august  :(
---
&gt; It’s literally the fall.
---
Someone needs a dictionary
---
Agreed, they're trying to manage initial server loads and over crowding while at the same time creating a viable end game realm community since most of the people will probably quit 3 months in.
---
It's a hard thing to do and of course any decision they make is gonna be blown up and scrutinized from every angle but honestly I don't think these measures are gonna ruin anyone's experience.
---
So do we have to own the latest expansion or how does it work?
---
"but whatever"
---
There you go. You don't care, so you're not even considering the ramifications for players with different playstyles than yours.
---
Rare spawns, mob grinding, gank avoidance, speed leveling, node farming, etc etc.
---
It will all be affected by layer hopping.
---
And now it begins.
---
Alts, my friend.
---
Why 27? Why specifically that?
---
Omg classic Hyjal would be amazing.
---
Want to make a 3440x1440 version :)
---
One of the best world PVP'ers, battleground PVP'ers.  Needed for raids, a few specs that are viable in PvP and PvE with no respecs needed.  Required for some encounters, good farming ability.
---
Probably one of if not the most viable class when including it won't be an overpopulated spec
---
A buddy and I did this in vanilla for fun, actually: Used the tier pieces that had HP/5 and also got some other gear that had it. Spec'd into Demonology to get the Voidwalker sacrifice buff that gives you HP regen, and then put points in Affliction for Siphon Life and improving Drain Life.
---
It was pretty hilarious (and fairly effective, as I recall) in 1v1 PvP out in the world or if you could isolate a person in a BG.
---
I think it'll be 3-4 months personally, that would put the entirety of the content at 18 months - 2 years, but the possibility is there.
---
And it's more the 1 month minimum that is the problem.
---
"only"
---
&gt; To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
This seems worthy of official clarification. Does it mean you must have an active subscription to be *invited* to beta test or stress test, or does it mean, if you are invited, you must have an active subscription only to *participate* in the test? If it is the latter, that is not at all surprising, since they always said that Classic will require a subscription. I feel sub to participate, not to get an invite, is the more reasonable way to take this, but if that's correct, they should make it clear before the meltdown goes into full swing.
---
If they mean they expect people to slap down three months of game time on the remote hope of getting an invite sometime between May and July, that seems like a big fat nope the fuck out. I mean, I get that selling alpha and beta access totally is a thing now and has been for a while, but games that go that way generally guarantee test access in exchange for payment. I haven't seen any game charge a monthly sub for an auto-renewing lottery ticket. I'm not sure that no game out there has done this, but if this is what they mean, it seems like a new low on the low, low road of "early access" scams.
---
On a minor point, it also would seem like a bit of a shaft if you paid a month of sub to participate in only two days of stress testing. If they make it so that any stress test invite continues as an ongoing beta invite after the stress test is over, and you can participate in any subsequent test periods as long as you remain subbed, then that seems ok.
---
&gt;Or... you could do something like gather a group of players and all swap to another layer to pop on top of for example a raid forming in Black Rock Mountains to wipe them.
---
You think there are going to be multiple fully-formed, fully level 60 guilds ready to gank each other on their MC runs two weeks into launch, and the main problem with that scenario is simply that a non-guild raid of 40 players who were all conveniently on one layer except for one guy preparing the ambush are going to suddenly phase into one of those guilds. K.
---
&gt;And how about auction houses, will I have to keep flipping between layers to find the cheapest Edgemaster's Handguards?
---
There's absolutely no reason whatsoever why the auction house would be layered. It's the *same server*.
---
&gt;What if I have friends in all of my server's layers?
---
Then play with whichever ones are at your level in your zone. What a travesty.
---
&gt;Conveniently you leave out the most obvious solution: launch enough servers to support the population. Wow, that's what ever MMO did back in 1999-2005 and everything was fine. Strange how absolutely nothing has changed yet we have to invent new solutions huh?
---
Did you ever fucking play Vanilla Warcraft on either a high pop or a low pop server? When you needed to wait for over an hour just to get in and God help you if you ever disconnected? Or when all the low pops got so bad that Blizzard needed to forcibly merge them together, causing massive internal problems and also sparking media frenzies about how the game was dying because it couldn't support a playerbase? It's not "a few minutes" to wait. I'd take layering any day of the week over the queues I dealt with back in Vanilla.
---
I'm done with this conversation, btw. The technology is temporary and designed to fix an actually meaningful, serious issue that you've decided to pretend is a "nonexistent boogeyman". So I'm going to declare that all your concerns are also nonexistent boogeymen, since that's what this discourse has devolved to.
---
Good day.
---
I’m confused, if it’s just classic wow what do they need to test? What am I missing here...
---
They said, where needed, they'd phase inside of a layer. So opening zones will not have thousands of people.
---
I don't think group looting is in at all. Auto Loot was always a thing but you had to hold a button to make it work originally. They are just adding the option to have auto loot be the default option instead of the one you have to hold the button for.
---
I [sadly] believe a lot of these will be hitting Ebay shortly after release :(
---
Except they're not the same because you can move between layers, meaning you are hopping between different communities and different phases of resources (devilsaur for example). I would be happy if you were stuck on the layer you start in until they remove it though. That way the community and resources open to the player remain constant.
---
Thanks for the new background!
---
I hope so too, just as long as the gear doesn't become too insane in terms of stats.
---
Yep.  Though it'll be closer to that five minutes before the release.
---
Sometimes, when I'm out to dinner and my wife gets up to go to the bathroom and leaves me alone, I think that maybe I imagined her and our relationship and I am really just eating alone.  And the years spend together has all been in my head because I went insane long ago.
---
Then she comes back and I'm like "Nah, that's crazy..."
---
You have it all wrong. Classic is coming out in SUMMER
---
I laughed cause its pretty much tru.
---
I hate BFA but I can endlessly play private servers. I'm not burnt out on wow, current wow just sucks
---
Nice thing about classic, is that 8 weeks wont put you that far behind. It took me, what, 3 months to get to 60 the first time. Youll be fine
---
they are super rare mounts that were only around for a few patches before they were replaced with different models.  Kind of a reward for people that leveled up fast.
---
I ranked 14 in 2005, and my favourite part was facing people that I knew, I understand how some people may not enjoy that, but by the time Xrealm BGs were added, there was not a large amount of people pushing for rank 14 anymore (at least on my server).   
---
The addition of more servers, means games will be popping 24/7, which means the only way to obtain enough RP to hit rank 14 will be to account share.   
---
I mean I am fine with it I guess, I have 3 brothers who will play for me, but this is going to make ranking even more cancer than it was originally.
---
Take my upvote sir.
---
Isn't Ion part of the team? The guy that spearheaded BFA?
---
More power to ya mate :)
---
Work
---
This is why they have layers
---
dont forget the advantage people will have at launch because they'll have their character created and server selected already
---
What if you get ganked in SoS and never see the ganker again because the likelihood of seeing 1 guy out of thousands is extremely slim?
---
Yes, the economy will surely suffer from having 40 black lotus instead of 20. Spawn rates don’t change, people farming isn’t going to change, prices aren’t going to change for a long, long time.
---
They could also just not remove them and let people decide. The armored ones were added because people were salty about u dead having armor on their epic mounts, I don't understand why they did g just leave it as an option
---
The devs said the layers will be dynamic in [Tipsout's interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo) which means you won't be locked to a layer (since the amount of layers will vary depending on players online)
---
I've never played WoW, is classic that much better than the current WoW?
---
Not sure how it works. The senior software engineer said that it is somewhat dynamic in that if your friends invite you to a group you will go over to their layer. I believe in Tipsout interview with him he says that.
---
destroying community for the sake of convenience is the exact mindset vanilla needs, good work kiddo
---
The interview with Tips out.
---
10pm for fellow UK players
---
WHo would have thought? /s
---
Epic mounts originally looked the same as non-epic mounts. In 1.4 they updated the models to give them armor to differentiate them from non-epic mounts. Basically to make them look more epic.
---
However, they didn't change the mounts people already owned. So you could keep your original unarmored mount which became almost like a collector's item that indicated the player was a very early WoW player.
---
Unpopular opinion: I hate this date. Just use DD/MM/YY like the rest of the world ffs.
---
This really doesn't sound like it would make sense.
---
Obviously there will be load balancing. From an engineering perspective it makes no sense to sequentially cap layers.
---
Cross realm groups? Is this a thing? This is awful if so.
---
Same brother.
---
We were The Patient.
---
So now it went from "on release" to "during phase 1" or is it just me?
---
True, thankfully I'm done with that. Good luck man it's worth it!
---
I like your take.
---
&gt;You're not going to know if and when one comes up, so there will be ZERO possibility of gaming this system like this.
---
??? How will they hide it from you? If you know somebody is in the same place as you, and you don't see them, you know that you're on two seperate layers.
---
SOME CHANGES!
---
Hi, /u/Sydarmx
---
Iiirk barbaderko
---
ffs I thought this was reforge
---
you’ve gotten into every single beta ?? Wtf I’ve never got a single one. Subbed each time.
---
Exactly my thoughts lol 
---
Now I'll just move 1 or 2 weeks of my vacation time for Classic's launch and will keep the remaining 3 in the summer to enjoy it.
---
I'm against cross-server BGs but I understand why some people want it.
---
I think the problem arises on smaller servers where one side is so dominant that they just steamroll in BGs all day every day. 
---
Then if population balance is uneven, longer queue times means that the larger faction will venture out and gank everyone while waiting for their BG to pop leading to an even worse experience for the smaller side.
---
Meh.
---
It really shouldnt take that long to level up an alt expecially if you maximize your rested XP gain, but asking others to farm with or for you will probabaly lay on deaf ears.
---
Mini-me's... If you will.
---
I have always wondered what would have happened if they never raised the level cap and instead just added the new content.
---
On another note, I think I would eventually love to see some sort of "season" where players see how far they can get into the game within a certain period of time. Can a guild full clear Naxx within 6 months, start at level 1? I think that would be interesting to see and would keep things fresh IMO
---
Wrath for me is the expansion that needs major changes, the two big ones for me are no dungeon finder, and no 25/10 man version of every raid.  Also in a post classic world where anyone that wants to raid will have done Naxx, the Naxx raid in Wrath is going to suck.  Also class balance in Wrath was terrible, and was probably at its best ever in TBC, that's another thing I would want fixed, and I mained a feral druid, which was absurdly op in ICC.
---
Because of speculation and the phrase *classic summer* and the implications it carries.
---
Had they said "classic fall" I would have made different plans.
---
There is no Classic collector's edition, its a 15th anniversary collector's box.
---
Maybe it's better that it's at the end of summer. During summer I minimize my gaming time as much as possible, and enjoy outdoors activities.
---
Yes, but even the spoken part is "wrong". It makes no sense at all. It's a matter of size.
---
Days &lt; weeks &lt; months &lt; semesters &lt; year, etc
---
Saying "Month, Day, Year" makes zero sense
---
I did and ideally Blizz would just upgrade their servers, but I'd take the lag and queues over this bullshit if I had the choice.
---
I didn't expect it to ever be cross-realm, not sure why everyone was assuming that.
---
Still seems like a mistake that could show up later on (regardless what someone at Blizzard says).
---
Hahahaha "cultural coconuts" that went straight in to my personal vocabulary. It's almost like Gordon's "you doughnut!"
---
I mean you can, but you dont have to haha
---
my cousin and i got a friend to play and over the years kind of collected a group of 8 or so main people, plus dozens of other “friends of friends” that we play with somewhat regularly. the main group meets up in texas sometimes, me, my cousin, and our friend moved down here bc we always wanted to move out of our hometown and had a bunch of friends in texas, and our other friends have flown down and we’ve had little friend vacations a couple times. none of us are older than 25 but we’ve been friends for almost 10 years i wanna say.
---
wrong. You cannot play with other players from other realms.
---
It seems to me that Layering is larger-scale sharding and the only way you move from one layer to another is being invited by a friend on another layer or maybe when you log out and in again? Which makes them nearly the same as whole servers except with some minor cross realm grouping going on. Definitely a big improvement over sharding.
---
How does blizzard know when my current relationship will end? They’re wizards! /s
---
In the interview that Tips out made
---
Most people? Like 10 k? You likely won't remember them.
---
I was an original beta tester. Do I get brownie points for that?
---
Because it's too darn long
---
&gt;  but this is going to make ranking even more cancer than it was originally.
---
For sure it will for people r12+ which is going to be awesome as there will be a ton of drama about people breaking 'honor caps'. I've seen it happened on a pserver, a Chinese premade went all out and played 24/7, the QQ from the other premade was glorious.
---
That's not what it is at all. You cannot play with players from other realms at all.
---
BFA launch was butter smooth for me
---
I had an active account constantly from 2005 to 2014. Only beta I ever got was wod. Yeah I'm just gonna wait for release.
---
What you're saying doesn't make sense. Without cross realm BGs there's a high chance casuals will get STOMPED by the same premade for hours since they can only fight with the people in their realm. 
---
If you're worried about getting wrecked by a premade you want cross realm bgs, if you're going to farm for rank 14 you want cross realm BGs that way you get quicker ques...
---
Either way cross realm bgs are better.
---
Ill be seeing them again in approximately 7.5 hours!
---
So you're happy to wait in a queue for a few days before playing? Because otherwise they will need to create a ridiculous number of realms (hundreds?) which will all be subsequently emptied out by tourists and the like leaving a couple of months after launch.
---
Phase 1 is gonna be almost the entire leveling journey for most people.
---
That’s the wrong day lol
---
That's what it sounds like. 9001 people log on, you're alone in the fourth layer.
---
that’s it bubbles. YOU’RE GROUNDED!
---
Hence the multitude of comments saying Blizzard simply rebranded the tech.
---
I raid mythic/old heroic. They care about the shown skills and cleared content of beta testers quite a bit.Most people in my guilds get invites.
---
So because a cool interaction isnt guaranteed to happen (tho very likely actually because he is on the same level and going to the same zones as me to quest, there being thousands of ppl is irrelevant to the odds) we should decrease the likelyhood?
---
and what do you mean by prices arent going to change? obviously higher supply decreases the value of every item and there is also tons of ways to abuse this (invite layerhopping etc.)
---
Well realistically you will have more retail players than old vanilla players playing anyway. 
---
I agree with a BFA ONLY player will probably not see the same things a vanilla player would but i dunno how else they would make the beta exclusive to vanilla players only.
---
Layering sounds awesome to me, I hate getting ganked and stuff while leveling but I like 60 world pvp in brm and stuff like that, so this is great news to me
---
WoW so much negativity, what is this, r/wow?
---
Why Tuesday then 😂
---
Ya I read that just from your comment it sounded like I missed something somewhere about reserving names.  Either way it is a way for players to mess around with character customization and determine a server they want to go to with their friends before starting and accidentally ending up away from your group; so it is not all bad.
---
Wonderful, then that message isn't for you :)
---
&gt; The idea was that people would be playing Classic over the summer.
---
Yeah but they never said that
---
Layering is not cross-realm. You cannot group with anyone that isnt on your realm. What are you smoking?
---
Lol I get home from deployment not too long after that. Wife’s not gonna be happy
---
Fair enough, I apologize for name calling.
---
It's a good move for load issues but a bad move for server community, which is the most important factor of Classic. It's the reason people loved Vanilla, why they want it back and why they think Retail is trash.
---
Layering hurts the community. Period. The amount of hurt varies based on how they handle chat (will it all be merged?) and how often you change layers on log ins (will it only be in drastic cases or will it be every log in?), but it's still a detriment no matter how they set it up.
---
It's also lasting a minimum of 1 month, which is wayyyyy too long a time frame for the community building to be effectively on hold, and could last up to 6 months (I really doubt p2 will take that long but that's the absolute highest upper bound).
---
I'd rather Classic go through the teething pains of 1 to 2 weeks of cramped zones and login queues than having to put breaks on the most important aspect of Classic.
---
Where in the review do they say that? They specifically say that layers will not be cross realm in the same Tips Out video that I linked above.
---
Yes it will be
---
Gotta go to school to learn the difference between than and then.
---
Is there any reason why after the starting area my whole group couldn't just meet at Senjin and quest form there, even if someone is tauren/undead?
---
The same people downvoting are the same ones who won’t last past the first 2 weeks when they realize how much of a grind Vanilla was.
---
lol mine starts 2nd week october
---
would you prefer 0% of summer?
---
(or 100% of "never"?)
---
I would imagine they don't want to send an invite to those that won't play it. There is a much higher chance of the person playing if their account is active.
---
You can sub a month early to create your character on the third of August with no game to play until the 27th.
---
So just to be clear, layers are to help with initial server "boom" so people can still quest and whatnot?
---
At their date they merge them period.
---
Theres no "nuts". Even if all 3 layers were maxxed (they said max is 3k per layer) their news servers can handle 9k pops. Hell theres 20k pops on live right now.
---
So yeah, you are worrying for nothing.
---
Okay? so what, do you actually think that piling literally everyone into the zone at the same time is a good "vanilla" experience? That's how big private servers are, not how vanilla wow was. Most people aren't saying it's perfect, just that it's worth the cost to most people. Blizzard wants people to enjoy their beginning experience and be able to give it a fair shot. Having to wait 2 hours for one small quest in the starting areas is absolutely not that at all and will turn people off to the game. It would be a stupid decision from Blizz to cave in to unreasonable demands from the more hardcore #nochanges playerbase that would severely hurt the main playerbase. Vanilla sold 240k copies on release and it had many, many servers. If the layering has comparable numbers per layer to vanilla servers, then a month of that is an easy decision for Blizz.
---
The community really is the best part of the game, and as a healer you won't be short on friends.  Just get into a chill guild, build up a friends list, and you should be fine.  I like priest for everything, both pvp and pve, but if I played alliance I would go pally if I was spending most of my time in pvp .  Nothing made me focus a healer more than a good paladin.
---
I'm sure there are many like you who would roll with the bugs, but /r/wow is like 50% complaint posts about bugs at most times, im absolutely sure classic would receive the same treatment in places
---
Nice, maybe they'll demo their new song Invincible. Gratz man lol.
---
You keep posting the same thing and you are missing the point, and the point is that in vanilla the people on your server were the people you were stuck with. You would run into the same people leveling for weeks on end. Now people will be flip flopping layers. Even if it doesn't happen it better to not risk such a big change.
---
Well damn :/

I bet he plays smelly horde!

beautiful, thank you.
---
I will be 60 and in MC by the time Summer is over. Thats enough for me
---
So you want this system in so badly you're willing to subvert other vanilla systems to make it work?
---
you're either trolling or i legitimately feel bad for you
---
oh well i wont be able to play in my weeks off in july but i kept one week at the beginning of september to play. I expected the blizzard late summer announcement
---
This is factually incorrect. It has been stated they're aiming for x-realm PVP specifically in Phase 3, nothing else was confirmed.
---
I mean, From August 27th to September 23rd there's less than a month's worth of summer left. Yes it is technically "Summer." but I'm willing to bet that most people don't view late August or September as summer due to school starting back up. I've been out of college for nearly 4 years now and work your standard 9 to 5 and none of the people I interact with think of late August as actual summer.
---
Yeah, school's out. Won't be August 26th.
---
But then it's people's faults for thinking that "vacations" are the same thing as a "climatic season".
---
Are you ok?
---
The original battle for Hillsbrad will have to come back
---
There are NO cross-realm groups. The only thing that will be cross-realm will be battlegrounds in phase 3. X-realm bgs were in Vanilla around like 1.10 or something (very late vanilla)
---
What did you expect, this is blizzard.  The community is putting waaay too much faith in them.  This is just the first of many disappointments.
---
Yes but those 2-3k players can change day by day as people will not be locked to an individual layer. Therefore you might not be able to ever see that guy who ganked you in STV or that guy that you've been grouping up with for quests recently because they're both on different layers now. The community and the resources open to the player will not be constant if layering is added.
---
Oh true. I considered for that alone. I just hope people aren't baited into thinking its for classic is all. Cuz its not.
---
I hate and like that big streamers will almost definitely get into the beta.
---
Hate because it sucks that they get chosen to test the beta and most of them have no experience with Vanilla WoW - outside private servers.
---
Like because, even though they have no experience, it's quite likely people that do have experience will be watching and picking apart everything as it is streamed.
---
Giving the beta to a handful streamers with hopefully wide ranging appeal could get a lot more knowledgeable eyes on it than randomly giving out beta invites. Maybe, I dunno. I hope it does.
---
current architecture of the account from what I understand allows you to have multiple wow accounts under one blizz account.
---
BFA was relatively smooth was it not?
---
my ID was all they needed apparently. I opened a Ticket and 1hour later the GM replied that he found my old Account and added it to my current bnet Account. It really was that easy
---
Unless they have upgraded this from the system on retail I don’t buy that aspect. Retail servers can’t handle 40v40 wpvp. It’s literally impossible to make it happen - it puts so much stress on the server they move one raid to a different shard. Hopefully classic will have better infrastructure
---
I know for a fact that silithus at points will be overcrowded. The AQ gate is there.
---
Then don't put it in at all imo. Let the cream rise to the top.
---
Seems like it. Goal will be to somehow land in that few hundred layer and be free to quest without competition.
---
Don’t you guys have summer?
---
We have to sign back up for the beta, so this point is negligible.
---
Ehhhh I think this post is night and day. Tho other posts I couldn't tell if it was sarcasm or not.
---
This please....I’ve had a new account for a while.  I would love to get mine back from 2004.
---
If I could go back to the free time I had, even when double majoring compared to now. Fuckkk I would so hard.
---
Dope, all the devilsaur leather.. No mob squads..
---
I have multiple wow accounts linked to the same [battle.net](https://battle.net) account. Depending on how you do it you might need to take another step for your OS to launch two WoWs at the same time. This usually involves copying the install folder, don't think that's an issue on Windows though.
---
they said layers will be removed by phase two at the LATEST, itll probably only last for 2-3 months
---
8th of august here in Finland
---
Disagreed hard about the original 4 phase plan, sharding, and right click report.
---
get a job now - then have some time banked to take off.
---
Well as an office worker guess I can finally let my boss know when I’m taking my staycation
---
No one cares what you care about, you aren't special.
---
But that way you can't get free karma blaming "the community" like a corporate fanboy OP  just did. See, some members of the community aren't allowed to be disappointed with Blizz releasing 3 days before the actual summer ends, while they were promising "classic summer".
---
They will send you an email letting you know you were invited. It isn't an invite so much as a notification. The invite is done through the launcher.
---
I truly want you to be right
---
&gt;from your experience, what was it like when you weren’t raiding or pvping and you just wanted to go out into the world to farm, quest, or anything else?
---
I used my rogue alt.
---
&gt;i also don’t want to constantly pay a hefty fee to respec, doesn’t seem very productive.
---
Because i used an alt to farm gold, mats etc. my priest would not have to respec. 
---
&gt;and i’m wondering what healers really thrive, everyone says the generic “priest is the best” and i do somewhat enjoy playing a priest but it also seems kind of boring.
---
I think the pallies had it MUCH worse in terms of being challenged for healing.
---
Priest was great as i remember it, shields, renews, fast or slow big heals.
---
In pvp though i envyed the pallies because of the plate. 
---
If you wanna pvp on your priest, prepare to be ganked constantly unless you roll with a group or spec shadow.
---
I'm 34 with classes starting less than a week prior and in the middle of a deployment. Should I yell at kids to get off my lawn or get off your lawn?
---
Cause I got into wow when I was 9 years old
---
Just in time for my very first gaming PC build to be completed. 
---
I’ve never played at all. Now I think it’s time.
---
It's been clear for a long time that the requirement for playing classic will be a subscription to WoW, and that is it. If you have a sub, you can play classic, no matter if you have the latest expansion or not.
---
Absolutely not true, I raided all throughout vanilla, went and bought BC from a retail store on launch day and everything.
---
The community will be there after phasing ends. A good size portion of the player base won’t even be 60 by the time phasing ends. Nobody who truly cares about community is going to put this game down for taking a temporary measure to handle server load.
---
Being a vanilla baby doesn’t change that. If you can’t find community in the potential 3,000 players playing with you during the layering phase, you probably never will.
---

---
HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPPPPE
---
“little bit” “inconvenience” lol yeah ok you’re very rational
---
“half wit” lmaoo what in the world
---
It's a lot easier to jump channels in Maplestory too, I don't foresee layering to be a big problem, and think it's a pretty cool idea as a compromise from sharding.
---
They will survive but will experience a watered-down version of the classic experience similar to how retail is a watered-down version of the overall WoW experience.
---
From a technical perspective, it's brilliant and does its job perfectly. Unfortunately, it comes at a heavy cost to user-experience as it redacts from the community server feel that is core to what made WoW an amazing game.
---
There are many great ideas on paper that solve problems but when it reduces the quality of the product, they should be flushed out.
---
delete
---
I am seriously pissed off about this. #GIVEUSIVORYRAPTORS
---
Literally everyone?
---
Disagreed. A "casual" will take far longer than a month. And they never even said it's 100% a month. Just however long it takes. Could be just a week of layering.
---
They also said sharding only in the starter zones at first - they do whatever fills their pockets best - fuck the customer and what he wants for an MMORP experience :D
---
Very true, I dabble in a bit of alliance, but ultimately at my core I’m a horde player. It just feels wrong to me when I play alli. Loktar homie.
---
Get offf my lawwwwn!
---
Layers are tied to a server, so you're never going to be on a layer with people from another server.  With that being said, it seems sensible to have chat channels tied to layers so that you're only talking to those you're able to interact with.  Otherwise you'd see exponentially more people phasing in and out between layers and a make abusing layers much easier.
---
yeah, understandable
---
Did PvP servers play non PVP servers? Don't remember
---
If it functions like retail, main capitals are not sharded.
---
Yeah! Just enough to scratch the itch lol
---
Layering is basically, instead of a queue when your server reaches cap, you will simply be placed onto a different layer. From what I understand so far, you will still be able to use the same General/Trade channels and Auction House as the rest of your realm.
---
You won't see people from other servers running around, or be able to play with your friends on different servers. After P1 is over, they will merge all these layers into one server, just like Classic.
---
What condition do you have ?
---
I need everyone to understand something. There is no perfect solution. Blizzard is looking at the issue of launch expectations from a realistic perspective and trying to make sure servers A) launch without a ridiculous amount of performance issues and 5 hours long queues, and B) make sure server populations stay healthy beyond the first weeks/months of Classic WoW. 
---
**Option 1 - no layering/sharding**
---
100 servers with a population hard-cap of 3000 are created on launch day with multiple new servers added over the first few weeks to accommodate the high influx on players trying out Classic WoW. 1-3 months after release there are now 150 servers from launch, but the player number has dropped significantly, maybe by as much as 200%. 
---
The launch experience included 5 hour long queues, the starting zones were an absolute shitshow where it took you 15 hours to get to level 10, and another 48 hours to hit level 25. 
---
Now, at day 90 after launch, your server has an average of 1000 players online, down from the original 3000 players. This number will only get worse over time. 
---
**Option 2 - layering**
---
40 servers with a much higher population hard-cap of 9000/12000 are created on launch day, with multiple new servers added over the first few weeks to accommodate the high influx of players trying out Classic WoW. 1-3 months after release there are now 60 servers from launch, and the player number has dropped down significantly, maybe by as much as 200%.
---
The launch experience had no queues, the starting zones were still a shitshow but to a lesser extent because of layering where it took you 8 hours to get to level 10, and another 24 hours to get to level 25. 
---
Now, at day 90 after launch, your server has no layering and an average of 3000 players online, maybe there's a tiny 10 minute queue or maybe you're lucky and there are rarely queues. This will drop over time, but likely not below 1500/2000 players even a year after launch. 
---
**Pick your poison**
---
Sounds about right
---
I’m in my final semester of my finance degree taking 6 upper level finance classes. I won’t have time lmao
---
please no scaling, please.
---
Itll be manageable though. I was there for the Darrowshire launch. 6k people online, it took hours to get out of the starting area instead of minutes.
---
Max Layer pop is 3000 split between horde and alliance. This will make it HILARIOUSLY easier to quest. Itll still be packed as shit, but you will be able to progress.
---
WOD IS COMING POGGERS
---
only small beta for "influencers" aka streamers like asmongold

You had my upvote until is read that rude edit. Take note kids, this is a perfect example of how you shoot yourself in the foot after making a profound statement.
---
Hi, /u/Tjazwow
---
I'd love the original mounts too!
---
Dead inside squad reporting in kill me
---
&gt;you could switch layers easily to avoid being corpse camped
---
 Pray tell, how does one do that?
---
I'd like to know more about skunks.
---
Question:  if you type in trade chat, will only your layer see it, or all the layers for that realm?
---
Or when you do /who Desolace what will come up?
---
14 years later. The dream continues.
---
You said you wanted to make money??? Rofl
---
I got the J6 guys to hook me up with a router directly above my bunk in Iraq.
---
Yeah it sucks

Tfw people forget classic wow sucked
---
Ugh.
---
Well, there goes WoW Classic. *shrug*
---
&gt;Part of the ~~fun~~ experience
---
Oh great tool the band who makes me wanna put a screwdriver in my head. They one good song problem is that every song is the same.
---
My server only had a 2:1 imbalance but queues still took 45m+ even during prime time sometimes. Really lame because you'd just end up against premades with good gear and voice chat anyway.
---
Instead of having 30% reasonably fun or balanced games on retail you'd get 5%
---
Orgrimmar snakes here, we would like a word with you.
---
Oh snap, i didnt think this was possible, gonna try and see if they can find my first vanilla account from the dust.
---
I guess you will have to grow up a few months earlier.
---
Well, duck for you I guess. For me it's perfect, because I needed to put in vacation days for summer months ago. I'll be able to schedule vacation days now! :)
---
&gt; Okay? so what, do you actually think that piling literally everyone into the zone at the same time is a good "vanilla" experience?
---
That _is_ the vanilla experience.  Sharding/layering didn't exist in WoW until many years later.
---
&gt; Having to wait 2 hours for one small quest in the starting areas
---
Having participated in most private server projects released in the past half-decade, I can safely say that no starting zone quest ever took me anywhere near this long.  Even at launch.
---
&gt; It would be a stupid decision from Blizz to cave in to unreasonable demands from the more hardcore #nochanges playerbase that would severely hurt the main playerbase.
---
So basically you want Classic to cater to a certain segment of the playerbase that vanilla never did.
---
That's fine, you're entitled to your opinion.  But we're going to have to call a spade a spade here:  You don't want an authentic experience.
---
I want them to do this so bad. Instead of jumping into BC and upping the character level, why not try adding new content to vanilla, in some ways it would be ok to try new things that keep the spirit of vanilla instead of retreading the path of later expansions.
---
I don't know. But you should!
---
Boomkin fishing for omen of clarity procs, maybe?
---
Do we trust Acti-Blizz to create new content and not ruin classic? Not sure I do.
---
If $15 is nothing to you, you can create more accounts to reserve more names then delete em and use em on your main account after launch.
---
How will it handle friends and being assigned to different layers
---
I told a friend to take the Nef staff as he didint want to waste dkp on it and I was 3rd in line anyway and didnt want to see it go to 2nd in line (was an asshat.) Well #2 decided to no waste dkp on it either and all I did was convince the only other person above me to take it. It was rly stupid of me..
---
One the one hand, I get the argument - they don't want to introduce missables into Classic, or systems that suddenly change on the player with no previous warning, assuming the player *only* plays the game and doesn't read up on when the next content phase is happening, and what changes.
---
On the other hand, there's a whole bunch of arguments you can make in favour of bringing them back:  
---
- Like OP says, keeping the old mount/skill system for the entirety of Classic means the mounts themselves will be prohibitively expensive, making having more than one an even bigger status symbol. Getting them won't be trivialised by having expensive riding skills but cheap mounts, which, if push comes to shove, you could just buy and hold on to until you can afford the actual skill.  
---
- They are just that, status symbols. They are simply visually different from other epic mounts. I feel like that makes them much more inconsequential to have in the game than say, gear suddenly having different stats when your realm moves on to the next phase. So why not allow players this small, inconsequential throwback to Vanilla times...?  
---
- ...because when there is content in the game to achieve, people will try to achieve it, and will bitch and moan when the possibility to achieve it gets taken away from them. This leads to players feeling pressured into having to achieve the goal while it's still possible, the main problem Blizzard wants to avoid apparently. HOWEVER - this bullet point isn't an argument in favour of having Old School Epic Mounts so far, lol - I personally feel this argument is weakened by quite a bit simply by there being no achievement system in Classic and the game being much slower, not to say tedious, than retail. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say completionists will be MUCH much rarer since collecting stuff just for the sake of it will in no way be reflected by your character or account status, and the amount of people that are going to end up disappointed will be much lower than the amount of people who would be happy for having them in.  
---
- In any case, there is always, still, the simplest solution: just keep them in indefinitely, alongside the newer ones. Yes, that diminishes their value (again, purely prestige) down to that of regular epic mounts, but IMHO this would still be a better option than not having them at all, in which case their value would be zero due to being nonexistent, and it would allow people who like them for their actual looks to get them. Personally, I don't care about the rarity aspect at all, but I think the unarmored Night Elf mounts and the Ivory Raptor are the prettiest mounts in the game, and I would still go get them even if they were in forever - I just like the looks. I would take literally any option instead of not having them at all.
---
No you’re not replying to them, I’ve asked you a bunch of questions constantly that you just don’t answer but choose to pick a small portion of my posts to answer instead. Not to mention you somehow think I’m against community which shows you’ve barely read my posts. 
---
You’re not here discuss anything.
---
This guy gets it
---
and 3 months is... hold on... doing the math here.... carry the 1...
---
90 DAYS!
---
A month after launch is not “well past launch” i dont get why so many people are hanging onto this.
---
I don’t know why more people don’t realize this. They could redevelop TBC and WotLK as classic content. Use the hindsight they have now to redo it without flying mounts or expanding the world, etc. A chance to do it over and get everything just right.
---
This is correct. I usually just check the account management page on the website, the battle.net launcher, and my email when seeing if I pull betas.
---
link
---
Checking a box and actively paying for/playing one of their games is totally different. Maybe it's a money grab but of the millions of people that haven't played wow in years it would make sense if they selected mainly active accounts.
---
Yeah pretty much. Server community can't even start to develop till after phase 1 if this goes through. Only sharding the starting zones my foot. Shaping up to be live with a classic shell rather than classic with a live shell.
---
Now I'm contemplating re-subbing just to get into beta...
---
The only concern is that in an interview they said you remain in that layer for your play session, meaning next time your log in you might go into another layer.  I hope that's not the case.  After the initial rush (a few days perhaps) they need to "freeze" which layer everyone is assigned to.
---
if you get a group invite from a friend or a guildie that is in a different layer you will vanish yes  
---
tho im sure you cant go to different layer if you're in combat as it is on retail.
---
Worst idea ever
---
How do they estimate how large of a percentage of the total playerbase, those subbing 14 days early will be equivalent to?
---
&gt;!We did it Mr. Nost. We got classic. You can rest now Mr. Nost.!&lt;
---
Imagine thinking that you're missing out on meeting a new player in game because you were sleeping. Now imagine thinking that you're missing out on meeting a new player in game while you're playing that game. Not really the same is it?
---
Seriously. What a stupid response.
---
I'm assuming you and your friends will be in the same guild. Guild members always exist in the same layer.
---
That would allow people to deliberately shift into a different layer at their will, which Blizzard is *trying* to avoid so that people can't cycle through resource nodes or dodge gankers or grab rare spawns multiple times over. When you log in, you get "pinned" to a specific layer so that you aren't able to just shift away when it's convenient for you, and they put in the group and guild workarounds simply so that people would be able to play with preestablished friend circles.
---
I agree with the premise of your comment and also wish it were released earlier in summer, but the actual end of summer is September 23rd. 
---
I know summer is commonly referred to as the time the kids are off school for summer break, but it should be acknowledged that we’re going to get almost a month of ‘classic summer’, not 3 days.
---
It looks like you asked for more animal facts! When male orangutans are fighting, they charge each other, grapple, and bite each other’s heads and cheekpads.
---
Yeah totally a streamers fault that layering/sharding is a thing
---
Bad game. Back to private servers for me
---
Wow, what a fresh, high-tier meme.
---
Happy birthday to me boys
---
This is what I would want as well. Karazhan was a great raid. It would also be possible to expand on the Caverns of Time fairly easily to add more dungeons that explore the lore of WoW.
---
Finishing the existing Mount Hyjal zone to be a level 60 quest hub would be pretty cool too.
---
Hey guys I found Ion's reddit account!
---
How else could you know how long the phase's will be.
---
Fair enough my friend. I hope they don't create the laying in the way you've described it, and if they do I will be disappointed as it is not the classic experience. I am biased on the summer date because I'm out of school and summer doesn't mean much to me. I get that it does for you and that must suck. I guess I'm really excited to be able to play this great game again and it feels like there are piles of complaints in this thread on smaller details instead of people being pumped to play. But your complaints are valid and I shouldn't have dismissed them. See you in Azeroth amigo.
---
No, just no. Enough is enough.
---
hence why it kinda sucks for students.. they dont get to experience classic wow launch again :)
---
It's just the opposite of my experience (Applied Math) so I was curious. From what friends have told me in Engineering and other sci/math related degrees it tends to be a harder college life than work life. When someone says the opposite I want to hear about it. No more, no less.
---
In Louisiana the end of September is very much summer for us
---
Sounds like it won't  be around for all of phase 1 even.  I kind of like the middle ground between the two, and especially like that I'll run into the same people over and over on the same layer.
---
&gt;actually play
---
typical modern WoW mindset, in vanilla we were afk on the bank in orgrimmar, no one was actually playing
---
In vanilla I ground dungeons for days to get enough gold for a mount.
---
It depends on how you want to define it. From Wikipedia:
---
&gt;Reckoning by cultural festivals, the summer season in the United States is traditionally regarded as beginning on Memorial Day weekend (the last Weekend in May) and ending on Labor Day (the first Monday in September), more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather.
---
Either way Blizzard is technically correct, which in this case is the shittiest kind of correct.
---
Not for the rest of the world, because the other side of the planet is in a different season.
---
Too exploitable.
---
"Oh, the rare mob I am farming didn't spawn?"
---
"Are there too many members of the enemy faction running around?"
---
"Competing for quest objectives?"
---
Let's just switch layers!
---
No thanks.
---
If it goes how blizz has stated, then guilds and most of your friends that you group with will end up on the same layer eventually anyways.
---
That's because they didn't restrict concurrent players.
---
Recall classic servers had a ~2500 hard limit where you were simply put in a queue.
---
Blizzard is really messing up with these release dates. I was going to ask some friends of mine if they wanted to play classic with me, now I can't because they won't want to start playing an mmo 1 week before classes starts. It really doesn't make sense to me. What makes the August release date so precious to them?
---
I've seen people talk about reserving names in advance but i can't find anything about it. Can anyone clear this out for me?
---
Where did Ion say this? Never mentioned it in his interview. Tips is a shill
---
I never said the should remove player interactions. My point is that layering is not as bad as this sub makes it out to be. There will be many people in one layer so the scenario you describe is definitely still possible. Personally, I see layering as a necessary evil for the game to be playable the first few weeks after launch.
---
From what I understand: 
---
Layers are very large scale shards. With a full Vanilla Server's (2-3k) population per layer. Your layer is assigned when you log in, and they fill up like cups. So first 3000 all go to Layer 1, next 3000 all to Layer 2, etc. Once you are in a layer, the only way you end up on a different layer is if you have a friend in that other layer who invites you. Logging out and back in may put you back on a different layer, but they also have some prioritization to make sure like guilds end up on the same layers when logging in. And Ion has made very clear that it would be for the first month at most, and never after that.
---
So this seems really good to me. Practically having many servers and merging them, except the servers are just Mankrik (1), Mankrik (2), Mankrik (3) etcetera, and you might phase to group with someone on the same server, different layer. The problems with sharding was A) all the teleporting was very immersion breaking and B) the size and consistency of the shards was not good for developing relationships/communities. Here, the only teleporting is occasionally when grouping with a friend, if you two aren't already on the same layer in the first place, and the layers are practically full servers, and just as consistent. I feel like anyone who properly understands what these are should be at least ok with it.
---
So I guess Ragnaros isn't a MC boss.
---
Copy-pasting what I just wrote in the other thread:
---
One the one hand, I get the argument - they don't want to introduce missables into Classic, or systems that suddenly change on the player with no previous warning, assuming the player only plays the game and doesn't read up on when the next content phase is happening, and what changes.
---
Fpgrumms is the top comment in this whole reddit post. I commented under him. The one that has like -37 by [removed] with [deleted] as the post. I never deleted it and the comment is still listed when I get on that other account.
---
It's literally school kids being entitled and whiney about it being released not according to semester schedules. For the adults, summer just means a change in weather not some big break from tough responsibility. So nothing changes, except we will exceed you all because were already used to juggling responsibility and tasks yearrr fuckin round. By the time I get to the barrens it should still be hot out sooo
---
Yes you read my comment correctly.
---
You’re a moron
---
Because some people want it so bad that they'll throw money at it, even though it is *just a stress test*. Why not charge for it?
---
call it a Cheap Shot.
---
Yeah dude this one change for server stability that will allow you to actually play the game at launch will definitely be the end of us all, stop being dramatic
---
Bit overgeared, no?
---
Its a beta test lol. Its not about you its about the quality of their game. They can gate it however they’d like and it will be full to the brim at the end of the day.
---
&gt; Disabling grouping entirely until 4 weeks
---
Holy shit that is not a 'solution'. That's downright destructive.
---
dead servers aren't a problem, just allow free xfers.
---
Amen. Layers should at least be static until the merge, which I don't understand why they are not since one layer is basically a population caps worth of players.
---
made me chuckle
---
Set hype levels to maximum!
---
No it's not.  The only difference is layers are continent-wide and do not have as much active load balancing.  You'll still run into virtually all of the same issues.  For example, if there's an awesome SS vs TM battle going on in another layer's Hillsbrad, you won't be able to participate unless you somehow convince someone from that layer to invite you into a group.
---
The differences between layering and sharding are semantic at best in this context.
---
Seriously? The same date that university starts after summer...
---
The problem is Blizzard is already making changes, we stated time and time again, no changes. What they are making is a retail version of classic. R I P
---
layering will be abuse, there will be privet addons for black lotus mafias to jump and hold timers on every layer there will be.   
---
but again, the layers are also made to keep the flow of resources to the demand of the server pop,   
---
Black lotus/devilsaur leather after layering is gone will skyrocket in price,
---
Good stuff my man
---
It launches 68 days into the 94 day summer, so it's more like 2/3 of the way into summer. Thanks for checking my math.
---
Overall, kinda like the idea of layering, that way 8000 people aren't waiting for a lazy peon to smack at the Valley of Trials. Plus it's only there for the massive influx of everyone in the same area at the same time, and will be gone soon enough after Phase 1. The only question I have is the /general, /lfg, /trade, /localdefense chats. I'm assuming they will not be layered, correct? So that if you want to group up for a WC run, you're not constrained to only the people in your layer and you'll jump layers within your realm to find a group. But then what about local defense? "The crossroads are under attack" but you head over there and no one is there since the attack isn't on your layer?
---
XDDD
---
What you're not taking into consideration is that everyone will start at the same time. I agree that it causes inflation when it's a established server and the demand isn't increasing at the same pace. 
---
However, with layering there'll be more people leveling and actively participating in the market as opposed to no-layering when there'll be just a "few" people being able to use it. With that said, the demand will also be way bigger and consequently control the inflation's growth.
---
Inflation happens when there's an excessive growth of gold inflow in regards to the demand, gold inflow isn't the sole reason for inflation like you make it seem to be.
---
&gt; casually
---
How dare you
---
It's been a few hours. People need to chill out when the game isn't releasing for months.
---
Hopefully, you are still eligible to be INVITED as long as you opt in. If you aren't even eligible for an INVITE unless you are subbed, that would be some bullshit. Then people could decide themselves if they want to pay to play the beta.
---
So is MC, AQ40 and ZG - boring as fuck pointless, trash everywhere that takes ages to go through for subpar rewards.

---
specially at 6:30
---
The entire realm community will not be rendered meaningless because of x-realm BGs, grow up please.
---
I mean I can agree with your reasoning.
---
But there is something in the background we dont understand. The techinical and server team for Classic feel like this is the best solution to offer a smooth launch. And i genuinely think that this is there goal.
---
Some people give the suggestion of making a lot of realms at the start and then merging, but whos to say merging doesnt have its own side effects, like name changes and economy imbalances.
---
Its clear that smooth launch is the goal, as to not recreate the hell of original launch and similar pserver launches. 
---
Every method will have a downside and upside, but you can't cater to everyone and we have to keep in mind we dont know the technical logistics of hosting 100s of servers with 3k+ people all around the world.
---
Out of curiousity, what would your intended solution be?
---
&gt; Sharding/layering is going to kill the game if it exists past phase 1. 
---
Well they’ve already confirmed it’s not going to last longer than phase 1 so that’s not a problem
---
Yes but that's what they were trying to avoid no? 3-4k is A LOT of people at launch and it will be overcrowded, this solution does not fix this. Sharding would fix this to some degree, server cap would also fix this but is very risky due to  the chance of dead servers hence why my post and the reason they are doing this is not because of the crowding issue but rather to maintain more control over server longevity.
---
I would be more then all over this list.  I actually really loved TBC.
---
&gt;you're not even considering the ramifications for players with different playstyles than yours.
---
Nope, I surely am not. Because I don't mind. If you guys want to rage and be butthurt over it go ahead. I'm gonna play, and it wont make much, if any, difference to the end game. And everything you mentioned is end game, except gank avoidance. Doubt it will help a speed leveler too much as they will already be ahead of the pack. And It's not permanent.
---
CAN YOU GET A TREE FIDDY
---
&gt; the actual end of summer is September 23rd.
---
Summer is June July August in most parts of the world. I don't know how September is Summer in the US. Seasons last three months each, and there are 4 of them. 3x4 = 12, the total amount of months in a year.
---
I'm glad you're excited dude, and just like you I really want the game to be as good as it can be, just like you. I'm just critical of the direction they're taking it. I hope you enjoy classic, because that's what its all about, the fun of the game.
---
Ofcourse the convenience of fast Queue's are nice. But I think that's where the community started to go downwards. People will be more likely to misbehave, under preform or even semi-AFK a lot more.  No one is watching you, reputation used to be a huge thing on eacht realm back in the day.
---
U high m8
---
I have thought about this for a minute now. I wonder how likely it is that they need to test the tech that shares the sub from Retail with Classic. Just make sure there are no hiccups? If they wanted to cash-grab there are many other ways to do it and they have done those before.
---
That's sure going to help 6 months down the line after the problem has become apparent and many have quit already.
---
If there are paid transfers it's a nonissue, otherwise you have to depend on Blizzard managing server pops, which they really don't do in a timely fashion
---
The thing that makes this game trash is the players.
---
So be a responsible adult and live with the consequences of your actions.  Nobody is forcing you to sacrifice you education to play a game.
---
&gt;So in theory friends could end up in different layers. 
---
What if Bloodscalp 1 is full and me and my friends still end up in different sub layers? Do we then make Bloodscalp 1-1, Bloodscalp 1-2, Bloodscalp 1-3?  
---
You see the rabbit hole, don't you? Stop going deeper, son. Stop.
---
They’re going to combine all the layers when the mass influx of temporary players dies down so I’m not sure why that’s a problem. 
---
You would certainly be upset if you were on a dead server. Ask me how I know—I was a player who got sent to Borean Tundra when it opened. That server died HARD.
---
it's aoe sharding.
---
They aren't even guaranteed a spot after *paying* for the sub though...
---
Why not charge for it? Hmm... It's exploitative? Is that enough of a reason for you?
---
I think in this scenario switching should take some time, like a few hours, so it's only there to have guilds and friends the option to get together if they  start at different times, or get to know each other after selecting their initial layer. And also have a cool down where it makes it burdensome to use it a lot. Make the switch something you only do after careful consideration.
---
Yeah you know what I mean
---
“Words only ever mean one thing!”
---
/r/im14andthisisdeep
---
Just a heads-up: Phasing is event-generated changes to the map, like when you complete a major zone quest. It has a similar effect, but... Sharding is what separates players despite being in the same map state, and actually came later, because phasing still allowed players to interact with e.g. riding on a shared mount through a phased area.
---
YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
---
Hogger, is that you?
---
Guilds will default to the same layer, apparently.
---
Is this stated somewhere in the interview/news that's been released so far? I can't watch it before I go home, so I'm still in the dark.  Was hoping someone could point out a source.
---
You clearly didn't experience the difference back in the day.
---
Cross realm BGs were added in vanilla. They were added later, but still vanilla.
---
They said on August 13th (or starting then I guess) you can make your character/reserve a name at that time. They did say you need to have an active sub to the game (which, even as someone who plays retail, kinda seems silly) but you'll be able to reserve names then so you'll be ready to go on launch day.
---
You can do both. It’s VR supported right? Right?
---
Brutal news. Damn
---
Its supposed to be only the regular subscription price, if you are subbed to WoW you should be able to play classic
---
THIS! When you pick a server you make a commitment. I would much rather Blizz take some action to prevent my server from dying in phase two. And if that leaves room for some convoluted exploit for rares, so be it. But letting the sever pop balloon for phase one with sharding seems like an easy fix to a difficult problem.
---
Fucking called it.
---
Classic is a fork, a new path to expand on in parallel to retail.
---
How much focus it's given will depend entirely on how well Classic is received in terms of subscriptions.
---
Next step: Cherry-pick TBC changes to introduce into classic, like dual talents.
---
Imagine being upset about Reddit comments you can just ignore
---
I don't see the Mario reference. Where is it?
---
No chicle en la boca
---
&gt; It will have more players and unlike Vanilla unforunately the player count will begin to drop instead of growing.
---
Which region of your ass did this information come from?
---
We can't. Blizz picked it for us.
---
I don’t get why everyone assumes the population will drop. Are we really expecting some people to start playing and then think “naw this game sucks. I’m out”? The game wasn’t insanely popular for nothing. I think it’s just as likely that players will think this game is great and a breath of freah air compared to all the FTP loot box POS games out there today. I can’t imagine that people actually prefer fortnight/overwatch/Wow bfa style games against something that’s actually good. I think it’s more likely that a new generation will fall in love with this game, tweet about or something, and get all their friends into it.
---
Server transfers are way worse than temporary layering. Seriously? You could have entire guilds just leave your server.
---
Auction Houses are per server / faction. Layering has nothing to do with that, it is all just to manage the player population.
---
That was when they were going to shard things. This is different. I know it might not seem like it but it is. I honestly do not think that the layers are too bad, they just need to go ASAP and I am sure they will do that. I firmly believe that they will do the merging of layers in batches with the last batch (highest pop servers) being done just before Phase 2
---
Wouldn't you eventually want Arcanite Reaper (hooooo) or The Unstoppable force for PVP?
---
Anyways, unless something is a huge upgrade, just use whatever feels better.  If the faster 2H feels like it kills faster, keep using it until it doesn't.
---
I imagine the crowd complaining about the release date and complaining about layering overlap quite a bit.  Which should indicate their age.  I’m happy at least that they will apparently be too occupied or angry to play at launch and I won’t have to interact with them.
---
It’s part of the curse of loving and playing video games.  The sad reality is this is just what the vocal, significant chunk of “gamers” is like.  Toxic and edgy forever.  They want their idea of a classic server and launch to magically appear and can’t fathom the real world business and design decisions that have to be made to make something they will enjoy immensely a reality.
---
You know they would be raging over any of the options you listed.  Apparently, they have some magical solution that Blizzard and no one else knows.
---
True. Definitely says "15th Anniversary" Collectors edition and no where does it state it's for the Classic Release. 
---
But man is it purrty. I bought mine right away *bows head in guilt*
---
But it is what some of us want. I and many others want to be able to actually play the game at launch and not be fighting with 500 people in a starting zone. Sorry that it isn't what you want though.
---
***IT'S A TRAP!***
---
That's what I love about this game. You do whatever tf you want. I'm considering leveling a human mage in only the NE zones to get the saber mount
---
Yea, making it harder to exploit is great. Having layering for literally the whole first phase is not great. You can still exploit the system with party invites, so it honestly does not seem that hard to exploit.
---
I might not have elaborated on it enough in this scenario I think layers would function identically to servers in vanilla, ie your character only exists on one, and you wouldn't be able to just hop layers willy nilly. I outlined this in another reply.
---
Tbc is where the game philosophy started turning for the worse, so I defenately don't want them to do this progression shit. Also people who think that having a vanilla server as well as lets say a tbc one are very delusional, and the reason it's not gonna work is because you can't have 3 of the same games without one of them dying and it will also kill a great part of all servers..
---
Each layer will have 2.5k people lol
---
One could say he's the first last boss of life.....
---
*smokes it up, yeeeeah*
---
It’s not confirmed that it will last all of phase 1.
---
That's the most ideal compromise I can think of. Not bad if that's how it works. 
---
Of course I still can't wait till its all in the past and theres no layering either but still. Not bad.
---
You’re right, I should have. I assumed it would have been implied by the date I gave for my technical end of summer, but I definitely could have made that clearer.
---
My point was just that if you use that definition of summer (whereby the actual definition used in the comment I replied to wasn’t mentioned either), that Blizz aren’t being overly deceitful.
---
But I do disagree with the whole thing and think their phrasing of a ‘classic summer’ sucks, regardless of how you look at it.
---
There will be twice the amount of mats as soon as there's a second layer.  If a layer starts at 3000 people, then you have twice the mats at 3,500, but not even remotely twice the demand.
---
What's worse is that many of those 3500 won't even be competing for that stuff, meaning the same people competing for those rare mats will all be 60 far before layering is removed, and so there will be likely twice as many for the same population.
---
That's a top kek.
---
5/7. Perfect trolling.
---
I am sure people are still going to fuck it up. August 27 is the worldwide date. It is August 26 @ 3pm PST for US
---
We're only getting layering...
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)
---
Yeah, who the fuck do they think they are not catering to students?
---
They aren't taking feedback for a stress test.
---
We'll talk in 3 years when all you've been playing is classic.
---
I like raw onion in my tortilla
---
&gt;"Hey Joe, which server are you on?"
---
&gt;"I'm on Aggamagan, come join me."
---
&gt;"Wait, which layer?"
---
Not interested. This won't even be as popular as BfA - a well earned fate.
---
Fuck yeah I booked my actual vacation just before it comes out
---
Honestly the fact that they aren't even charging for the game itself when thousands of people are chomping at the bit is pretty surprising. I don't see it being a major issue that current subscribers are given some small token of "advantage." I get the frustration though if your old character had a very common name since there's only a two confirmed servers.
---
Fortunately, I had 500k gold despite not playing for a year. ez clap token that is 120k gold.
---
Exactly! People complain about Warcraft retail dying and subscribers dwindling, but as far as an MMO being this successful for this long using this kind of subscription model, blizzard literally wrote the book for how to do it. There was no instruction manual and I'm certain with every expansion they had a deep discussion about catering to Old players while bringing in new players. And the launch of classic again on this scale is another chapter in the book they're writing,
---
Some people wont be able to play with their friends on the same server when they want then.
---
Yea, but it's like telling your kid that you'll help him with his homework, and then you only help him 5 minutes before bedtime.
---
Not what I meant, see my other comment in the thread
---
They said in tips' interview that they have not committed to any dates/lengths for the phases.
---
maybe when it is released and ive played ill have a different opinion but in the meantime i will stay positive about enjoying Classic WoW :)
---
I've already corrected myself in this thread.
---
Did you look into how layering works, or are you just angry and the very thought without any research?
---
Guild members are 100 percent guaranteed to be in the same layer. If your guild members see Horde, you will too. If you invite someone into your group, from a different layer, they join yours. Horde will still be there.
---
This isn't modern day phasing where you can see different people in each zone. Then entirety of each contient is an entire layer. 3000 people can all exist on the same continent simultaneously.
---
yes?  The actual raid content given in current wow is easily some of the best theyve ever had, if you can get that type of quality content with the mechanics and philosophy of classic that would be great.
---
I'm so ready.
---
Of course the population will have an initial influx. It’s free for anyone who subscribes to retail. Most of which I think will quit after trying it because they realize it’s way different/harder than retail. There’s no $60 buy in so I think a lot of people will try it for nostalgias sake and then realize it’s different than it was 15 years ago when they were in high school or college.
---
Full disclaimer I intend to gather the shit out phase 1 and will totally take advantage if I can, but really is it that much harder to just hook up with someone from a different layer, especially if it is as easy as joining the group of someone on a different layer.  If people really are assigned layers on logging in I personally will try to find a few people from a different one and ask 1 of them I see sitting in Org to hop back and forth and get some sweet sweet copper.
---
We don't know if there's gonna be server xfers. Regardless, the free xfers only occurred from high pop to low pop servers
---
It's my way of coping if I don't get in the beta lol.
---
Yeah thats why I only take the absolute minimum classes. Sure its gonna take a while but I get to enjoy myself and keep my sanity tbh.
---
Ragnaros isn't a boss... he's the LAST boss... ok got it... thanks
---
Eh, played on a private classic server for a while. This could be a blessing and a curse. Everyone on the private server was a veteran. I mean, you kind of have to be to even seek out playing on such a server.      
---
This meant every world PvP fight was a real battle. You could be sure the other player knew how to play their class. It was exhilarating but at the same time it would be nice to get some free kills again.
---
My favorite one yet by far!
---
me too...
---
I'd bet my life savings on it for real, it's possible that it could see an Oldschool Runescape like rejuvenation if the game attracts new players over time however if you believe the second month will have more active players the first then you're in for a surprise. !remindmeinNovember
---
no idea who that is, i don't have brain worms where i obsess over internet "celebrities"
---
[literally the only cool thing a paladin ever did, anywhere, and it's hotfixed.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aX2JEKVn-U4)
---
Why does Blizz always do end of summer releases, when more people don't have enough time to put into the game?
---
Yea,you are correct.It takes me an hour a day of work time to earn for  subscription,it's not worth to invest time into farming gold.
---
Log in queue
---
Yeh where did it say you had to buy BfA? All it says is you need a subscription. QQ
---
Why not both?
---
Honestly I don't really give a shit either way.
---
But at the same time, I agree it'd be cool if they added in more stuff that is only achievable in the first few phases, especially solely cosmetic things like mounts, titles, pets, etc.
---
I mean, is scarab lord going to be a limited achievement? Of course. So there's already going to be things in the earlier phases of the game that will be unachievable later. What's the issue with having a few unique mounts?
---
yep, sharding is a term used to describe data strategies in distributed systems.  it wasn’t invented to describe cross realm
---
GET OUTTA ME SWAMP
---
holy is amazing, ret and prot are worthless meme specs tho yeah
---
Well guess who just put in for vacation that entire week!
---
&gt;You could still get placed into the latest layer that hasn't filled yet. It's possible, however unlikely, that you could be the only person on that layer for at least a while.
---
I would agree that it is possible, however the chances of it happening are slim and even if you did the layer would fill up probably pretty quickly.
---
&gt;More probably, I think people will experience being on layers with a few hundred people, which would be the equivalent of being on an very low population server.
---
Keep in mind that this is for the entire continent. Hundreds of players in the same area is a terrible experience and no one can get anything done. Layering is the only real option and better than sharding as it keeps all those on the same server.
---
Im happy for you guys hope it goes well!
---
As healers, no? As DPS, ya kinda. As tanks, depends (they can tank Strath undead very well)
---
Community is a big part of the Vanilla experience. Sharding effectively destroys that.
---
LEERROYY... JEEENKKKINNNS
---
u/Aphorism14's point proven. To bad you don't have something better to be doing.
---
Yeah that's the big goal: prevent dead realms. I'm all for it myself.
---
For casual players you are right, xrealm BGs are the way to go, but its these convenience changes that ultimately ruined the game. Said in another post that I would be ok with limited "battlegroups" so we can still get the feeling of rivalry's (2-3 servers max) rather than not knowing who you are fighting, which will take away from the experience for players like me. I enjoy knowing who I am owning, and I enjoy those BG rivalry's transferring over into the open world.
---
The dps is basically useless, and with sit and crit gone it’s even worse. Paladins are great in vanilla, just not great dps.
---
it's only 27 days worth of summer classic. why not only 3 days?
---
I meant 2008
---
replace "MC" with "summer".
---
I really had to explain? I tought the troll was obvious lol
---
Faster weapons tend to smooth out the feeling of "misses" really hurting you as much from what I remember grinding my warrior years ago.
---
I've seen those and even made a post calling this out. In 14 years, technology has moved so quickly that we literally went from phones that barely played ringtone music to having computers in our pocket more powerful than what I used to run WoW originally. We have self driving cars, AI, and virtual reality.
---
Yet, WoW still can't handle a few hundred players in one area doing mass PvP. Seriously, Elon Musk created a car company from scratch, and shot the car into SPACE in less time than WoW has had to just solve the problem of having a few hundred players together. I feel like this is something Elon could solve in a weekend if he really wanted.
---
Getting off topic, but yea, Classic is on that slippery slope. It's good to know there's always private servers to fall back on if Blizzard crosses the line too much.
---
This is HUGE if true, any Classic World of Warcraft Content Creators making a video on this?
---
then again thinking a subreddit is representative of the general public is a fallacy I've seen happen many times on reddit.
---
No one feels bad for ASU students, though. Stupid good weather.
---
theyre literally the best tank healer in the game. where do you even get this useless info from? also one of the best pvp healers due to spot healing in plate gear...
---
Most seasons do not start or end on the first/last day of a month, but rather near the end of the month, so they're 3 months long, but there's overlap.
---
So when you go to a mon sir for 20 mins and wait. Problem solved for you.
---
I think one of the biggest problem with sharding is the loss of immersion. You walk somewhere and suddenly everything disappears and reappears. This fixes that
---
Sure, in theory, but that's not really how it was... People still AFK'ed in AV and under preformed before cross-realm BGs. And yeah, rep was important, but unless you were a total ass, no one is going to remember "that one druid who was exploring in AV" or "that Rogue who didn't do his best".
---
But you know what did frequently happen before cross realm BGs? All day premades. If you got unlucky enough to queue against a premade WSG on a Saturday morning, half of your group would outright refuse to fight back because they knew they'd get steamrolled. Then you requeue. Same premade. Over and over. It happened in Vanilla and it still happens on Pservers.  
---
Arguments can be made on both sides, but overall, a battle group of 3-4 regional servers is beneficial for PvP.
---
Hmm I always thought they were great healers in PvE and PvP.....
---
PHRASING!
---
&gt;I played priest in vanilla. I was holy on raid days and shadow the rest of the time.
---
I mean, it's not really necessary though. Once DME comes out, priests can AoE farm in the standard raid holy spec on lashers. Plus, farming lower end dungeons with holy nova, doing DME jump runs for thorium with a warr, rogue, or druid, and dungeon farm runs of BRD, UBRS, and orb runs for gold. Plus passive gold off profession CDs, gathering professions, and fishing as backups. There's options for healers to make decent cash without going hard spending 100g/week on respeccing.
---
Yes but if you read the article you can be automatically pulled in and out of shards based on the population of the zone you're in. Layering does not work like that. So you're not going to be seeing people disappear unless you get invited to a group. Which IS different than sharding.
---
Why couldn’t they do this a few years ago before I had a life?
---
They are for real.
---
Which one in particular? I've crossed out the "forever" part to clarify.
---
True, good possibilities.
---
I wouldn't mind the option to transfer/copy to a tbc server. But I'm happy with vanilla.
---
Name checks out.
---
I hear you there. I know I don't like most of those big streamers and just ignore them. Some people get really caught up on it; I just go to the sub 100 viewer peeps usually.
---
Yeah I def don’t mind tanking. Only reason why I don’t heal is because I have never done it , it’s not out of the question though.
---
Eh. I don't trust that they don't use it again later if numbers go above what they predicted.
---
My boi Verog the dervish appreciate the sharding
---
&gt; I'd rather have queues and gradual server roll-out so that growth curves stabilize organically.
---
It's not about growth curves, it's about shrinking populations. The peak population for classic will be at launch day/weekend, then it will go down from there. So what you would need is a ton of servers on launch, that will then be severely depopulated as time goes on. Or you would have to merge them, which does way more damage to a server community than layering will.
---
As a Canadian, I agree.
---
This is a necessary technical change. The "no changes" mantra was about gameplay. Do you wish they were running the servers on the old server hardware too?
---
You all do realize that the demand and supply will *both* be affected in 1:1 ratio? Save, of course, for that one layer that might be underpopulated where the supply surpass the demand.
---
I had the same problem trusting jagex with osrs but they do a pretty good job
---
but the beta starts tomorrow (the 15th)
---
Literally my first reaction. Starting my NQT (first year) of teaching in September. Nvm.
---
Level up as Ret just fine. Solo Ret just fine.
---
Raids are a different story.
---
It all depends on how casual or serious you want to play.
---
It’s not quite exactly like that, you can be in a different layer each time you log in, but overall similar
---
So the fact that layering is continent wide and not zone wide is just a semantic difference?
---
Beefy 5 layer vagina

Ah, I was always horde, and shamans had no issues, so I figured paladins were the same.
---
Play retail?
---
I mean I think part of it may depend on the server you play on. I play on Argent Dawn EU which is an RP server and one of the largest on EU in terms of population.
---
There was lag in Stormwind and some in Boralus yes, and certainly during the first 30 minutes or so when it came to loading assets and input lag but I'd hardly call it comparable to people who couldn't log in for 1-2 days which I genuinely, hand on heart, have no recollection of people mentioning and didn't have anyone in my guild experience.
---
I have commented on this in other posts but I suspect that this is because they need to test the tech behind sharing the subscription between the games. AFAIK, they have never shared a subscription across games like this before so to test it they are putting this requirement.
---
Assuming you felt the same way about the demo from the virtual ticket? And any wow expansion alpha/beta previously? 
---
I honestly don't get the hate, so I'm just gonna drop it here and leave you to it mate.
---
If there's something to hate on for being exploitative, subbing to reserve a name 14 days before launch is way worse imo.
---
I definitely want to raid.
---
I'm an online student up in the Northeast. ASU was just easier for the major I wanted. Normally that would still apply but I'll be in a sandy, hot part of the world around that time too.
---
Everyone that is acting like Classic isn’t being released in summer.
---
&gt; What did I miss out on? The vast majority of what you write ends up being part of the same point, which I answer in my replies to those posts.
---
one of them would be how you think layering will work since you're talking like you already have the answers. 
---
&gt;I think you're against community because your replies show you don't care about the harm layering will do to the community.
---
Then this is a bigger waste of time then I previously thought.
---
i've been subbed (with some breaks here and there) since nov 2004 xd
---
Do you need a sub for beta?
---
Then yes, you're fucked. Prot has no Taunt, so it can't meaningfully be used in raids, and Ret has garbage DPS *and* no threat reduction, and unlike something like a Shadowpriest, its raid utility buffs are marginalized by the fact that Holy Paladins can give mostly the same buffs.
---
You can likely find a casual guild somewhere that will tolerate you and mostly play PvP, but Ret Paladins by and large unviable in raids, as are Prot. There are notable exceptions here and there, but they're notable because the players in question go *waaaay* above and beyond in terms of min-maxing and buffs/consumables to even approach middle-of-the-pack dps in guilds that they either formed or are key members of.
---
Prot can tank 5-mans, and Ret is decent in PvP. If you don't mind not raiding beyond MC and maybe some BWL, you still have opportunities. Otherwise you'll need a lightning strike and an extraordinarily patient progression guild to even think about taking you to Naxx or AQ40.
---
With so much being uncertain I am very excited to see how much the pserver meta will shift. Armor values, regen rates, proc rates etc.
---
Will warriors be less effective due to them only dealing physcial damage? Will ret paladins not be as much of a meme spec due to magic damage? How will glancing blows be calculated? Will human raical still be bis for many classes? So many questions! =]
---
Roll a Warrior.
---
Lol yeah that shit would make me REee but idfc we got CLASSIK!!!
---
I used to use it on 4chan in like 2007 before it got all super super crazy.  I made I think a twink 19 hunter, then a Monk that I mained in MoP.  When I signed up for reddit 6 years ago my main use was FFXIV stuff and my character was Otter Anon on that so that's why I picked it.  Otter comes from my Pledge name from my Fraternatiy in school, Anon comes from the obvious 4chan character.  A little embarrassing now but I've used it so long I kind of like it.
---
The hype is so real!
---
Been asking you for a source from before we knew anything when you were spouting bullshit.
---
Any sources from BEFORE your lucky guess like I've been asking forever? Kinda late now that TODAY is the day we get confirmation.
---
So, how about that earlier source? Or are you going to continue being a scrub?
---
It’s the day of my anniversary :O
---
hahahah if only i could change my name
---
1.12
---
Hahah yeah probably the latter
---
My bad!
---
More importantly, we beat r/wow
---
To be fair, if you re-release a game like Oblivion or some CoD game, those older versions are still playable. With WoW, we've never had a way to play the older versions (that wasn't a janky ass private server), which are so different they're practically separate games from modern WoW. I'm alright with them releasing legacy servers for old expansions for that reason.
---
This has been said by the dev team multiple times since this was first brought up.  They are only looking to use layering/sharding for the beginning zones (Northshire Abbey, Coldridge Valley etc) during the first 1-3 weeks of launch to prevent login/crashing issues.  After that there is no sharding. 
---
Check literally any Blizzcon interview/panel regarding classic development from last year for confirmation.
---
It is not dumb at all. There are many people that will log in and opt into the Beta but not have a ton of time or dedication to play. From Blizzards standpoint, they have a higher chance of getting active beta players from a pool of people that they know actively play a similar game. I know we all want to play the Beta but the point of the beta is not fun, it's improving the game/servers, that is their goal as it should be. We aren't entitled to play beta. It is a test.
---
&gt;Doubt that will be the case seeing as you can only reach level 30 in the beta, so there will be no point in swapping layers, even if it is as easy as people are saying.
---
Think about the new players /u/pflurker829 . Both the ones already playing retail and the ones that are only just now discovering WoW. Do we want them to have a playable, enjoyable experience when this thing drops, or present them with a 50-hour long queue timer and then many wonderful hours fighting over cactus apples and lazy peons in some "tots ugly AF" game from 2004?
---
Layering is not perfect and in some ways worse than sharding in that it creates a hard divide between players in a realm. That said, there has to be a solution and after thousands of comments I've yet to see a single person describe a better one.
---
that would make sense!!!
---
OHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH my
---
I dont assume the game is fucked, I assume Private Servers will be a better product and a better game until content phase 3. 
---
This isn't really about what makes people happy, this is about what's abusable and what's not. Blizzard is adding a high knowledge barrier method for ill intented players can use to literally stonewall players from leveling. If we had the system live I would stream it. In fact I might level a rogue and do exactly that on stream with a few friends for a few weeeks when it comes out to force Blizzard's hand. I dont give a fuck if I get banned for griefing, I want the abusable function out of my goddamn game. 
---
STV, Redridge, and other ganking hubs will be borderline unplayable if you're behind the curve and there are good rogues who know sharding tricks on the opposite faction. You think those jackasses won't abuse the mechanic? Their intent is to kill low level players with no contest to make themselves feel strong, why wouldn't they use more underhanded tricks?
---
If the tech for 1 server 1 world isn't there, where the fuck did it go? It existed in 2004. I get the cloud computing is the new thing, but so far it's a straight up downgrade for MMOs. I dont know their server situation either, but I do know that if their servers can only shard, they have fucking shit servers and they've been developing in the wrong direction for a long time.
---
Though this raises the interesting question whether or not auction houses will be interlayer or intralayer.
---
I am still not sure if you need to be subbed to get the invite, you just need to be subbed to actually use it and play the beta. I could be wrong. Not sure how they would deal with players not using the beta invites if they didn't want to sub.
---
no
---
most likely very low especially if you run the lowest settings. what do you have i can tell you if you'll be good not
---
I guess a potato will do fine ? No, i'm not kidding. Old classic worked fine on just onboard graphics, so today a mobile phone could take it ( don't get any funny ideas, blizz !!!)
---
Yes I remember that too. Think it was a couple days no respeccing will reduce the price again.
---
As someone that hasn't played since WotLK, I'm fine with waiting until August. Waiting a little more than a month than what people were predicting makes no difference to me. At least now I know when to sub to reserve my name and when I get to start playing again.
---
You can't handle the truth.
---
Ah, was looking at stress test dates. Yup, the limited, select beta starts tomorrow.
---
Demand absolutely will not increase on a 1:1 ratio. 
---
If a server has 4,500 players, that is two layers.  Twice the materials.  
---
But it's only 1.5x as many players.  So 2:1.5 ratio which is not 1:1.  
---
Aside from that, it's likely to be more skewed because the portion of the population gathering and demanding those mats is likely not the population that is likely to quit after phase one.
---
I am going to drop a hard agree on that one. I've seen what they do and I can not imagine being able to understand that nonsense.  
---
Just to throw some shade at the comp sci people, programming is easy as shit and every engineering major learns how to do this as a bonus on top of their material. Comp sci is a joke.
---
Oh please, no one gives a fuck about what you did on private servers. That wasn't vanilla. Populations min-maxing and shifting to new servers after they got stuck on AQ-40 is private server. And more often than not private servers had dynamic respawns, so of course it didn't take you as long. You're acting so simple minded it's insane to read, just because sharding/layering wasn't in vanilla doesn't mean it doesn't serve a purpose in recreating vanilla. WE CAN NEVER HAVE VANILLA AS IT WAS EVER AGAIN. You were younger, people didn't know much about it, things didn't work properly or work as intended, etc etc. What I think is that Blizzard will cater to the 99% of vanilla's playerbase, not the 1% who min-maxes, keeps a journal of every encounter they have with strangers in the first month of playing, and jerks off at the thought of new players quitting because there are no dynamic respawns like on your private servers and quit because it's not fun. I will call a spade a spade: You seem like an entitled private server baby.
---
Even here in New England it’s regularly 80+ and humid af well into October.
---
"oh no you're on a different layer nothing we can do to play together"
---
*Joe has invited you to group*
---
No worries! Not the first thing people think of. Plus yeah, I don't feel bad for students in residency.

Thats the nostalrius age distribution, actual players not reddit youngins.
---
Wouldn’t make much sense to have them, good decision blizzard.
---
Good news, after my other response to you: Paladins are extremely mana efficient single-button spammer healers. With the exception of some downranking for Flash of Light to proc mana regen from crit heals, your job is very, very, *very* easy. Holy Paladin PvE playstyle is basically:
---
Press Flash of Light over and over and over and over at varying ranks
---
Sometimes press Holy Light
---
Buff when your Blessings are running out
---
That's it.
---
I mean, it’s not the exact same but you’ve needed an active sub in order to log into test realms in the past.
---
I'm pretty sure they would keep battle groups, it's always been that way in retail.  
---
I also agree that it's way more interesting to fight people from your realm in the bg. 
---
I don't think things like cross realm bgs ruined the game, there are some convenience things that blizz has added over the years that have made the game better and some that made it worse, in my opinion cross bgs are in the better category.
---
The reality is no one wants to wait 30+ mins for a bg and no one wants to get stomped every bg they play,  even the most hard core players. Cross bgs are a good way to solve these problems and I think the tradeoff is worth it. Blizzard could make players in the same realm have a higher chance to fight one another in their queuing process so they still could keep some level of authenticity with cross bgs.
---
I just said this in a diff thread but I'm uncertain on if you need to be subbed to get invited, or just subbed so you can actually play once you've been invited.
---
Yeah NF enhance shamans work well. A hunter with a nightfall doing wingclip raptorstrike span will still out dps a pally with nightfall doing his normal rotation. Lol
---
If you picked and leveled on a server that ended up as a dead low pop 3 months later, you would beg for crossrealm BGs.
---
That's why they implemented it in vanilla 1.12 because some server pops shrunk and WSG would take 30+ min to queue for 1 game, and AV would take several hours to queue for, or many times you there wouldn't be an AV game because not enough people are queuing on your server.
---
Yeah, no, there is no way that's something they need to test... It's just a cash grab for the hype...
---
If I understood it correctly, which I by all means may not have, you can join another layer by grouping up with someone on another layer..?
---
Still way better than transferring and then having to start over if I ever wanna play max level vanilla. Let people make that choice on their own. If you wanted to emulate a "transfer" you could copy the character and then delete the one on the classic servers.
---
I'm not burning a token just for a chance of an invite. If I get an invite and have to burn a token to use it, I will think about it.
---
You're still on the same server and chat channels like that are server wide, so yeah I don't see them not being able to join.
---
just don't talk about other expansions beimg good or you'll get stoned
---
Doomhammer layer 1 through 10 is no different than 10 different named servers. I might be on d2 first login. Later in the day log into d5 with a completely different set of people. It sounds similar to me.
---
so we are going to see a bloat of 30% of the population be MS warriors?
---
The details on the free shipping says it does not apply to preorders. It has always been this way. Even if it was $100.01 you wouldn't get free shipping.
---
*If.*
---
MY LIFE IS OVER
---
City of Heroes Classic anyone? No?
---
Same here, such a shame. I guess I'll have to settle for one or maybe two hours a day at best. I guess that will be just like Vanilla since I couldn't play for a long time as well back then.
---
[http://www.bfrontz.net/Community\_analysis.pdf](http://www.bfrontz.net/Community_analysis.pdf)
---
heres the source if you dont believe the picture.
---
Jesus good lord save us all
---
Ok.
---
&gt; Do we just keep rebooting over and over, once every few years?
---
That is how time-locked progression servers work with other MMOs, yes. Every few years they launch a new server to start from scratch.
---
I'd definitely like to see new level 60 or 70 content (because BC servers are practically a foregone conclusion at this point), but only if they still have designers who could create content that feels like it could have been made during that era and isn't just pulled from modern WoW design.
---
&gt; Basically once you are put in a layer, you are in the exact same one until the servers merge
---
This isn't true according to Tips' interview. Omar said that you'll persist in a layer "during that play-session", so you could get a different layer next time you log in
---
Because store mounts are the most unique mounts in game and people would rather be able to achieve it somehow in game rather than paying out of pocket.
---
They won't. The difference in power between Naxx gear and MC gear is huge already, they won't drop another tier on people, PvP would be a clown fiesta.
---
Ignore the hyperbole. It's essentially an expanded form of sharding that is continent wide. You login, you're put in Layer 1. At a certain point, the server determines that it needs to start up Layer 2, 3, etc, and put players there. I imagine there will be some load balancing so that it's not like a new Layer is spun up and you get put on it without anyone else on it yet.
---
This is essentially the same as having multiple of the same named server that will be merged together - Illidan 1/2/3/4. Once Phase 1 is over and all the tourists leave the game, Layering will be turned off and all players on that server will always be in the same single one.
---
During Layering, you'll be able to swap between them by grouping, like how cross realm groups work in the modern game, except you'll only be swapping between layers of the same server.
---
This does present some issues with persistent relations with players. Day 1 you see everyone progressing through zones. But Day 2 you log in and you're put on a different layer, so you may not end up seeing the same people again.
---
...no... Summer ends at the September equinox. End of September.
---
I don't think Blizzard sends emails anymore when you get into beta, it should just appear on your account
---
World chat destroys any reason I have for spending any significant time in a major city and seems like nothing more than a place for streamers to spam their twitch channel info... no thanks.
---
Yeah. I see problems with it too, but I really don't see any better alternatives.
---
What u/whotooknan said. But I like where your head is at! I hope they can mitigate the issues
---
Cross realm BGs was good.  Battle Masters to que up for BGs was bullshit.
---
hero
---
I was under the assumption it was "AB" with some base PvE objectives like AV.
---
Sounds good to me on paper, but I've not played WoW since mid 2007 so I never actually saw what got released years later with this instance.
---
BADGE THIS MAN
---
&gt;AKA xrealm BGs promotes account sharing (a bannable offence)
---
So ban the perpetrators, not the average person wanting to enjoy BGs. Problem solved.
---
I don't think it's completely out of the question to have the expansions handled in a way where the player is lvl 60 in Azeroth and then their level in TBC and WotLK. Have bank deposit chests at the world access/leave points and only allow gear to go to appropriate continents.
---
If they don't half ass it, I think the two expansions could exist in the same game as Vanilla.
---
It doesn't help that the person above him quoted a part of the article that doesn't mention requiring the subscription. He quoted the end of it. That part started at the beginning, how anyone can skip over that when explaining to someone you need an active sub for the beta and quote the ending part of the article is BEYOND me.
---
Yeah, really depends on how many people are still playing on each server when the merge happens. Will be interesting to see how Blizzard handles that.
---
I love how you finished your rant with this completely subjective statement.
---
My 400 hours of PTO will finally be partially used, haha!!!
---
MC awaits you
---
Nah, I'm going to resub to ffxiv and catch up to that, play the expansion over my summer break, then get into classic wow when that finally comes out
---
You're "locked" in that it won't put you on other servers randomly. You won't be walking through goldshire only to see everyone disappear and an entire new group of people pops in.
---
People are blowing this way out of proportion.
---
After thinking about it for a few hours I'm considering it like premerging servers before they get empty once the vast majority of sight seers leave.  The problem I see is if some servers are so popular that even after phase 1 they can't realisticaly stop the layers, though I think the chance of that is pretty small.
---
Just thinking that the congestion might last past 10... Maybe not full on to 20+, but over the next few weeks, I think I'll try and find the best options through the 3 10+ zones (since i can get to any quickly) and optimize things a bit.
---
I think the compromise on crossrealm would be the best option. Have small 3-4 server 'battlegroups' and prefer your own server for 5, 10, 15 minutes or whatever and then expand if necessary.
---
How is wow classic different from just running your own vanilla server?
---
If you have any starter shirts that are not character bound, they can be sold for a quite a bit now. You may have a couple tokens if you are lucky.
---
Remeber though, Xrealm BGs were added in the game late vanilla, when people were pretty much done ranking since AQ / Naxx gear were on par or better than R14 gear.
---
So nobody knows how Xrealm BGs is going to effect the players who want to push for rank 14, and we wont know until we see it of course, but I am still under the impression that it will have unwanted consequences.
---
Xrealm in itself did not ruin the game,, but for me (and my friends) BGs were never as fun after they got added, rivalry's basically gone over night. To each their own, I understand the casual player wants to come home from work, and que up and have some fun in BGs and of course the argument that it was in classic is irrefutable, but it was not in classic when people were pushing rank 14 and adding them in is going to "change" how the game was played.
---
If its not tears about layerings its the sub fee's for the beta. No one's ever happy.
---
Well that's good - but what if a layer is full. Will you be put on another layer that is different from your guild? Will someone else be kicked off that layer?
---
Poor dan

they’re only going to use layering for the first few weeks, at most a month. https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
But those decisions aren't the content itself. Those decisions are game play and qol changes. What I'm saying is only release content. Not a Titan forging implementation.  Not lfr. Just a new raid. They can still make good raids, it's just the game play surrounding it that sucks.
---
First toon ever. Undead mage. First 60 in vanilla: orc warrior. I'm seriously struggling between orc warrior and orc shammy. It will be tough to make a choice.
---
Go ahead and piss away $15 for a small chance at an invite then before you actually know shit.
---
Sell coke on the weekends ditch the job for a bit
---
I can definitely understand this aspect. However, layering will still enable you to meet the same people. You will be locked in to one layer. Only time you will leave the layer is if you group up with someone in another layer. Source: https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Mini-Memes? XD
---
This. I played priest and made friends with a warrior and we would just run around together farming. He was unstoppable as long as I had mana!
---
Can you give me a couple examples of "situationally" better gear? And can we make entire dungeons/raids with this "situational" gear? Are people gonna have to keep *even more* gear in their bags to swap to keep up?
---
It's surprising because this is the first time Blizzard has ever required a subscription to get into a beta
---
Have you ever played a game without sharding?
---
No, you'll just be put in one when you log in. Not sure if it'll be persistent between login sessions or not, as the Layers probably are not persistent when they aren't needed. You'll be able to just group up and swap layers that way.
---
The sentence on the subscription preceeds the sentence on the opt-in and being selected. This structure means that a subscription is necessary. If they did not mean to say this, than they should have done better at drafting.
---
Are guilds always going to be in the same phase then? If my guild is large enough and we always have at least one player on line will we never leave our layer? If that's the case what about another similar guild on my server on a different layer? Will I rarely to never encounter this other established guild until layering stops and they smash us together? How is that any different than server merging or server groups?
---
They can call it whatever they want, but it's all ultimately the same tool and the implementations all have similar effects on the community.
---
Wish someone would do this for horde
---
&gt; The (original) reason for sharding in Classic is solely to prevent the starter zones from being overly crowded.
---
Yeah, don't care to be honest.
---
I played in beta for vanilla, and the day vanilla dropped I was on. It was a mess, I got DC'd more times than I can count. I'll take a bumpy few weeks, over an eternity of sharding.
---
Are they removing sharding after the initial bump? If so, that's a different convesation. But if they are keeping sharding in for all of it, then it isn't vanilla. Sharding sucks, and defeats the purpose of vanilla.
---
You could always name her Khaleesi. . .no wait.
---
seems like a weird time to announce the beta, a day before it goes live, when invites haven't been going out. at least afaik. haven't seen anyone comment they got officially invited yet.
---
It's like you never played without lfg.
---
Adding on to my previous post on why I kinda like layering, I don't think layers will affect the "classic feel" of reputation and what not. The trolls of the channel are still going to be posting on barrens chat for all to see, the good players will still hold reputation throughout /lfg and helping others with quest in /general, and the ninjas/assholes will still be known and names spread like wildfire. You can still communicate and develop relationships with everyone on your server, just won't run into every single person until phase 2.
---
Obviously it's speculation, that's why I said it's an opinion.
---
The speedrunning angle is interesting though, but that's pretty niche.
---
When you have bad news to deliver, make youtubers do it.
---
Sharding starting zones solves launch day problems. It doesn't solve realms being dead after a month or two when 80% of people have stopped playing tho.
---
They wouldn't be able to add a tier higher than naxx. It would have to be a sidestep, possibly something between bwl and aq40.
---
Dude it's like you're deliberately saying the stupidest thing possible just for attention
---
If they decide to make tbc after I just hope they leave classic servers untouched so you can return there whenever you want, forced expansion sucks
---
Two weeks after I start law school....lol RIP my odds of ever playing it
---
They didn't. Not sure where above poster got that from.
---
Remember when you were so out of ideas you decided to become a Buddhist just so you could reincarnate?
---
Hyjal.
---
Do you have a link to the interview ?
---
Yes. I've been playing on and off since Open Beta and spent some time on Private Servers.
---
And we are not getting sharding. We are getting a different thing. Or would you rather have to wait for 15 minutes for every quest you do because theres so many people the mobs dont have time to respawn?
---
Statistically speaking a few of us won’t make it. RIP.
---
A pretty disappointing release date, I was hoping it would actually be in the middle of summer, not at the end of it.
---
What good RPG’s are there to play in the mean time?
---
but the classic philosophy requires a mindset that the current devs don't have and might never have again.
---
vanilla was created by people who wanted to create a world more than a game, and by doing so they made a lot of "questionable" design decisions in favor of *theme* over *balance*. when creating an item, spell, quest, town, bossfight, anything, they thought about "what makes sense for the world?", not "what do gamers expect?".
---
it's a mindset that, once you move on to thinking about numbers and balance and normalization, you can never go back to. we'll never see cloth gear with agility, or improved firestone, or undead players being totally immune to fear anymore. and maybe that's a good thing, but it's these weird things that made vanilla so good -- the developers gave us all these thematic tools and allowed players to be creative with them. 
---
we'll never get back the "classic philosophy", because that style of game making has been left in the past. it is impossible to *forget* the modern approach to making WoW.
---
It's this kind of attitude that let's them (Activision Blizzard) get away with shit like this.
---
Why 2 weeks tho? Who decided this time-frame?
---
Anyone interested enough to secure a name will do it in minutes after the opportunity becomes available. Everybody else just doesn't give a fuck.
---
2 or 3 days would be plenty of time for people to secure the names they wanted, while only having those 2 or 3 days of payed 'unplayed' time.
---
If you're not a current subscriber, you're essencially paying a half-subscription to secure the name(s) you want. 7€ or dollars might not be a lot for you and me, but make that times the number of players adhering to this and you start to get the picture of the 'free' money they're making.
---
Ironically enough, the #nochanges movement should be extended to company philosofy, as we didn't see this kinda shady tatics from OG Blizzard when WoW launched back in 2004.
---
The 100% speed mounts used to be just recolors of the 60% speed ones
---
10s, no servers charge any other price that I’ve seen
---
college kids 15 years ago were 4, they don't even know about classic.
---
Gold has a direct conversion rate with real money now too. Sooooo you CAN earn them in-game, so to speak. Just consider them all AH mounts and you’re good to go.
---
I have the second edition strategy guide and that list it at 0g10s0c wiith your self and 9 other signatures required.
---
It is absolutely garbage, and yeah, I would.  It's objectively more authentic and more cohesive than layering/sharding.
---
Are you confusing sharding with phasing or referring to some intersected point where both collide or something? I've never heard of people popping in and out of visibility with other players and I've played every expansion a decent amount.
---
Anyways, I must be a moron or obscenely stubborn to not see the difference and that is why I am calling it semantics. 
---
Yes, you won't see people not on your server, and that seems to be the only difference because at it's core this technology will usher people into seperate instances of the same map based on spillover and load exactly like sharding does. I don't understand how you view this as such a different concept when it can basically be described as sharding without cross-server interaction.
---
Now proceed to avoid talking politics with almost everyone you know, in spite of knowing that that exact idea is what keeps us all in the American circus.
---
Or, you could have a Rogue set that gives massive bonus' to Damage over Time and bleeds to enable a "poison/bleed" rogue synergizing with hemo, garrote, rupture, and deadly/instant poisons.
---
There is a ton of stuff they could do.
---
You can see all the sets at classicdb.ch and just search item sets.  Naxx based items and even some items off C'Thun are crazy powerful compared to most other items in the game.  They are on a whole other level, and on a technical level, most BWL items are ilvl ~75 with their stat spread.  Naxx items are ~80-90 and have insane raw stat values.
---
Ddos
---
If I recall, the initial cost was negligible (1s or 10s)
---
Since we saw the interview he had with Devs at the Media Summit. JS.
---
&gt; It’s not confirmed that it will last all of phase 1.
---
I think you are suffering from denial dude. Clinging onto the hope that it will only be 2/3rds of phase 1 is folly. The damage will largely be done by then anyway.
---
Yeah, but then you would be logging in at a time when the online population is growing, meaning the layer won't be empty for long. 
---
The only thing I could see happening is people staying up late at night, hoping they will be on the emptiest layer as people log off. But that is impossible to control, so not exactly a big problem.
---
Honestly the game is free. I subbed so I hopefully get a chance to test it out. I want to try with a friend to get a wand asap while dual levelling.
---
Yeah it's sucky they want us to sub, but then again we have been begging for this game for years. I started back in 2005, so I mean paying 10£ isn't the end of the world for me. 
---
If I didn't get into the beta on the other hand.. Oof
---
Fuck yes, the two expansions I consider on par with classic! Can't wait to play launch DK again
---
From the OPs comment;
---
&gt; Well many in the world think of **1st of June to last of August** as summer, so yea, many think it's as late as they could release it and still call it summer.
---
It's not talking about it being 'technically in summer, so it's fine'. It's saying that it's at the tail end of summer following this definition.
---
It was 10 in vanilla from my memory
---
It’s my first day of teaching I can’t miss the first week of school! Why!!!!!!!
---
Lol who said I was? Or are you just speaking generally? You alright there, lil timmy?
---
After boot camp and mos training/tech school, you will be in operational military. You will work 8-12 hrs daily and have plenty of free time.
---
I was USAF during WotLK/Cata/MoP and still had plenty of time to play and stay relevant with gear and raids.
---
And no, I wasn't 'chairforce' lol. I worked the flightline fixing them airplanes that our boys on the ground love.
---
3 != 25.5. It's not semantics, it's mathematics.
---
Opinions not based on anything are pretty much worthless.
---
Just learned that AH will be interlayer. That raises this issue across all of P1, not just at the transition or preparation. It will be a bit off from 1:1 indeed, but not to that extreme you seem to present. What you are suggesting insinuate that the resources will be gathered at the same pace as they respawn, regardless of layer population. It will not. Though obviously it would be more lucrative to make your way to an emptier layer for gathering of resources.
---
Yeah any reason? why would they ever be like "yeah keep that literal bug from ZG but fuck the actual content from vanilla like the unarmored mounts"
---
Yes i think we are, and we are actually arguing with people who dont even understand the concept of an MMO without sharding
---
But it won't be classic summer. Let's put it this way, if we would be promised a rainy summer, but it wouldn't rain until the 27th of August, nobody would be thinking that the summer was rainy.
---
Even if you would consider summer to be a few weeks longer, I still think it is misleading to advertise "classic summer", when even in the best case scenario summer is soon over.
---
Wait, now I am second guessing myself. LOL
---
Potentially, the biggest example of situational gear is res gear.  They could also go the route of specific gear working for specific raids but I really dont like quarantining off gear in that way.
---
Another way could be cosmetic only gear with the same stats as other pieces.
---
Hello
---
Need cptn here - blizz is relesaing classic wow remastered or what will be the difference between plaing wow without tbc, wotlk... And so on?
---
Never underestimate the mental gymnastics of Blizz fanboys.
---
For leveling you're really just single target DPSing it down as fury, whirlwind is a long-ish cooldown and without sweeping strikes it doesn't make sense to pull two at once, even if you are at max rage.  
---
In dungeons yeah, perhaps the whirlwind/cleave would be better but I found still it was tough to build enough rage to use those abilities, especially if I missed or dodged and there's zero rage generated for 3-4 seconds.  Compared to icebreaker, I'm bloodthirsting on cooldown and occasionally have extra rage for whirlwind or cleave.
---
Right, but people like me who have brothers playing on the same IP address will be safe from ban, as there will be no way to tell who is sitting at the computer chair. Meaning if you have a family / bunker of chinese people you will be able to rank 14, playing by yourself will be impossible since I will be playing non stop every day until I hit it.
---
Layering is a Classic-specific replacement for sharding.  They're the same thing, except layering is continent-wide instead of zone-wide.  It is also less zealous about actively re-distributing players into different instances.
---
You still run into most all of the same issues as sharding when it comes to world PvP, logging into a dead instance, resource availability, etc.
---
Purps all day
---
Nop, fuck those money grabbers
---
Retail doesn't have those problems because nobody plays the fuckin thing.
---
Additionally - some server might not even experience Layering, and some server might only experience it for a few days or weeks. Only the most populated realms will experience layering for the entire phase 1 period.
---
#slipperyslope
---
No I would prefer 1.12 classic wow.
---
&gt;But I guess no critic is allowed, else you're a just a entitled crybaby
---
Accurate.
---
From the limited info we have, I could see that being possible.  Hopefully we get some more clarification on how it's going to work. 
---
 I will most likely have multiple accounts, if it's possible for me to log on during busy hours and get a few chars into say layer 3, and keep them there so that when the population dies down for the day I can invite my herbalist and limit my competition for herbs I'm going to do it.
---
Yeah. But the likelihood of a server having exactly 3001 people on for long periods of time is pretty unlikely. It varies a lot, so it will even itself out to maybe 7500 people with 9000 peoples worth of resources, just as an example. 
---
The same would happen with depopulated servers. And the opposite (arguably worse) would happen with superservers. Do you have a better suggestion?
---
No one in the United States thinks of September when someone says summer. Cultural norms and definitions are a thing.
---
Haha no thanks.  But true enough.  I'll farm some AV and get TUF like every other noob!  Too bad Mace spec is not really my style but meh.
---
Lmao.
---
Presumably guilds are tethered to a layer based on whoever was on earliest, and layers are semi-persistent when logging out and in to avoid purposeful jumping.
---
So to shift to a new layer, a guild would need every single one of their members to log out and wait, logged out, for a good half hour to an hour to *maybe* get to a new layer.
---
So no, I don't see this being an issue.
---
Need more data, cant compute yet
---
Of course he didn't
---
That's such a succint point. Yes it's really important that any new content released is done as a "patch" not as a expansion.
---
You can respec, but once it hits 50g it becomes a huge nuisance. I was a holy priest, and I would sometimes want to pvp as shadow. Speccing back and forth every week or so really hurts your coin purse that can be spent on consumes or gear.
---
He's saying that has nothing to do with vanilla population because the game was designed for the original max realm pop of 3k back then.
---
&gt; Sharing in the beginning zones is more MMO like than grouping with 5 people constantly for the first 5-10 levels. After that, I agree there shouldn’t be sharding
---
\- Radunny, 8 points 11 days ago 
---
Sounds like you changed your mind in 11 days. Crazy how Tips controls your opinions.
---
Nothing to feel guilty about :) it's cool for sure, I just wanted people who saw this to not think it was for classic is all.
---
really?  thanks for mentioning that, little chance I get in but I check my account everyday now just on the off chance.
---
It’s just an easy way for blizzard to filter out those who really want to play the beta who are willing to resub for it as there’s limited spots
---
23/11/04* FTFY
---
You’re already paying $15 a month to play the game, expansions are $50, and the most unique mounts in game are exclusively in the store. People like collecting mounts and it’s shitty that they have to pay for them on top of paying to play. It’s simple
---
No need for any xpac, just a sub and you'll be able to play both Classic and retail with it.
---
You also need an active sub for a chance to be invited to the beta and to reserve names beforehand.
---
There are a lot of retail cucks roaming around here right now.  Naturally they're alright with it.
---
You can find that information [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule). Blizzard has stated the following:
---
&gt;To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in
---
And also:
---
&gt;opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test
---
This means that to get an invite, the primary criteria is opting-in for the beta, which you can do [here](https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html). Other criteria they are considering is how old your account is and a few other things.
---
Once you receive your beta invite, you are now eligible to **participate** in the beta. This can be done by activating your account via the sub fee and logging in. This information was given in that same announcement as such:
---
&gt;Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
I hope this info has helped.
---
Edit\* : spelling.
---
I have a grueling first semester of my masters starting 1st sept. I fear for my life
---
By this line of thought you shouldn't trust them to make classic to begin with.  
---
  The only reason why wow went off the deep end was because they didn't knew what to do, they had to make new stuff and new systems and what not.  
---
  If you have a core philosophy and a specific audience looking for specific things, it's insanely easy to just create stuff around that.
---
They want to boost subscribers so they can brag about it during their quarterly and yearly investor calls. I suspect at some point down the line we may see a separate sub but for now it will just be the one
---
Really? All they needed was your account name?
---
Has Blizzard stated that there will be multiple sets of resources layered across each shard? If they haven't said anything on either side, these are all assumptions.
---
Vanilla WoW was $15 per month when it was around, I don't see a problem with paying $15 a month for Classic WoW.
---
Highly doubt Blizzard will give a classic only sub for less money.
---
Would the modern wow people be able to the same that they don't want to have to pay $15 a month for classic and just get modern wow for a reduced price?
---
Wouldn't blizzard end up losing money in the long run.
---
You don't get it at all.
---
I'm talking about on-demand layer hopping for refreshed mobs, nodes, and to escape pvp. 
---
4 layers = 4 Prince Nazjaks, 4 lotus nodes, 4 packs of mobs to aoe farm, etc.
---
Bruh.  That stun may not be reliable, but good god when it hits, you notice.
---
Yeah my fox news brainwashed dad gets PISSED if I say anything negative about the country. So stupid. Criticizing your nation is one of the most patriotic things you can do for fucks sake.
---
Subscription price has always been $15 a month.
---
why would you think it will guarantee anything? This is a typical Blizz beta testing. It was always like this, at least with WoW.
---
Im just going to hold out. Ill be going to Loch Modan instead of Westfall and pick up a slightly stronger wand there. I dont want to level a profession just to drop it and have to relevel something else.
---
So they'll go through all that extra effort to recreate bugged content but can't even bother to throw in the original mounts for a few months?
---
tf is wrong with these devs? This is basic shit, we shouldn't need to tell them that the original mounts are important.
---
Big difference. It will be continent wide not every minor quest area like kn BfA. One pop in/out, if at all, beats constantly phasing everywhere you go.
---
No Cross-Realm makes this a very easy pill to swallow, would i prefer seeing thousands on my screen at once trying to tag the same mobs? Sure I guess for the first hour it would be funny but that shit would wear thin as fuck 5 hours later and this seems like a very smart fix.
---
I really hope they go the new content route, there’s so much potential for this game it’s ridiculous and I personally want to ride this train for as long as possible.
---
That is just demonstrably wrong
---
I like the idea of layering. It's like a "shard" but it's server wide.
---
It is not fringe lol, it will be happening on every single server if games are going 24/7 it will be the only way to obtain rank. It not mattering is kind of my point, they are changing the game to convenience players who don't even care, meanwhile hardcore players will be forced to cheat to compete. 
---
Fine by me, I am ready to account share to R14, I am just thinking about the overall health of the PVP scene on servers, this is going to have unwanted consequences and it will be much harder to remove Xrealm BGs after it all goes to shit, than it would be to add Xrealm BGs closer to then final phase (like original vanilla)
---
Lmao, how is it different from sharding at all?
---
1. It lets you hop phases by being invited.
---
2. It merges/multiplies depending on server stress.
---
3. You can end up in different "layers" depending on when you log in.
---
This is sharding but renamed so idiots like you buy it.
---
that's impossible to do 
---
game ruined
---
also it's way too easy to do, people are going to exploit this so bad
---
Those tabs look a lot like notifications on a phone...
---
That's a great idea that could be done as well. Anything that preserves vanillas structure. No flying, there must be 40 man raids and 20 man raids, no in betweens for actual raiding. I do however think that making a new zone, kind of kills the old world, so I don't know how you would do it but I think it's better to keep all the players on azeroth. Otherwise world pvp goes to shit real quick.
---
Indeed
---
Besides the raid opening events though, you can always experience everything if you put in the time and effort to.  The whole reason I skip over MMOs that I haven't played since the start is that so much is missed by not being there at launch, and already classic WoW is potentially doing this before the game is even launched. This combined with the no unarmored mounts announcement has lowered classic pretty hype pretty heavily for me.
---
Hyjal! I knew I was forgetting at least one that made sense.
---
The weird thing is that most people complaining about having class in 2019 didn't play vanilla. If they did they're either a mature age student at university or they were like 9 in vanilla.
---
Yeah they were, then I had to kick them as I just wanted the guild.
---
Authenticity and server cohesiveness &gt; convenience.
---
You mean to say people lie on the internet?
---
And I would not be ok with transmog. But I would like the LFG tool (not the automatic finder) and world quests. 
---
So it's impossible to make a game that will make everyone happy. But I think Blizzard could still make a really good MMO though, if they weren't so limited like they are in WoW.
---
As a healer main I struggled with farming gold. The only way I could maintain gold was by two gathering profs (mining + herb). If an opposite faction dps wanted that node I would be shit out of luck though while on a pvp server. A dps alt is truly the best choice.
---
Is it running Linux? I don't think Chrome OS can even run WoW
---
Did they charge immediately or wont charge until shipment?
---
This please!!
---
Right; I don’t think Layering will behave the same as Shards in this behavior. From what I understood Layers are much larger (continent-wide) pools of players that allow for escalations of instancing but not with the goal of maintaining averaged/minimal populations. My interpretation is that player migration between Layers would be much less than shards. The only indication we have from Bliz that _any_ migration happens in layers is grouping. 
---
You can certainly assume that this system will rebalance similar to shards, but it’s an entirely different system so you’re guessing as well as I am at that.
---
What about parfait? Have you ever met a person and you say, "Let's get some parfait," they say, "Hell no, I don't like no parfait."? Parfaits are delicious!
---
They said it is going to be real tiny so I'm signed up but not really hoping for much and am not going to sub til I either get in or name reservations are available.
---
Loch is a lot of fun and has a very unique timed quest (kill X amount of Y creatures in 5 min or so). Very intense quest!
---
I'm glad that most kids will be in school... so when I take the week after Labor Day off I can grind mostly with just other 18+ try hards
---
Affluent white boomers had a good enough life to never need that level of critical thinking. They now run the country.
---
Same.  I eat meat, but vegetable korma is hand's down my favorite Indian dish.
---
You'd lease a car just so you could be a crash test dummy.
---
It's immediate
---
&gt; Do a /who, jump layers, do another /who. It's super easy to find out how crowded a zone is in a particular layer. 
---
You could get /who for the entire realm, we don't know that. Either way, you would have no reliable way to switch to that layer. When you group with someone you could end up in either layer.
---
Lmao, it's actually the opposite. We're way too calm for this.
---
They're trying to sell us sharding but relabeled.
---
I mean it's beta, who gives a shit. You'll have to do it all again on release anyway. Just play a private server
---
Start a gofundme every month if you’re struggling to cough up an extra $10 in your budget
---
/r/ChoosingBeggars
---
I just realized that, if they follow the same server naming scheme, I’ll never have to deal with players from Ragnaros again.  I know this has nothing to do with your example, but you just made my day!
---
How do you not see the massive problems that come with layering?
---
Layer hopping for resources is going to ruin server economies.
---
Layer hopping to avoid pvp is going to ruin world pvp.
---
Layer hopping for quests will make you see people shard in and out which is going to ruin immersion.
---
Ending up on a 7k pop active server which only allows 3k results in a 4k queue after phase 1 thanks to Layering.
---
Layers holding 3k on a 3.5k pop is going to leave 1 layer with a dead 500 pop.
---
How can you say that layering seems really good if you just think about the consequences?
---
I'm lactose intolerant.
---
Never stopped me before, though.
---
No it wasn't. It was just a tedious process made easier.
---
Or business that want to be nice for paying customers (like every real business in this planet).
---
My post only said they weren't 100% clear. They weren't. I think it actually is likely you need to be subbed to get an invite, but you can't know that for sure from that statement alone. If you think you can, then you lack critical thinking skills and you're the kind of person Blizzard hopes will give them $15 for a sliver of hope.
---
"Lil Timmy" Good one dude. I suppose that is on par with the creativity of your username so props for being consistent at least.
---
Hello and welcome to 2019!
---
Dual talents was Wotlk
---
&gt;I'd take free realm transfers from low pop servers any day over this.
---
Not sure how this would help with 5k+ people fighting over the same mob on launch day.
---
Astronomical summer is as made up a concept as any other. In most cases, summer matters to us in terms of temperature and weather, by being the hottest time of the year. This doesn't coincide with astronomical summer for most places. I've also personally always found it strange to have summer officially begin at the same time as MIDsummer (June 21). I don't know about the US, but here in Europe people for most basic purposes think of June, July and August as summer, as they together typically compose the warmest quarter of the year. Meterologically speaking, summer starts when certain temperature thresholds are met, but this is more locally defined. I'd wager that more people across the northern hemisphere think of June through August as summer, in comparison to June 21st to September 23rd
---
Sorry for the long response lol.
---
Hahaha that comment got me. Sorry for your luck bud. It’ll all work out
---
Oh I agree. But sucks for them.
---
Having an alt not only for gold farming, but for variety and changing up the role you play is extremely fun. It also broadens your horizon on being a better tank from a dps or healing perspective. You don’t always see everything when you play one role/class.
---
You are saying having a brother who grinds for you for weeks every day from 2 AM - 9 AM (for an account he doesn't even own) is not a fringe scenario?
---
Besides that, if someone is online for 72 hours straight then it will raise some flags anyways.
---
Northeast what?
---
If you want a *chance* to play in the beta you gotta cough up $15. It's glorified gambling.
---
Archimonde exploded when he was killed by the wisps in the ending cinematic of Wacraft 3: Reign of Chaos.
---
Actually there should not be any corpse :)!
---
So what?  At least it will be cohesive like an MMO _should_ be.
---
they said they are using new server names
---
Well it is called the slippery slope fallacy for a reason.
---
We all did JUST FINE in 2004 to 2007. Can you find any complaints between that time frame about "dead servers" or people not being able to find groups for stuff? I played HEAVILY from day 1 until 2007, I was on all forums possible for the damn game. I saw not a SINGLE post of anyone complaining about dead servers or not able to find groups.
---
This is why A LOT of us are kinda like ok well what the fuck?
---
Layering isn't only to allow people to actually play, it's to allow people to actually get a mob to kill. There will be hundreds, probably thousands, in each starting zone. Good luck getting a single quest mob without layering.
---
As far as i understood they will be capping servers even when using layer technology to prevent this issue. If 3 streamers start on Mankrik and the cap is set at 12,000 total, they will start the queue there. Most people won't join a server where the queue is at 10,000 with estimated wait time of 10 hours. But I get the concern and I doubt they will be able to hit a 100% perfect balance here.
---
all they needed was my real life identity card
---
My birthday is the 28th, this is awesome!!!
---
Please. Fucking please.
---
I mean that's how it works on retail with sharding. Why would it be different?
---
Can't you just play for a few hours every couple days and then more on the weekend?
---
"I'm very confident" that the majority of players will not even clear naxx by the time some people are demanding new content.
---
If you give it to them the gear gap gets even wider and pvp doesn't make any sense. Already by the time naxx hits, many people are doing earlier raids or even still leveling. The game shouldn't cater to the minority of people willingly burning through all the content at lighting speed. Unless all people are given the change to experience the existing content new stuff doesn't make sense.
---
People don't want welfare epics. But they do want a chance to get them before old content becomes irrelevant, even if they are playing at a more relaxed pace. And if new content doesn't make old irrelevant(catchup items), it makes an even bigger gap between players.
---
Layering is to combat what traditionally would of been huge queues and long queue wait time.
---
Hence some realms might not even experience Layering, some realms may experiencing Layering for a few days, or a few weeks.
---
The high pop realms which remain high pop longer than the initial few weeks, will be using Layering for much longer period. Effectively it could be for the entire phase 1 period.
---
At the end of phase 1, layer will be disabled for those few realms still using them.
---
For those high pop realms this will introduce queues, and possible long queue times. Blizzard will then need to decide  if and how to deal with that issue for these high pop realms. They could raise server caps or they could offer free server transfers off the realm.
---
Will be interesting to see which direction Blizzard takes and also what the feedback of those affected realms is, when that scenario arrives.
---
I’m not “clinging” to anything, it’s a video game. It’s not that serious. Anyways, everything Ive said and everything you’ve said is entirely speculation. We’re never going to replicate vanilla WoW and have it be 110% the same experience. That just won’t happen. This to me seems to be best case scenario.
---
haha summer at the start of september, dont make the world laugh, "Classic summer" What a joke
---
Never skip leg day.
---
It’s going to be mobile exclusive
---
People *will* be popping in and out though, it's confirmed friends and guildies will layer hop if invited to group on a different layer. So yea, you're definitely going to be seeing people pop in and out of existence as they group with their friends and guild mates to do dungeons etc. Also it raises questions about abuse, I'm sure griefers will love getting someone into a 1v1 fight and having their friend pop into existence behind them. Not to mention, how long does phase 1 last? Are we going to have layering for 2-3 months? Because that seems excessive to me.
---
Not saying layering is all bad though, I do think it's a fairly nice solution to the impending population crash. However it has some *serious* caveats IMO, for me it's duration of phase 1 and potential layer hopping abuse.
---
I think you're right, I'll have to rewatch that. I guess I'm most interested to see if the layers are persistent once made or not, as that could lead to what I was thinking.
---
Uhm... It's not like they are at school/college 24/7.
---
They might miss a few hours depending on when exactly servers will open, but that won't kill them.
---
Recently uninformed but previous-classic player here. But why has it taken so long for this to come to fruition? Seems like this has been a long road for a seemingly straight-forward (?) reboot.
---
Good to know.
---
I like it!
---
This is literally more difficult to do than to just camp the nodes normally if there wasn't layering. Still doable, yes, but more difficult than it would be with no layering.
---
What the hell are people even complaining about now?
---
How can you ruin economys that don't even exist yet?   
---
You cant hop while in combat.  
---
Who said anything about queues? 
---
So you want queues? How is it different than blizz pushing dead severs from before?
---
\^ this is the saddest shit i read on this stupid website. just eat your slop you fat greedy hogs - quality doesn't matter in the slightest and if it does you are a whiner and unfaithful to the almighty blizzard enteretainment.
---
3PM PST would be noon in HI, wouldn't it?
---
&gt; These anouncments show a lot of greed from Blizzard
---
That's ridiculous. They have a team working on Classic, that started out not knowing how successful it would be. They aren't selling a box game. It's free for whoever has a regular sub. If they wanted to be greedy about it, then classic would have charged to buy the client, and a totally separate sub from the main game.
---
Giving subs preferental treatment on name reservation isn't out of line. Until you pay, you aren't a customer. So why should you get first dibs on reserving a name.
---
This shits stupid as hell lol
---
Probably just going to wait for tbc realms and stick to arena
---
Blizzard makes wow free to play with no microtransactions
---
"Oh great, here come the cheap casuals!"
---
Hey, at 6:55 in the tips out interview they specify it is per PLAY SESSION. So login will change your later.
---
&gt;but given Blizzard’s marketing I don’t think it’s wildly unreasonable that people expected a release sometime in July.
---
What on earth gave you this impression? They stated it would be a summer release. Late August leaves a month of summer. Any  misunderstanding you had about this is strictly on *you.* It's not like they had graphics of Rangnaros and Sylvanas in swimwear bouncing a beachball with a big **WOW SUMMER FUN** above them. 
---
How the fuck are there so many people here that don't know summer end in September? Fucking mind boggling.
---
Yeah, now you can all go grind this silly slow paced game that became outdated 10 years ago. I cannot understand how, with all the advancements in video games that everyone is hyped to press 1-5 repetitively again.
---
You are full of inaccurate information. There are a lot of players who are educators and were looking forward to using their "summer" to play classic wow. Don't be so dense.
---
Economy will be shared through all layers too. All sharing the same auction house and chat.
---
Lolled at this
---
Well we know that the devs read Reddit. We have to ask our questions en masse and make our voices heard so we can hopefully get some answers.
---
Good luck making that gear in a way that it wont trivialize some content. Remember ToC/IC dungeons and what they did to 80% of the previous content? Yea the same  thing will happen again.
---
&gt; Maybe they can release gear that balances some of the class specs. For  example, a decent balance druid or ret pally set. Or even a prot pally  set that gives a taunt as a 2 piece set bonus. 
---
This can break the game.
---
\#hyppe
---
Yeeeaaahhhh no mercy gonna crush yo all
---
Either way. Questing at preferred mount areas while at correct level kills two birds with one stone.
---
Nah best album bud
---
I played on one of the biggest PvP servers and thought battlegroups were a great addition. Premades would actually get some variety rather than just running into the same couple groups repeatedly, and you would still bump into your nemeses often. The only negative was that our instant queues were normalized, but that was so that others with very long queues could get better.
---
I’m gonna be at burning man.  Now I kinda don’t wanna go.
---
If it isn't that easy then how will two people from different layers group up for anything..?
---
Holy shit, I was so happy (and spreading upvotes) because I thought this was a victory - I assumed them never sharding past phase 1 was not mutually exclusive with sharding in starting zones. They're just moving goalposts now? That changes everything. What the fuck Blizzard, you're just sharding the entire experience?
---
The main thing about new WoW is the Zandalari. They are everything I wanted from playable trolls.
---
It can be adding content in lower tiers without necessarily creating new tiers
---
Lol signatures wont be an issue. I'm about 90% positive my guild will have at LEAST 10 humans ready to go, or make an alt and log over to sign the charter real quick =).
---
Good.  Keeps the kids away so the adults can play
---
I agree with this. Its frustrating for students/teachers. Like others have said, aug. 27 is not a classic summer, its a classic fall. Yes i know its technically in the summer, but at the very very tail end. Yes, release date is nice. But those us who thought that "a classic summer" meant that for most of the summer we would be able to play classic, the frustration is reasonable. 
---
Not to mention the sub only beta. Lets be honest, that was meant to have a last minute panic sub-fest, and is a little gimicky.
---
All that being said, im still glad its coming out at all. It will still be worth the wait
---
thank you all this information that it turns out you didnt actually have
---
layering is basicly them releasing twice as many servers at launch and then merging them after 2 months
---
Today had a bunch of shattering news =D
---
Did they say what time tomorrow it starts?
---
Authenticity and server cohesion &gt; convenience.  I'd take the queues any day.
---
Imagine you end up on a server where 80% of the population leave after 2weeks. Is that not equal to or greater than all the problems you have listed.
---
Come on guys share this we need some more upvote for that post
---
I was only trying to let people know there are other options, that they arent totally screwed if they wait.
---
Yes, that's correct.
---
That sounds correct yeah. From what I've gathered reading all morning is that you are stuck in whatever layer you originally get into. You will not be moving around layers at all unless 1) You somehow have a friend that invites you to another layer wherein you will stay forever now. 2) You are somehow in a different layer than whatever layer your guild is anchored to in which case you will go to that layer and stay there forever.
---
Other than that you are not going to phase. All of this is temporary as well so once the influx of tourists dies down it will be turned off and there will be 1 server with 1 instance and if it's still populated will have queues.
---
I think it's conservative to say that the populations will drop after the final merge.
---
nice word salad
---
Sad but true
---
I received and email notification for BFA beta access. I would think it’s safe to assume you’d receive one for classic
---
Troll shaman - horde and shaman being the 2 things i've never given a proper chance.
---
Hi, /u/C_North_
---
You just doubled my excitement!
---
Phase 1 tops, not 1 month tops. 
---
Take Ions dick out of your ear and listen for once maybe.
---
i smashed that upvote. we need more of you in the r/gameofthrones subreddit
---
That has to be it
---
Absolutely not. Even with all the talk about giving older accounts a leg up in the beta invites I wouldn't. I'm happy to be part of a testing group for a game I want to succeed but I'm not going to sub to a product I heavily dislike to do so.
---
I hope they do it in a way that allows Vanilla to still be active.
---
So the biggest takeaway is that post phase 1 this is 100% gone. And it might be gone or less prevelent  after first month.  I will tolerate this. It's like sharding but not so immersion breaking
---
Been unsubbed for a while, what's good about them? aesthetics?
---
if I have a month of play time available on my account but not currently active am I eligible for the beta?
---
Not everyone has 30-1hr+ to wait for one BG queue to pop for a 4v5 game, this is a necessary change to adapt to eventual burnout that will come by the time P3 occurs. 
---
Also GY farming one player is not a legitimate strategy in a battleground ever. It doesn’t help your argument.
---
Listen to the interview again. "The entire eastern kingdoms and kalador as ONE SINGLE world". You will be in that single layer with everyone of the cap "lets say 3000" every time you log in. Their exception to this rule is partying up with friends is when you would transition.
---
And just FYI you claimed it was every time you logged in from your original post
---
While all valid concerns, I think many are overestimating exactly how easy it will be to tell which layer you are in, and the difficulty with which to move between layers.
---
We just learned about this system today, and already there are people that supposedly know more about how it will be used than the devs who designed it.
---
A new fire resist raid grim batol, a raid to follow up on that uldaman quest line that leads to a deadend. They had tons of u finished stories.
---
There's a Forbes article with Brack where the says that if Classic is successful then they have the means to add TBC or WOTLK servers.
---
The stress tests last for 1 day and are all conveniently about a month apart from each other. You'll need 2 tokens at minimum if you want to participate in all three stress tests.
---
Better save that gold for the actual launch where you can use it to pay for 30 days of classic WoW.
---
Bro classic didn't even come out yet. Chill
---
Stared at this for 2 minutes before i realized it was an actual world map
---
Don't you guys have phones?!
---
In the middle of an ocean with no access to internet for 6 months. I picked the wrong branch.
---
Captured my emotions completely
---
I would rather buy a 30 dollar box and pay a seperate sub from retail than deal with the bullshit that they're announcing as a result of the two being so closely tied.
---
I'm pretty sure they'd just fork the game into new servers for tbc/wrath/other xpacs, that are separate from the classic servers.  The classic servers would still stay as classic.
---
Yay right before classes start so I can ruin my future and play classic.
---
Totally agree. I went feral the moment BC dropped because I needed to level and then learned they fixed the talent tree to give druids -to crit so they could actually tank without the spikes in damage from not being anywhere near def cap and depending on armor and dodge % to make it through.
---
Never looked back and yanked everything I ran in BC and WoTLK
---
Colonel Mustard in Ironforge.
---
When did the actual loot cards come out for the TCG? I know the TCG came out just before TBC but did the loot cards appear at first? I dont remember it being until WOTLK?
---
Check your download folder, you'll see there's a retail subfolder. It's very possible there will be a separate folder for Classic while some files will be common.
---
So yes, most likely you'll have to download another client, not as big as retail though.
---
You don't phase or teleport if you are actively in combat.
---
I'd be pissed about that. The black saber also has a knock off mount from the redone ZG.
---
where did they say that
---
Classic will fail hard if it asks more than 5 bucks a month
---
Yeah there's a 50-50 chance I fail next semester of uni
---
&gt;I'd be ok with transmog
---
That has nothing to do with free realm transfers. Free realm transfers wouldn't help you at the start.
---
Instead of asking for possible TBC, let's ruin classic instead. Just let it be, and if you get so bored, Pservers have a solution...fresh servers. Something that classic should do instead of "trying to balance classes, add new dungeons". Yea no thanks, i don't want a second ToC/IC dungeon bullshit to happen again.
---
awwww
---
That's TRUE
---
Nice! Is the grind horrible to get them? I might sub to opt in for beta
---
ok.
---
I’m not even gonna try to read this meme.
---
&gt; Another thing to realize about the layering system is that it will NOT be cross realm, so the server community will still be there even at launch, just split across the layers.
---
This is a pretty good comprise.
---
big lmao @ u
---
sharding is fine in starting zones, which they initially planned as per Blizzcon: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w
---
And I said "ok whatever, its only for Coldridge Valley or Valley of Trials or Northshire" and now they reneg the offer and instead cram phasing down our throats for all of phase 1?
---
Hell no br8, I'm not going to accept that.
---
Ion lied, and I am pretty sure this will be the first in a long series of classic lies.
---
Just try it Ion and I swear if it isn't changed in 14 days, me and my whole guild will be deleting our accounts.
---
Mace spec and the USF proc can proc independently if I recall, and stuns didn't DR so if you got really lucky, your opponent would have a baaaad day.
---
Economy will be ruined from sheer volume of things being looted/gathered due to one server functionally holding multiple times the population the game was designed for. Instead of a normal 2500-3k cap you might have 7-10k people on a popular server separated into say 4 "Layers". The private servers that have those kinds of populations have all sorts of economy problems due to massive overpopulation. This will be the same thing, just achieved differently.
---
It's not a bad idea it depends on how they will use it. I understand many people want this "real" vanilla feeling to them and server community is a big part of this. Give them some time. I actually don't understand why people are so paranoid about all of this. What benefit will blizzard have from destroying realms with sharding and stuff (honest question). It's not like they can charge you to get rid of it or something like that.
---
I remember spectral tigers being a thing in TBC atleast
---
Layering is a mistake. The first few weeks and months where you’re leveling up is extremely crucial for building friendships.
---
Server communities are 100% in-tact when servers merge. The old server retains it's community from day 1 to merge. The merging only ADDS to their community, boosting the economy and gameplay experience. The only drawback is name conflicts, but easily fixed and for some a welcoming opportunity to change their name - for free.It's greed buddy, it's called shareholders for a corporation. They want to see profits and this is a product at the end of the day meant to do just that, push profits as hard as possible. This can't be done when 100% of the playerbase can't login day one due to queues. Complaints = loss of subscriptions. But make no mistake about it, sharding/layering, whatever you want to call it, completely shreds the community feel to this game. The core reason WoW become a world in of itself especially during it's first iteration, Vanilla.
---
This is a poor decision but makes the most sense technologically.
---
You need Exalted with the Zandalari. So quests + World Quests.
---
$15 dollars ?
---
Depressing you have this many upvotes when you’re so deluded
---
You just don't get it, do you
---
You are right. How are you supposed to add to your friend's list people in a different layer if you can only see the ones in your own layer ?  
---
It's seems to me like it'll be much more time consuming to go from layer to layer (if no addon exists obviously).
---
Dude I'm on a fucking quest right now upvoting every /u/Sable17 answer.
---
Wait, you are comparing players' interest in classic and seriously think that players who haven't been active in years, but went out of their way to check the box for the beta are less likely interested in classic wow than players who play retail?
---
Yeah I was joking, it just feels so much further behind us on the east coast
---
Nice, Saved.
---
nobody with a brain wants the rest of wow
---
&gt;Also would be nice if they added social-events
---
They definitely need to add in more fun random world events.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25tkxg5Vws](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j25tkxg5Vws)
---
that's exactly what makes this problematic! because so few players will be high enough level to take advantage of this system relative to the number of players in game early on, there will be a small group of people with a large number of layers to play around with and very little competition. if things aren't set up properly, a small subset of the server could farm up way more than intended before the number of layers start to shrink down to accommodate a shrinking playerbase
---
&gt; You don't understand what you're talking about.
---
rofl, okay.
---
&gt; but STOP trying to invalidate people who have genuine points
---
It's not a genuine point, it's just your opinion, which you are trying to pass off as fact.
---
Well it's more like so folks can see that beta invites really do exist and art a figment of the imagination. Number of redditors sent invites definitely won't reflect the total of beta invites sent
---
Depends on your time frame and server dynamics. Looking for current income in gold you're probably better off farming straight gold. If you're looking for future income then I'd be looking at acquiring items that are inflation protected. Whether this is directly farming them or farming gold and purchasing off the AH depends on your GP/h farming and AH prices/availability, compared to straight up farming the item, and any competition that comes with it.
---
Gold is deflationary long term so really only hold enough for your liquidity needs and hold the rest in items that'll preserve value.
---
It's literally the same suggestion many people had:  Launch "bundled" servers with a unique name pool then merge those bundles seamlessly a few months in.   
---
The only difference is, the bundles are invisible and you can actually join your friend(s) on their bundle instead of being stuck separate until the merges happen.   It's quite literally one of the most popular alternative solutions I've seen people post about to sharding...only made better and more streamlined.
---
Beta will be live for months. With a 30 level cap the world pvp at Tauren mill/southshore is going to be a pretty unique experience. I subbed for the first time since wotlk, fingers crossed I get in but I doubt I will.
---
Stupid question but will the beta characters be wiped at launch or not?
---
I paid **$202.43** including shipping to EU
---
Man I'm going to have to do this.
---
the ... emerald dream?
---
Wow speedy meme sir
---
Didn't they announce this like 2 years ago?
---
***"Ok kids, hop in the car! Were going to the beach, Disney World, Universal Studios and the Washington DC Smithsonian!"***           
---
             
---
"WOW, this will be the best summer ever!"               
---
***"Yup, enjoy it, it's the last fucking one your getting!"***
---
Bro if you love sharding this much maybe you ought to go play BfA?
---
I'd like a source on the whole "Layer changes every time you relog"
---
Because what I found was that
---
"However, unlike sharding once in a layer, players won't leave this layer in favor of a better one whenever they move or change zones, removing the awkward phasing present in retail. The only way to change a layer will be to enter a group, which will have all players from the group in the same layer."
---
Maybe bans have been issued, though my friends never experienced a ban, maybe if you are account sharing and you tell people in game that you are doing it would get you banned, but that would be your own stupidity.
---
and the guy who can only play at night wont be getting rank 14 in any scenario (xrealm or not) so that point seems moot.
---
I am not against them adding in xrealm BGs on the naxx patch, but having it on pvp release will make account sharing mandatory to hit rank 14.
---
I mean it doesnt matter, it seems pretty set in stone anyway that it will be on release. Just stating my opinion that it will be bad for rankers who don't have anyone in the same household to play for them.
---
First of all, it's a maximum of all phase 1, not just guaranteed. It could be a few weeks, depends on the load.
---
Secondly, I'd you refuse to accept it then don't play. Your choice. I'll happily be playing and actually being able to level up whilst you're not. I don't mind.
---
Doing God's work my friend.  These are stellar!
---
 I'm finishing up college so it feels great knowing I can enjoy WoW properly. (Until my job gets in the way I guess).
---
You talk like it will be easy to change layer. But it won't.
---
Enlighten me oh great one
---
Dude, read agan, i said i was not exited for beta. I don't complain about sub fee either, but the "pay us money and u have a chance to play beta is so extra grabby. Most of us have noe desire to pay anything before release, and it said classic summer.
---
I'm not sure what class should I main, since I never played vanilla.
---
Amen, tis a rabbit hole
---
Lmao. Right. Because youre just going to happen to have people in multiple layers that you know on demand to be able to hop and kill rares? That to you is a bigger issue than 3000 people in one place trying to kill the same starter mobs?
---
Well, the more I can mine the more profitable it will be in the future. One truth I've found for mmos is exploit early and often. I don't mean actual game breaking stuff but stuff like mining materials being easier at the start is a great example of something to take advantage of.
---
&gt;Layer hopping for resources is going to ruin server economies.
---
How do you tell what layer you are in? How do you control which layer you are in? How would you go about establishing a "layer hopping mafia" and make it work without known what layer you are in?
---
&gt;Layer hopping to avoid pvp is going to ruin world pvp.
---
So you think everyone in WoW is going to have a buddy on standby to toss them an invite as soon as they see an enemy? Would they just yell over discord "SOMEONE INVITE PLZ RIGHT NEOW" and hope that their buddy is in a different layer?  Now that you're grouped with someone in the same layer, how are you going to pull this stunt off again?
---
&gt;Layer hopping for quests will make you see people shard in and out which is going to ruin immersion.
---
Can you explain how someone could abuse quests by sharing into a new layer? Do you have your buddy doing the same quest in an area, and as soon as one runs out of mobs, they invite their buddy? How do you get back into a fresh shard?
---
&gt;Ending up on a 7k pop active server which only allows 3k results in a 4k queue after phase 1 thanks to Layering.
---
How would remove sharing solve this problem? Do you want to have all servers have a 3-5k queue?
---
&gt;Layers holding 3k on a 3.5k pop is going to leave 1 layer with a dead 500 pop.
---
Again, how would sharding remove a low pop server problem? Before they implemented crossrealm worlds, there would be dozens of servers with a few hundred people on them
---
&gt;How can you say that layering seems really good if you just think about the consequences?
---
Idk, If you sit down and think how much coordination, time, and effort it would take to game the system, it isn't worth most players time. Plus they're GOING AWAY after phase 1. This will be a tiny blip in your memory 2 years from now.
---
But hey, if this news makes you this upset, then wait until phase 2 comes out before you start playing. Problem solved!
---
Depends on the size of the layers really.
---
And they could shard the newbie zones in the layers ...
---
Please blizzard PLEASE content after 60. OSRS style.
---
Sure many of us love and miss BC and Wrath... but we know how that road ends, in disappointment. I loved BC more than anything, but private servers couldn’t hold my interest the same as vanilla ones. It truly was the start of the game we see now...
---
Move on beyond phase 6. In my opinion start with some pvp rewards. Perhaps on the level with the blue set, or similar to the BG rep rewards. Azshara Crater anyone? Or maybe make Hyjal into a mega zone and somewhere in there a fitting challenge for us pvp players to seek new gear beyond the existing rewards.
---
Of course we would all love new 5/20/40 man content too. I just believe the first step in adding to the game would be fresh pvp content.
---
But no matter what many of us would love to see the original design continued! Maybe even into Outland or Northrend by phase 10...
---
Speak for yourself. Right now I'm really close to NOT accepting it and just quitting before it even starts.
---
If they do add more content post Naxx they better still keep real Classic servers as well, not everyone wants this. I don't know why people think Blizz is capable of making content that will be true to vanilla anyway, it's going to feel like BFA content being injected into it.
---
#neverskiplegday
---
Was my face 100%
---
I'll be a week in and thinking about my fallen brothers and sisters who are in the classroom instead of in The Barrens
---
I'm sorry.
---
This couldn't be releasing at a better time for me. I requested that week off for my birthday months ago. I may never be this lucky again.
---
Meh we play games for fun. The pserver I'm on is extremely active and so far been pretty fun and nostalgic. 
---
Alot of people want to get into beta to try out classes and Vanilla mechanics and it's a great place to do that. 
---
Sadly others are already looking at Classic like another job.
---
The server I'm on has already stated it will close when classic releases.  I just consider it like a beta or a chance to tinker with things until classic.
---
And as stated it's not like beta wouldn't be a waste of time using your logic.
---
"Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. "
---
If you read the paragraph and take the context clues, you will see that its grey at best. Could they have done better with communicating if you do or do not need one? Yes, did they specifically say "you have to have a sub to get invite" NO
---
Ret is definitely not fine even in "non minmaxy" situations. They barely do 50% of the damage that the top dps does.
---
Hahahah! 
---
This is literally my anniversary. We are doomed.
---
How about equal ilvl gear to naxx, just for other specs (feral, ret, enhancement, etc)
---
Not the case. The beta page indicates that to have the chance at being invited requires an active subscription (and further informs that an active subscription is not a guarantee).
---
How's he wrong? So you also consider December fall? Is June spring?
---
seek help
---
They adressed that in the interview, yes that is what happens. It is sharding, or atleast very similar to sharding, with a lot of changes that make it seem like a very tangible solution.
---
Shit that sounds exhausting. How long does it take?
---
I got mine in TBC so ya, maybe late TBC Classic they may do that.
---
They will probably come right after Classic, just like it was years and years ago
---
I’m not sure I did it before they came out. Sorry.
---
During a Dev interview they said if it's linked to your current account you will have access to the original CE rewards in classic
---
My gut reaction was hating this, but it's basically the same as my favorite solution: open lots of small servers like 2005 had, but merge them more aggressively when pops starts to drop. 
---
As long as we don't see a different layer every time we login, I like this idea.
---
My guess would be purchased DLC that comes with a server transfer to the Classic+ or BC server
---
On a tuesday? RIP for all day maintenance
---
Classic WoW and new Tool album all in the same week damnnnn
---
I'm sorry but if you think smashing separate organic communities together = 100% intact community, then I'm going to go ahead and say 
---
&gt;Please research before you argue.
---
The thing is I want to play a hunter as long it is good. The further Classic goes, the worse hunter get because of the shitty scaling.
---
Y’all really are ridiculous. You won’t even be level 45 by the time layering is over. Let alone coordinated enough for you to worry about it. The only people who might even have to think about this are the turbo nerds who have done vanilla 6 times over on private servers. Simmer down now y’all.
---
Wasn’t it a bug fix instead of a nerf? I thought the problem was some tentacle spawning in unreachable places.
---
People don't have the same playstyles as you, and their priorities are different than yours.
---
Just because you don't care doesn't mean people who do are wrong.
---
Things that happen in phase-1 can matter for the entirety of Classic.
---
There are people who are playing SOLELY for things that occur in phase-1.
---
That's what your mom said
---
Is two screens actual worth it in wow?
---
Lol, I did the same at the end of BC
---
I was going to reroll in Wrath anyway and a guildmate offered me $400. Only character on there over 20 was my T4 holy Paladin.
---
To be fair, Criticizing without proposing a solution is just bitching and whining. 
---
I think a lot of the boomers dont pay attention to the youth anymore because their conversations go something like this. 
---
"SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM IS BROKEN! \*provides actual issues that should be addressed\*"
---
"What can we do?"
---
"I DON'T KNOW IT'S NOT MY JOB TO THINK. IT'S BROKEN. YOU FIX IT!!!! RABBLE RABBLE RABBLE DAMN BOOMERS!"
---
I can see you are struggling with what I wrote so I will break it down for you:  
---
Day 1 Server A 3000 people all together  
---
Day 200 Server A 1000 people all together
---
No sharding or layering, never seen anyone from any layer or other server before.  
---
Day 201 Server A must merge with Server B
---
Day 202 Server A is now 2000 people, everyone from server A still intact with each other but must meet new people from Server B.  
---
Server A never lost it's sense of community, it only had to welcome the new community to theirs that already existed.
---
Sharding/layering is so fluid you never know what server you are on and who you will see day to day. The community is never intact. Warning, if the above doesn't make sense to you then you might be retarded.
---
Also also also: lists
---
That’s pretty dope.
---
All I am saying the developers were interviewed and they said they would be open to post content... say what you will about "your" Vanilla... the truth is it is owned and operated by blizzard and they put in things some of us didn't want for classic anyway -- layering, modern ui elements, etc...   
---
If it does come I just hope we get a final version of the map as presented in the manual.
---
Yep, I suspect you can still get an invite without a sub and it will just pop up the error you get in retail for not having a sub. Why? Because thats how it will work when Classic goes live, gotta test and make sure it works
---
If we all follow each other on twitch... we can all be streamers together and get in.
---
Not the date
---
There's no blue post about layering because they know it's a negative which no one welcomes with open arms.
---
Is this praxis?
---
So why on earth would you join a guild in Phase 1?
---
Don't join a guild on WoW only on Discord.
---
Then abuse this crappy sharding for rare spawn farms etc. Spread out your guild best you can.
---
Guild wars 2 does something like this. If a particular layer’s population goes below a certain threshold, you will be asked if you want to hop to a more populated server, and doing so will give you a short rested XP bonus.
---
Just because they think it, doesn't make it any less factually wrong.  Nice try though.
---
Multiboxing has never been against the rules. Obviously account sharing is, they do a pretty god job of suspending accounts now if any fishy ip hopping is going on but I think you'd be fine if you're in the same state at least. I dunno what the exact criteria is, definitely don't account share with someone in China...
---
&gt; If done right - old gear isn’t invalidated
---
They've done this in the past and it doesn't work. If the gear isn't better people don't want to do it.
---
They wouldn’t have the same feeling of achievement. They’re not cool looking mounts. It just means that you’re “better” than everyone else cuz you got your epic mount very fast.
---
WHAT!?
---
Only a few rares are worthwhile so it wouldn't be too bad.
---
Im excited, ill gladly go beta test if i get chosen by the giant metal hand in the sky.
---
My understanding of the resistence to server mergers is because it sends a message to investors that the game might not be performing at the desired level.
---
&gt;^^^EEE^EEE^EEE^EEE
---
I see it as sharding without most of the things that make sharding bad - especially with the parts that conflict most deeply in Vanilla, where modern wow is a different beast. So, to me, that's way different.
---
Bro we just got all news TODAY and you've been hedging your bets this whole time hahahaha!
---
You ain't fooling anyone, sport.
---
And for a whole phase too
---
Lmfao it’s $15 dollars.
---
Thank goodness the discussion police are here to save us all from unnecessary discussion!
---
It's not phasing. It's layering essentially mini servers. 2-3k players per layer. It's still going to be crowded as F and isn't the same as sharding. Read before you freak out.
---
Name reservation 2 weeks prior to release date is bullshit.
---
8 AM launch for aussies, too easy lol.
---
&gt;Maybe bans have been issued, though my friends never experienced a ban
---
Yeah but that was 2005. In the last 14 years Blizzard became better at enforcing rules, banning botter and hackers etc.
---
&gt;and the guy who can only play at night wont be getting rank 14 in any scenario (xrealm or not) so that point seems moot.
---
How is it moot though? Just because he can't reach rank 14? I want legit players being able to PvP and not being punished because some idiots break the rules. Ban the account shares, the hackers and the cheaters and don't punish legit players.
---
&gt;I am not against them adding in xrealm BGs on the naxx patch, but having it on pvp release will make account sharing mandatory to hit rank 14
---
It wont. People achieved rank 14 without account sharing in vanilla after cross realm BGs released. 
---
Account sharing would be an unfair advantage either way. With or without X realm BGs.
---
&gt;I mean it doesnt matter, it seems pretty set in stone anyway that it will be on release. Just stating my opinion that it will be bad for rankers who don't have anyone in the same household to play for them.
---
I understand your point. I just think it wont be as big of an issue you ard making it out to be. Especially if Blizzard keeps an eye on potential account sharers.
---
Nah I’m good
---
/thread
---
I think he just wants to play the beta and is angry he needs a sub to retail? IDK
---
Activision Blizzard continues a trend blizzard had in the 90's, I really doubt media has much to do with anything.
---
&gt; 3000+ people to create a new "layer", lol.
---
If that's the case, then how does this solve ANY of the problems on day 1? 1500 people in Elwynn is still gonna cause a lot of mob competition issues.
---
This is a non-solution and only introduces problems.
---
Yes. Totally the same thing
---
Can be Spell names? Like Holy fire?
---
anyways, Yrel, Tyrande, Void, N'zoth
---
Well that's quite a bit shittier then, if the case
---
Tier sets that support 'offbrand' specs. Balance, Feral, Shadow, Elemental, Enhance, ect.
---
I'm loving all these premium-tier posts with good, thought out questions.
---
*takes a large bite out of a beautifully layered onion*
---
Here in Europe it starts at midnight. I think that by the end of my (looong) first classic session I will already look like the corpse in the picture ! :D
---
All the college/school kids in here bitching, guess what? You werent the target demographic of Classic WoW in the fist place! The stats show the vast majority of classic players are past schooling. Get fucked!
---
You no longer get to match up against top players/guilds in your realm.  This takes away from excitement in world pvp when you go up against these people you recently played in BGs.  You may be farming for tubbers in felwood and come across someone from a great premade pvp guild and know what could come if you get into an altercation.  No cross realm meant that you could understand who on your realm was really the most dominant.  When they added cross realm bgs is when I lost interest in vanilla and eventually quit.
---
&gt; rofl, okay.
---
You described my early-game concerns as "all endgame".
---
You thought my next concern was that it would "help speed levelers".
---
If that isn't evidence that you don't know what you're talking about I don't know what to tell you.
---
Your input into this thread should be a post that says "layering doesn't hurt my particular playstyle so I'm okay with it", and that's it, because you have nothing else to offer.
---
The Nicker
---
Not just older accounts, but currently active accounts. Meaning if you resubbed today hoping to get a chance at beta its going to be slim to none.
---
Classic+...
---
my god...
---
No. They need to beta test. Get the fuck over it.
---
And yes, I was a Vanilla player up through Naxx. Wait until August like everyone else. You're not afforded special privileges because you were around longer.
---
Huh?
---
Blizzard stated already that they'd take long time subs over new subs.
---
ILL BE ON VACATION LMAO. WE'RE DOOMED
---
I played through vanilla,tbc, wrath,cata,panda, and draneor launches.  They were all playable and i got very far even with the bullshit.
---
Me too. I know this would imply major changes content-wise, but regarding the lore I'd love if they made some sort of alternative plotline where Kael'Thas ended up joining the Horde and not becoming this "hahaha I'm evil!" sort of loot piñata.
---
You've given me a sliver of a hope, but I'm still firmly of the belief (as is most of this sub) that you need a sub in order to even get invited. We need clarification from Blizzard on this ASAP.
---
Exactly why below I questioned how they would make sense of it. But we don’t know what they expect, maybe they’re only expecting 100,000 players and get blown away when there are 500,000 early subs for it and they figure they have to substantially increase what they’re prepared for
---
I don’t think people trust blizzard to follow through with removing it.
---
People like the simplicity and reward structure of the early version. For example, it was difficult and time consuming to get to max level in classic, now you can get max level in days and it's basically impossible to die while questing
---
Everything that exists in the game in each respective Phase will be in it's 1.12 state.  Items, BG's, spells/talents, etc.  It should be assumed that mechanics surrounding things like rep would be in their 1.12 state as well.
---
With the exception of a few things they mentioned like potentially trolling everyone with the Hakkar disease or pre-nerf C'Thun.
---
Why aren't other people being "silenced" for voicing similar opinions? I see comments pretty often along those lines.
---
Has anyone determined if spillover reputation is implemented in the Beta? And if so, at what point does it stop/start (honored, revered, half way through one or the other)? If you get 25% spillover rep from all city-faction quests, then your best strategy may actually be to follow a quest completionist route and complete ALL city faction quests at the appropriate level (before they turn gray) to get the maximum reputation possible for your preferred faction (as well as the other three factions at the same time).
---
Wow I'm so surprised that you are a better authority on /u/xgobez's thoughts and actions than /u/xgobez himself.
---
&gt; 40 v 40 at BRM gets a retail-level of lag
---
Guys you aren't supposed to have that many people in the open world. Join an instanced AV if you want large scale PVP.
---
Realllllly hoping this isn't the beginning of the end.
---
i disagree--balancing specs and making them all viable endgame is really important to me. i loved boomkin in BC and Wrath and I basically can't play it in classic. There's no real 'hybrid' value to druids if youre resto/feral anyways, so it's not like you're unfairly buffing druids if you were to give boomies a little mana sustain.
---
Not every student, especially around the world, are 19.
---
mods... give this man a flair
---
what is dead may never die, but rerolls harder, and stronger
---
i was just responding to the fact that tethering by guild name doesn't really do anything. i think layering is net positive too
---
I just dont understand why you think theres going to be 5 people in winterspring?
---
I mean dont get me wrong. I am also against sharding. They have come up with a middle ground and compromised. Layering as an alternative until the end of phase 1. You will be seeing the same people every time you log in, instead of phasing in and out every time you log in or every time you travel a few hundred meters. Can you agree that this is a good middle ground?
---
The quote doesn't say that layering will be for the entire phase. It says that there will never be layering after phase 1.
---
Based on that it is possible that layering system will run for as long as needed. AFAIK demo had sharding disabled after first couple of days.
---
Garbage
---
[ackchyually](https://i.imgur.com/Ek6jgeF.png)
---
I assume the layer has soft caps to accommodate full guilds. Even if that means 50 people extra on the server.
---
&gt; It's same thing as being on a different realm that has a massive battle going on
---
Yeah, except it's not a different realm.  It's _your_ realm, with other players from _your_ realm.
---
&gt; The fact that you can traverse the world without watching people disappearing at zone lines is the main thing that makes Layering different and better. It preserves the feeling of it being a world far better.
---
That's a very minor thing relative to the problems that it causes to wPvP, population inconsistencies, resources, etc.
---
&gt; And I would imagine there is load balancing for layers when they exist. You're not going to be put into Layer 2 right as it's made and be the only person.
---
You can't have it both ways.  Either there is active load balancing with people being re-distributed to different instances, or there's not and you have a somewhat more persistent world.  I think it's _entirely_ possible and, in fact, probable that people will log in to layers that maybe only have a couple hundred people dispersed throughout an entire continent.
---
&gt; The system obviously has some problems still but it's fundamentally different than sharding as it is in the modern game.
---
It's different but not _fundamentally_ different.  Most of the same coherence issues remain.
---
That's all I'll say here.
---
Beta wouldn't be a waste because you're (potentially) using time on beta to prepare for launch. It's going to get wiped, but you're still starting with a knowledge advantage. It's time to get addons ready, adjust to any of the minor changes, etc.
---
Because sometimes a group of friends just prefers one method over another
---
Definitely needs new content like osrs or people are going to be bored after a year. Just needs to be done right, don't oversaturate the game and leave its roots
---
&gt; I assume that when you join a group you will end up in the group leaders layer, as is the case with sharding.
---
With sharding it's so temporary that it doesn't matter. I assume they will make an effort to consolidate layers as much as possible. Not allowing players to manually manipulate which layer they belong to doesn't seem like something they would want, and that is a pretty easy fix. 
---
&gt;It's possible they could mess with /who. 
---
I think they would have to go out of their way to do that. On retail it still shows everyone on your server, I'm pretty sure. Shift-clicking someones name in chat uses the /who tool for example.
---
This is something I'd like to see more info on as well. How many layers each one will be capped at. Issues like broken economy and overcrowded servers are less likely to occur if there are only a few layers.
---
no!
---
I'm behind on the news. What's this about permanent sharding?
---
Subscription based service shows preference to customers with a subscription. Shocking. More news at 11.
---
I think it’s so the game is actually playable from what I’m hearing
---
lol k.
---
This will be spread sheeted out and calculated within days. If you think the gain is little all I can do is lol.
---
What’s going on?
---
As someone who works a job and attends college, it does make a difference.
---
But it's NOT 3 phases. What is this what if bullshit? And what do you mean "new definitions"? In my PERSONAL opinion (even fucking wrote 'for me'), change is a permanent thing. I'm not defining anything for you or anyone else. This is not a narrative, it is an opinion. They are entirely different.   
---
Yes, you can keep fear-mongering, but it doesn't make you correct. Instead, it makes you look clueless and uninformed. I'm done here.  
---
People who say "truth hurts" or "it's the simple truth" are the dumbest people on earth, I swear.
---
+1 please!
---
Please can you continue to post them on YT ? 
---
The Reddit player is shitty I can't read most of the captions !
---
I tried to download them, they're still in shitty quality.
---
[Something like that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4kI9uNlnPc)
---
If each layer is 3000 people then  what is the POINT? That won't have any impact on starting zone congestion, so just get rid of it!
---
I remember getting a beta invite for BFA without having a active subscription. Do I need a active subscription to get invited to the classic beta?
---
I think its alot more important that its playable on launch. Just think about how many ppl will take time off etc
---
The liquidity is where I am looking for potential profit now to take advantage of the low cost mats during phase 1 for future sale.
---
Sure, with today's information.  In 2004-05 you were lucky to get a player that wasn't a keyboard turning clicker that had even half of their abilities bound.
---
Vanilla was not designed with today's min-max mentality in mind, it was designed so 40 people, if they worked together, could possibly kill a boss.  Most of those 40 people, by today's standards, were absolutely horrible players.  But they still got content down.  So, yes, ret is fine.
---
The point of layering is because they're assuming the higher population won't last and will settle on a more normal, lower number within the first 2-3 months.
---

""Anything is on the table. This is a love letter to our fans," Dawson said. "If the fans have a desire for something, it would absolutely be considered. We're certainly not planning to do that today, but if people want more, we can talk about that. We'll cross that bridge when we get there."
---
Patrick Dawson, Production Director
---
but they are all still technically summer.  I get the point.
---
Yes. He was needed patch 1.9 and they are starting at 1.12. Broken Tooth will be best pet until ZG
---
That wouldn’t make sense
---
So many people say shit like “opening all lockboxes on IF bridge” or “meet me at mailbox” 
---
What about when you type in chat looking for portal, and a mage invites you? Suddenly you get a reload screen?
---
Layering may have just ruined my hype. Fuck Ion and fuck the devs that supported Layering
---
Not even at the end of Phase 1. They said it wouldn't be there past Phase 1, but they also said it likely wouldn't be around longer than a month, and Phase 1 will likely last a minimum of three months if it's mimicking the old content release schedule.
---
People are being absolutely hysterical about this. When it was first announced before I learned that it was temporary, I didn't really like the news. Now I welcome it. It's a perfectly reasonable way to lessen server lag that won't be around for long anyway and has only marginal detriments.
---
Depending on the size of the battlegroups this could become a deal breaker for me. I'm serious when I say that this announcement shifts my excitement from "WoW Classic!" to "More accurate private servers thanks to WoW Classic!"
---
Layering makes sense the more you think about it.
---
Programming is literally all you do in a real comp sci job . It’s why you don’t even need a comp sci degree to get a job, you just need a really good portfolio of projects and stuff you’ve done. It’s just time.
---
Just to provide my source - my brother is a comp sci professional with a network of other comp sci professionals who all agree that the undergraduate degree is more of a money maker for the universities than it is a preparation for a career in programming.
---
I obviously have no inside knowledge but I assume once a second layer is created the server will automatically split the 2 layers with 1500 people on each and then continue to fill them up towards the 3k cap again
---
What you people dont understand is this.
---
Sharding means there is no players locked to a server, which means no server community. End of argument. 
---
It 100% wont be closer to vanilla, because vanilla didn't have it.
---
I was actually there for vanilla, you clearly were not.
---
Not sure, but if they at least tried to keep it in line with vanilla (no increased level cap, no flying mounts, nothing entirely for the sake of convenience, leave the cities as they are(no shattrah/dalaran)) then it would be difficult for it to be worse than TBC.
---
It’s definitely not ideal for the economy or community in general. But hopefully it’s for a short period of time.
---
Should offer Beta to anyone and IF you get chosen then you have to resubscribe to play...I'd probably resub if I knew I had was in for Beta.
---
Once they are geared RET can destroy in PvP. YouTube ming test server PvP and watch Deviate dueling. I was there and no one beat him on the test server.
---
Don't get me wrong, the salt will sustain me for months and months.  It's pretty great
---
Paladin is OP for healing not much else. Especially pvp healing. But you can heal raids. If you want to dps or tank any other class is recommended at endgame.
---
I didn't see BM as viable until the 2.0 changes. As a MM if a BM hunter attacked me I viewed it as a free kill. In 1.12 5/31/15 was the way to go.
---
Zero.
---
Except hardcore players will farm Devilsaur, Black Lotus and other mats (x) times faster.
---
1st grade. tee hee.
---
You're the one that has to make assumptions about it being implemented in a nonideal way
---
There's a good chance they implemented it so you're stuck in the layer the whole time, so you can still form a community, at the benefit of not having dead servers or a broken questing experience
---
But how do you easily tell if they're on another layer.
---
“You guys don’t have phones?”
---
Absolutely it can, and it will. People and guilds will exploit this to make 3x the amount of resource and farm rare nodes, all at the expense of your regular player 
---
They killed Classic with this shit
---
we will have the option of switching to another layer to be with, say, the rest of the entire guild discord i just joined? :)
---
I apologize if someone answered this already, but what if I have game time until the end of May and only discontinued my sub a few days ago from reapplying?
---
Adult swim
---
It was the reason I stopped playing vanilla.  Lost all the realm reputation I spent time earning.  I was no longer the feared mage on my realm and was just another strong mage in a mix of 13+ realms.
---
&gt; We need assurance blizz!
---
Sorry I wasn’t directly quoting you at that point
---
I see what I am saying is not clicking. I fully understand what you have been saying. My point is that after you combine those two communities together, they're fundamentally not the same because the dynamics that make up each are now in chaos. There's more to communities than just the player count.
---
I literally watched this happen as the realm I was on, Spinebreaker, was merged together with Gorefiend, Wildhammer, and Eredar (sorry I said 5 but it was 4).
---
Collecting costumes is about 20% of my play time. 
---
Everything is about world pvp anyway, especially sweet mogs.
---
Private servers didn't prove this wrong at all. I played on 2 of the more recently launches and they were a giant cluster F until Ungoro (level 50+). No matter where I went at any time there was huge crowds of people.
---
Typically after about a month they finally died down. They didn't prove anything except that we NEED something like this for at least a month.
---
Killing enemies, zone control is incentive. Securing areas for nodes and questing
---
Are we getting at least one Oceanic server?
---
Of course mate, all on YouTube now. Will continue to upload em ❤️
---
Didn't they say there would be no sharding outside of starting zones in exact quotes? You do realize layering is sharding so their words mean nothing at this point.
---
&gt;jokes on you im an old ass man
---
Name checks out lmao.
---
A sub is required to PARTICIPATE in the beta, so, presumably, you could still get invited even if you did not have an active sub, and would only be barred from logging onto the beta client.
---
Still can’t imagine why anyone would want to play a beta for anything. Seems like a job for the devs is all.
---
Honestly that just sounds like it would take forever.
---
 Well with 2 young kids and a job the more i can play is 2.5 hours. Thats the most i can play during a day, not the average i will be able to play per day. That would be way less. So yeah, that summer head start would have been nice. I just dont think i will actually play
---
layering sounds to me like a proof of concept for elimination of servers by name.
---
Except there is because it’s not a negative
---
Yeah well, that's basic MMO economy tbh. It will start out with 0 supply and an increasing demand all the time. Pure gold coins will lose value towards the market as it's supply increase, but it's value towards constant costs (repairs, vendors etc) will stay the same. As gold coins will lose value, materials will become more expensive with respect to gold coin. So whatever material you gather early game, you can expect it to see an increase in gold coin value as the demand goes up towards it's climax, only to fall into sustain. And whatever gold you hoard early game will quickly lose value until demand climax is over and it goes down to sustain value.
---
What do I know, though, I am just a filthy peasant.
---
I like the date. I can enjoy summer first. And then no life after that.
---
I’m glad they are only offering it to people with subs that’s how it should be IMO. A lot of people who don’t have subs are inactive and don’t play so why should blizzard waste invites on them. I get it that some of those inactive players are just waiting for classic but they have no way of knowing that.
---
BUT...BUT...MATHEMATICALLY IMPOSSIBLE
---
Perhaps for phase one, but the higher level stuff may not be so flooded given that most people will not be near max level. 
---
In past expansion releases, early on the market was flooded with crafting materials, but eventually supply slowed down and the cost of items increased. This would emulate the same experience, but it's too early for us to know to what degree.
---
RIP students
---
&gt; You thought my next concern was that it would "help speed levelers"
---
I said "I Doubt it will help speed levelers" lol. It's right there and you can't even get that right.
---
Rare Spawns will most likely be dead, no matter what layer you are on. 
---
Mob Grinding is the same. If you are there, someone else will be to on the other layer. 
---
Speed leveling only matters to rush people to end game, at which point you will be alone if you are one of the first, and it wont matter what layer you are on, very few others will be there with you.
---
Node Farming means nothing at low level. Good job having shit loads of copper, there is no economy to sell it. There are also going to be shit loads of other people on the other layers you could go to, also trying to farm all the nodes. It might matter at high level for the rare stuff, Black Lotus, Thorium, Etc, but again, if you rush to it then it's only you anyways, and if you are 'with the pack' then there will be people going for it on every layer. It doesn't matter.
---
&gt; Your input into this thread should be a post that says "layering doesn't hurt my particular playstyle so I'm okay with it", and that's it, because you have nothing else to offer.
---
And your's should be "I think layering will affect certain aspects of the game, but I really don't know what I'm talking about but I want to be angry about something", and that's it, because you have nothing else to offer.
---
No, with the release of Cataclysm the entirety of the world was permanently changed, regardless of which expansion you have.
---
If one layer is 3000 players (original vanilla cap) and there's multiple layers...wtf is a realm population cap set to? I don't want 6000players in a realm come phase 2.
---
Quality.
---
"We aren't firing you, you're being let go.."
---
In much of Northern Europe, last day of summer is August 31. (Not complaining about the date, though, August 27 is fine)
---
They straight up said get ready for a summer of classic, implying it would be available for the majority of the summer. I don't think people are out of line in being irritated it's arriving so late.
---
Thanks. The sub includes the game too or does it still need to be purchased?
---
Only one way to find out for sure right?
---
You have all of them in a zip or something? Want to download them all but too lazy to manually save each.
---
I’m sorry that it isn’t working out how you wanted.
---
If it offers you any hope though, there has never been a point in the history of wow where I wasn’t working st least 40 hours a week.  Sometimes without the ability to play for a month or more at a time.
---
I still freaking love the game and can’t wait for classic (and am currently working almost 60 hours a week).
---
Just remember that ‘no time’ doesn’t equal ‘no skill’.  I guarantee you can find a group of skilled raiders that are also under time constraints...and while that won’t likely be as fast as your friends...we do have an end goal this time.
---
They won’t be moving on to BC where you have to keep trying to catch up.  They’ll be right there in the same gear that you’ll get eventually.
---
I got downvoted to hell in another post for suggesting this. Apparently it is 100% clear in the post that you will need a sub to even be invited.
---
LFG tool will exist through add-ons anyway, no worries there. I certainly don't need tmog. If it happens later on neat, if not who cares.
---
Where are you getting this from. It's not sharding. Layering is 2-3k people per layer. People won't be ghosting...you wont even notice it except there is actually some stuff to kill.
---
I would love to play TBC again. WotLK I personally would not play. I loved Ulduar - my absolute favorite raid. But you could not pay me to raid TotC again.
---
Wtf is layering?
---
You know there's only going to be layers for a few weeks, right?
---
If programming is all you do as a comp sci major, then math majors just need to know how to use calculators and EE majors just need to know what wires go where.
---
Doubtful.
---
Also, wasn't the only truly vanilla TGC item the slow-ass turtle mount?  It would be nice if they let you redeem it again.  But c'est la vi
---
I think that layers only appearing  after the first is filled sucks. You log into a fresh layer in a totally empty Org or Ironforge and hopefully you have the server population to fill up your top layer sufficiently, otherwise you're walking around in a dead world.
---
To me this feels like a way for Blizzard to use sharding as a substitute for future server merges/server groups while calling it "layering."
---
At 3k people it also does little to alleviate starter zone congestion.
---
We're losing out on a cohesive world phase 1 and still going to have a crowded launch.
---
This imo is the worst case scenario.
---
Per the post found [here](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080): "Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account."
---
Turtles live on every continent except Antarctica.
---
A good point. Would make sense to separate /3 by layer. I was just thinking trade, Local, World and LFG.
---
Phase one takes months
---
Sure but layering makes the supply go up even more than it normally would then drop at a certain time.
---
How can you buy this? It's literally the same thing as sharding, just more abusable. Big fail from Blizzard.
---
Called it.
---
I fully expect blizzard to eliminate servers altogether. Maybe not for classic but probably for whatever the current expansion becomes next major tech pass. 
---
I would expect that the "servers" become "regions+game modes"... So East Coast PVP, West Coast PVE, and so on. At that point with layering tech a server split is irrelevant.
---
This isn't a middle ground. They first promised sharding in the starting zones and I said "sure, why not?"
---
And now they realized we gave them an inch and whoopsie, they just gobbled up the entire mile.
---
This garbage means 
---
1. You can hop between layers through group invites. 
---
2. You can relog and change layers.
---
3. You can hop continents to reset layers.
---
"No rare here? Eh whatever, let me relog."
---
"Too much horde? Let me relog."
---
"Not enough mobs? Relog."
---
And we're back to sharding again, only now we have to relog instead of change sub-zone. But the difference is infinitesmal.
---
My hope was that we'd get sharding in the 1-5 zones and then no more sharding because people spread out to various zones immediatly after the bottleneck of starter zones.
---
They can remove layers, sure. And then suddenly you're playing with people you've never seen or interacted with before.
---
Ya wait for release date
---
Then you wait to play
---
Depends how long they would have given you to farm the gold.
---
Look at first we were supposed to have sharding on the newbie zones, now we have layering on the whole world.
---
Do you really expect Blizzard to think cross BG are a bad ideas ? 
---
To my knowledge they are the one that made instancing a thing. Before that MMos where just a big open world.
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm very opposed to cross BGs, but I have no hope they'll listen to us.
---
The best option is to just stick with 3000 cap servers and just do aggressive merging once any 2 servers hit 1500 active pop.
---
Good thing phase 2 is when the world events start opening up
---
It's funny that we are even asking questions about this, because it already means it's all messed up.
---
But it's not 100% clear that you need to sub for the invite. Blizzard needs to clarify.
---
They said that being on the same layer as your guild will have priority. Would make sense for raiding purposes, I do not know how phasing works on live retail servers, but they specifically said that layering was a solution made with classic in mind. It could end up being an exploitable mess, but I hope blizzard can find a way to mitigate any possible abuse of layer hopping.
---
No need to apologize. The official statement says:
---
&gt; Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account
---
You would have active game time so I would assume you're eligible.
---
Hi, /u/2plus24
---
What’s the gold to game time conversion these days? Also, how much gold did a middling player have during WoD? Asking for a friend.
---
No that isn't what it means.   
---
It takes each server and splits it up into many "mini servers" you're still on the same 
---
server as everyone you see, you aren't just phasing with people on different servers.
---
You're literally getting upset over something you don't even understand.    
---
If you're too upset over this feature that NEEDS to be in the game temporarily, then you won't be missed.
---
Are you kidding me right now?
---
You're going to try and sit there and tell me "educators" are upset because they work from 8am to 3pm and wanted to take advantage of their summer time off to play WoW more? Gtfo. 
---
1) Everyone else here is not an educator and they are probably working 8-5pm, so don't complain to me that you have to work until 3pm until you get to play WoW, when everyone else is working until 5pm.
---
2) EVERY SINGLE TEACHER I know (anecdotal I know) works in the summer. They all do it for the extra cash, because 9 months of a teachers salary is already a joke. So the educators taking advantage of their summer time off is kind of misleading imo.. 
---
Educators have it THE BEST! They have a job and they get out at 3pm, maybe 4pm if they have office hours or are an assistant track coach after school or something. Jesus christ man.
---
It's kinda sad the actual video has less likes than the post.
---
Besides the fact I’m sure you consider yourself an *intellectual*. The quote “Get ready for a classic summer” absolutely implies that the majority of summer will be spent playing classic.
---
Yeah, I've been thinking about it. It's the worst of both worlds. It wont help starting zone congestion, and leaves the possibility of exploiting it and/or changing the people you interact with. Hopefully it will attempt to keep you in the same layer and only move you if the one you started on is super full, but who knows. Maybe we'll get something else before launch.
---
You think that classic servers will be 2-3k limited? Sweet :)
---
Good, i guess we just need to wait till end of august
---
Yes I understood you, and was just trying to be clear that that very well may be the best way to farm gold in phase 1. I just wanted to clarify that in general, straight grinding gold is inefficient compared to phase 2 and onward.
---
We'll have to see how the spawn rates, server sizes, and AH prices play out in reality though. There might be a huge push of people going for server/world firsts, driving up AH prices initially; or we might see high spawn rates throughout stagnating the price in later phases. It's speculation, but probably a safe bet that gold invested in mats early will go up in value as inflation increases.
---
At some point there will be a tradeoff between farming mats and farming gold to buy off the AH, but again that'll take some personal experimentation to figure out when that happens. Figure out what g/hr you can get farming, then figure out the AH prices of mats and how many mats you can reliably get per hour. Initially farming mats will be better, as more people hit 60 farming gold will be better. If I had to guess, by the end of the first month it'll almost assuredly be stabilized and farming gold will be better.
---
"like did you even?" stay off facebook and instagram, it's showing.
---
&gt; Sharding blows because you see people phase in and out.
---
Omar calls this "transitions" and you will still see them in the Layering system, just only when group invites go out. So people will still disappear in front of you at random. And when you get an invite, the entire world fades away and gets replaced by new players. 
---
It's jarring, but even more worrying is the world PVP implications of it. Getting corpse camped? Just open battle net and invite someone from a different layer. Farming spot dominated by the enemy faction? Before you'd have to organize a team to get control back. Now you can just hop around and test all the other layers.
---
? im just looking for an answer
---
Resistance gear isn’t a sidegrade. You wouldn’t run new raid content just to get resistance gear. Resistance gear is stepping stone gear to achieve your bis goals.
---
Maybe one day but that’s not really what I’m looking for
---
Does this insult anyone?
---
We don’t take kindly to your types around here!
---
so that the game is fucking playable and not a 10fps fuckfest of 6000 people in one area and yes player competition, 600 players trying to kill one mob isn't going to be fun for anyone and a lot of people might straight up decide never to play again if the launch is fucked. The only thing that layering appeals to is people that want to play the game on launch day and not have to wait a month to be able to get out of the starting zone.
---
Unless you have at least 16gb ram and a 980ti forget about it my dude.
---
You don’t *need* to play beta just like you don’t *need* to lock in a character name to be fair. It’d be nice if the classic crowd could be the larger portion of beta access players but probably won’t be the case.
---
It was confirmed to only be for a couple of weeks to a month as well. Really don't see what the big deal is. It's better than sharding and for sure better than not being able to play at all
---
&gt;Healing as a priest is boring because you spam your flash heal.
---
Aren't you supposed to use your slow (greater ?) heal that is much more efficient ?
---
I played a priest in Vanilla (my 2nd main) but I didn't raid with him just dungeons, and I remember trying to only use the slow heal, flash heal only in emergency or PVP.
---
It's both, really. In the interview they said they take into account the age of the account. On the post it says they also take into account if you're an active player of retail or not which means if you sub as of today it probably won't do much.
---
"Parmanent". Didn't you read what the man said? It's only for a month at the most.
---
YouTube link!
---
https://youtu.be/g3Xtjl8Km3k
---
I didn't say it was 3 phases, I said IF it was 3 phases to point out the flaw in your "as long as it's not for all of classic it's not a change" argument.
---
As in, even if it was much longer than the already long period now, you would still not consider it a change because it doesn't cover up 100% of classic's lifespan
---
Nah XR BGs should have been in vanilla from the start. It's awesome they'll be in classic from the start
---
what about a 14 year sub that left because cata sucked the life out of the game, came back for pandatown then left again because bfa sucked the remaining life out of it?
---
...asking for a friend
---
Some schools drop you out of the course if you don't show up first day
---
:0
---
Kinda. Only better.
---
- Layering: I join Doomhammer because my guild's there and no big streamers are there. DH1, DH2, DH3 eventually merge into Doomhammer.
---
- Merging: I join Doomhammer because my guild's there and no big streamers are there. 2 months later, Doomhammer merges with whatever server Asomongold's "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" followers are all on.
---
you mean cross-server pvp... that was added in 1.12?
---
People might if it didn't detract from progression. WoW is normally like a constant treadmill where you miss out if you don't play "optimally." 
---
If we're 4+ years out, there's no expansion coming, no real progression, then doing cool content for cool sidegrade equipment could definitely keep people's attention. Or make the new gear focused on particular builds that aren't normally viable. Some MMOs like Guild Wars have only cosmetic loot past a certain point, and people still do the content.
---
It doesn't even have to be Naxx sidegrades. Just adding a few new dungeons or BWL-level raid could be awesome. People will probably be playing a lot of alts by then.
---
Second time today that's happened to me. I've gotten used to the misinformation on this sub. Natural result of a community trying to dredge up content for a topic they can't properly access.
---
It is wow with no expansions back how it was in 2004 and 2005
---
I'll be recommending to my guild leadership that we try to make friends with another guild on a different layer to layer hop when needed. Others are going to exploit it so we may as well too.
---
Good to know.  I had not seen that.  Thanks!
---
Interesting, where did you see that? Would like to see that video/article.
---
All of that sounds like a good day one experience. Still doesn’t seem like a reason to play a beta.
---
You're assuming you can change layer by relogging. It's a new system. Could very well link guilds/friend, or have a persistent layer if you log out and in.
---
You said you doubt it will help speed levelers because you thought my concern was that it would help them. You were attempting to alleviate my concern, when in fact my concern was that it would hurt them.
---
Rare spawns won't most likely be dead, because I will be ahead of curve.
---
Mobs won't be the same for level-hopping aoe grinders, because they will be ahead of the curve.
---
Do you not get it? I am specifically talking about the most hardcore people who are far ahead of the pack; people who will be affected by the possibility of layer-hopping. The casuals won't care, but I will. 
---
&gt;Speed leveling only matters to rush people to end game, at which point you will be alone if you are one of the first
---
NO SHIT THAT'S THE POINT YOU DUNCE
---
&gt; and it wont matter what layer you are on
---
WRONG
---
GOOD GOD OVER AND OVER YOU PROVE YOU DON'T FUCKING GET IT
---
edit: Blocked holy fuck you're a waste of time
---
Lol tailoring the release so that educators can play while on summer break seems reasonable to you? Blizz have never had a major release in the summer. You'd be an idiot to think that would change now.
---
There could be bones n shit
---
stop trolling lol
---
Yeah, he just said. Yourself.
---
So? Even the fastest raid guilds will only be level 60 for about two weeks total before layering disappears entirely, and they'll be fighting with other fast guilds for the resources. We'll see, at best, a minor blip of an increase in high-end crafting materials for a small window of time. It's not going to be a huge problem. It's barely going to be a problem at all because those guilds will be using the mats they farm instead of selling them.
---
But then they should wait and see.
---
No problem. Enjoy your hops.
---
&gt; What the fuck is the point of servers anyway?
---
I mean, can you tell us the number of servers Blizzard needs to set up?
---
Or can we trust them to do a bit of load balancing vis-a-vis layering so they can get actual numbers and not have day-long queues or ghost town servers?
---
They're really screwed with the community either way. Everyone already gets on the warpath when servers go down for maintenance. Can't imagine the head-explosions if the servers are simply down from overpopulation or you have to wait for a few hours to login.
---
I think it's more to mitigate the issue of tourists obliterating realm population once they get bored. Layering is not the same as sharding (to my knowledge). With layers you will still see the 3000 people around you in the starting areas, with sharing you'll see like 20.
---
Could you link to the specific addons you're using? :)
---
It was one of the Dev interviews that came out today. I think it was the tips one but I could be mistaken.
---
You act like the Streamer live at Blizzard HQ and they are all in on this together. Blizzard is in no way responsible for any dumb bullshit that you actually believe is true. A streamer tells you to take off of work and you do it, then get mad at who? Blizzard? Daft Idiot.
---
Wait it has a battle net page client page already?
---
also this wont help.. still gonna be 3k ppl in starting zones at launch
---
Essentially yes, but without class changes and other QOL tools/ingame shops
---
That's absolutely not true and you know you're just trying to make a false comparison. As a comp sci person you can literally get paid 6 figures to develop user interfaces.  
---
I'm seriously just trying to argue that in the near future, the comp sci job market will be flooded with untalented individuals doing tasks that people (higher ups at corporations) will realize are not worth what they are paying them for. The job market is oversaturated with untalented people doing not so difficult jobs.
---
Guilds and Groups exploiting rare mobs, rare nodes, resources, aoe farming, and more.
---
People potentially selling rare spawns like broken tooth.
---
People vanishing from your screen when they join a party, can be used to dodge combat or pvp.
---
People simply logging out and back in because they happen to dislike the STV layer they’re in.
---
Layering may have killed Classic
---
Turn off the skybox in settings. Fixed.
---
Should probably show the screenshot with the WoW Classic tab highlighted lol.
---
You guys will have time to play even it takes 6 months to ding 60 :)
---
If you're in STV and about to get ganked, post for a group inv on another layer and you can phase out. That's dumb.
---
Likely higher chance. I've had this account since TBC (vanilla got banned thanks to my brother botting, rip the statue). Its always had a sub bar the end half of WoD.
---
&gt; I was thinking/hoping they would be very quick to merge servers if any had population problems
---
The problem with merging is that you have no control over which server yours is merged with.
---
Like if I **SPECIFICALLY** decide to NOT join server A, and join server B - it'd be garbage to find out 3 months later that A and B are merged.
---
just drop out then
---
I was thinking about bodypower, maybe midmay
---
I'm not trolling dude 980ti is old ( about 100 bucks ) just watch the upcoming streamers get 80-90 fps on the classic beta with their 10.000$ PC's
---
He’s leveling his staff skills obviously
---
Hi, /u/bagelstar
---
Well beta starts tomorrow so yes.
---
You know a lot of people are literally doing that.
---
Some people like fast cars. Some people like econoboxes. Some people like the bus.
---
I am not gonna question someone else's desired transport any more than I am gonna question someone else's desired gaming.
---
What the fuck are you talking about "new content?"
---
I said they were situationally better gear as the requested example of it.  A true sidegrade would be something  just very slightly different to the gear available, of course there will still be a single bis, but its a path they could take.

Finnish military. Going there to finish the service since the last time i was there i got myocarditis.
---
Your edit sucks.
---
No Starcraft II there :&gt;
---
Never even thought of lots of those. It really will exploited. Even simple logging on/off to get out of being corpse camped or to escape pvp. 
---
This will 100% change the feel of Classic
---
People who don't think time=money in this situation are silly. I'd rather pay the sub fee than waste my time farming gold to pay for it.
---
As someone who's never played WoW, would this be the best place to start? I can only assume it would be, right?
---
Yeah I've corrected myself.
---
Just scheduled the same days off. Haven't gotten much time to game since I was in grad school, it'll be nice to go back to being a care free adventurer for a week.
---
Agreed. It's basically just sharding at login rather than sharding dynamically as you are playing. Still does not allow you the choice of playing in the same game world as a set of other players unless you are grouped, which is exactly a grievance (if not the main one) that many people have about sharding.
---
As for the claim that people won't be disappearing and reappearing, isn't that precisely what happens when people join/leave parties on another shard? Or are we actually claiming that it will be a rare occurrence for people to be joining/leaving parties across shards (it won't be rare, imo)?
---
Just pay attention to your gold per hour and AH prices, converted into a 'mats acquired per hour' versus simply straight up farming them. May change from day to day. Do whatever acquires you the most mats in raw numbers.
---
You serious? How?
---
I’m guessing a huge chunk of the original wow players played during college. They are going for that authentic vanilla feel.
---
&gt;Questing alone on a PvE server is death, you're gonna die to mobs...alot.
---
I think you're exaggerating here !
---
To die against normal mobs as a holy priest (or any healer) you really have to do something wrong !
---
Agreed with you on the PVP side though, I have a lot of screenshots to prove it :D
---
I am unsure about that.... hopefully someone else can answer
---
try retail
---
It’s hard mode but also social mode
---
980 ti in your phone ? wow that's a heavy brick
---
It's more than just WoW without the DLC, it's WoW *before* the DLC's which was a very different (and in our opinion, better) game than it is now.
---
Over the years with each expansion pack (DLC), WoW received many changes to things like classes, talent trees, additional system introduced, easier leveling, etc. The biggest changes happening with the Cataclysm expansion. 
---
So we're getting the original game which is exciting. If you're looking to play for the first time than welcome. :) It's going to be fun. But it's also a 15 year old game, so things will be slower than modern games, so expect an older style of MMO.
---
Exactly! I'm thrilled! I think layering is the right compromise solution. 
---
* No cross realm nonsense
---
* Scalability to handle launch rush
---
* Probably fewer queues during launch
---
* Limited duration at most all of phase 1
---
I haven't consumed all the content yet but maybe there will be 10 layers at launch. Then gradually they reduce that number after a few weeks when people have to go back to work after vacation is over! 
---
It's going to be a great time! Totally ready to head back into Azeroth!
---
It would be similar to starting WoW when it was first released. It's how almost everyone in this sub started playing. Yes, it's a good place to start.
---
Your comment.
---
Top lol.
---
So what do they do with those servers? Just delete the server? Let them rot and complain about 2 hour BG qs? Or make battle groups with opposite faction balances? Which is the more logical option?
---
No, power creep is one of the primary problems caused by expansions
---
It's not like you're going to be seeing people from other servers, do you even know how it works?
---
I wonder if the TBC stuff will be limited to only people that had TBC originally.  They said they are gonna probably do TBC, and are already working on it so I hope I get my TBC minions.  Something to look forward to I guess.
---
2-3 times more resources and 2-3 times more people. So at least in theory the economy should be fine.
---
You wouldn't be able to broadcast that anywhere though? Layers seem to be completely separate outside of being able to group with one another manually.
---
Your insight is well done. Thank you. I think I will stand by a mixture of both to head off risk and adjust as the servers and market mature.
---
&gt; Doing a quest and the spot you need is overloaded. Np just jump layers and look for one thats not so loaded.
---
Bruh, servers are going to have like 2 or 3 layers. And the reason there's 3 is because the other 2 are just as crowded as your own. So you hop from one crowded layer to another, equally crowded, layer?
---
&gt;That wouldn’t make sense
---
&gt;So many people say shit like “opening all lockboxes on IF bridge” or “meet me at mailbox”
---
You mean just like how Warmode works ? 
---
&gt;What about when you type in chat looking for portal, and a mage invites you? Suddenly you get a reload screen?
---
There is no loading screen, you will just phase over to that players layer if they are on a different one, just like sharding.
---
&gt;Layering may have just ruined my hype. Fuck Ion and fuck the devs that supported Layering
---
Then play the game a month after launch or so. It is only to manage the playerbase with the influx of players, once the population lowers it will be removed.
---
Ah, ok. Let me rephrase then. 
---
This garbage means
---
1. You can hop between layers through group invites.
---
2. ~~You can relog and change layers.~~
---
It still doesn't change the fact that they first promised only starter zones and now it's for all of phase 1.
---
Also I don't even know where you got the idea from that you can't relog to change "Layers", I'm going by Esfand's video and he says once you log in you're locked.
---
So relog -&gt; locked to a new open layer.
---
Okay but layers are all the same server, and your layer is not static between play sessions...   So what you're really saying is reduce max server size.
---
Then you risk it dying to a bad release date.
---
I myself enjoy it. I will hopefully get through the barrens without having to leave general chat.
---
Sorry this subreddit is filled with nerds but pretty much yeah. 
---
"Expansions" are pretty much huge DLC that fundamentally changed the game over the years. Fans of Classic WoW dislike the changes that these DLC brought to the game and thus want a return to the game as it was in 2004/2005.
---
Edit: The expansions were so huge that modern WoW is pretty much a different game than classic wow. The gameplay, graphics, community, social aspect, goals, etc. were all changed over the years.
---
You try letting them invite you and see if you phase out? It's very noticable.
---
My friend and I joked when it was announced that it was going to be the very last few days of summer. Even though I knew there was a good chance that was going to be the case I still held out hope it would be sooner.
---
It doesn't imply anything, that's an assumption
---
Why do people want flying removed so badly?
---
I'm assuming a lot of tryouts will collide with the lvl 10-20 wall at 500 mph, so the playercount will settle fast
---
How big will Servers be ?
---
&gt; And if chat channels aren't across layers, then what is going on on another layer has no impact on you.
---
Except it would by design. People can cross the layers to join friends and might end up on a different layer depending on when they log in. If I miss an event that took place on the layer I wasn't on, that IS in fact directly impacting me because I missed a community event
---
I initially took off Tue-Fri, then saw the map schedule. Technically I could work and still have time to get home for that 6 pm EST launch, but starting a launch-day binge after a work day didn’t sound like a great time lol.
---
I would rather that they keep it as a seasoned thing. So after clearing of naxx there should be new "fresh" servers but some servers stay with your old chars if you want to stay there. You can start new or continue where you left.
---
No need to project this hard mate, just saying its kinda baseless to assume that literally all comp sci majors do is type code and develop UIs. So far from the truth it's hilarious.
---
Imagine if they push the release back to Sept 4th... I have a dark mind.
---
what is this layering thing everyone is talking about?  no one is explaining it
---
I’m practicing (:
---
Does it matter if it's harder? top guilds will be looking for any and all advantages and will absolutely abuse them, no matter how convoluted or difficult it is.
---
Its the perfect time to release. Everyone is in close proximity of his/her pc.
---
But not unexpected unfortunately.
---
I feel like you don't understand how standing and honor works in vanilla at all... Only a handful of people need to be doing this out of every 3000 to ruin it for everyone. 
---
I will be doing it with my roommate. We will dual box while the other sleeps, and only be logged off a few hours a week. Polyphasic sleeping exists so an account can be active 23 hours a day legitimately. I will have a huge advantage to your detriment because of how standing works, you will never get r14 if you are on my server.
---
Shame. Blizz really fucked up this release date.
---
So will there be multiple world bosses despite Ion's prior statements?
---
&gt; Layers are for a few weeks at most. 
---
The devs apparently mentioned not being able to see an opposing guild in BRS, that's more than a few weeks:
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/layering-good-or-bad/172056
---
People who just want to "play" the beta usually make bad beta testers. It's not a demo it's testing.
---
 Of course people with an active sub and have an active interest in the success will not see this as a problem. Blizz bad me no play early
---
Actually, I understood perfectly, but I don't think having to be subscribed 2 weeks before go live actually matters when you're expecting to be subscribed for 6 months or more.  Those are the people who will care what their name is anyways.  IMO, this is more fair.  I'm going to be playing this for between 6 months to a year solid at least.  Other than some life changing event, I'd be shocked if that didn't happen.  I'd rather compete against a smaller pool of players for my names rather than everyone on go live.  
---
Like I said in my previous post, previous MMO's that have done something like this have required you to have pre-ordered the game.  This is impossible in this situation.  They realize the character names are important to some people.  I have 4 or 5 that go back to Vanilla EQ 1 days.   $7.50, I think, is a nominal fee to reserve your name.  
---
Others may disagree
---
Oof I wish. I’m getting into 300 level courses for GIS though so that’s not happening lol
---
&gt; more important then
---
Apparently not
---
ok?
---
Thats how Blizzard would have to solve the massive amount of players at the start, tell me what other options they have im listening.
---
A massive shard for the whole continent. A layer will have a population of around 3k players, and once that's full, another layer is created on the same realm.
---
You're a moron if you think that.
---
&gt;Besides the fact I’m sure you consider yourself an intellectual.
---
If I'm your standard for an "intellectual" then I don't even want to know how poorly off you are.
---
If they wanted a cash grab they'd just let you pay $15 to register names early so that they'd get a cash bump on the summer earnings report, since august27th will be pushed to third quarter.
---
Oh wait...
---
They’re expecting a player drop off. This will mean that the server will spike up to a high number early on, then fall down as tourists stop playing. So say that the % of tourist on each realm is expected to be 50% (for ease of math, it will definitely be lower) then that means they will set the server cap early on to be twice that of the desired end server population. So let’s say their desired server population is 3000, then they would set the server population at 6000 then split that into two layers until all of the tourists go away. At that point, there will be no more new layers spun up, whether they disable or not. If they disable at that point, the server will purely be controlled by login queues.
---
How else would it work? Nodes and mobs disappearing because someone on another layer looted/killed them?
---
So as someone who has never played WoW, should I try it? I figure starting fresh with everyone would make it great. But is everyone who knows everything still going to feel light years ahead of me?
---
Hey, I agree and ultimately I am happy to have it. I just made a tongue in cheek joke about teachers not getting to utilize their summer vacation to play and it has clearly triggered some people beyond comprehension.
---
It does let you hop "Layers", if someone has your name and manually invites you to a group, yes. 
---
It will not merge/multiply while you're activally playing, which is the biggest issue with sharding. You wont see Layers. 
---
You can end up in another Layer, yes, but with only 2-4 Layers per server (as opposed to limitless shards), that means a lot less.
---
We don't have realms available yet.
---
Its releasing the day my college start so it really don’t matter to me anymore.
---
GTFO shill. This just means people who are currently playing bfa are going to get to mold and shape classic vis feedback.  While people who despise modern wow and aren't subbed won't get that chance. That's REALLY fucking bad
---
Nobody said that, but everyone including Blizz I bet is sure thinking it.
---
Pretty sure it is not for Phase 1. Just a week or two of launch. Ian just made sure to promise 100% it would never be used AFTER Phase 1.
---
Pretty sure people are misunderstanding.
---
MOTHER FUCKER CLASSIC WOW RELEASES THE DAY AFTER I START MY MASTER’S PROGRAM GOD DAMNIT
---
Guess I’m dropping out
---
The biggest difference will be a lot more of low level mats that enter into the economy.  Taking advantage of this will be hard, but its a good time to grab stuff like wool that shoots up in price the longer a server is alive.  Other Ideas would be to do stuff like watch the market for stuff like copper bars as lazy sightseers look to grab 1 or 2 when it would be a lot cheaper for them to just make an alt and smelt a few.
---
Also with bigger populations a good place to start would be low level stuff that everyone wants like starter wands and the eng gun for the Ashenvale quest Horde side.  Converting and starting crafting will be a lot easier for alts in this phase so if you are gonna have a bunch of crafters its good to get an early start now instead so spending as much time leveling.
---
If you are absolutly insane you can try to get a ton of devilsaur and black lotus before the availability is cut drastically but that would require no lifing to an unhealty amount (i.e. me!)
---
I had to take Monday my brain isn’t going to give a crap about work so I might as well not be there lol
---
No, I played in classic and I know the leveling is different. I planned on leveling twice, one to just have a character ready in time for studies starting up and then leveling once more, but this time to enjoy it and meet people.
---
&gt;target audience begins school
---
Their target audience is classic veterans who played back in the day, so they aren't still in school. In fact I think this is a clever release date, as it helps keep adults with jobs and kids keep up with students in the initial rush to 60. I mean I'd prefer to have it earlier, but if it was during summer vacation mat camping/devilsaur mafia would be even worse since there'd be more people who could no-life.
---
Except it's literally fucking not.
---
too bad the world doesnt revolve around your school or work schedule. no matter what time they release the game it will always be a bad time for someone. just be glad its coming and enjoy it because i can guarantee you that youre still going to be playing regardless of when it releases
---
Ive never been a lucky gambler. Every time I just instantly lose all my money and I'm never ever up even a small amount of money. 
---
I don't gamble at all anymore. Bad luck is sort of a shield against gambling addiction for me.
---
Stop lying to yourself. Late August isn't summer for most people. Blizzard fucked up this release date, it's that simple.
---
They could easily create a group of smaller guilds to try and hit all layers and just use discord to communicate, and then reband as one guild after phase 1.
---
It doesn't matter. Phase one is long. You make tons if friends at early levels. Except not anymore. Fun "mmo" we've got here!
---
Well, you let me know when that happens and I'll be here waiting for you to tell me "I told you so!"
---
This is all just speculation, and nothing more.
---
I’ll be in college again next fall at 29...
---
Yeah, they specifically said weeks but added that the hard stop, for sure point is before Phase 2.
---
This should be a 3440x1440 version :) [https://i.imgur.com/P59vBNc.png](https://i.imgur.com/P59vBNc.png)
---
Nailed it. We all know it. Who you foolin?
---
We all need to be patient
---
&gt; You said you doubt it will help speed levelers because you thought my concern was that it would help them. You were attempting to alleviate my concern, when in fact my concern was that it would hurt them.
---
This is actually correct, unlike your previous statement.
---
&gt; Rare spawns won't most likely be dead, because I will be ahead of curve.
---
Good, then you got there first, like anyone who is ahead of the curve. But if you are ahead of the curve on one layer, someone else is on the other layer as well. You have to have someone move you there, you can't just pick to move.
---
&gt; Mobs won't be the same for level-hopping aoe grinders, because they will be ahead of the curve. Do you not get it?
---
And again, if one person is doing it on one layer, someone else is on another. You have to have someone move you. You can't just click a menu and pick your layer. So if you are solo farming, it doesn't matter. If you have a friend to move you to another layer then.... You are now taking their spawns. Unless you were together on the same layer before? In which case, you can't move. Good job. 
---
Do you not get it?
---
&gt;  I am specifically talking about the most hardcore people who are far ahead of the pack; people who will be affected by the possibility of layer-hopping. The casuals won't care, but I will.
---
Assuming you will be ahead of the pack, rofl. 
---
Do you even have any friends to move you across layers? (probably not, seeing how angry you are about this, you seem like a crap person) Do you have any way to guarantee that they will be on a different one? No. So it doesn't matter.
---
IF you know someone else, and IF they get on a different layer, and IF they aren't farming the same thing you are, sure. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. 
---
&gt; NO SHIT THAT'S THE POINT YOU DUNCE
---
Right, so it's end game. It's not like every layer besides the one you start on is going to be empty. They are probably all going to be full except the 'last' layer.
---
&gt; WRONG
---
&gt; GOOD GOD OVER AND OVER YOU PROVE YOU DON'T FUCKING GET IT
---
Rofl. Do you have any evidence to suggest that there will be 'empty' layers? Because it seems like the way it will work will be to fill the 'first' layer, then the second, then the third, etc. and moving new people into the empty slots on the 'first' layer after people on it log out. The only 'empty' layer (or the least populated rather) will be the 'last' layer.
---
&gt; edit: Blocked holy fuck you're a waste of time
---
Rofl. Good.
---
Only for phase one. That early in the game, no one has gold anyway.
---
It is what it is. I'll just play Baldur's Gate for the 46th time. It's fine. Everything is fine.
---
No. Only servers with content added. Content that the devs put on poll and subscribed players vote on in the banks. It requires 75%? Or more to pass. The content is very well done and the game is more alive than ever.
---
You think the release date will prevent kids from playing? Are you an idiot?
---
Right, I'm saying that you could still do this if there wasn't layering. So what's your point? The problem is the monopoly, not the volume.
---
prevents 10000 person login queues
---
60% of WoW Classic playerbase has between 25\~34 years. A lot of those guys have children and this release date will be very welcome with children going back to school, allowing the parents to play at least a few hours. 
---
The release date is great for the majority of people. Quit the negativity.
---
It's not a matter of quitting. It never was. I mean, yes, some people will quit, but that's not what layering is about.
---
When the game releases, that will be when the highest number of people spend the most amount of hours on the game at all available hours of the day, including otherwise-casual players who take PTO. After launch normalizes, anyone other than hardcore players will play fewer hours, and usually only on certain days. Layering will allow all these players to play together without queue times, and then it will normalize when server populations become more steady because people are playing *less*, not because they aren't playing *at all*. People who quit less than a month in were tourists who likely didn't get past 30 or 40 anyway, but there will still be casual players who eventually reach 60 despite not dedicating 10 hours a day *every* week, even if they do exactly that in the first week or two.
---
3440x1440 version [https://i.imgur.com/P59vBNc.png](https://i.imgur.com/P59vBNc.png)
---
This is why I post this. Blizzard needs to know our concerns and to address them just like they did with loot sharing. If we keep quiet, we may not get an explanation.
---
Right? I've never claimed to know myself, but I know one things for sure... I know better than to go on the official forums lol
---
Best explanation and consideration I’ve seen yet.
---
Why is this shitty? What’s wrong with this, exactly?
---
So how do you keep that charm while still getting rid of lolspecs. Or will there forever be memespecs that are just trash and have no place in raids?
---
Yup. I was in my second year of college when WoW dropped.  I made my decision and had a fully decked out warrior through AQ40. Never did get that degree, though...
---
Shit worked out for me and I have a wife, kid and house on the line this time around. I'll probably skip playing but will live vicariously through this sub.
---
I think u didn‘t understand layering.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
North American seasons follow the solstices and equinox. If your country isn't using those as the standard then your seasons are completely arbitrary and baseless. Make fun of Americans for using imperial if you want (I'm Canadian), but don't shit on them for using actual scientifically recognized events for their seasonal measurements.
---
Lvl 25 rogue lfg
---
You know we agree, but have been arguing separate ideas at this point. You're talking intact in one way, and I'm talking another. Happens a lot on reddit. I think with layering the communities, even if they have a soft split, still have a better chance at organically coming together than hard combining people at the end (based on shared chats, ah, etc - and those present their own problems too). If there was no ability to move between them with your friends, then it'd be moot and result in the same thing you're talking about with server merges. 
---
Also, doesn't the way layering works (as much as we know currently), contradict what you're saying here?
---
&gt;Sharding/layers does not allow users to feel a part of any server, so you never become a close community or realm if you will whereas logging into a specific realm Day 1 has a restricted community.
---
From what I'm reading now, you're probably going to specifically be soft locked into a layer when you join a server, unless you swap by grouping with a friend. If that's the case, then I would think a community would form in the same way a normal server's would, unless abuse of swapping between layers is really rampant. I think Layering would only split a server up if there is some active load balancing going, which is something another user is talking about with me. I really want more information on how they're going to do it, because the new layer created = ghost town thing is a worrying thing.
---
&gt;My opinion isn't subjective, it's factual since we have respawn rates from OG WoW and using mathemathical equations can set dynamic respawn to reflect that.
---
When I said your opinion is subjective, I meant when you said it preserves a near authentic feel to it. I believe that is a subjective thing, because authentic feel would be the same relative player count a zone would see based on its population. That's why the max player count per server was what it was. I'm not talking about there not being the ability to calculate spawns per player in a zone. Obviously it can be done, it has been done.
---
And honestly, don't be that guy that feels the need to berate someone in a (friendly) debate. Resorting to insults immediately makes you lose face.
---
Sharding as it exists in wow this very second, blurs the lines of server... There is a reason why you see plenty of people from other servers, when you're questing...
---
Anyways
---
&gt;If you're too upset over this feature that NEEDS to be in the game temporarily, then you won't be missed.
---
Never said I was upset. Just saying it isn't vanilla. Also, you're a douche. I didn't plan on playing anyways and just came off the front page. 
---
You aren't missed anywhere, ever. See ya troll.
---
I'd rather it be this than cosmetics or services in classic.
---
You're so stupid you don't understand the comparison... lmfao. And if im annoying you thats on you. Im simply telling the truth about streamers and servers. If because a streamer is playing on your server and that ruins your game play... thats legit on you. Nothing a streamer is gonna do is gonna fuck up your game experience... You and anyone who thinks that is a complete fucking idiot, no matter how many of you think that way. cause i can promise you day 3 when you're level 12 and that streamer is 50+ you will have zero interaction with him or anyone you think thats gonna be following him around... Not everything is about you.
---
If it doesnt matter, then why would people even do the raid if there is no real reward?
---
Exactly. They screwed this up. They should never have been claiming "Summer 2019" release. Most of us saw this coming, but it doesn't make it any less disappointing. Shame on blizz.
---
Read what I said and tell me where I said literally all comp sci majors do this kind of work.
---
Man, haven't they milked wow enough?
---
I might even come back and play if they went with a f2p model; something like what rift uses
---
Yeah, that wasn't a thing until much, much later in WoW's life. It will not be in classic.
---
Yes, here is a link to wowhead: [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)  where they posted something about it a couple of hours ago. I know it's not an official blizzard blue post, but wowhead is a pretty reputable site that works closely with blizzard. Can't imagine they would give out any false information.
---
New wallpaper
---
Ya I don't understand why you would pull testers from a group of people playing retail. Sure there could be classic fans in there but so few. 
---
Wouldn't you want the try hard guys from private servers who know all the little tiny bugs and quest drops that can be abused?
---
Do us a favor and don't play then
---
Yea that is what I'm trying to remember, I swear those spectral tigers where around earlier then wrath.
---
With the precedent of rare retail pets coming back to classic I think we will get them if they are already on your retail account.
---
Or you can risk it dying to an unfinished state.
---
Like BfA.

Might as well set up a third computer and get the lil stinker started. Mine is almost 4mo and she likes to sit on my lap and watch me play Diablo 2. Her poor eyes.

Content is being released in phases. If they don't go to phase 2 the game doesn't exist.

Sharding was never going to be cross realm on classic

Mods on r/wow banned my post without even checking the image for "low effort/repost".

It is a Ragnaros only wallpaper hidden in the media files.
---
Blizzard fanboys. You are no different than retail fanboys.
---
If they group with you obviously they will have you in the same layer. They said they are also prioritizing putting people in the same guild in the same layer at login, so if you are in the same guild as your friends that would in theory allow for this to work.
---
But yeah, if neither of those apply, then you'd rely on randon chance  at each login to be in the same layer... Unless of course youre on a server that isnt large enough to require it, which might be a possibility after a week or two depending on initial server pop and how fast the tourist players fall off
---
If all someone cares about is item stats, then yes horizontal content will not appeal to them. But most players would enjoy the experience of running something new, new item appearances, and more chances for a good drop while you're still gearing up (aka 99.9% of the game). 
---
It's hard as fuck to actually acquire full BiS. Even 5+ years in, people will be all over new loot opportunities. A new 2h with 1% less stats than Might of Menethil would still be incredible.
---
An option without the WoW logo on them would be nice.

lol I think this kind of proves why this blizz experiment will fail, people will find anything to complain about. They said summer august is summer yet people still bitch.
---
Thanks, i'm just a bit confused because Ion apparently stated layering will last "at best, only 1 month", implying it will likely last longer than that.
---
Wow, man, you got dark. You got real dark.
---
You could have a leaderboard of the people who have killed you visible on your stream. 
---
My first thought was to also ban you from getting help, but I think the most fun in the challenge would be battles between your protectors and people trying to gank you.
---
&gt; I will be problem for ppl who don't farm mats but buy them from AH
---
Huh? Are you saying more resources will be BAD for people who buy them off the AH instead of farming them themselves?
---
More resources means the prices will drop.
---
New WotLK with no LFG or split raids... inject that straight into my veins, please
---
Lots of players want in for different reasons. I can't speak for everyone, but personally I want in because..
---
As a player starting in 2005 and having years of private server experience I want in to get an idea of how much classic sways from my idea of vanilla. Vanilla was long ago so I'm bound to misremember in favor of private servers. 
---
How does certain ability interactions work in Classic? How is pathing? Did private servers have correct mob stats or were they undertuned / overtuned?
---
Private servers also feels really dead at times. Little NPC chatter and scripted interactions, mobs without abilities etc. I want to know if NPCs and mobs feels as empty as they sometimes do on private servers.
---
I want to test the feels of playing the different classes and that can ultimately change my class of choise. Does shapeshifting feel fluid? Is hunter autoshoot awkward? Is charge smooth or delayed and "blinky"?
---
I want my UI, binds and macros ready for day 1.
---
Testing all that comes with the possibility of stumbling onto bugs and/or stuff not working how I believe it's supposed to. If I find something I'll be happy to report it.
---
Having that said, I won't activate my subscription for a chance at getting in. If that means I don't get in so be it. I'd be happy to subscribe a month before release if I was guaranteed to get in, though.
---
Hadn't considered that .. going to be AWESOME not having the kids playing during the day.
---
/r/shittylifeprotips
---
Good talk.
---
Good thing I'm the only person affected by this.
---
DM is in phase 1 so that we cannot farm the gear and make MC too easy. Makes me think phase 1 needs to provide enough time for most guilds to get to 60 and clear MC a few times. Definitely months.
---
Exactly. It's best to just dismiss the people who are unironically outraged over this. They're probably 16 years old. Pay them no mind.
---
No thanks. Would much rather more content after naxx, not entering into flying content which the devs themselves stated helped ruin the game lol
---
The game still exists. Just content won’t.
---
Pre-BIS will be BIS
---
I'm not worried anymore because Blizzard said they would offer free realm changes if we end up getting screwed over by some streamers.
---
In Staysafes interview with the dev team, I believe they specifically mention "3-4 weeks" as their preferred time period for merging all layers. On mobile so can't check, it's on his channel.
---
Woah you're marrying Rhianna
---
What I am looking forward to the most is leveling. Taking it slow, listening to the music, the ambience, seeing the zones how they used to be. 
---
Classic isn't going anywhere, at least not for a long time. You don't have the fear of it shutting down like pservers. Take your time, enjoy it. Raiding will still be there for you.
---

It would also mean lower prices. 3x limited resource drives the price down.
---
Hell yeah, getting paid to play WoW in my underwear!!
---
Legit no idea what you two are on about- lots of interviews went out today. Tips asked the question [https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=930](https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=930) and there was an article about it from major news site. They 100% said they're interested in BC / WoTLK or content post Naxx if the community demands it.
---
That's the 3rd anniversary mentioned, haha.
---
You've got all that going on but still have time to be buttmad about this release date?
---
Big yikes.
---
If you have similar objectives and playstyles is the real question when choosing to play with someone.  Family or not.
---
I’ll check him out. 
---
It is a bit odd though that a spec could be considered useless by so much of the community for an entire expansions (I’m assuming it got fixed it BC?)
---
I hope it doesn't last any longer than a month
---
Hmm, maybe if she was a priest
---
I don't mind new content, but a balancing pass to make all specs raid viable to some degree would be fantastic.
---
It's only for phase one. There is NO gold that early in the game. Calm your tits
---
Originally there were no battlegroups at all, that's what I and a lot of other people who PVPd back then want. After they were introduced I remember never seeing people that I PVPd against anymore.
---
The idea of the challenge is you will have to get help to level since it's an mmo
---
Each server will have 2-3 layers (copies of the world) within the server. When you create your character and logon you will be "assigned" to a layer. Players will continue to be assigned to a layer until it fills up (cap is 2-3k players) then players will begin being assigned to the next layer. You are locked into your layer but you can join other layers by grouping with friends or joining a guild, so you don't need to worry about not being able to play with someone. Presumably, chat and the AH will be shared across all layers in a realm so you can still see and talk to everyone on your realm. At some point before phase 1 ends they will merge the layers on a realm and you will go back to 1 layer per realm.
---
Think of it like mini servers that share a group together and at some point shortly after release each group will be merged.
---
God bless you child
---
Because it could cause instability for everyone with initial numbers bound to be incredibly high. I think they are a choosing this as a lesser of all evils.
---
You were one of the couple hundred in full T3?
---
Any news on server population? How many playeres can be online at the same time when layers end in phase 2?
---
I don't really see what difference it makes then. If you don't have time to devote to an extremely grindy and time consuming game, what does it matter when it launches?
---
And it still only matters if you know someone on another layer. You talk like you are going to be \*the\* highest level person on the game, and that the people who get max level first are going to know someone on every layer so they can just go layer to layer, farming Black Lotus, and completely ignoring the fact that there will be others at the same or similar level, and that you won't know someone on every layer.
---
10k population is retarded and you should feel retarded for thinking it's good.
---
I've never played WoW and never really thought about purchasing it, but there seems to be so much hype about this classic release. I've been looking for another big multiplayer game to get into, is this something I'd be able to dive into and thoroughly enjoy, or would I need to be playing the current version to get context?
---
Half a layer
---
I had a sub every expansion, played since the first day, would quit for like 2-3 months each expac. Never got the statue :(
---
\*\* Servers will be 'layered' (basically renamed full-world Sharding) for the first few weeks. Will be shut off as soon as it can be, or at the end of phase 1, whatever comes first. \*\* Waht? You mean the players i will level with in phase 1 will be from all sorts of servers?
---
phasing 3k people or even 100 people in the same area is much more intensive than phasing 3000 in an entire continent.
---
A lot of folks don’t understand it. It was explained to me recently and I have to say, it began to make sense, and seemed the most logical way to work this issue.
---
The basic concept, if my understanding is even remotely close, layering is building additional servers, but they share the population. Think of the base/primary server as “servername”, then add your layered servers sharing the same name, but add a number to it: “servername1”, “servername2”, etc. 
---
What this means to the end users, is that you will be part of a server population as large as say 10k players using 4 servers. Because each server handles up to 2-3k players at a time. 
---
Here’s the winning ticket: This means that as player log on, and the primary server begins to fill up, then servername1 splits responsibilities with the primary server. (Sort of like sharing, but you’re still part of the base server community). As this continues, each server takes and handles part of the player population until 4/5 servers are filled. As the players log off, players are seamlessly transitioned back to the primary server - completely behind the scenes and unrecognized by the end user.
---
So you’ll still have the same friends, and play with the same community. But, instead of waiting in a que to log in, you’ll simply connect to another server to play with other players on the same base server, but on a layered server. If someone playing on servername1 invites you to group, you should be able to switch over without any issue. (Providing there are reserved slots available for this purpose). Most importantly, you’ll most often be associated with the players you log in at the same time with - because you’ll likely be on the same layer each time you log in, if your playing time remains constant.
---
Eventually, if players stop playing, the layered servers simply lie dormant and can be removed without affecting the active player base. This way, servers won’t need to be merged, alleviating all of the problems THAT chaos brings.
---
Trust me. Layering is brilliant.
---
Hey man, everyone here is very **O P R E S S E D** by this release date. Cut them some slack.
---
"A layer's just a bigger shard, numbnuts."        
---
          
---
"Alright, zip it!"
---
Like I just said in my comment how are they suppose to know that. How do they determine if an account that has been inactive for 3 years is going to actually play versus someone who is currently subbed and playing the game. It makes more sense to give it to the active player who has a higher chance of actually participating. I’m not sure why people are so butt hurt about it when it’s more of a stress test than a beta anyways.
---
I had way more time in university even with a part-time job. Same for my wife who was in a pretty tough major (EE)
---
I was hyped enough for the new Tool album in August, now this as well? August is shaping up to be the best month of this year!
---
They said maximum it will be through phase 1 but they'd hope to merge the layers earlier than that.
---
Nothing will "ruin the economy" more than the insanely fast resource spawns on private servers did. If those are fine, then this is more than fine.
---
I think you might be a little confused on how this works. It doesn't matter if they have higher volume, only if they are able to corner the market. They have higher volume, but there's also higher population. They're competing with more people. If anything, higher supply means the prices will be slow to inflate compared to PServer prices in the past, and it'll be more difficult for any guild to get a monopoly because of layering. You need to have another guild, who doesn't re-phase onto your layer, on each layer; who also isn't competing with you for materials.
---
Semi-hardcore players would still get monopolized out of the economy by hardcore players on a non-layered server. That isn't how it works. If anything, it will be easier for non-hardcore players to get rare mats like devilsaur and black lotus, or farm recipes like crusader, major healing potions, etc.
---
Plus, the majority of people will be banking mats by farming gold and buying them on the AH while they are cheap... not necessarily farming them directly in the world. That's just the more efficient way to do it most of the time.
---
Pretty sure that quote is from Da Vinci, though. Abraham Lincoln started playing in TBC.
---
not until after BWL. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/classic-content-plan/120346
---
&gt; If you get put into a fresh layer does that mean you basically have first dibs on valuable resources like devilsaur or black lotus?
---
I feel like that issue could easily be avoided by 1) keeping the id of the individual layers hidden from players and 2) staggering the spawn times/locations of resources across the layers of a server. That would make it pretty hard to abuse the system in that way.
---
Okay buddy, if that's what you want to believe.
---
Practically all shaman tier gear is exclusively resto or heavily leaning towards resto spec gear. Having other gear equivalent to that for enhance and elemental would be really nice. There is plenty of room to add new gear for different builds and specs without having to increase power cap. Not all classes are black and white choices for BIS gear.
---
Well that's lame as fuck. But they're apparently hell bent on it even though server queues worked just fine in 2004-2006
---
Yea. They will be much less likely to commit to the game with less free time.
---
Before you say it, vanilla was revolutionary at the time; why would someone spend their free 2-3 hours grinding in wow over enjoying a more modern game today?
---
Yes, and that new classic content doesn't pose any chances for slipper slopes.
---
you willl most likely be assigned a layer the first time you log in, and will keep that layer for the remainder of the system,eg illidan l1, but if your friends are on L2 you can switch, but once you switch that becomes your base layer also l1 Eastern kingdoms links to L1 kalmidor, when layering ends you will see some new faces
---
AH will be linked,but i doubt chat will be
---
Literally never happend
---
Honestly dude, the thought that the fresh experience i was expecting will now be with a bunch of randoms (as in not actually from my chosen server - is that how it will work? Sounds like, but would love to be wrong, please link/explain if so) Is very much a deal breaker. The whole hype about classic to me is the revival of community. This decision is the shittiest shit that ever shat.
---
No, layering is only present during phase one. World bosses come in a later phase.
---
There would have to be some catchup mechanisms. Naxx gear already invalidates like 70% of the gear before it, so much so that if a mostly Naxx geared group encountered large group of MC players, they’d wreck the MC group. Its pretty unappealing to have geared 60’s one shotting other fresh 60’s or 60’s just starting.
---
That would be the best solution to make everyone happy. I know most people seem to be hyped for new content, but I personally would rather just stay on a standard Classic server.
---
I DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION BUT IF I YELL LOUD ENOUGH I FEEL LIKE I AM FIXING THE PROBLEM
---
Okay, thank you, that guild thing is very good to know. But I was explicitly talking about when you're just running around solo in the world and run into a friend you know. It's an amazing feeling that has been gone from wow since sharding got introduced. So grouping would remove the possibility of that feeling. The feeling comes from the excitement of running into people you know without the expectation to.
---
Because there will be 20k pkayers all in one zone. Have you seen any game or expansion launch?
---
Eh, I'm fully over the whole classic crew. Tips literally asked all the questions blizzard wanted him to ask and he sat there like a balloon full of creatine and praised each of their answers. He didn't bother to stop the devs once and ask "well what about no changes?" It kinda looks like Classic Crew is working for blizzard instead of WITH THEM to bring us Classic WoW. I mean was #nochanges a big gimmick just to get those of us who ACTUALLY didn't want ANY changes to join your crew just to not care about it at the very last second? the fuck
---
What was the point of Blizzard contacting Nostalrius if they wen't going to run Classic the way Nos did? Did that even ever happen? All you literally have to do is bring online a few servers, max their population to 3500 or so and let us play. 
---
The fuck is the big fucking deal?
---
Yea it's like it's "technically summer", but so is September 22nd, and that would be BS if that was the release date. So how close to the end of summer can they push it to still be technically correct that it's summer but be total bullshit? I think Aug 27 is teetering on that line. Even 2 or 3 weeks earlier and it would be fine.
---
When will we know if we have been selected?
---
Its stated in the article.
---
&gt;Birmingham said that the developers talked about putting the unarmored mounts into ***Classic*** for a limited time, but decided against it.  
---
&gt;"We recently talked about this, and we were going back and forth for a little bit," Birmingham said. "We pretty much committed at this point not to do that.  
---
&gt;"The reason why is because we don't want to incentivize people to a playstyle that they would not otherwise choose for their first level up experience. If someone comes into ***World of Warcraft***, and we say, 'Hey, you can only get this mount if you get to level 60 and get all this gold in the first month...', we don't want to force that on anybody.
---
I'm sure for the first few days itll be a bunch. But you're right, after that it is much better this way.
---
Tedious to actually go out into the world for something?  I guess the whole game is going to be tedious for you, then.  This is vanilla, not some trash expansion like TBC.
---
That's not just a bunch of people getting added every now and then. Entire communities will be thrown together. Suddenly 50% of people on the server are new. This also causes sudden drastic economic changes.
---
I really don't think that's any better than layering for a while.
---
Yes. I understand people that don't want any changes, but I feel it's the best option for both short term and long term server population and stability.
---
Without layering/sharding, Blizzard would need a lot of servers to handle the huge number of people wanting to play on release (without ridiculous like 5-10 hr queues). This spreads the population out too much, so that in a few months when the initial hype wears down and people play less or quit entirely the servers populations will be too low.
---
Server merges are another option, but how is that functionally different than layering? At least this way no one has to change their character or guild name once the layers are merged.
---
If I had to guess it would be that you need a sub to be invited because they're only handing out so many invites and I doubt they want to invite people if they don't intend on subbing and playing the beta.
---
The only way this doesn't suck is if global channels are seen by all layers allowing people to invite folks from other layers. This blows but I guess it's slightly better than sharding
---
The layers are capped at 2-3k players and the number of layers are capped per realm at 3 or so. Meaning there is already a cap built in for every server of around 9k.
---
The population numbers will probably drop in half at least after a few weeks.  That's how releases always work.
---
Ah right, thanks.
---
They should only be sharding the non contested zones....
---
We'll see tho
---
Having this in Ungoro\*, black lotus zones, STV, or world boss zones will ruin the world pvp lol
---
You can't have two arenas up in STV
---
I got another question though, will this layering thing make world PvP balanced? So i don't have to be feared as an alliance to play on a imbalanced "layer" rather than "Server".
---
This I can’t answer. I’m at a loss.
---
LOLOLOLOLOLOL
---
i guess thats where we disagree, I think an active player i have encountered should never hav a chance to be on some other instance of the game, and that kind of ruins the experience, wheras that cant happen in my proposed method.
---
It does, and I don’t think they’d change anything pre naxx so that’s why I’m not considering those tiers.
---
Not gonna lie, I'd like my Trolls back to be a little less bent... And boots would be nice.
---
&gt; ret and prot are worthless meme specs tho yeah
---
Eh, there's been recent meta change over the past couple weeks where Ret can do some pretty high DPS in raids using a spell / proc based build, like 1,000 single target dps in BWL gear.
---
Prot's still fairly garbage tho.
---
As much as I was in the July 16 camp and want it ASAP I think it's a blessing in disguise that it's late summer.  I'll have a nice social summer, enjoy the weather and outdoor activities, then bunker down from september to christmas.  In the grand scheme of things that 6 weeks isn't a huge difference for me.
---
well if you have time to level up 2 classes each...
---
It seems most of the hate now is aimed towards people that may use the layer system to control farm spots, or avoid pvp.
---
Valid concerns; but too soon, IMO, to speculate on a system we have only known about for less than a day.
---
Woohoo!!! 😀
---
Layering is cancer and exploitable.
---
Sucks to suck
---
That’s a little dramatic, don’t you think? It’s only for the first phase and there’s a chance it will end before the end of phase one since the only statement made was that “layering will not occur after phase one”
---
Do you remember what vanilla was like?  It fucking sucked trying to get quests done with so many people in the same area.  They didn't intend the game to be like that back then.  They did it because they fucked up with not enough realms.  They have admitted that multiple times.
---
Exactly how long I played MOP
---
Yeah, whatever it was it’ll be interesting to see!
---
But it likely will, for a more stable launch. The alternative *no sharding* which means the servers crashing and everybody lagging. 
---
You can deal with a month or so of sharding before they turn it off so the game is playable.
---
Ohhh what a shame. But is it like a dlc or standalone and I pay to pay to play it?
---
That wowhead article you're quoting seems to be written by someone who didn't even watch the video he's using as a source (unfortunately).
---

---
These two explicitly mention the same "play session". There's more where they mention it **might** even change your shard as you switch continents with boats or zeppelins, can't remember which interview it's from right now.
---
Quit being butthurt.
---
Students have the most free time even if school started.
---
Just wait until you get a real job that has overtime in it. Even worse if you date or have a family. 
---
Then you'll be crying to be a student again.
---
LEEEERRROOOOYYYYYY. JEEEENNNKKKIINNSS
---
nobody in their heart believes that september is actually summer.
---
Something someone told me once,
---
A band has a lifetime to release their first album. And only a year to release their second.
---
I don't really understand why everyone keeps posting this.   Like, why the obsession with rogues?
---
1.12 wasn't rogues' strongest patch.  And in an even fight, a rogue will lose to most classes, and at best can guarantee 1 fight won every 5 minutes with prep.
---
If you really want to not get ganked your best bet is to be higher level, and either be a warlock with felhunter or hunter to detect the rogue coming.  If a rogue doesn't get the jump they will never win a fight.
---
Yeet
---
He later says he is wrong in that thread. You can be put into a different layer each time you log in.
---
Why do participants need an active subscription to get consideration for beta? They aren't going to get good feedback from current subs because they not only probably don't like Classic, but they are okay enough with how shit BFA is to still be playing so there's nothing of value to be had from those players.
---
One possible implementation of this is that when the first guildie logs in for the day that will decide the layer for the rest. So there would be no control of what layer you are on 
---
In any case how would the guild know what layer it's on? The only way to know would be to see if you can see people from the sister guild to figure out if you are in different ones.
---
It would be very hard to coordinate and if there is abuse hopefully it will be relatively easy for blizz to spot it and stop it.
---
That is not how it will work at all. Stop with that crap. A layer is an ENTIRE CONTINENT with 2-3k players. This isn't like sharding where it is easy to jump between them and multiple shards exist.
---
A layer is like an overflow channel. The chances of you finding a friend in another layer, let alone multiple is next to zero.
---
At best there will probably be like 2 MAYBE 3 layers and only for the first few weeks.
---
I highly doubt there will be 7-9k people per server on at one time.
---
Might be worth that for lw here too for a hunter/rogue
---
I rolled on PVP azshara back in the day. It was a living hell playing as Alliance and dying 500 times per level. But if they give me azshara at New Classic I will be forced to roll on that even if I have to suffer through PVP, LOL.
---
Mages at a close second with only being unable to blink out of charm.
---
That reminds me, do we know what version of wow this will be? Humans had 'everyman for himself' for a little while and it was bonkers for women classes.
---
Other than newly introduced bugs, or coding issues, I think most of the old exploits wouldn't work in the modern client anyways.
---
There’s none.
---
Layering is not sharding.
---
The technology is just not there &lt;.&lt; Apparently its all same server at least, and will be ''  **Layering will only be used for a couple of weeks or maybe a month** ''
---
[https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow)
---
Its a monthly pay of 15$
---
Lol, take my upvote.
---
I agree. " To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants " AND  "PARTICIPANTS will also need to have an active subscription ".
---
It was never stated that it will cover the entirety of phase one,  it was only stated that it will be in phase one and will not be in phase 2.      If the game gets to a point where it’s not needed they will remove it.   They aren’t going to keep it in until the end of phase 1 if it’s not doing anything anymore.  Is it likely? Who knows. But I’m just saying it was never stated to last the entirety of phase one, although that could be a possibility.
---
Mixing WoW and Marie Kondo for a meme. I’m impressed! Lol.
---
What year of school are you in?  If you are high school/undergrad and you think you have no time now...
---
You should
---
I start back about a week and a half before the full launch and you'd better believe Im skipping class on the 27th to play WoW when it launches. I'll tell my professors I have a doctor's appointment or some shit.
---
So when WoW first launched back in the day, the epic lvl 60 mounts had no armor. When patch 1.4 dropped, those mounts were removed from the vendors and the current day racial ground mounts were released. For example, as a troll, before 1.4 you could only buy the Ivory Raptor or the Mottled Red Raptor. These were the same model as the lvl 40 mounts, but different colors. After 1.4 the Ivory and Red were no longer for sale and instead there was the Swift Orange Raptor, Swift Blue Raptor and Swift Olive Raptor mounts for sale, which were new models with armor on them.
---
I think private servers make new servers but this is blizzard so they might not feel the same way
---
Post nax content would be great to help fill in some holes with some of the less optimal specs. Some armor set bonuses or just specific stat pieces to help out things like boomkin or shadowpriest be more viable.
---
This is specifically for managing launch load. Server queues work just fine in the long term, but specifically for the weeks and maybe month of launch, just doing queues can lead to really shitty experiences. Vanilla's launch was a mess as I understand it.
---
http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/remembering-the-launch-of-world-of-warcraft
---
&gt; At launch, things took a turn for the bizarre. Blizzard’s forecasts for the game were dead wrong, the swell of players flooding servers was too much for them to handle. Stores were selling out of the game fast and online vendors were taking orders left and right. When they flipped the servers on, the little light flicked from “on” to “burning on fire please help” as server queues reached the 1000s. The servers were crashing harder than burning ship trying to walk into Mordor.
---
&gt; If you got past the queues, you were greeted with latency issues, including the infamous “kneel and loot stuff for half an hour” and the even more infamous “disconnect because Internet was really sketchy back then compared to now” and be greeted by the 1,000 person queue. Blizzard issued game time credits for lost playtime and the rocky ride lasted over a month. Afterward, the servers were plagued with dilapidated hardware that wasn’t optimized to run the game and the entire issue wasn’t “perfected” until all the servers were upgraded.
---
And that launch was only with the very small initial player base compared to the amounts that play and have played today. I personally expect the launch of Classic to have the highest number of concurrent players WoW has ever experienced. Because a significant portion of current, or recent subscribers are going to try it out for sure. And countless more people are going to come back for Classic. Blizzard needs something to mitigate that problem so the quite literally millions people who are excited can have a good experience on launch day and soon after. Sharding, and now Layering are solutions to those problems. I agree that they're not perfect, but they seem to be the best options for handling a massive influx of players for the few weeks of launch.
---
How is this any different then layering? If you are already planning to merge the servers, why not have them start off as 1 big merged server?
---
edit: THis is what i dont get about people complaining about layering btw... merging servers later, will also give a benefit to people from the LOW pop server that is joining the med/high pop server... They will have been able to farm mats etc easier, and even have PVP advantage (less competition for Rank 14)
---
The game is ruined! We should all abandon it! /s
---
Yeah, I think the more popular it gets, the harder it would be to achieve. Guess you could put a time limit in addition to the level cap limit (2 weeks, or a month maybe)
---
This seems unlikely. They aren't just turning the old servers back on, they are creating entirely new ones. If you want to meet up with players from old servers, you should probably try and set that up beforehand.
---
We are getting slippery sloped. Many people called it out that if we said okay fine do sharding on launch for a week or two that's not a huge deal... especially since it will only be the starting zones, but now we are going to have it for over a month on the whole game and suddenly that's acceptable? This could ruin many people first leveling experiences to 60. Getting ganked? No problem just get an invite from a buddy on another layer. Can't see your group of people that have been leveling along with you the past week anymore and invite them because you don't know they're there? Forget about it. I'm not unreasonably complaining. This is a bad change that shouldn't happen. We should get back sharding or even layering now in starting zones like originally promised and accept no less. Blizzard has been listening people, take advantage of it now before it's too late..
---
Looks good, thought like Sable17 said droping tailoring after getting you make your Truefaith (a high level chest you only get from tailoring)
---
It's going to be really fucking noticable when you log into a server with a whole new set of people every day.
---
That's what EverQuest does. They have a range of servers staggered through different old content.
---
I’m extremely busy the first and last week of each month, so I can’t take a lot of time off right away, but I’m definitely going to set up a month or two of 3 day weekends!  Pretty excited for that!
---
Feralas for me.
---
Its even a bit different from that. They are portraying it as basically once a layer fills up there will be an overflow layer.
---
So it is even less panic inducing than this sub and the discord are making it out to be.
---
The chances of having like 2-3k people on at once, and then even another 2-3k on a single server to make yet another layer is so low.
---
All these people acting like you'll be able to jump layers and mess with the economy are dumb.
---
I won't blame any of my friends who choose new names
---
Lolol 2months? Kid will be sleeping most of the time...2hrs at a time
---
I missed out on classic and most of BC. I'm looking forward to experiencing the games roots, what made it the king of MMOs and all that jazz.
---
Also...
---
 HORDE FOR LIFE!!!
---
Probably at least a month, potentially until phase 2x
---
Fuck yes
---
At what point does it stop just being tourism?
---
snowflakes rekt
---
Hunter, Mage, SL Warlock, Spriest, Warrior.
---
Yea, but that part wasn't in the video
---
Wooooowee!!!
---
Cheap Devilsaur
---
Then Blizzard should have said specifically that in order to be **invited** you need an active sub, not just to participate. The ambiguity in the post can lead people to believe that a sub is required for the **chance** of an invite, which I find somewhat reprehensible. What if it turned out that you didn't need to sub for an invite and a bunch of people subbed unnecessarily once they found out that they didn't get an invite?
---
**FEEL THE BERN!** - Ragnaros (probably)
---
ITT: you can’t complains about stuff that doesn’t kill you
---
You can dive right in. The current version's story all happened afterwards, so it is of no relevance at all. If you want context, play (or read up on) Warcraft 1, 2, and 3.
---
Day 1 is the monday night though as it's a global release.  Tuesday should be fine.  Having said that I'm only taking the wednesday - friday off.
---
Lol you didn't even read half his comment did you.  God damn brain donor.
---
Because people over 16 also play the game.
---
I agree wholeheartedly with what you’re saying.  I play retail right now and the phasing, sharding, and all that crap is really annoying.  It does not have a place in Classic outside initial starting zones during the launch period.
---
They absolutely did not say at most a month. 
---
Here's a dev talking about it being in the ["early **months**"](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779).
---
Thanks friend. I live to serve.
---
Yes, always give the corporate overlords the benefit of the doubt. Except, no, that's terrible - don't do that. Hope for the best, expect the worst, be on their ass about it.
---
I'll be off from 24 Aug - 16 Sep.
---
You’re making a lot of assumptions about the retail community based off of zero data or evidence. Just because someone is currently subbed or playing retail doesn’t mean they have no desire to play classic. I know plenty of retail players myself included who have been waiting so long for this. I’m sorry you’re so angry that they choose to give paying customers access first.
---
The main con is doing this will likely exacerbate population distribution problems. Huge amounts of people will flock to Blackrock, Tichondrius and Medivh, other lesser known realms won't attract players.   
---
So if that happens this setup would be far worse than just having server sheep/donkey/cow or whatever random naming system which would see a much more even distribution of players.
---
Hyperbole, nice.
---
WOOOO!!! Never played vanilla,  this could be painful
---
This and realm lists being announced early have been the biggest deal for me so far.
---
People are so fucking stupid.  They don't want any sort of layering, sharding, or dynamic respawns because that's how it was back in vanilla.  They seem to forget how shitty queues are; how shitty waiting for a single mob to respawn for minutes at a time and just hoping you or someone in your group is able to tag it; how shitty server lag is.  The only reason releases were how they were back in the day is because technology sucked and because there weren't enough realms, which they have admitted multiple times.  A truly authentic vanilla experience in terms of server technology would suck ass and likely harm the game.
---
Adult life doesn't free you all the time. Most of my vacation time at work is in the early summer (we bid for vacation time and it's always winter/fall/later summer that all get grabbed first. Also this REALLY sucks for my prof/teacher friends. Lol
---
What is this?
---
Did you need that $7 for some Taco Bell?
---
You're thinking of sharding but layering and sharding are not the same thing.
---
I think that adresses the other issue that has been talked about, which is initial zerg and dead realms the moment when tourists leave. 
---
That way you can put 2 realms in 1, effectively increasing the cap, and still maintain somewhat healthy population from Phase 2 onwards.
---
Have seen very few people point out how layering is extremely bad for world PvP which is the most organic during phase one. This is not good
---
It's good. It's a better version of sharing that works better for classic. They have also stated that this is just to "survive launch" and plan on removing sharding /layering after phase 1. It's impossible for the servers to handle launch without sharding.
---
and a majority of the gaming news websites, silly me
---
Eh im not gonna take any chances either. I'll probably do a 4 day weekend after release but Im not gonna bank a whole week of time on it.
---
if he's the one, he won't postpone his honeymoon for a video game
---
Hmm, I didn’t consider that some servers may have problems like that, also imbalances in horde/alliance ratios are tedious .
---
What do you mean by “ forced to roll” ? You mean your friends will force you or you’ll just go for it for the nostalgia (&amp; shit and giggles) even if it’s hell?
---
"Classic summer" written over and over again.
---
The honest answer is power creep is a lot more noticeable in vanilla. Classes literally 1 or 2 shotting the average player when in full BiS. Letting the top 1% on the server have an even greater ilvl difference would be... problematic. Saying that, I'm all for equal ilvl to naxx content.
---
Don't let the forum people here with their hardcore raid attitudes make you think that will be the norm. There will be a very small percent of people who manage to clear naxx. Even 3 years post release, the grind to have the gear to even get there is a lot of time.
---
Dumb.
---
I used to love Friday night drunk Beerazhan runs on alts.
---
Plenty of people were excited for a beta as it meant a release date. Unless I'm mistaken, august is still summer. And you do realize that Blizzard would make more money if they released the game earlier as that would mean MORE subs, not just a FEW subs to MAYBE get a chance at a beta invite?
---
This is the news I was waiting for!!
---
I would guess it's to make sure that if you're busy with going back to school, or last vacation, etc. that you don't get screwed if you miss that first rush to get out of the clusterfuck. Looking forward to hearing them explain in more detail about that though.
---
honestly what kind of fucking servers do they use when private vanilla servers have no problem. Even retail is some cheap server shit after I watched asmon try to do world pvp just instantly rips server.
---
This is what people who say they hate xrealm bgs don't understand. They clearly didn't pvp in Vanilla. All it was was super long queue times, only to get into a BG with a premade just for everyone to realize they should afk for the quick loss.
---
BGs were fucking horrible before xrealms.
---
It's running on the 7.3.5 client so old bugs won't work.
---
I dont think its blizzards fault here. As a gaming community we have been preyed upon at every step for tue extra dollar. 
---
I will be playing day 1 but if i dont like the feel i can always quit. If phase2and up is different and they do usethesharding and layering then i will have to hope i am not missing out on the hardcore aspect im after. It would suck to have sharding while im trying to gank or world pvp. Thats a no no. It needs to be difficult for me just as i will make itfor them. I need to have 60s camping my corpse when im in tarren mill killing the bat handler.
---
Its going to boil down to what i see first hand not what they say. There has always been an oops we forgot to turn it off moment and i see plenty of that here.
---
Itsup to me to play and decide if its the resurgence of the nostalgia i crave plus extra. But again its not uncommon now for the consumer to be weary of the ACTUAL pushed product.
---
I wastold there would be dlc cosmetics and shit. That is going to be a killer for me if they go crazy with that stuff. Im not here for that type of bullshit. Thats a qol change on many levels for everyplayer involved and i dont condone those practices. But when greed is involved its a dif story
---
&gt;Layering is 2-3k people per layer
---
So its sharding? Anything that means I can not see / interact with every player in that exact spot at that exact time means they are in another shard, Sure they can change the name to layer if they like but that does not change what it does.
---
Hoping Tabard of the flame makes it
---
Well that is just awful too, so once we reach the cap roughly half the people in IF will just disappear?
---
Wowhead literally made that statement up. Why? Who knows. 
---
Here's a dev talking about it being in the ["early **months**"](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779). Wowhead got a ton of things wrong with that article, hopefully not on purpose.
---
I don't remember the exact efficiency while I want to say gheal lower level was one of the most mana efficient it was slow and in a raid generally the paladin's could handle big burst heals. I remember a lot of being on renew/divine shield mt duty using low level flash heals to top up raid.
---
This is why I think vanilla is gonna let down so many people.
---
You’re never recreating WoW, you’re never going to be able to relive that experience.
---
thank god.
---
Off to find another game then
---
Those are tidal charms.
---
Wouldn't you if you were a company hoping to test your game?  I would choose people who have stuck around too.  Fuck.
---
Gbid runs won’t be a big thing in Classic. On private servers it’s exclusively used on Onyxia pugs.
---
I know that. My argument is... the core playerbase is actually much much older for WoW classic. Yea sure I'm sure some 12 year olds to 18 year olds will check out WoW classic... But I believe a large % of the population that will actually play the game more than 1 week will be older than age 22. Which you are out of school by 22 for the most part.
---
Y
---
It is not but can be abused like it and does not actually fix the launch issue.
---
Months. Plural. Is reading really that hard?
---
&gt; Can't see your group of people that have been leveling along with you the past week anymore and invite them because you don't know they're there? 
---
??? What
---
If you've been leveling with a group of people, add them. Is it common to log in and explore a zone on the ground to try and find previous groupmates?
---
The only genuine downside I've heard is that it allows a way to avoid ganking, but even then it seems like most/all layers are going to have gankers, it's not like it's guaranteed that you'll have a friend online who happens to be in a different layer on the same realm.
---
The problem it solves, on the other hand, is a huge one: making the game playable during the first weeks post-launch. I'll take a hyper-specific gank escape over spending 4 hours at the login screen to fight with 200 people over a couple of boars.
---
&gt;We should get back sharding in starting zones like originally promised and accept no less
---
How is this not worse? Sharding means you get those cross-realm ghost characters who you can't properly interact with fading in and out of existence.
---
I hope you have a great time in WoW.
---
I could never afford my epic on my 180 days played character :(
---
It's really not bad for world PvP. Each layer has the population cap of an entire vanilla realm. There are plenty of people out there to kill and the setup required to "jump" layers to avoid fights is so prohibitive that it's not a realistic thing to worry about.
---
oh god, here we go with the teacher debate... yes they are saints! Teachers have harder jobs than MOMS! I SAID IT!!
---
Here, have a downvote for beeing stupid.
---
What? You have to kill all the other bosses in MC before you can summon Rag. Are you high?
---
Reddit/r/gatekeeping
---
I mean. I decided I'm not going to show up to my classes, does that count?
---
I actually played vanilla with my parents when I was 7
---
No, they are thinking about getting people who is serious about classic and have a passion for the game to try the beta for the best possible feedback. If you really want to play the beta and give feedback on how it is you wouldn't mind paying for it.
---
No. You should definitely keep playing on pservers. Please.
---
And I thought Fox News had horrible spin LOL
---
Will the graphics be like how they were in the vanilla?  Or how they are now ?
---
lol. bai!
---
Another kid who doesn’t understand that this launch will have millions of people, unlike the original launch of vanilla and that in order for the game to be half ass playable we need sharding/layering for a early bit.
---
i remember saying to one of my friends “I hope blizzard actually releases in the start of summer and not August” because august is in the summer and it’s just what blizz does- release shit in august.
---
Sure I understand, but like, worst case scenario is you don't sub and you don't get invited to be a free beta tester.
---
He's not worth it. He doesnt even fully understand what layering is, or how it works, but wants to spread misinformation. I wonder if he does it purposefully, or is just that daft.
---
But at the same time, those people are still on the same server, just not the same layer. So you can still talk to them
---
Fuck towelliee
---
I am happy, take a few days off work and have peace and quiet during the day
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
istoryi am a rollover from the private realms. There is already mass wpvp planned for honor grinding and rep grinding. This is straight up a killer for so many guilds already planning their schedules. We dont know work arounds to shit like that yet but we are weighing our options
---
quality meme
---
How to get banned on launch.
---
ahahahahha bye plz
---
same
---
Layering is a better version of sharding made specifically for classic. I welcome it with open arms because that's how the servers will survive the launch. There's no way the servers can handle a launch without it.

---
Unfortunatlly, the addition of the "get off at next flight-point" Button... kinda scared me though... I know its "just to make it easyer" and "you could just logoff to do the same thing" but you also could just spamm LFG to find a tank...and the LFG tool just "Made it easier" 
---
annyways, only 105 nights of sleep till we can start training our unarmed skill again :D
---
I like the idea of post naxx content. It will be a while until we get there but I hope they don’t dismiss the idea and release tbc instead.
---
It's going to be one in the same. You'll be able to go to server select, go through character creation, but you won't be able to actually load into the game. You're an idiot, pal.
---
Yeah thats true to be fair. That said didn't they just launch a new patch for live? Like a raid patch. Cant have big compition from their own game for the cross over of classic wow and live wow players so it would make sense. 
---
Most likely just some polish to go in the end.
---
And here's a dev talking about it being in the ["early **months**"](https://youtu.be/UHMd0KC3eTY?t=779).
---
Wowhead literally made that comment about "at most a month" up. They didn't have anyone at the blizzard event and don't know any more than we do from the videos.
---
Blizz should not gate testing of the game behind how long you have been subbed.
---
any chance for a 16:9 version? 1440p :D
---
They have now updated this to “layering” which is sharding but better. Pretty much that you load into a version of your server that you and everyone you see stay in until logging out for the same Vanilla experience. It’ll only ever layer if the server cap is reached to reduce waits to login. 
---
Obviously, not perfect, but better than straight up sharding.
---
Sounds like your Pay Per Roll system is just slower GDKP with RNG.
---
Well it came out in the US on that day where we do it mm/dd/yy so...11/23/04
---
I don't think it's a negative...?
---
&gt; But layering definitely is just a few weeks
---
What's your source to be so definitive? What you linked? It may very well be only a few weeks but that video is all non-committal and broad answers and examples. The only thing relatively certain is that it won't last past Phase 1.
---
Also, I don't see how you don't see how BRS is relevant.
---
How do you get your buddy on a different layer? How do you even know he's on a different layer to begin with other than physically trying to meet him in the world somewhere? The setup required to "jump layers" via a friend inviting you to a group is not a realistic thing to worry about.
---
Why would you not be able to invite people you grouped with...?
---
I don't think you understand what layering is or how it works...
---
Wait new tool album August 30th?
---
Fucking Tony Robbins 😂
---
Are you serious? Servers were down ALL the time back then. It got so bad I got tons of free months of gametime as a compensation.
---
Well, it's partly tongue-in-cheek. Because if anything I've only gotten worse at PVP since then. But I never would have met the friends I met had I not sucked at PVP and found other people to suck with.
---
teehee
---
&gt; there was an article about it from major news site.
---
Link it then, stop shilling your classic YouTube channel, you're one out of ten million bandwagoning clickbait artists trying to get clicks off the hype.
---
No, I don't, but that doesn't mean it's a paid beta.
---
It means it's a CLOSED beta, a complete norm in the industry. Why do you think you should be entitled free access to a testing beta of the game?
---
WoD had codes given out at an event that cost considerable time and money to go to for most people, that's a bad argument.
---
WOTLK had keys given out a Blizzcon, which costs to a lot more than a wow sub to attend.
---
I know as a fact through experience that you get a better beta testing phase picking subscribers based on prior beta experience with good feedback reports, which is exactly what they're doing here.
---
Once again, why should blizzard be essentially paying to have you use their server resources, take names up and probably provide no positive feedback other than "This sucks fuck blizzard lol." for a standardized closed testing beta.
---
I figured as much. I started wow right before cataclysm came out, so i know next to nothing of the game before that. This is something I Could definitely get in to.
---
Yeah that ain’t happening.
---
I see your point and it’s a fair one. Maybe it’s better for people who seek to play on the same server to act confidential and try to bring an even number of horde and alliance guilds together.
---
I mean, no. The worst case scenario is subbing because you think you need to to get an invite, finding out you didn't need to sub to get an invite and then not getting invited after all.
---
Exactly, a lot of people are quoting the wowhead article saying two weeks to a month is fact, when they never mention 2 weeks and say 1 month is a best case scenario. It's important to be realistic about these things, Blizzard never achieves the best case scenario.
---
&gt; good luck making any meaningful connections for the first few months
---
That's going to be the case regardless. Making meaningful contacts during the levelling process is infrequent for a lot of reasons.
---
&gt; Blizz did that and it ended up with the WoW we have today. 
---
TBC literally proved you could improve all classes/specs and close the gap, while still keeping it interesting.
---
&gt;You make one change, meta shifts, now other classes are on top, make  changes again, etc etc. Its a can of worms and youd eventually end up  with Classes that are nothing like Vanilla and bastardizing the whole  product. 
---
So you think further increasing the gap between the best specs/classes is good? Post-Naxxramas isn't Vanilla either, that's my entire point. Even at AQ40/Naxxramas levels you see certain specs pulling so far ahead they're doing close to twice the DPS of others. Imagine with post-Naxxramas gear.
---
Sticky for that _session_. Every time you log in you can get a whole new set of players you never met before. 
---
For months.
---
Just like in vanilla.
---
We could well be forced into a specific layer depending on guild/friends or even persistent through logouts to stop people abusing it. We just don't know yet.
---
CELEBRATE GOOD TIMES C'MON! CELEBRATION!
---
They aren’t adding sharding, by the way. They’re implementing layering now and works better for the vanilla feel. Watch the interview tips out did with the Blizzard devs for more details. Sounds like a good compromise for the early days of classic.
---
Still for $15/month. Can't believe people are still paying that much in a subscription to one video game in 2019.
---
Is there a source from this besides Tips? He had a full interview with him and not once said this..
---
I am in STV. Horde is ganking us and is in control of the area. I ask someone to invite me to another layer. We are now in control of STV. I can level in peace.
---
Does 12 am mean midnight release for EU? feelsbad
---
So basically power creep is always perceived as bad and additional power creep would just be worse?
---
I can’t say that I agree, I think of it as progress. But that’s probably a very subjective topic anyways. I can’t say that I’d mind a few more iLevels similar to the increases between existing content ... or as others suggested, add more gear at the same iLevel for a while
---
Not a chance. That would be so broken being able to start at 60 in full epics. What if I never played classic?
---
Prot pally via reck bombs or attrition in the form of the damage auras+self heals
---
Is he flexing?
---
It is for phase one which can last a few months. They can turn it off early, but why they would backtrack from saying only for launch to phase one if that is the case. The devs might have your trust but not mine.
---
You're assuming that you'll be able to see what layer you're on easily....
---
They likely aren't going to up and tell you what layer you're on. The only way to know you're on a different layer from someone is to try and meet them somewhere while not in a group. Then that only tells you that you aren't on the layer of that specific person. You see how it might be a bit difficult to set something like that up?
---
More free time with work then college often times.
---
Leeroy Jenkins!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
They have a point that there's a time limitation to resource generation that will be greatly reduced by this layer aspect. That will have an appreciable effect on the economy. Previously you had *1 server* with 1 set of resource nodes. Now you have a server with *x layers* and x sets of resource nodes. But all those extra resource nodes now feed into one auction house.
---
No, the server is split into different layers. Think of them like channels in other MMOs like FF14. You can be on the same server but in a different channel.
---
Sweet sweet couldn’t get any better of a week then. Unless I could find a leak of the new album on classic launch day....
---
NE warrior, same place
---
THat's WoD bro...
---
I have connected my alarm clock on my phone to Spotify. This album has been my morning alarm for a month now. Shuffled.
---
Assuming that they have an indicator of which layer your in advertised and assuming you will be able to find someone not in your layer to invite you and assuming that layer isn't getting wrecked as well. Can we all stop thinking of the worst case scenario and just enjoy classic when it comes out?
---
There is a LFG thread posted multiple times a week.
---
fuck towelliee
---
My current account doesn't even have any WoW keys on it. I gave my original (circa patch 1.5) account to my mom when I quit WoW since she loved my characters and wanted to preserve them (I was going to sell the account otherwise, I was hardcore and had full BiS at the end of Cata when I quit)
---
&gt; The launch will be a disaster without it
---
And how does layering change that?
---
In case you think this will add convenience to the game launch, you are mistaken. Convenience was never the goal of sharding in the first place, neither it is with layering.
---
Orc. Can't beat that 25% attack power and stun resist
---
The day Towelliee has a compound heart attack on stream will be a good day. Same with his obese girlfriend.
---
I would think having a limit for how many layer-hops one could make in a certain time (like instances) would be adequate enough.  However, I can't imagine blizz going through all the effort to do this for something that will only be around for a few weeks.
---
We can only wait and see!
---
No there isn’t because you don’t buy the game.
---
But that's exactly what I wanted to do...
---
Yeah, they removed the page when Blizzard said there wouldn’t be progressive itemisation :/
---
&gt; "nOt A SuMMeR relEasE"
---
Huh? It comes out a month before the end of Summer.
---
Well, maybe, but I think most people will be too busy enjoying the game to mess with that (not to mention that after phase 1 layers are gone).
---
It is very naive to think that by then people will not be able to change their layers
---
nobody gives a fuck about the new tool album. it's not 2006
---
I thought Ulduars approach to difficulty was fantastic. To this day I think it is the best raid in WoWs history. That being said there were a ton of regrettable decisions made during WoTLKs lifespan.
---
You could always, you know, travel?
---
very very excellent point
---
Awesome. Thank you for clarifying, friend!
---
&gt; It’s not like the majority of realms are going to house tens of thousands of players, right? They never did in the past.
---
That's the exact reason why we are having layering... Servers will have much more people online than 3000.
---
I feel ya. I’m within that range but still studying - damn research. Luckily I’m practically done and will be slamming classic regardless of studies. 
---
I wonder how many people claim to have played patch 1.x.x but in actuality only on private servers. Then the other crowd is likely people who wanted an earlier release date then August - which is fair too!
---
sUmMeR ReLeAse
---
The temptation to make a very inappropriate joke is too strong so I'll just take my leave.
---
BFA launch was a shit show, I sat on the login screen for an entire day before I could login. It was definitely not smooth
---
TBC had a system for finding people looking for specific dungeons but it did not automatically build your group iirc.
---
It will not be that difficult. The way the layers fill up means that unless you are in the same guild, then it is very possible and likely you will not be on the same layer.
---
It doesn't matter if it's a beta or not. The beta thing has nothing to do with it. It's the money...
---
So much misinformation thrown around because of the terrible way they choose to release it. Other people have been saying your layer is only persistent while you stay logged in. But maybe on relog it'll remember your last and send you there. I haven't seen official info personally either way though. Just getting off work now to actually hunt for legit sources :)
---
It's perspective.
---
I couldn't care less what casuals are doing. Two hours after launch I won't be running into them. I'll be playing against the people who are doing that.
---
Also isn't phase one a few months?
---
I think it would be cool to add gear with set bonuses to and use abilities that would make some of the of the other specs more viable in raids, and then come out with content that encouraged bringing those specs. ie drop a shield for pallys that has an on use taunt, then create a raid encounter where Prot Pally can excel on.
---
Should be whole server. You can invite and /w people on other shards and I imagine this tech is not much different.
---
Maybe. But and I know a large part of this has to do with the fact that this was 2005, I was in the military and hungry for interaction that was not let's go to the rifle range and do stupid things, at this point meeting and engaging with new people in a computer game was very new to me and exciting. So it didn't matter that the server was low population and it didn't matter that there were five horde for every two of my alliance, everybody knew everybody and we were friends and I know it sounds corny but when you have meaningful friendships on a server you suddenly just care less about overall population.
---
If I was the age I was when Classic was originally out...I may have found this funny.
---
&gt; You do stay in the same layer.
---
Only for one playing session.

wtf are these unarmored mounts everyone is talking about
---
Unpopular Opinion: Good. I don't want the game flooded with people who just want "the next new thing" and don't actually like MMOs. Making the game for people who hate MMOs is what killed retail WoW.
---
My fall semester starts Aug 19.
---
I dunno.  I bought WoW day one back in whatever year and I remember it being seriously grindy.
---
I dont know if you played pre bc, but the grind is real.  People who never leveled are going to be in for a real shock.  It will be a few months for people to hit 60 who only get on casually and a couple of months for people who only have a couple of hours a night to play.  That is going to turn off a lot of players.  So if people are still playing past a month, they are going to be in it for the long haul.
---
They are playing 2 new songs off the album on their current tour. You can find pretty decent recordings of them on Youtube. They are called Descending and Invincible. I'm seeing them Sunday in Chicago.

I just put a down payment in to go on a camping trip a few days later...

For those that knew an "open" beta (for streamers and a few others)  would mean an autumn release as we have now it was a huge bummer.  We are talking about 27 of August, if you are happy with that as summer, then np. We were hoping to get it at least closer to mid-summer and not start of autumn. Noone looks at an almost September release as summer.  We all know now that Blizz would not do something that would cause them to lose money. Don't be naive. What they have done now they make more money on.
---
That's not going to happen.  The search for better loot is a large part of the raiding experiebce for a lot of players.  There might be a few hardcore guiods willing to run raids week after week for loot that isn't better than what they have, but not many.  For most guilds those raids would be "do it once to see it and then back to leveling alts since we've finished all the high end content".  Blizzard isn't going to spend a ton of resources and time developing new content that most of the players run once and then never see again.
---
Hi, /u/Nenharm
---
Paladins are rocks to rogues scissors.
---
It's my understanding that the Classic Beta opt-in option only became available today.  Is this true?  If so, then very few invites, if any, have gone out.
---
Except you won't be seeing them again. Ever.
---
Fun sidenote: Vin Diesel and Paul Walker played WoW together.
---
Orc Hunter! Zug zug.
---
It's not clear that they're favoring people who've been subscribed for longer over others.
---
&gt;We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game **so that we have the right mix of players**
---
Part of me wants to play in the beta, but that part doesn't care to pay for a sub to get a chance. Do folks even get to keep the characters made in the beta? I don't feel an incentive unless that's apart of the beta.
---
Can we please have this in 4k?
---
Yes. Me too and I agree. My previous comment still stands though:
---
&gt; It would be so much disparity, it would be like putting 40-60 in one queue.
---
&gt; I agree with your statement (and used it many times myself when defending vanilla PvP), but up **to certain point**. The point is where majority of people just hate it and stop queuing for BGs anymore, and I think it would happen.
---
Proof?
---
I grinded what felt like 10,000 days listening to 10,000 days. 
---
I am glad I am not the only one noticing the returning of greatness is across the board!
---
We are discussing the game? I will enjoy classic when it comes out. It is not a worst case scenario in the least. The way the layers fill up mean that if you are not in the same guild, then you will not always be on the same layers. This can and WILL be abused
---
If you live in the US, Sep 2nd is Labor Day.
---
It's an excellent question.  By the same token, what happens when the population drops and you've got 20 people per shard?  There's a reason why this kind of sharding (which isn't new or innovative, regardless of what the devs would have you believe, they are literally aping the systems in EQ and SW:ToR) isn't used everywhere.  It works really well in a game where you don't group a lot, or a game where you group everywhere, and in games with discrete zones.  But the number of shards needed when the game launches and everyone is in 3 starting zones per shard is going to be way, way lower than the number needed a month later when everyone is spread out across all zones.  
---
I'm not saying this solution is necessarily terrible.  There were way worse things they could have done, but it's also not even close to an optimal solution.  Either way, I think it raises as many questions as it answers.
---
So they're intentionally misleading people by making them think that they will have chance (not even a garauntee, a chance) to access the beta if they sub now when in reality they're going to choose the pre-existing subs anyway? That sounds very illegal.
---
Yup technically until September 23rd
---
You seem to miss the point. Put yourself in their shoes. Who would you want testing a game? Someone who hasn't played the game in a long time or someone who is currently playing the game and has been for a while? I'd go with the latter.
---
Anyone else notice the paladin is ret...
---
I'm going to take the first week of September off, and let the launch day blues pass a bit before I really put my nose to the grindstone.
---
I think the nostalgia for different historical eras of WoW offer a much stronger pull than the idea of new developments using old philosophies. TBC is already mostly an extension of Classic vision, and in many ways a direct upgrade mechanically.
---
The epic racial mounts from before 1.4.
---
I admit, I was wrong.
---
&gt; LFG tool will exist through add-ons anyway
---
Had not thought about that, and it's probably true. Still don't think it will replace trade chat spam though, which is what I would like to see. 
---
&gt;I certainly don't need tmog. If it happens later on neat, if not who cares. 
---
Don't think anyone need it. And I care :P
---
I'm not a player who massively care about gear, but I still must admit that getting the cool epic gear feels much better when you actually see the difference on your character as well. It's also a really nice touch that there are very identifiable armor pieces, which happens less when people are running around with transmog. 
---
The problem with classic is that the raid tier gear aren't always upgrades, so you end up with really weird gear, which transmog could solve, but I don't feel like it's worth it for the player interaction you loose.
---
Qq
---
He's a little bit wrong. Fan entitlement didn't kill retail, bad design did. Also it's just a ludicrously dramatic edit.
---
I started playing wow in 2005 at 11 years old, am now in my final year of grad school at 25.
---
Was definitely hoping it would come out closer to this side of the summer.  :(
---
Answer me this:
---
What happens with layering when my friend is in a different layer and wants to group up?
---
I am talking about transfer for TBC.
---
I don't have a gaming computer..... and I have kids
---
Sharding is literally against everything that made WoW special.. what's the point of world building, social interactions, world pvp, making friends and enemies that you know by name, when you can just shard to another layer??
---
Fuck I hate this.
---
It's a hell of a lot better than sharding and a hell of a lot better than 12,000 people fighting for the same mobs.
---
My man! Lok'tar ogar
---
I'm one of those 'second-career' older college students. There's actually quite a few of us in my program.
---
They said at MOST phase one. Couple weeks to a month was the timeframe given. Settle down.
---
Because it's a stress test? But sure, maybe they're not read for one of that size yet.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Not be on the same layer as who, though? Your friend? Only if he joined at a different enough time as you to get put onto a new layer. And then only if you haven't been grouping with them before and got shifted to their layer. And then if you haven't done all that, you'd still have to do a stupid little test of meeting somewhere to see if you're actually on different layers. All of that to *maybe* at some point avoid getting ganked in STV. It's not a realistic concern.
---
because world pvp and resource exploitation happens due to layering. Getting ganked? get a guildie to throw you an invite you essentially shard you to a new layer.
---
Want to grab all the black lotuses? coordinate with guildiess to phase to new layers and grab them all.
---
Wow, this was a really good story, you should tell it again!
---
If Alliance has control of STV on one layer then people will hop layers for a more favorable one.
---
So they can or they can't ?
---
Link the source then.
---
&gt;you used to meet the same people in different zones because you leveled at same speed
---
This will still happen, and layering will only slightly diminish it. As long as you're both online, you will definitely see each other as you travel to different zones. There is of course the likelihood of you guys later being in different layers, but unlike with sharding on live servers, it doesn't sound like there will be more than 2 or 3 layers per realm depending on population. And of course, if you level for a few hours with someone enough to become friendly, you can always add them in a snap. I'm not saying there won't be some cases of this system failing or being a negative influence, but those failings just seem to specific and relatively insignificant compared to what's being gained in stability.
---
&gt;Also I agree with the guy above that this layering/sharding whatever term is used should be limited to bottlenecks like starting zones only.
---
I could be convinced either way (there are certainly benefits to a layer being consistent throughout an entire continent), and I think part of the issue depends on what level the servers are actually being overwhelmed (per zone/per continent/per realm, etc.)
---
&gt;This entire thread has really shown me the maturity difference between 18 - 21 year olds and those of us in our late 20's. Its insane the difference responsibility can make to a person.
---
That's weird, doesn't seem to have done fuck all for you mate
---
And don't forget the posts that scream "upvote my screenshot of desolace because reasons"
---
I am OP.
---
It's all just speculation at this point.  No sense saying that the sky is falling until we have more information.
---
Not sure you got the meme mate, he's up front for the reason he's the biggest shill, he went from hating on classic to now promoting it all because he realises he can make a quick buck from it.
---
From my experience way back in 2004-2007, I died..... a lot to mobs, which is why I added the bottom saying "entirely my experience, others may have the opposite".  However now, I don't think I could die from a mob as a H Priest if I legitimately tried, the self healing from those BFA pieces would keep me alive lol.
---
Doesn't matter when it releases because I finished college and have stockpiled PTO. Glad I'll be able to enjoy a bunch of release time with adults lol
---
/r/2meirl4meirl
---
Give feedback. Thats literally all you can do. I generally don't trust Activision Blizzard either, but if you objectively look at the entire process of Classic WoW, they have been pretty open to feedback, and wanted to keep the spirit of Classic WoW alive. Could they be lying? Sure. But from a business standpoint it doesnt make sense to just do a 180 a month or two after Classic releases, because they know it will cost them money.
---
My buddy's about to be a doctor, an hes super bummed hes not gonna get to spend his last free summer dickin around on classic again.
---
This sounds like such a bad idea.  Not only for you if you get banned, but the server you are on for ruining the economy.  It sucks if it works, and sucks if it doesn't.  Why try to ruin what so many people have looked forward to for so long.  Instead try to take advantage of layering or come up with a Mafia or something, lots of gold and the server is improved.
---
The last two WoW expansion were released mid-late august. Is anyone legitimately surprised by Aug 27th?
---
Playing classic servers this whole time? You mean private servers that are not even blizzlike and have a shit load of bugs themselves? Also, how the FUCK is Blizz supposed to know who has played these illegal private servers? Lmao you are ridiculous.
---
So, can't you just accept being behind and take your time to stop and smell the peacebloom on the way to 60? Like, I get wishing you could get out ahead of the curve, but now that you can't, you might find the second alternative has plenty of merit, too. Leveling was fun back in the day, band together and fuck with some Alliance scum that are leveling while you are. If you *are* alliance, then I don't care if you have fun or not lol.
---
I actually work for a vacation rental company, so talking about vacation destinations is always a t hing when people take time off. Still trying to figure out what story I'm giving for this one.
---
I definitely have the feeling the market over-evaluates programming and the level required for some tasks, but IMO that just results in a possible waste of more advanced skills, especially for master's degree graduates who would be more specialized. All CS friends I know had to sort jobs to find something satisfying to do, to avoid monkey-coding.
---
I am not sure it can be blamed on universities. It will get better over time when people get a better grasp of what task requires advanced stuff and what task is really easy. 
---
But in the mean time educational institutions should always keep trying to go beyond the basics, even if the job market does not really understand yet and put everything in the same basket. Whether they do probably depends a lot on the specific university and country though.
---
Let's assume it's not a big deal.  Let's assume it's a small deal (and I'm not saying it is, but let's assume it is).  Now, anything which is a "minor inconvenience" can be fixed by changing the game.  A lot of those things that were a minor inconvenience to you, were an integral part of the game to someone else.  Further, a lot of those things that mildly annoy you, are what creates the texture of the game and the memories we have of it.
---
So, *maybe* this one change isn't so bad.  And maybe this one change won't affect the game, because \[we're under the assumption that\] it's a small change.  But when something else happens and people say "well, we fixed the problem on launch day by layering, maybe we can do something similar to fix this issue", and the game will start to lose its character.
---
I do not disagree, but i would happily just run it on alts that dont have naxx gear. I would also be happy if at Naxx remained something you did not get to do without a lot of dedication, and a khara with similar (but perhaps slightly weaker gear) would be okey in that case.
---
I remember the peace that occurred on PVP servers. I played on an RP-PVP server and normally if it's red, it's dead is how the two factions roll. It was very cool to see an informal truce those first few days of launch. No one was really fighting each other during that time because we all wanted to quest and see the content. 
---
The first dude with a flying mount though was dive bombing everyone in PvP.

A full server isn't a downed server because of technical problems. Let's pay attention to the conversation, eh?
---
SHHHHHHH. Drink Pepsi
---
There is nothing someone on reddit can do though - blizzard wants to cater to the world and be able to say "LOG IN AND PLAY NOW, OLD PLAYER OR NEW"
---
It's frustrating but as long as they eventually turn it off (ideally no longer than a month) then classic will be fine.
---
I figured it wouldn't be out til September so I'm kinda happy. Sucks with college, but I'm sure I'll find time.
---
I just think it made Outland absurdly small, especially after aquiring the epic  version.
---
Went back to school in my twenties. Finishing it up now in my early thirties. Working at the same time as well so I don't get a whole lot of free time September through May. I'm not mad about the release date, but it does suck.
---
People not understanding what summer is and loving to whine isn’t Blizzard’s fault. I know it’s popular to hate Blizz here but a lot of this sub needs to relax.

At Blizzcon they told us we'd have sharding "for the initial launch" and only in the starting zones. Now it's game-wide and for a whole month before phase 2.
---
WOTLK was a truly shit X-pac. I have no idea how people package it with the previous two. People who think classic was unbalanced don't know shit. Played a ret pally for the first half that Expac and, I could level and combination of 5 players from other classes. Unless they were an Arcane mage or Death Knight.

I can promise you that changing layers is not going to be as hard as people assume. All it takes is a group invite haha. It will not be that hard to get a group invite from someone on a different layer.
---
I wonder if they just mean new raids or other stuff like class balancing. New raids that the usual specs don't get invited to would be disappointing.

"Get ready for a classic summer", implies early or at the latest mid summer.
---
Hurr hurr its technically summer.
---
Yea just like a wreck is technically still a car.
---
I would like to comment on this post, but first I have to make sure:  do you know what sarcasm is?
---
1.12 patch for balance and most game systems. Raid/PvP content will be released in 6 phases. UI elements and some very minor game systems will be ported from retail(display options), UI/LUA, etc.
---
To quote a raid boss - "You... will... die"
---
a lot
---
Go till 9/9 like I just did 😎 see ya at 60
---
Wrong - these things were known. I never saw a prot pally tank at end game and never saw ret in a 5 man (no cc). People even got picky with talents. No imp sap? Sorry we need someone that can reliably cc.
---
I'm already subbed so I don't feel guilty about playing Classic servers.
---
Shit, it'll probably be 8/27/20 at best by the time I hit 60, i just wanna do it again.
---
No, of course not. I've never heard of such a thing.
---
&gt; **They also said tops 1 month, stop with the outrage culture.**
---
Correct your fucking post if you know it’s wrong, jackass.
---
Shhhhh don’t tell them
---
I don't know where max stats end up in Vanilla, but I believe if you tried to naively add a full content tier to TBC without fucking with the maths, everyone would be overcapped on every stat that can hit a cap.
---
Are you having a stroke? Should I call someone?
---
This is why 2019 is such a satisfying year. We are finally getting everything we have longed for!
---
Prove it! What is "runs with short shorts" in Spanish?
---
Go spread your negativity on the private servers please
---
Why are you to decide that for me? No issues with queues you get back from work log in let the queue run down whilst you have a bath or get some dinner which you were going to do anyway. 
---
Now we will have little to no community in classic wow due to several months of "phase1" possibly longer. You will never see the same people twice, You will never meet and befriend people on your server, you will have no PvP rivals other than the basic moron function of red is deadlolololololo
---
I want to play with other people around me.
---
Why do people think there will be server ques in 2019?? This is not 2004 anymore. LH the most recent popular PSer had 14k people on the day it opened and had ZERO que time and no lag. If a private server staying up off donations can do it I'm sure blizzard money will have no issue.
---
Options to narrow. Taking a week off. Going to no life it for 7 days strait then play both Classic and my 9-5 Job game...
---
The problem with power creep is it trivializes prior content. It's just more noticeable in vanilla because so few people will obtain those gear levels, so the ones that do are really noticable.
---
If item level keeps increasing, it will be nearly impossible for someone just starting out in the game to catch up. No one wants to do 3 years of gearing just to be competitive with the old timers. You also need to get 39 other like minded people to do it as well. This is why ZG was released the way it was, only 20 players and it was a great catch up raid.
---
Overall for the longevity of the game the power creep has to be contained.
---
well that would mean, that we end up with megaservers that aren't vanilla-like whatsoever. without any of the shorter respawntimes present on privateservers that are meant to accomodate the larger pop size... seems like a really bad system...
---
There is a chance they will choose new subs, but there is no incentive for Blizzard to choose more than the absolute minimum number of these types of accounts. This just allows them to cash in on people resubbing with the hope that they will get into the beta. When in actuality, this will make make up some extremely small percentage of population invited. Nothing illegal about it.
---
Remember when they mentioned sharding months ago, and Reddit lost its mind for a couple weeks? Eventually, it settled down. I think the same thing will happen here. I dont think you can objectively look at phasing and say it's worse than sharding. Just take a chill pill, and relax. If you really don't like it, provide feedback on the forums.
---
We've had first wait, but what about second wait?
---
The problem is that if all thats needed for the playerbase to drop their vigilance is a free blueposts that shows a degree of touch and intelligence, then make no mistake - they will abuse that. Precisely to make money. Not a little bit of money, not a reasonable profit, but more and more year after year. It must never go down, only ever increase, and you can bet they'll do anything to keep it going that way.
---
Wasnt my intention to "assume" we're the only ones. Surely you didn't honestly think it was. I'm fully aware we aren't. Doesn't mean our opinions don't matter though. I feel for anyone who can't take off for something they're passionate about. I hope you get your grind in too.
---
In fairness, you're assuming everyone goes to college 18-21. In my anecdotal experience, you'd be surprised how many people far older are there. The majority is certainly in the above age group, but a significant portion are mid-late twenties and far older.
---
I would love to see drops that potentially change a classes play style.

WPvP isn't actual pvp. I don't know why you retards like to pretend WPvP is this outside Gentleman's duel, when it isn't. What WPvP actually was people killing other players when they had an advantage. You almost never saw a fair fight in WPvP, which is why it was dogshit and people stopped doing it to get honor when BGs came out.
---
Flying didn't "ruin" WPvP, and there was plenty of it in TBC too.
---
Still ditching school for 2 weeks and goign full poopsock
---
Oh.  Well then I should probably explain.  You see, sarcasm is...hey!  Wait a minute!
---
I am just going off of sharding. You can change layers exactly like how you can change shards. All it takes is an invite from someone not in your layer. It is naive to think that this will not be abused.
---
It will be only in starting zones for couple of weeks. Guys, it will be only in phase one. Guys it will be only ....
---
I bet they will shard AQ event.
---
Why are people buying this?
---
Completely ignoring the fact that the layering system will be used until phase 1 ends at the latest. That's 6 months at best - more probably even earlier, since phase 2 "only" brings kazzak, azuregos, dire maul and the pvp system.
---
Lol no it doesn't. It just gives the guy who's going to get ganked a chance to run, and gankers don't like that.
---
But I’m a strong proud night elf. I just don’t trust gnomes. They peep at the moonwells
---
i remember some of the TOP pvpers on my server in vanilla... but i played with them or vs them like 10 times so far because the long Q i ended up doing something else and i knew that the only way to get a high rank in pvp is to join the only hardcore pvp group in the server wich was imposible :(
---
There's no way you actually believe that is there?
---
Well it was impossible with the BiS gear at the time.
---
He's saying it might be possible if they had Naxx gear.

Those aren't contradictory, although it does sound like it.

personally, I've spent time in most every blizzard beta since like tbc, and I enjoy being able to contribute (hopefully) to a better launch product because let me tell you, the betas are always fuuuull of problems, big and small.

---
Lol whats the difference? Becasue they are literally the same thing.
---
&gt; Also in the tips interview they say at best it would be for 1 month
---
This isn't even actually in the video, wowhead just misquoted this and it keeps being passed around.
---
If this feature was actually the way that wowhead article claims it is, there wouldn't be a problem. But unfortunately they just kind of wrote down what they wanted it to be and not what the devs actually said it would be.
---
&gt; Except it's not. June 21 (summer solstice) is the longest day of the year. It's not baseless and arbitrary. Putting the first day of summer on that day is a perfectly logical thing to do.
---
How is that less arbitrary? Considering that summer is supposed to be the brightest and warmest month, I find it much more logical to have the summer solstice during the summer.
---
I know wikipedia isn't the best source, but for what it's worth I can vouch for this being in line with my experience here in Northern Europe:
---
["Traditionally, in many temperate regions \(especially Europe\), the summer solstice is seen as the middle of summer and referred to as 'midsummer'."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_solstice)
---
&gt; Canadian here, that's incorrect. Everyone knows here that summer starts in June and ends in September. It doesn't hurt that our Junes and Septembers are fairly similar temperature-wise.
---
June is on average slightly warmer than September across most of the US and continental Europe. I've also never met anyone here in Europe that doesn't either use June-August as a basic definition, aside from just saying it's summer once it's warm enough. 
---
&gt; I can't believe how mad some people are about this. This is a really fucking stupid hill to die on.
---
I can only speak for myself, but I personally think it's a bit of a shame that the launch is just when University starts. I assume some people may also have problems with booking vacation that late, idk. It's still summer by all definitions though, so I can't really complain. I mostly just find the difference in definition interesting.
---
This is a total reset or a new game right? I stopped playing wow at WOTLK. This is probably a stupid question but everyone starts at lvl 1? The same grind as it was back then? If so I might consider buying a pc just for this I loved the 40 man raids back then. The thrill of downing ragnaros the first time. Do you guys think u need a good pc build for WoW classic?
---
If that's the case then it will simply be a pinned notice in discord of layer status. That notice will probably only need to be updated once a day after the low point in activity. Worst case scenario is a layer hop is requested and fails to move the player. Then the status can be updated in discord.
---
One way blizzard could prevent this abuse is if the layer hop requires BOTH grouping and proximity.  If that's the case it will be limited to zone chat. Then, get ready for layer hop spam from anyone and everyone in a zone. You'll wish for Thunderfury and Chuck norris jokes from all the layer hopping spam requests you're going to see.
---
wait... didn't Blizzard use to give out free game time cos the servers were always down at launch?
---
Dude is just preping for Classic WoW with Classic Vanilla trash-talking. No better insult than a necro'd QQ.
---
Would be amazing to see people with today level mega nerd minmaxing beat pre-nerf C'Thun.
---
I mean world buffs and everything.
---
OP's trying to show that him and his guild will try to abuse layering/sharding so they can get more Elemental Earth (expensive potion material), Elemental Fire (another expensive potion material), devilsaur leather (expensive material used for creating pre-best in slot raid gear), purple lotus (immensely expensive flask reagent) and tidal charms (trinket which drops off of a rare mob which can only be killed like a couple times every week. Almost like Time-Lost Proto Drake)
---
[Did anyone notice this blue comment?](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/world-of-warcraft-15th-anniversary-collector-s-edition/172027/18)
---
They may have misspoke but that seems to say we can get pets from live in classic wow, going completely against what they said earlier about being separate games
---
This coment here!! Totally Understand!!
---
By testing it mathematically? which was already done.
---
&gt; Their target audience is classic veterans who played back in the day, so they aren't still in school
---
Some of us WORK for schools now :( FML.
---
They would be vanilla-like. It's not like Blizzard is letting 20k people in per server.
---
Here's a wild assumption I'm making: The dev team has stats on hand and knows how much attrition they can reasonably expect, how much server load will occur, and how regularly they'll need to curtail new accounts per server to accommodate a proper Vanilla experience. The community as a whole is being overly hyperbolic about a technology they've only heard in summary, hours after it has been mentioned.
---
Layering is there to facilitate a goal of avoiding queue times. That's it. That's the reason they put it in, because that's the reason they gave for putting it in. It's better than sharding for immersion reasons alone, and I'd rather have slightly overpopulated servers compared to underpopulated ones anyway.
---
We are, Unfortunatly the launch date is also top news in r/wow so we have all the retail players here who love the idea of keeping the game a solo instance and their voices are louder than ours.
---
This is just sharding with more steps. 
---
I really really want to be excited but almost every update is just more disapointment for me. I think ill still play when it launches but honestly not sure how long for. Maybe ill wait till the last phase.
---
“Eat wood, fire elemental!”
---
Rip I just signed up today I wonder if I’ll have any chance at getting in.
---
As I understand it, you’re only layered with the people from your server. It’ll all be the same crowd, you just won’t see all of it at any given time.
---
So you are saying that they are aiming for people to gamble $15 on a beta invite chance?
---
75% is pretty generous, I bet people wont know who 85% is until end game, which will 100% be merged, I dont see the issue. Do people really want to do day 1 with 1000s of people in the starting area? A good chunk of the quests have to respawn to be collected and it absolutely sucks when you're fighting over quests items for an hour. I really dont see the issue with it,  but I am also playing with 4 people when it drops so I wont be interacting with many other people outside my group until later in the game regardless.
---
Adhere to the subreddit culture, or don't use the subreddit.
---
You're still getting this. Layering does _not_ mean to fix overcrowding. It's meant to fix server queues.
---
that is from original WoW Vanilla Collectors edition, you have to have the very first collection edition activated-bounded to your account so they will restore the rewards for you in Classic. And yes, same rewards as you COULD have had in preTBC ingame. Strictly nothing after vanilla, nochanges.
---
This would be cool but this would also get too far from Vanilla for purists - I'd argue if you're talking new content and new gear that will fundamentally change class balance, just lean into that and make WoW Vanilla: Remastered and Improved
---
It's no different than if the SS vs TM battle was happening on a different server.  The difference is that if the battle was on a different server you would have zero chance of joining it.  With layering, you just need to find your way onto that layer somehow.  Each layer will be the same size as a normal server so you still have the same chance of it happening on your layer.
---
I have a playlist of all wow albums ;-)
---
Lol I know an alliance guild or two rolling horde! Imbalance will be worse this go round.
---
Not super serious issues beyond queues back in the day, but each vanilla server was around 2.5 to 3k maximum population (high pop), these servers will be double that. 
---
Sharing is annoying yes, but I believe that not sharing will do more harm than good to the "new" classic player. He wont be level 40 in a few weeks, so he will experience more than half the game leveling wise in an unlayered server. Ian said it would he a few weeks at most before they squish the server, long before most people get to end game. 
---
I believe a little layering will help encourage John doe the new wow classic player. Instead of being in northshire for 30 hours. If that's the case, John will simply go play another game. It's a way to grow the community past the old veterens. 
---
It's just a few weeks, it well help John stick with it. He wont be 55-60 in 3 weeks like me.
---
There's not that much to know, you do quests, you run dungeons, you get loot and you level.  If you play retail you won't have a hard time with the gameplay.  Other than everything generally taking longer.
---
The vocal minority of idiots are ok with queues and spending 50% of your time sitting and waiting for mobs to spawn. Why would Blizz cater to you dumbasses when 99% of players want an actual pleasant experience. Also, it's fucking temporary.
---
Your interaction is extremely unlikely to happen. Tanaris isn't the only lvl40 questing zone.
---
Prices aren't going to change because everyone will be broke in Phase 1. You're also assuming every server will have multiple layers when only 1 is made for every 3000 people. I can guarantee not every server is going to have 9000+ players. Retail has worse sharding and the prices for herbs have been around the same since BfA launched. You thinking the AH is going to be flooded with 1000 black lotus or 20,000 thorium ore in a month is silly.
---
ORAH ORAH DIE FRANKFURTER SIND DA
---
Just because you never saw it, doesn't mean it never happened.  A paladin more than likely would never be a MT, but they could definitely OT if needed.  Also, I can recall plenty of ret paladins in 5-mans.
---
I have no doubt that all the cases you stated occured, but unless the party was trying to do something specific, as long as they had a tank and healer, the dps really didn't matter, as long as they were somewhat competent.  You may have had the luxury to be picky, but for the rest of us, after waiting an hour or so to fill up a group, you eventually settled with whatever you could get your hands on and made due.
---
People that only halfway understand what it is are taking it to the nth degree of worst case scenario and acting like that will be the way things work. Here's what's gonna happen with layering. Launch will come, layering will occur, 75% of the people playing won't even know it exists or is happening and will just play. A month or whatever down the line they will announce that they are getting rid of layering and merging. 75% of the people won't notice anything happened and will keep playing. Of the remaining 25%, 1% will attempt to exploit or have someone they are ganking phase out after a group invite and they will make a bunch of forum posts about how shitty it is.
---
Or if you're the first person in a layer. Will you be alone while waiting for 3000 new players to log in and play with you? Sucks to be him I guess.
---
The original CE pets are vanilla pets though, and not attainable in any other way. It makes sense for them to be ported over to classic.
---
I agree. People are reading into these things way too much. Be ready to play the game come August; all the complainers here today will be!
---
AOE farming, Rare mob farming, Node farming. Layering will be exploited and will significantly affect the economy of the game
---
But don’t you think that (many) people also need an incentive to keep the game going? Personally, if I’ve seen everything and there is no goal left for me to reach, I’m done. And I don’t think I’m the only one who thinks like that. So for the longevity of the game, future content also needs gear that people want.
---
Whether or not the gear needs to be straight up stronger or not is up for discussion, but it probably needs to be. Otherwise, not enough people would actually want it (unless it looks amazing).
---
So why is everyone ok with Blizzard potentially adding new content, and in a sense changing the vanilla experience now?  
---
Just like 2 weeks ago, I was getting downvoted for mentioning the same thing. Even the the whole going back in time/parallel world gimmick :(  
---
Mentioned that it'd be cool if Blizzard acknowledge that Classic WoW is a fork/off-shoot/parallel timeline of Modern WoW through unique quests around the world (Easter Eggs) that implies this.
---
You are assuming it will be hard to change servers. I just think a lot of people would rather ask for an invite to another layer, then get ganked or camped for even ten minutes. No one ever said the sky is falling. I will still be enjoying classic man
---
Why are people so upset about this? You need a subscription to play the bloody game anyway. You're going to have one come August 27th if you intend to play the game. You're going to continue needing one to continue playing the game. What's wrong with starting your paying cycle 2 weeks earlier for an extra half a feature? ++ it's only 3 names per account, so not every name is going to be taken anyway. The odds of your dream name being taken (unless it's something like Bob with no accents) is incredibly low. This has gotta be the stupidest thing to call "MONEY-GRABBING!!!!" over. Blizz does much scummier shit, but getting sad over something this minimal when we finally have a release date is just fuckin dumb. Let yourself enjoy it.
---
Since when are the lil kiddos stuck in school the target audience for the re-release of a game that came out when you were in diapers?
---
I did both private servers and retail WoW. Lots of people do.
---
That's good to hear
---
You'll fall behind regardless of how much you know, because there will be people who inevitably dedicate their lives to getting ahead. That's just what happens in games.
---
Level at your own pace, enjoy the experience for what it is, and when you get to endgame, find a guild with other casuals and newbies. There will be a lot of them.
---
Also, there are, like, fifty different YouTube channels dedicated just to teaching people about Vanilla WoW mechanics. So go do some basic querying on YT. Frostadamus is probably my major recommendation, but there are many more.
---
Don't worry about people on Reddit so much. The community of Classic will be the community among the players on the server you end up rolling on, not what you see here.
---
Not sure why the mods aren't enforcing rules 2 and 3 here in regards to streamers. Some criticism is valid, but here it often seems to be turning onto personal attacks, but oh well.
---
There was never going to be 12,000.
---
My only issue is that the dynamic nature of the layers seems like it can be abused or exploited. Imagine a mage aoe grinding, he could figure out a way to swap layers and never run out of packs, or avoid competition.
---
First of all, trust me, 6k gold melts like butter during raiding, especially if you want to raid on two characters and do well for yourself dmg-wise (with consumables and whatnot). Second, at least on the private servers mage/hunter can do upwards 100g/hour farming DM. And also, people enjoy leveling characters when the other one is geared and might as well crate a character that makes good gold
---
I mean, people did it 15 years ago just fine.
---
Great. Looking forward to you documenting that fact.
---
Let me know!
---
Caps can probably be increased rather easily, so I don’t see a problem here.
---
I'm dying over here! xD
---
IMO, research nothing. Play it blindly like we did back in 2004. It was a blast. I wish I could forget it all and be fresh like you.
---
Herbs like black lotus are a different story
---
Yeah, it sucked, just like the rest of the things that “sucked” in Vanilla that they “improved” in later expansions and ended up with retail WoW. They also didn’t intend for the debuff limit to be at 16, they stated that it was a limitation of their hardware, not a game mechanic, but they still intend on including that in the game to make it authentic.
---
It's phase 2 that is gonna be the most active in terms of wPvP. Phase 1 is mostly gonna be leveling and getting pre-raid / MC gear. And no, people who rush for 60 in 4 days/played and get full "pre-bis" gear in 2 weeks don't count as a significant portion of the players that we are talking about.
---
People will be farming level 48+ zones for free points all days in phase 2 because of PvP rewards and no BGs, and a larger population will be wanting to do that at that point. And as we know there won't be layers at that point anymore.
---
You will still see "your" people and you will build friendships.
---
Actually, you will still see *the same 2000-3000 people*, so basically the realm cap for Classic. So you will see your server all the time. Only when it goes over the pop cap, it will go to another layer.
---
It's actually great.
---
&gt; watching/listening to the announcement
---
Watching THE announcement? Or a streamers announcement? I didn't see an official Blizz announcement.
---
That will be great, bunch of retail players giving feedback for a game they never played. of course there will be players capable of giving a quality feedback, but i dont like the way blizzard is handling this.
---
I think that if you have the CE, or the blizzcon codes, you should be able to redeem the items again.  I see no harm in doing so, as they were just as much a badge of honor as wearing cool raid gear.
---
"Hey invite me real quick"
---
*players around you disappear*
---
"Yep, you're on a different layer"
---
U N R E A L I S T I C
---
No deal. Guess I'm waiting
---
Yeah...
---
But do you talk about it with a tone that could be implied that you where on the Bears team when talking about the 1985 NFL season?
---
So it’s 99.99, you get a $25 credit in blizz balance and a month of game time, so $65 for a rag statue and in-game mount? And does it get charged now or at ship?
---
Azshara is the WORST!
---
Anyone who's banking on loan money for their $15 a month sub fee shouldn't be playing wow...
---
They never said that. They said for the "first few weeks after launch".
---
&gt;They've done this in the past 
---
When?
---
When you are done with this, Shadowbringers and Ff14 will be waiting.
---
GDKP means you have no chance against someone with more gold than you. Not sure how that's the same.
---
Well realistically it was always the more realistic way to see it to begin with. Some people denial started a circlejerk tho and naturally, as its sooner and hence more pleasant, more people jumped on that bandwagon.
---
Do you need an active sub to get into the beta?
---
I just cancelled my preorder.. not only is nothing you get available in Classic, but the "special" CE mounts will be available as a store shop purchase, you don't even need the CE to get them.
---
Would have cost me 200 dollars Canadian for basically a statue and 30 days game time, not worth it imo.
---
Yes, I would have no issue spending a few hours in queue only to get in the game and find all the mobs camped becasue ill just treat it like the game should be treated and start talking to people, Hell maybe we level 1 raid org who knows worlds our oyster. What im not ok with is logging in instantly to find 4 other people per zone with me and that being the case for several months. Sure ill get to fight the mobs but is it even worth it when the game would be a solo experience?
---
A lot of zones in Azeroth that were sparse during Vanilla that they could build up or even use stuff like Caverns of Time to add cool raids
---
Starting zones with 5k players and standing in line for quest mobs wasn't what made WoW special, and definitely not vanilla. The population needs to be dispersed somehow so the game is actually somewhat playable - and the first couple of weeks are the most critical.
---
I love all these crackpot theories on how layering is going to work.
---
If you care that much, just go play on a private server now so you can catch up over the summer before release.
---
I play on high population servers, so there will be more then one layer. Finding someone on a diff layer will not be that hard when the chats are connected.
---
It has upsides and downsides, I'm not sure where I stand on the issue until more information is available. I like the general idea, because it's a good way to counter dead servers and handle the huge wave of people checking the game out on launch. If half of the population of your server leaves after phase 1, you're still on a decently sized server thanks to the merge of the layers. The only thing I massively dislike is the amount of abusability of this system, and we'll have to see what they are going to do to combat that. I'm afraid it's going to hyperinflate the economy, but we'll see.
---
Thx it was disturbing to me lol
---
Except shards are restricted to single zones and work across all servers. Layers are for the entire world (or continent) and have a population the size of *an entire vanilla wow server*, and limited to 3 or so per server. That means that unless your server is at the absolute maximum population it can be at, there likely are only 1 or 2 layers going on anyway and most of the people you try to get invites from are gonna be on your layer anyway.
---
“Actually boss, I’m taking a vacation from my family”
---
Completely agree, I said this months ago and got told that this would never happen. Blizzard cannot be trusted.
---
Do you even know what layering is?
---
Lol people are so annoying on here..yes it's the original game before any expansions came out. They weren't referred to as dlc but as expansions. They were more than dlcs because they were changing core gameplay mechanics over time with each release. Welcome to wow, im jealous you get to experience it for the first time!
---
Ret is good at pvp (I thought). One thing about pally is constantly buffing your raid. Only 5 min buffs.
---
But what happens to the servers that end up super highly populated? Surely this plan is banking on a steep drop off of players, what if the largest servers still have a much larger population than they want on one server? Queue times then? Just do that from the start then and don’t make your plans around essentially failing. Considering most of your initial playerbase to be “tourists” is absolutely stupid, even if it turns out to be true...maybe it will only be true because you’re treating the game with that expectation.
---
I don't want to add everyone I meet. Sometimes a "I know that fucker over there from that quest we did together yesterday" is a better feeling than becoming close with the 100s of people I do that with. We were promised it would be starting zones and now we are losing that.
---
["You don't want that. You think you do, but you don't"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Wrw3c2NjeE)
---
What they said about being separate games is that there will never be crossover rewards, that is you can't farm gear in Classic to have transmogs on retail, or do content on Classic that's been removed on retail to get the relative achievements.
---
They never said you wouldn't be able to have your *original vanilla* stuff you got by CE or TCG.
---
I've done my share of DKP PUG raids and it's not the worst system but this is better IMO.
---
Yeah I feel like the layers will be my zone and your level, cutting off the lowbies and the highest speed levelers. Prob not the worst thing?
---
Won’t matter in the grand scheme of things. If a guild puts forth that kind of effort in the first few months... good for them. Would take Method level neckbeards to really be game breaking.
---
I wonder if the oozling pet ~exploit is going to be in
---
Becasue I like the idea of having a server community, I wont get to quest for the first few days? Oh well lets go do some fun stuff. 100 other level 1's that cant quest lets head to org or low level horde zones and swarm them you know community fun. What I wont enjoy is logging in and questing solo in an entirely empty world, A world that will stay empty for lord knows how long.
---
I didn't like it when  it was starting zones only but accepted it but now that it could be anywhere from 1 week to 6 or 7 months I am not pleased at all.
---
It funny.  Almost everyone here was ready to accept sharding (as it is on retail) in classic, and then blizzard comes up with something that actually fixes most of the problems with sharding, and all the complainers come right back out!
---
We are getting vanilla, or as close to is as possible, and people are mad because it's Dryer's brand instead of Ben&amp;Jerry's.  Incredible.
---
Inagine if you could play wow on Earth
---
Thanks !
---
Nonsense. It's all but a requirement to be able to play in the starting zones.
---
Here's why it isn't.
---
*Because it isn't.* The two mechanics don't work remotely the same way, and one is temporary, while the other is an integral part of retail.
---
How else did you expect them to handle it, but to try to disseminate the information through trusted content creators? They did that—probably the most comfortable and broadly acceptable method of disseminating information they could possibly have—and in less than a half a day the community has gone *completely fucking apeshit insane* about it, screaming that it will destroy all PvP, ruin endgame grinds, create multi-layering guild cartels, etc. Some have even claimed that layering is just sharding repackaged, being sold to us in a conspiratorial plot.
---
Yeah, lets celebrate that kids won't have the amazing experience that shaped our lives when we were kids. It's not like a 10-year old is gonna be your raid leader or anything, what are you afraid of?
---
Pandora has a World of Warcraft Radio station. Lost of wow music with some Skyrim, Morrowind, LotR and various gaming music.
---
Harder, daddy
---
Well they still have their original roadmap, so going the OSRS route does not seem impossible. Even though I raided on WoW private servers in the past, I was never interested in the FRESH hype and I would lose interest pretty fast if Blizzard were to start doing the same thing.
---
Got time off!
---
My concern is that it could make people with that new gear too op.
---
Definitely going to enjoy rolling the dice to get on a low pop overflow layer once the main ones are full.
---
pre-gambino.
---
Yes! This. It's great.
---
Are they making a remake of the original wow or what is happening?
---
Thanks beforehand
---
Hey after watching some interviews with devs about what layering is I changed my mind, the advantages greatly outweigh the drawbacks, you have a good point.
---
I am fucking stoked about classic couldn't get better devs honestly, so thankful for how passionate they are.
---
Blizzard reps have said in an interview that even with layering there will be queues predicted at server launch.
---
Its only at the launch, imo its not that deep.
---
You should watch some Drakedog 4 to get super extra hyped! [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1wVvAy4es&amp;list=PLI\_Q5\_iJQskPqxeUbQSJ9PhK5hOYKEBBi&amp;index=4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1wVvAy4es&amp;list=PLI_Q5_iJQskPqxeUbQSJ9PhK5hOYKEBBi&amp;index=4)
---
There literally is confirmation on that... We have a Ion quoted as saying layering will be restricted to phase 1 GUARANTEED, it may end earlier than start of phase 2,but it will not be there for phases 2-6
---
Phase one isn't lasting a month so layering for multiple months!!! Woohooo!!!! Might as well be on different servers!
---
lfm ubrs need key
---
modern doesn't equal better. 99.9% of classic fans would be hyped for another modern mmo which follows classic's philosophy.
---
It was IN classic I don't see how it can be a non classic experience.
---
And Im assuming you were never in a guild that was in current content.
---
You were gearing out in t2 when Nax has been out for 6months.
---
welp, booking 8 days of leave now. that'll give me 12 days of neckbearding.
---
I agree with you completely, but unfortunately the hivemind has spoken, and we should accept layering even though Ion said he knew how much server communities meant to the players in Vanilla.
---
This is laughable and ridiculous. Thanks for the entertainment! 
---
Layering is temporary. Calm your wiggles you goofball.
---
That's what I mean. World first would be pointless. Everyone should start TBC at level 1 and it's to easy and broken to be able to swap an almost maxed character to TBC and start raiding with it next week because you had made progress others might have not made on another version of the game. Should not be an option.
---
The OP was deleted and link is gone. I cant find the Blue comment, do you have a link ?

Edit: Found it

---
dude why didnt you buy it on the european shop? only 10€shipping there
---
options too narrow.  I will make my CharacterS, not Character and then look around a bit.  I  want to have good names for future alts, including bank alts that will stay level 1 all their lives.  I have a long list of names to chose from, so I don't mind if some are taken already, I will just  try various names until I am happy and run out of spots.
---
They're not sharding for just the starter zones, so idk what you're talking about
---
This is the best poop of my life
---
Perfect. Layers sound pretty good TBH
---
Fuck it bring the Lich King to classic eventually, it's the best raid fight i've ever done with C'thun being second. Would love to have a similar classic version of it.
---
Ahh, I see you’ve referenced a streamer, that’s all I needed to know.
---
Yup, don’t play it.
---
You already got this removed once
---
i'm confused about what is meant by "select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in." 
---
what is the "select criteria," and what do we have to do to meet it? (besides being actively subbed and opted in for both retail (and classic beta))
---
Yes, which is why I said organic pvp. When everyone is just starting and leveling is when pvp is most ‘natural’ . Phase two is when the camping 48s begin like you said which is why I felt layers was a bigger blow as we will not get the pure pvp of phase one ever again.
---
Well you can't exactly dodge, parry or crit more than 100% of the time (though that last one is more complicated, but it doesn't matter). I'm talking that kind of caps.
---
You don't get play with imaginary Friends....
---
I think one of the best parts of classic is the fresh slate, everyone has a chance to go back and try to be the cool raider you saw when you were a kid.  I guess it leaves a bad taste in my mouth, but I'll try to look on the bright side and if I get my Trading Card Items I'll use them.
---
&gt; How do you get your buddy on a different layer? 
---
If I have 50 friends on my friends list, at least one will be on another layer.  
---
&gt; How do you even know he's on a different layer to begin with other than physically trying to meet him in the world somewhere?  
---
He invites me to a group. If my surroundings all change, I've been ported to his layer. If my surroundings don't change, we were on the same layer all along so I need to try with someone else. Exactly like retail WoW.  
---
&gt; The setup required to "jump layers" via a friend inviting you to a group is not a realistic thing to worry about.  
---
Already happens on retail.  
---
&gt; I don't think you understand what layering is or how it works...  
---
How young are you again?
---
😂😂😂👍👍👍👍👍
---
Pls don’t contribute to using the word that starts with “I” and ends with “R”.
---
Then just wait in line or play a different game until the population evens out some. I don’t see why this has you so upset as if you’re losing out on something if they don’t do layering. One of the biggest points of Classic is community and interaction with the player base within your server. If you cannot do that organically, then the game turns into retail (which is fine, I like retail and play right now, but it’s DEFINITELY more of a single-player game than Vanilla was). If you are looking for efficient leveling, retail has you covered - there’s almost no waiting needed for a mob and no grouping needed to kill any of them either.
---
There will be multiple realms, with a few layers within that realm. So everything will still be bound to the same realm. Also it's timegated, they said for a month at max, so it wont likely have any major effect in the long run.
---
And you don't think that should be regulated as gambling? Of course you'll get the argument that people are subbing to play retail and the chance to play beta is simply an extra perk associated but we both know that that's bullshit.
---
Well I would assume the creation of another layer is not something that frequently occurs. I also dont know thats how it works but I assume something like that has to happen. You cant have a layer with 3k people and a layer with 50 people thats for sure
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
The thing that frustrates me is that if layers are as large as they say then they'll do little to solve the issue of starter zone bottlenecking (which was their original justification), yet they're still breaking up the game world.
---
To me it's like they're picking a worst of both worlds situation.
---
This is literally why they've introduced layering for the early weeks. That way you can play without worrying about queue times and lag and such.
---
It's always a tradeoff. Without new content, some will surely stay, as shown by some private servers. Some will surely go. With new content, some will probably go because it's "no longer vanilla". We don't really have hard data for the numbers
---
You have to think logically. A videogame development company is going to prefer current players to beta test a game they are developing. It is much safer. Remember, betas don't exist just to debut a game. They exist for mass testing and bug finding.
---
There was clarification on Wowhead earlier I just read. Layering is what they are using instead of sharding, essentially a less noticable version of sharding, and will only last 1-3 weeks after launch.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow
---
Save as much money as you can so you can take a good chunk of time off between contracts!
---
This reeks of ignorance of game development.
---
Except for a satisfying final season of Got... but I digress...
---
Don't worry about it. The negativity here doesn't represent the actual community in game. Never has. Almost all gaming subreddits are like this. It's going to be awesome and most people you meet is going to be nice.
---
Do we currently have any idea when these invites will start going out?
---
.......It's just sharding dude
---
It will ruin the economy at the start there are gonna be multiple times as many high level mats rolling around as there should be
---
If there are 3 layers that will mean 3x the black lotus spawning on your server and 3x the devilsaur, mining nodes, and herb nodes. 
---
What should be valuable resources will be worth nothing at the start of the server and depress their value longgg into the game. He who abused the layering system best will win out...
---
Not exactly how anyone should have wanted this to go down
---
False.
---
You're right I didn't play classic, I played Vanilla.
---
just for information sake Blizzard is currently going with the first option.
---
&gt; layering is only present during phase one
---
Until it's not.  I am calling it now, blizzard will institute sharding when the servers start to get overloaded af and then keep it in the game.  I appreciate them even doing a classic etc etc, but they have proven to fuck this up in the past I ***G U A R A N T E E*** they fuck it up again.
---
you do realize that 90% of the info today is from those who were at the Irvine meeting/interviewed devs.
---
More or less. Going in blindly would be fun but it’s not like we didn’t bank roll the thottbot and alakazam websites during vanilla either
---
Could be. I still wanna givem a week to make sure thats working well enough.
---
If that would be the case it would be a deal breaker for me and many others. The whole point we wanted this was for stability and not losing our characters
---
Yah fuck those kids
---
You’re acting like an idiot.
---
Pre-waiting or praiting
---
Gotta love people talking out of their ass
---
Some group will make an individual guild for each layer and /gquit and join as needed to transfer around even easier
---
Put in the request almost immediately after the announcement. Can't wait!
---
Sorry but your answer is absolutely bullshit. Wait in line or don't play? No way. Fuck that shit. If you developed your own game you would want as many people to play as possible as well. You're just talking from emotion. Be logical.
---
layering is only going to last a couple weeks at most. the things you're asking for are even worse than what they intend to do. holy shit..
---
iT dOeSnT nEeD bEtA iTs aN oLd GaMe
---
Your making an assumption that layering means very few people per layer but this doesn't need to be the case we could easily craziness
---
It's honestly smart. You basically create mini servers split up initially in a sense, but then once the hype goes down you end up in a way combing the mini ones into the regular one. Compared to games creating a shit ton of servers and having some be dead in a month
---
If I were going to take time off to play that's probably how I would do it.
---
Powerlevel to 60, rush to crater, win crater. 
---
Coast rest of the server.
---
I am tempted do this i wont even play BFA but dods anyone know of the invites are staggered all the way tiill release?
---
I personally play on high population servers, so there will most likely be multiple layers. From the post I have seen, most people are assuming there will be less servers overall and more layers so having multiple layers on even medium pop server might could happen.
---
Let them squeeze. If people want to slap money down for a *chance* at beta, let them.
---
Meanwhile, keep waiting like we have been. Blizzard wants money. People are gonna give it to them, and we are going to give them money when classic launches and we all sub again. Who cares if they are "squeezing" more cash. 
---
You would too if you could. Don't you deny it!!
---
Oh right, I wasn’t thinking of those. I only thought of agi, str, etc.
---
Sorry what’s the alternative again? 
---
12k queue lengths?
---
By all means please link me the blizzard post of blizzard saying we will have the whole summer to play Classic.
---
ive already given notice at work you fucking casual
---
They did say they were going to release in Summer.
---
Summer starts June 21 and ends September 23, they are pretty close to being in the middle of Summer.
---
This does worry me a little. And they did say they will turn off layering/sharding after Phase 1.
---
So my thought is, since I’ve heard the new servers Blizz uses have upwards of 8k pop limits, I’m guessing we’ll play with what feels like 2/3k people per server, and then at the start of phase 2, it may feel like a population boom, as upwards of 8k people may be playing at the same time, without layering.
---
This, I am not actually a fan of. But, if it means I don’t end up on a dead server, I’ll take overcrowded &gt; dead any day.
---
yeah its clear to see who and who didn't play back then in this sub.
---
&gt; Only 5 min buffs.
---
15 min at 50+
---
I just keep telling myself that if I do end up playing (super busy with work and family nowadays) at least all my time I do actually have to play will always be fully rested XP!
---
It's absolutely not ready for release. If you've actually watched any of the streamers who've been playing the Classic beta, they have said there are still multiple (albeit) small issues with how spells interact, items etc,. that they are not done with. They want these things to be perfect for release so that they're not constantly hotfixing and patching them out later.
---
On top of that, I'm sure there are still a lot of decisions yet to be made in regards to layering, server structure and so on. I don't see why you would just assume all that stuff is ready to go. How is this a cash grab? At most you are spending $30, once for the chance to get into the beta and again to reserve your character name. The beta is optional, the other one comes with a subscription which you would need to be playing at that time anyways.
---
don't worry millions people logging on at once during primetime in US will be just as bad
---
Isn't that part of the classic experience though?
---
Very interesting, thanks for the link!
---
Worries me how they acknowledge that pvp will take a hit from layering. Makes me wonder if they're underestimating how quickly the hardcore players level, and how seriously hardcore players will exploit mechanics like layering to give themselves a leg up. Hmmm, my mind is going to explode from the info drop today lol, just too many options and possibilities to consider. 
---
Poor devs, their job is to wade through those options daily, definitely makes me understand *why* they've chosen to go with layering.
---
If you respec to enhancement you have to up your 2h maces and 2h axes weaponskill from 1 to 300 every time !
---
And there are not that many staves that might be good for enhancement shaman.
---
I really want to play this but im not quite sure how you get it. Is it like regular WoW where you buy the game then the sub? or different?
---
I'm not sure why people would just constantly randomly be phasing out though. If it's shared across the continent, the case would be if people are just suddenly joining friends in a different layer (which could be unlikely, but still a niche case)
---
&gt; Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.
---
&gt; I know that fucker over there from that quest we did together yesterday
---
That will still happen, a lot. Moreover, whenever you see anyone, you know for a fact that you'll see them again assuming they're still playing.
---
&gt;We were promised it would be starting zones and now we are losing that.
---
This is such a strange mentality. The devs told us their plan at the time, and now they've come up with what they believe to be a better solution. That's all. You're not being "betrayed" by a team of sinister suits trying to ruin your nostalgia trip, you're seeing the compromise of incredibly devoted devs who want to create the best classic experience they can.
---
I’m taking off the Friday after launch and the 4 days after Labor Day holiday. Gives blizzard a few days to iron out any issues and I’m taking advantage of the US holiday. Mark it 10 days off for me
---
You are a child. If i was your parent, you wouldnt be playing at all.
---
Hey, man, you do what you want. I'm restarting my sub fee a month early for early character naming, personally. But if you want to start late and avoid the launch day crowds, that's totally fine.
---
I realize that I have not nor will I get any of my info from a pro gamer who makes a living teasing fanboys.
---
Been looking for phase-specific BiS lists. Thanks!
---
So whats to stop a playing from chain hoping between layers, creating alts to abuse layer swapping constantly, etc?  This is a terrible idea and even worse than sharding
---
Even tho I'm poor and should probably save instead of buying this, I'm sorry, but this is no longer a want, it's a need.
---
Man... so late.
---
You'd throw up at how many people throw their financial aid towards counter strike knives
---
&gt;Its only at the launch, imo its not that deep.
---
I'm not saying it's that deep, I did stress phase 1 after all. But, I also see this whole reddit being all "levelling IS the game" and phase 1 is levelling... soooo?? Also, I'm merely just blown away that just because we have a release date and a beta and stuff people are just accepting this solution even though it's worse than what they originally proposed. If this news broke out a month or two ago by itself it would've been a shit storm.
---
What is your solution to tourism? Some servers will end up desolate after the tourism crowd leaves.
---
PVP forever until I die, sweetheart &lt;3
---
Yeah, I found this out the hard way. Wish someone slapped the advice in my face when I was in college.
---
He has a video on it? 
---
It’s on YouTube, and I watched the video as he played it live on stream. It was at that moment I decided to give him a little latitude. 
---
Why is this a thing? Literally he didn’t explain it in this video, the actual devs did. So, not really even the gospel of tips.
---
He wrapped himself in a giant tortilla.
---
I think parts of it are greed, but for the most part I think the people working on it want to do what they can to make a fun game.  A Beta is for sure going to make the game better, I just wish there was a sticky post linking were they said the beta is going to be tiny so most people dont sub and get their hopes up.
---
how is it squeezing you of an extra 3 months of cash? just dont sub to the game, its as simple as that. theyre not forcing you to spend money on anything.
---
Hey you can play with that cool guy you met in 6-12 months when we leave phase 1 thats pretty gooooooddddd right?
---
What I think and what it is is irrelevant. They are doing this strictly for money.
---
Which is a good thing really.
---
Thank you! Saw this after digging in the inspector for the source.  Too bad reddit hosting has trashy quality! Keep up the good work.
---
Right? This is essentially them combining server merges, sharding, and server groups into one idea.
---
Make realistic server caps that their servers can hold, provide enough servers for players to be able to swap if the hyper populated server queue times are too high, merge servers or allow server transfers selectively as necessary down the road.
---
Yeah but why can’t they just leave the game alone. There aren’t going to be huge queue times. Maybe on the most popular servers that, full of streamer fan club, there will be a decent wait for a while. But there isn’t going to be just one server, and there won’t be massive queues for all of them. Private servers have done it with hordes of people and, little to no wait time. Blizzard can’t manage? Or they are catering towards their streamers?
---
new content would be great. Its worked very well for OSRS
---
I agree 75% is generous, you're not going to remember nearly that many people, and if you somehow do it's going to be a "have I seen that guy before?" type of thing so its no big deal.
---
That guys main issue is that it somehow takes away from the community aspect because you might not be able to see them in chat or leveling if you're on another layer...which is difficult to prove unless you flisted them or they normally play at a different time than you. 
---
IMO its better than the alternative, I've played on pservers for a really long time and having the starting areas fucking chalk full of people is not fun. People aren't even accounting for the increase in pop so since layering is said to have around 2-3k that would make it more vanilla like that not having layering lol.
---
I understand their plights but I think people are simply overreacting.
---
Watching my twitch streamers play the beta. And tje private servers appear to be way off...
---
All mobs resistances are off and 1 or 2 abilities are not even being used. Popular grind spots like thr fire rocs in tanaris are no longer a thing since they all cast a fire ball
---
Except shards and layering **ISNT THE SAME**
---
I honestly would like to be able to play on mobile but it would also drive me crazy having it in my pocket all the time while at work.
---
I like the idea of multiple same-name servers at launch with a shared name database, with the explicit intention of mergers later on.  
---
Solves all of the negatives that come with sharding/"layering", while preserving the Vanilla feel.
---
I personally think it should be a clean slate. I don't see any harm in being able to redeem your vanilla-era collectibles, I just think that with the idea of re-releasing, it makes more sense to clean slate than to make it feel like a continuance of 2006.
---
For everyone who is as tired of asmongold being recommended on google. There are working Firefox addons that let you block his channels. I’ve gone out of my way to look for something that works. This lazy reaction content is such bullshit.
---
ActiBlizzard realised that soft gambling is an easy way to make a tonne of money.
---
Yeah thats a legitimate worry, especially if you pick an extremely high pop server, as the higher the population, the more layers would be used. But picking a lower pop server runs the risk of its population collapsing a few months down the line. It is not a good choice to have to make.
---
It's amusing to me that this guy is calling strawman on both of us, while simultaneously strawmanning himself lol.
---
Then you would simply fail. I tried to tank as a pally while leveling (out of desperation since we couldn't find a warrior) - it sucked. A lot of specs were just poorly designed. You absolutely needed cc in 5 mans. 5 random peeps playing whatever? No mage/hunter or imp sap rogue? Not going to work in a lot of cases. And yea I played a hunter so I know the feeling of long waits to get groups. It sucked. But we expected to take a while to get stuff done and all it meant by taking sub-optimal setups was that it took even longer... before you eventually added what you needed or gave up.
---
Yeah I’m fine with what they said. Call me a casual
---
Thank youuuuuuuu
---
would you say its still summer if they released classic on september 20th? technically it still is I guess blizzard was right shouldve gotten ready for a classic summer
---
Yes. I wanted to write the same lol.
---
Who the fuck listens to CMs outside of a handful of people on the official forums?
---
I think layering could, if implemented poorly, potentially sometimes occasionally cause some of these issues at a fraction of the severity that people claim it will. It's a fair tradeoff for a smooth launch. Group PvP will still happen. Ganking will still happen. Fast guilds will still snatch up all available resources, and if anything, layering gives others a chance to steal some nodes on a currently "unused" layer (if a layer is in fact unused at any point in time).
---
And now I'm voicing my opinion that it's not a good change. People were happy with the original proposal. This is not a good idea this time around and it since they are very receptive with feedback I am giving them that.
---
Bought it the moment it was available on the store.
---
Well we did do the nose.
---
Not enough dev's to stress the servers and explore every possibility for bugs. Plus when you're a dev you do not have the mindset of the end user. You could build a bridge and people will find ways to misuse that bridge, blaming you for not considering how others might use it. Easier to get a nice sample of people who will prove, in close relation, how it will be when its live.
---
What types of things did they change (graphic or gameplay)?
---
It’s not in any way related to classic, so I don’t know why you would call it that
---
Maybe I am just a lowly schmuck who doesn't understand programming, but I mean, let's take a simple game like Terraria for example. 
---
Even though they release 2 patches worth of new weapons and armor, the old stuff was still useful--if not outright necessary--to get the new stuff. Yeah, some of it could be skipped over like Night's Edge and Molten Armor but you still needed good weapons and gear from old content to start doing content to get the newer stuff. 
---
So why not make new content /just/ hard enough that you still need to be geared via old content to beat new content? That's something I never understood--why do they always make level X1 greens better than level X0 legendaries?
---
(Él que) corre con pantalones cortísimos
---
Have a downboat :)
---
Some people like playing quality MMOs.
---
I agree, they seem a bit flippant about how much of an impact it can have. I do believe some form of sharding/layering _is_ necessary, but I disagree completely with their suggested timeline and part of their implementation.
---
It's like so close to being perfect. I hope they'll do some tweaking before release.
---
Yessir

---
Regardless of the layering volcano of salt, layering of entire continents implies that the continents are treated as an entire instance in Classic, just as they were in original Vanilla.
---
Basically, it means that you won't see things like Blizz breaking up large raid groups congregating in a single area like they do on retail.
---
I took my time leveling and smelling the peacebloom the first time I played vanilla, I don’t intend to try and have the same experience as last time. I tend to be discouraged if I feel like I’m “behind” whatever goal I set for myself. I’m not going to compromise on this goal and if it I find it unachievable I’ll seek a more attainable goal (ie different game).
---
Don't be surprised when classic fails.
---
But it is based off of what we know
---
Yeah its Greed, they're a damn business. Releasing classic in general is an attempt to make more money. There are no "smoke and mirrors", just whiny people on reddit who expect stuff for free. Be glad that the monthly sub cost hasn't increased in 15 years.
---
105 till launch, but who’s counting? XD &lt;3
---
wait...
---
so you have to sub to retail for a chance at beta?
---
ive not been subbed to retail for years
---
i cant just buy beta access?
---
Do you understand what RNG is?
---
Interesting, I’m not that into the math behind the game, so I have no clue about it. But the devs surely know about this (I hope).
---
i want that cool CE pet i was envious of 15 years ago when i saw it, i want to be that person now.  can i?  no, i can only be envious of that same person from 15 years ago #nochanges
---
Underrated comment right here.
---
An important note from today's drops - if you have the original collectors edition, all in game rewards from that will be available to your character in Classic
---
&gt;How do you avoid dying to random monsters when exploring? Do you stick to the road?
---
Pretty much. Time spent in Redridge has a strategic death. Westfall has good exploration route with minimal aggro.
---
&gt; How does the wetlands skip work?
---
[watch this for abt 4 minutes](https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY?t=3731) - this video is also pretty much line 1-82 of the sheet.
---
So... layering?
---
I mean. Layers are completely different from sharding.
---
Sharding breaks up multiple servers and stitches them together like multiple abominations.
---
Layers break one server up into two or more pieces when it's too crowded, but never involves other servers.
---
You’re right, they should scrap retail and just start all over.
---
Ok... So?.. ITS NOT ABOUT RUSHING TO LEVEL 60! Its about living in a world and experiencing the people of that world! I would much rather sit around and chat with people for 4 days whilst the starting zones clear out or hell take those other people that cant quest and go have so fun somewhere than to be in my own solo world. 
---
People are what made the game so great in the first place and the lack of it is what is killing live now.
---
Sadly you have no way of proving it
---
And I can make up stories too
---
F R E S H
---
&gt; It's just a few weeks, it well help John stick with it. He wont be 55-60 in 3 weeks like me.
---
But I don't want John to stick with it. I want him to quit. It isn't his game. He's the one who will want LFD back.  
---
And 55-60 in 3 weeks isn't hardcore whatsoever. Joana went to 60 in ~12 days playing 8 hour per day. Layering will affect the entirety of my leveling experience and you can be sure that I will abuse this system to farm black lotus and shit very early, despite all these losers arguing how "impossible" that will be.
---
Yo, when I was going to reply to this, I realized we are kinda going in circles. I am looking forward to release date more then a beta anyways. Have a good one.
---
You're displaying your lack of understanding if you think creating alts will somehow allow you to change layers infinitely
---
2004 bby.
---
We're in Chromie's world now, after all. Anything could happen and be chalked up to weird fluctuations in the universe.
---
What is your solution to tourism then? I am honestly curious. What do you think the solution to tourism in the first month not completely fucking server pops except server transfers?
---
I am going of having 3k per layer.
---
&gt;People were happy with the original proposal
---
I sure don't remember it being that way, and I see plenty of people happy with this solution, but I don't think either of us actually posess the real numbers.
---
&gt;This is not a good idea this time around and it since they are very receptive with feedback I am giving them that.
---
Of course you're free to do so, I just disagree.
---
Today during an interview they confirmed if you have the original collectors edition, your in game rewards will carry over to Classic
---
27th Aug or in other words the fourth last date we can still call "Summer 2019"
---
Oof, someone gonna tell him the bad news?
---
Sir this is a wendy’s
---
But the layers accomplish just that. It’s a phase 1 only addition. By that time the server population will have taken their natural coarse just like any other system. The layers don’t exist without the population demand
---
Yeah I remember it being "some sharding in starting zones for only 3 weeks" and people were like "THIS IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE" and now here we are.. slopes slippery and all.
---
Server merging has really hurt games in the past. I think layering is going to hurt a lot less, but I would love if they allowed for server transfers - with the exception of streamers. They definitely shouldn’t be allowed to move once it is known where they play.
---
I love how not one reply provides a counter argument as to why simply sharding starting zones isn't just, better.
---
Roflmao! Thank you, I LoL'd!
---
&gt; You are locked into your layer
---
Per session. If you log out and log back in, you will be in a new layer if there exists a lower-pop layer than your previous.
---
What you think isn't irrelevant and what someone does for money does not automatically make it right.
---
I'll hold you to it and come back to call you a fucking idiot.
---
Lmfao, classic will not be classic, you all seem to think it’s going to be a like for like 1.2 release. You’re all so naive.
---
are you insane? Don’t try to question the echo chamber that is r/classicwow/
---
"Community" is such a strong word. The "Classic Community" is nothing more than people who take some interest in Classic. Otherwise they are just a lot of people who are very different.
---
Don't think about them as a "community". Almost all of them you'll never meet (either in game or on Reddit). Ignore the idiots and find good people to play with.
---
(My own little take on the streamers: I just find it very weird that Blizzard only released a short statement about the release date and beta testing. I had to watch interviews with the developers on some no-name streamers' youtube to get a little bit of more info. Why didn't Blizzard themselves provide this?)
---
Private servers have issues partly cause they also have dumb dynamic spawns
---
Yes exactly they never did in the first place and theres a possibility they wont again. It’s not about being uptight or anything it’s just a bit sucky, you hear of the days when wow first launched as a legend for most of your time playing wow, when the time finally comes to experience it again it’s unavailable to you. I for one am not complaining, since my University will start around 2/3 weeks from then, but some people wont have that luxury. You may not be affected by this which is why you lack the empathy of those complaining. 
---
At the end of the day having a second chance to experience something like this is amazing and will suck to those die-hard fans who wont get to experience that initial launch.  
---
Its unlucky and it just sucks.
---
So the first 3k people who log into classic on a realm will need to compete for the zone. The very next person gets a completely fresh zone.  
---
Yeah. That's a great solution.
---
Your reasoning for not officially posting in the forums is that "no one will see it"?  Content creators will.  
---
Instead of closed-door meetings that are in-secret (i.e. this whole debacle), you would have the commentary on official statements instead of one-sided opinions that are potentially censored by Blizzard.
---
Honestly, I am for no changes. Just let people change realms when there is pop issues. 
---
I rather they just make the layers actual different servers, and then merge them after phase one.
---
Sure, but isn't that what made wow fun and memorable?  I have more fond memories of those shoddy pugs than any streamlined group.  One of my best friends to this day I met on her undergeared tank that pulled way too much and made me burn all my mana to keep her alive on every pull.  An hour later, after we finally cleared the dungeon, I added her as a friend.  This past January,  I visited her and her husband after the birth of their 2nd child.  I don't have any of those experiences from "optimal" groups.
---
I totally get what you are trying to say, but this isn't retail.  In classic you don't have to minmax everything you do.  Leave that mentality at the door and play what you want and HAVE FUN.
---
I’ll be playing comfortly with a friend, full on duo levelling. No vacation planned for the chaotic first week. In week two or three we’ll both take a week off, I’ll get my pc to his place and we’ll straight up game throughout the week. But decent sleep is a must.
---
It's not a true beta. It's a sever stress test. To close to release for any real changes from a beta.
---
Because that seems like a more awkward way to say, "Releases this summer," in a futile attempt to temper expectations that will never be tempered. The folks upset about the launch date would have been upset about it regardless of how they phrased it. The bottom line is folks are upset they can't rush through launch during their summer break. While the disappointment is understandable, the actual whining at Blizzard for it is childish. Either the game was coming out too early and would have bugs, too late for summer breaks but working properly, or we could all wait for the next time college/grade school students got out of school again.
---
Can't wait to see people just up and vanish when I get an invite to a party for a dungeon or a friend. This is so retarded and completely ruins and semblance of a shared world server
---
They've literally said there will only be around 3 layers per server max. Which you'll only see if the server is at max capacity at the time you're playing.
---
Fair enough, to each their own.
---
Wait how do you do that!? I’d love to get that setup
---
Dude I cannot wait for Barrens chat.
---
Omg. This would be the dream.
---
&gt; The technology is just not there &lt;.&lt;
---
Laughable. What do you do for a living, bake bread? You aren't qualified to speak on technology if you believe this is true.  
---
That quote from WH is a mis-quote from Blizz. Ion said that in the best case scenario, layering would be removed in a month, and the worst case scenario is that it will be removed after phase 2. For all we know, P2 will last 6 months, so that's "1-6 months" not "2-4 weeks"
---
If I'm not mistaken wasn't flying a major part in wotlk? Im a baby so I didn't play back then but all of northrends mountains were built with the flying depending on it right? I don't see what's wrong with that and it adds so much more for zone creation in my opinion
---
Who said the world is ending? I said this is not good. I will watch the video tho
---
They accomplish this, while adding a plethora of potential other issues.  What issues would my solution have?  People upset that they're on Blackrock 2 instead of 3?
---
What month is 27?
---
Mine only goes up to 12
---
So, what class and race are you gonna be playing as? :)
---
These people are fucking brainlets man. These answers are staring them in the face, and they think they're just going to have a guy dedicated to helping others hop layers? Why wouldn't he just play the game himself? How will he even know who's on a different layer? And then after all that, this guy thinks the zone is going to be empty?
---
It's like a 50 IQ thought process.
---
this version of vannila is more fake then any private server tho
---
The RNG makes all the difference, means people ALWAYS have a shot.
---
Just seems like it’s not a fresh slate then. I never got to play till tbc. That means I have no chance at those items?
---
"Lets have a beta test for Classic, but only invite people who currently play Retail"  
---
Good job Blizzard.
---
Mists has some really good music but I’m a huge fan of vanilla, TBC and Wrath.
---
He's outleveled them quite a bit. That being said thats why the first one aggro'd kinda late plus he was running towards it making to look like he gets even closer before aggroing. The range on the other two seemed fine.
---
Don't see a lot wrong in this clip. He's 2 levels up and kited them and he got kinda lucky on the parries and misses and even crit the last one.
---
Anyone else a little ticked that they said 2019 Summer and its actually 2019 Fall?
---
Hi, /u/c0debr3ak
---
Looks like i will be up late on the 26th over here in the UK. Server go live actually on the 26th not 27th
---
Big mistake. Servers will constantly be crashing and unstable. Start your vacation a few days later at the very least.
---
If it’s more world bosses or something other than hard core raiding, that would be cool too
---
How do you hop layers ?
---
sad but true
---
&gt; No, they are thinking about getting people who is serious about classic and have a passion for the game to try the beta for the best possible feedback. 
---
You mean people who have passion for the shitshow that is WoW retail.
---
Colorado, but I'll let my west coast buddies know!
---
Doesn't look like it to me.
---
Right, I haven’t thought of the pvp gear ... damn, it’s really complicated. Especially since newly introduced pvp gear shouldn’t be stronger than r14 gear. Unless a new set gets introduced that is only obtainable through a crazy pvp grind ... or new pve gear is not useful in pvp
---
Boy do I miss talent points
---
Of course, is Abed.
---
Thanks, it was catchy after all.
---
Im pretty sure layering is what people originally wanted. 
---
It essential creates
---
Darkspear 1
---
Darkspear 2
---
Darkspear 3 
---
Etc
---
They all eventually get merged by phase 2. 
---
I thought this was pretty much what the most upvoted liked solution to server issues and tourists playing for 2 weeks and leaving servers barren. 
---
If we go back to when Ion talked about sharding in starting zones this reddit was full of similar suggestions. 
---
This means you will have mega servers for launch that tappers off to a more niche normal sized community.
---
Maybe buffs or model changes to existing items?
---
so say if a layer is 1000 people and i log on as the 1001st i will be in a layer by myself and wont see any other people?
---
Here is the classic content plan blue post.

---
Phase 6
---
    Naxxramas
---
    Scourge Invasion
---
Which you don't move out of except if you group. The worst thing with sharding in retail is seing a huge fight in the distance, coming closer and suddenly it disappears. That won't happen in classic.
---
Been raiding for a couple years with this amazing guy. I knew him only by his in game name and that he had an insanely sexy voice, as he was RL.... ended up inviting him to do random solo shit with me, farm this, run this for transmog, etc. Which led to us spending lots of time getting to really know each other, which led to us falling madly in love... and he's been my boyfriend for over a year and we are so stoked to play classic together :) he never got to experience it since he's a bit younger than me. Honestly I'm almost more excited to watch him be excited than I am to play it myself hahaha.
---
Requesting PTO now brb
---
I'm coming Home.
---
Troll warrior for that tank life.
---
Classic will be included in the regular sub fee. No extra purchase necessary.
---
did it have anything in game?
---
sold out while i was asleep lol
---
the statue looks nice but i dont really collect game statues bit too geeky
---
Well aren’t you special
---
So they can have less servers at launch and less dead servers in 2 months when all Fotm players are gone.
---
They somehow survived a launch in 2004, but hell, we've only had 15 years of technological improvement since then.
---
Which is fine. 
---
There are three possibilities:
---
1. Server population starts out high with multiple layers, then eventually normalize to a stable population for a single layer. Great success.
---
2. Server population starts out high with multiple layers, drops a little but still has too high of a population for a single layer. Blizzard offer free server transfers to new or underpopulated servers.
---
3. Server population starts out high with multiple layers, then drops massively to below a healthy population. Blizzard offers free server transfer from overpopulated servers or merges with other low population servers.
---
They're highly unlikely to guess a perfect number of servers before release, especially with the influx of curious visitors from retail. Layering just acts as a safety net to avoid adding too many servers too soon.
---
What I'm worried about is layer hopping.
---
"Anyone got a layer with Sin'Dall alive?"
---
"I'm getting corpsecamped by a rogue in STV, need a new layer."
---
The guy that can’t keep it together and curses out of frustration telling me to keep emotion out and be logical?
---
I’m for an authentic vanilla experience, and I understand that compromises have to be made because they won’t leave certain bugs and exploits in, but where I see that they can afford to keep things authentic, I advocate for them. That’s exactly what I’m doing right now, and that’s a logical line of thinking - you are whining because someone doesn’t agree with you. Vanilla was not released with shards or layers, it did fine. Dynamic respawns sound like a better answer to me than sharding because the first is less destructive to true vanilla gameplay than the latter, that is why I’m voicing my opinion. But you can stop crying because it’s not like they’ll go back on it because of what I said - you’ll have it your way and I won’t, and I’m a little upset but it doesn’t even come close to offsetting my happiness for having this game released in the first place.
---
ez OP
---
Thank You!
---
Its not about lag lol. Did you play ND day 1? That is not how a proper game should run. Dynamic respawn was the biggest fucking joke. And again, let me say what I have said multiple times in sharding posts. No time in Vanillas history did it involve 1000 people in Northshire, that is not Vanilla like, which is the whole point of this.
---
Where is this stated? Is there a source?
---
10/10
---
You won't actually change shard on log in, it's been explicitly said. So no, you're wrong.
---
all this secrecy and lack of info and dishing out something they know ppl wont like , i think they are setting vannila up to fail so they can introduce "refreshing content " if you know what i mean .all in all  the community of the people i have palyed with on private servers was great i just hope there will be a fine balance between retail and private in pop so i dont feel so lonely on there. 
---
i just dont understand why they can make starcraft  with better graphics and leave the game as it always was,  but fail to do so for vannila
---
I really like your explanation, thanks.
---
&gt; But what’s the difference between the power creep that happens from MC up to Naxx to any additional power creep?
---
its literally worse?   
---
Why is the powercreep between MC and blue gear less bad than the powercreep between blue gear and BWL? Because its less impactful.
---
&gt; Only when it goes over the pop cap, it will go to another layer.
---
And if you happen to log off and log back on during that time, you will also be sent to that other layer.  
---
Stop misinterpretting this shit.
---
Your first two complaints are based on an assumption that it's easy to abuse the system and jump between layers. It would be surprising if it's that simple.
---
3 is an unfortunate result but if you watch StaySafe's interview with the devs they also say that it should be a very rare occurrence because they expect the need to layer to go away fairly quickly after launch. So outside of launch, whether its the day or week or however long until players return to a normal playing schedule, they expect servers to be a single layer the majority of the time with additional layers used for population spikes. 
---
The "end of Phase 1" timeline is a bit misleading because that's just their timeline for completely turning off layering. They expect populations to fall into stable states well before that.
---
You could be totally making that up but I'm choosing to believe you because I know one of those words is the right one.
---
It's the version everyone back then started on so I'd say yes.
---
Good thing I’ll be undead priest &gt;:)
---
True story.
---
There were a lot more servers available when the game originally launched, the population numbers on each layer are the same/slightly more than the server cap back then.   
---
One layer on a server is going to have the same population as it's own server back in 2004.  
---
So to answer your Q, no it wasn't in 2004 my friend.
---
Which really means you shouldn't sub at all if you weren't already subbed. But you and I both know that a whole bunch of people instantly saw the official post and whipped out their credit cards. Shame really.
---
hahahaha
---
Roll horde on the same server and just give them hell lol
---
Oh yeaaaah!!!!
---
RIP OG Frost Ram. Only purchase I ever bought gold for.
---
Your first ones being from a different decade when blizzard was a completely different company. May is not summer. Wow has never had a summer release, even wow patches usually isn't released over summer.
---
This is a sarcastic post right? Pally has heals and still barely survives? Do what he did on a warrior, mage, rogue, warlock, hunter, or anything that has no self heals and watch as you are running back to your corpse, lol
---
Authentic re-creation by definition is being as close to the original source as humanly possible void of cost measures, etc.
---
Sharding/Layering was not in Vanilla and takes away from the community feel aspect of the game. Why is this important? Because the success of the game was literally it's "own world-like community" for every server.
---
We can disagree all day long but at the end of the day this isn't attempting to recreate the authentic experience. It's using nice technological advances to streamline a product. I can't rebuild a classic car and throw a supercharger on it and call it an authentic classic car, it's not. It's a remastered version of itself. This is now WoW Classic remake, not WoW Classic remastered.
---
The same can be said of that guy that says, "I know my stuff" Often times, they don't. Calling someone an idiot for using a safe line of well that's your subjective opinion is indeed moronic. If dynamic respawn spawns 99% identical to the original - guess what, it's authentic. Not subjective but fact. Using all new technology is the farthest from representing the authentic experience is my main point here. I would be all for it but the game is literally founded on community and sharding is absolutely horrid to the creation of that.
---
Layering isn't as set in stone as you think it is - layers will eb and flow - it's the whole point of them being created so that as population dips day to day peaks or week to week population losses, people WILL be migrated on a server handle load basis. It's lame and slices through communities like butter.
---
The thirteenth of August. So two weeks early, not a whole month. Still a bit shitty, but ehh, its theoretically 8$ name reservations. That's less than I spend on lunch most days. Everyone who is claiming "ded gaem" cause of slightly greedy practices by Blizz are fucking idiots.
---
Yep. I’ll just no life my summer scouring the web for anything pertaining to WoW Classic.
---
&gt; Thats literally all you can do. 
---
We can protest with our wallets, the same way we've done to modern WoW.  
---
If you retail baby apologists would fuck off and die already, maybe the rest of us could have a good experience for once.
---
Q_Q
---
Omg thank you! I'm embarrassed how long I searched for a Classic Collector's Edition 😣
---
Thing is blizzard isn't going to ALLOW 14k people on a server, there will be a maximum player limit per server and it will be much lower than 14k, so if you want to play on that server you will have to wait in que until somebody leaves.
---
Exactly, it's the *15 year anniversary* collector's edition
---
You sound like a dick. Especially when you put dev in quotes. 
---
And just because something didnt happen to you doesn't mean it didn't happen
---
Some people just be close minded bro
---
Yeah I’ma need to know how you did that
---
It did fine? Lmao... You have no idea what you're talking about. See ya.
---
I'm going to make a list of everyone on my layer, and whenever they ask for a hop, I'll make sure to send an invite, so they think they've hopped, but arent' really hopping.
---
30 mintues later 'u mad?'
---
I'm totally on board with them squeezing, but I think they should have done it in a way which lets Classic fans voice themselves separate from retail.
---
If there was some box cost that classic fans could pay which granted beta potential and allows name saving I would pay that, but I won't sub to retail.
---
Benefits of the box approach:
---
* Cleaner incremental numbers for any sizing efforts related to launch.
---
* Feedback during beta will more closely match the audience coming back for Classic, with less dilution from people currently satisfied with retail.
---
* Greater granularity in price discrimination. They could have multiple price points for the box cost with Collector's Edition type tchotchkes.
---
Blizzard seems very reluctant to provide visibility into Classic demand compared to retail. Every decision they've made has taken the approach of blending populations to buoy current sub numbers.
---
Jeremy Soule worked on the Mists soundtrack...same guy who does the Elder Scrolls music
---
You will start with all the base dungeons except Dire Maul, no dungeons were ever added after BC(though several like Deadmines and Wailing Caverns were changed).  The main raid at start will be Molten Core, with Ragnoros as the final boss.
---
Basically they're saying they only want retail players and idiots to beta test for them.
---
Think how weird it would be to have a server with a layer of 3k people and then another one around 1k if it does not fill up.
---
I'd imagine Relentless Strikes would be a dps increase but maybe with high enough crit chance lethality would win out?  
---
Gouge/dodge is mainly going to come down to what you intend on doing outside of raids. If it's any sort of pvp you'd want gouge but if not, dodge is probably better in the strictest sense for raids.
---
Damn, lucky you. I hope they will offer more because the demand is super high it seems
---
oh well, back to private servers for 3 more months
---
Dude 7.50? Come on...lol
---
So the reason for me advicing you to downrank is not to top your dps, its to control it for when the raid needs it the most, while I cant say for sure as I've never played boomkin only read, you will most likely need everything to keep your dps from falling close to flat 0 and you go completely oom with all consumables used for the absolutely longest fights like Nefarian. Nefarians phase 2 100-20% is not what kills the usual raid, its the first phase or phase 3 that starts when he hits 20%, the entire fight can last over 20min.
---
Id highly advice you to take up the suggestion to try a boomkin on a private server, while its not 100%, its quite close to what you will experiance, especially mana wise. Dps might be a bit off as resistances are not known by private servers (as far as i know) but boomkin mana regen surely is and there is where the boomkin fails.
---
It would surely have helped with 3 t2 spelldmg pieces instead of the 3 t1 pieces with spellpower.
---
Now i have a reason to live! :)
---
Combat rogue with daggers? Do daggers if you are grouped at most..def sword for solo.
---
I'm by no means in full agreement with their decision with this. But the devs have said they're doing this to gauge interest to see if they would need to add more realms before launch.
---
I don’t understand, hasn’t WOW been out for a decade?
---
It is probably a bit more dynamic in that layers are created or deleted on the fly as necessitated by demand. Possibly similar to gw2 overflows, if you are familiar with those at all.
---
Gonna be super cool when you go to gank someone and they phase away to a other layer because they're buddy invited them. Or how the economy will be ruined when people abuse nodes on many different layers and guilds abuse world boss farms
---
Ahhh so you didnt look up how it works?
---
You just wake up?
---
I make about 36$ an hour so by my math if I get 30 minutes of joy out of it each month then its worth it.
---
Except it isn't. Will retards like you stop spouting this bullshit?  
---
With **layering**, you are assigned your layer **upon login** and **can change layers in real-time** by having friends invite you or other users of an addon invite you.  
---
With **pre-bundled servers**, you are assigned your subserver **upon character creation** and **cannot interact with the other bundled servers or their players** until the day when the servers merge.  
---
These are different systems. This one is prone to exploitation. Just because you aren't clever enough to exploit the system doesn't mean that the economy won't suffer.
---
How would a planned server merge be better? After phase 1 you see a bunch of people you never saw while leveling or started grinding dungeons with.
---
i feel dirty even launching the blizzard launcher tbh
---
I suggest adding "income" instead. So we know where to go if money making is the goal.I suggest adding "income" instead.

---
Are RP-PvP servers going to be in at launch?
---
Sooo, it's not definite that this is being used even the entirety of phase 1? For certain not beyond it? How long exactly is phase one expected to be. Due to world PvP I think it's important we have a lot of action without layers before battlegrounds come along. 
---
They're also planning to have higher server pops people. Since its not cross realm, consider it like this- it's 2006, xr is being raided. Those people leave and log off for 6 hours as another group of allies raid. You're not seeing the same people but they're still a part of your server and you will cross paths again. 
---
As long as it's short lived it's not the end of classic.
---
Actually this is a big not true lol.
---
Solid point.
---
I think you misunderstood what my question was. I assume, from what I’ve read and experienced throughout the years, that the power creep between t1 and t3 is fine, it’s just progression. But any additional power creep afterwards would be bad. I am wondering why.
---
Cool thanks a lot, where is this information found at?
---
" Confirmed we will not be getting the unarmored mounts at all." is this a thing?
---
I am quite blatantly asking for sharding. That's literally the post. Thanks for proving you didn't even read it, lol.
---
Wtf is “EDT”, it’s EST god damn it
---
If you get a beta invite has nothing to do with sub. You just need to sub to use the invite once you get one.
---
What? If a layer has the same population cap as a server population cap, that means the same amount of players will be in x zone at launch.
---
Yeah.. off from uni for 3 months during summer, still only manage to get one week of uninterrupted classic goodness in
---
Could be worse, I guess, saw some people say they start on the same date, now that's real shitty
---
Yeah I really see this as the equivalent of opening up a "b" server and then merging it once the flooding stops.
---
Every time!? Jesus fucking Christmas
---
I'm learning more now. They're increasing server population anyways. I mean if you wait in line with 1000 other people on an overpopulated server and 1000 log off and you all enter slowly that's basically phasing one pop out for the other and it happened back in vanilla. This is a temporary solution to a launch still it seems
---
Do you have a source that phase one is only a month?
---
So it's just about *your* experience then. Noted.
---
As Varys once said, incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty.
---
Literally everyone is gonna be just fine.
---
Correct. Classic will not require any one time purchases, as long as you have a subscription active you can play Classic, regardless of any other circumstance.
---
&gt;btw $100 shiny box which does absolutely nothing
---
I mean, people have been saying they want a collector's edition so why not? It's not like it could be anything else. I guess it could include more than a single month of game time.
---
EDIT: The real absurdity is that they come with mounts that can't be used in Classic.
---
99% likely you are in your friends layer...
---
Thank you for this! I was just about to start editing the version with the release date so I'm glad I checked Reddit first!
---
So if someone is ganking you/camping you, you can just log out and log in to change layer? LMAO
---
Probably in Irvine, at their headquarters
---
So you want game changes because you can't pay attention to details that everyone else can?
---
Those CE pets and everything are worthless today and nobody even gets a chance to show them off. If you were lucky enough to be able to buy the CE or obtain those codes 15 years ago.. Good for you, enjoy your CE pets I his version! Show them off!
---
its exactly like vanilla in all the wrong ways, information didn't spread as fast back, few people bothered recording and youtube wasn't a thing yet. Guilds that knew of exploits, cheats or other ways to game the system kept it to themselves and reaped the benefits. Now information spreads so fast that its very unlikely that anything gamebreaking escapes blizzards eye for more than a few days and is promptly fixed.
---
August 26th is my girlfriends birthday. Been playing wow since 2004.
---
Plz send help.
---
This is doomed from the start. Thankfully somewhere in the North lies our friend Dale.
---
Just remember you said this, when 4 months after release, you realize shardinf is here to stay and you go on reddit to complain
---
That's not what he meant. He meant players on different layers will automatically move to same layer when grouped up. No Cross Realm anything.
---
So... How classic is it?  Can I polymorph someone for a solid 60 seconds and drown them in booty bay?
---
bro... that's kinda cringe
---
Posted elsewhere in this thread: [https://i.imgur.com/nUVMyf1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/nUVMyf1.jpg)
---
Now I don't know if I want to roll PvP or pve. Only big positive on PvP server for me was bgs.
---
It's a quick way to chase off the people who just don't belong, at a quicker rate. They can run back to retail and we will have our classic servers. Ever seen kids exposed to fast and the furious,lambo's and ferrari's enjoy their time at a show with nothing but oldie hot rods?
---
Blizzard is trying it's hardest, again, to sell a video game to the world. When Classic is meant for a certain group of players. And blizzard once again is going way too far for the players that aren't even going to stick around for long after they realize they can't press 2 buttons to get into a dungeon or crit something for 13 billion damage.
---
A certain group of people have been fighting with Blizzard to do this. Now they want to do it, but not mainly for the only group who really wants it. They are doing it for EEEEVVVVVEEEEERRRRYYYOOONNNNNEE, when you and I both know, Vanilla WoW is NOT for everyone in today's gaming world.
---
Man, that sucks.
---
Standard if you live in a developed country.
---
A few seconds before your link he mentions that it's not cross-realm. They're talking about the layering system they're adding to classic which is similar to sharding but over the entire continent.
---
Had my V-card punched by a girl in my guild.
---
Welcome to the real world, some of us have been putting in 50+hours a week for years and now the students will only be able to get somewhat ahead of us and they are crying they can't get more ahead lol
---
Adam Friedland is a paladin and will save any damsel in distress. Unless he has on flip flops.
---
Up voted to counter the down vote. Fuck that guy
---
As far as I understand they are different layers on each realm and players from different layers but the same realm will be able to party up "cross-layer"
---
Blizzard cares deeply about the launch experience, since it will make or break many people's subscriptions. Can't get people addicted to their character if they can't login due to queues. Queues suck.
---
reminder that if people complain enough blizzard will fuck off with this layering stuff and make more realms

Except its called layering and in reality its 3 servers in 1 that will merge before phase 1.

Everyine saying they should just do server merges, well this is exactly that. Just premeditated

At least it will help them predict launch numbers, I guess.

Same lmao, my school starts the monday after the release. That means I have one week and hopefully hitting maybe 30-40.

blizzard doesn't care about people like you, the people posting like "dude who cares lol" are who they are catering to

No proof? Just take your word for it eh?

better 3k than 8k, at the very least.
---
I think conceptually you’ve got the wrong idea regarding layering. All of the layers will share the same primary (base) server. The economy won’t drastically change in a layered environment, because it will be on the primary (base) server. Most players probably wont even realize they are on a layered server while playing in the game.
---
Think of it this way. Your guild all logs in at different times of the day. You end up on different layers, but you want to raid Hogger. So, you invite all your guild buddies, and go raid him. 
---
How is this possible? Well, even though you were on different layers, inviting them to group brought them all to your server (layer) for the intended purpose of fighting one guy. You all shared guild chat, and nobody on any of those layers can make a guild with the same name. All of your player names, your identities, are all unique for that stack of layers. You can mail, trade and communicate with anyone on those different layers, because all of those aspects are managed by the primary (base) server.
---
Eventually, as players stop coming to the game, the server population dwindles down. Yet, you don’t see this, because they simply aren’t using the layers. The population is still active, the economy may slow, but remains largely the same - all of those problems caused by merging simply don’t exist, as the layered servers simply go unused as active population decreases.
---
&gt; Just like how phasing/teleporting works in retail if you are in active combat, you will not phase until you are out. 
---
Actually not true. I was soloing a tough elite in BfA and got phased when I got it to around 20%. I got phased to a shard that contained Horde and Ally fighting to get the elite for themselves, and I got mauled pretty quickly. 
---
This is one of the reasons I'm incredibly glad they're not going with traditional sharding.
---
Well that is fucking awesome, you ROCK!  Thanks!!
---
Perfect i can have a straight 14hr session ezclap
---
And guild wars! Jeremy soule is awesome
---
It's different. I was one of the people who skipped a lot of class, and therefore had to do some very intense studying before exams. Basically, I'd have a lot of time for like.. 10 months of the year, while i'd do nothing else than studying one month each for both exam periods per year.
---
More realms is not the answer long term.
---
This isn't supposed to be a fresh slate. But yes you have no chance at getting then today in modern wow. Why would you have a chance for them again?
---
Sure, but it just seems like an unnecessary added step.  If you get outbid, come back next week when you have more gold and the other guy already spent everything.  That's what I like about GDKP: even when you lose, you still get paid.
---
One issue with your system is that it will tend to set artificially low price limits on gear: if one guy rolls 100, no one else will bother buying a roll.  When I participated in GDKP runs in WotLK, I was on the same tier token as another regular who often sat at the gold cap.  Instead of whining when tier tokens dropped, I pushed his bid up as high as I could get it so we all got paid, then picked up that tier token for cheap the following week.  The gold cap guy got his gear, I got my gear, and we all got rich.
---
In my opinion, either use gold or don't; hybridizing it with /roll to fuzz the outcome will only lead to frustration, especially if losing rolls are non-refundable.  You'll discourage those super wealthy players from attending because they can't buy their gear, which means your raid has less appeal to the super geared players looking to get rich quick/finance raid consumables, and so on.
---
i imagine the restriction of when a layer stops adding new logins, and the literal capacity of a layer, arent the same so the layers probably can go over their cap they just wont do so through logins
---
Nice
---
Will this still work in classic? Does it still work in retail?
---
&gt; and the setup required to "jump" layers to avoid fights is so prohibitive that it's not a realistic thing to worry about.
---
I haven't played since WotLK but it sounds like an awful idea. [This](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow) page says you can change layers by joining a group, so I assume there will be some way to manipulate layers by joining and leaving groups or raids.
---
Also just because they promise to remove something, doesn't mean they will actually do it.
---
If you had friends on the server, you'd already be on the same layer...stop making up stupid reasons to be mad.
---
I'd *highly* recommend not doing any "research" or preparation. It's a game, not a job. You'll enjoy it the best if you take your time and discover things yourself by playing.
---
You'll find plenty of people who you can play with either in game our outside, if you look. Not the "hardcore", rushing type but those who'll also be taking their time, whether they'll be new to the game or veterans.
---
I hate this sub today
---
I don't but that's probably because I'm a bitter husk of what was once a human being
---
Layers are supposed to be 3,000 people in one layer. So if they are doing the cap of 3,500 for a server then there is potentially going to be an over-crowded one, and one that is ripe for farming mats, leveling gank free, etc. I think it's a complete failure of an idea.
---
You're going to level via arms or fury (literally ANYTHING can tank leveling instances).
---
Then you'll go prot at 60 for raids until you get geared enough for the battlegrounds. Then you'll go Arms again.
---
Oh no!The Horde has burned down the UK!
---
Prolly need to chill bud, you seem upset
---
You're gonna be ganked before you find your friend. Then you'll cry about that too
---
"Eastern Daylight Time (EDT), when observing daylight saving time DST (spring/summer) is 4 hours behind Coordinated Universal Time (UTC−04:00)."
---
We're currently in EDT.
---
12:00am on the 27th, I thought?
---
they should merge them if they die or offer free transfers like they did before
---
layering is retarded because players can't choose their "layer"
---
lets hope not its so shit with people from other servers abusing this functionality to farm junk on other servers
---
Induce early labor to get it out of the way.
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
Not at all. I just take it from official sources when it happens and not speculate.
---
Very small crowd. Might not be worth it.
---
Enjoy fatherhood, this is only the beginning.
---
Isn't it pretty widely accepted as being so heavily RNG based that it'd be a miracle if someone pulled it off?
---
CS is a lot more than learning programming, though.
---
Best guess is that there would still be a 3k cap and a 2k queue. Servers that didn't drop population fast enough and still have more than the population cap would get queues and maybe free transfers to lower pop servers.
---
Sharding is already confirmed for starting areas, why do we need Layers though? Plus, 5k isn't a confirmed population.
---
So ganking a player requires a countergank to stop, right? Chad the level 60 rogue is ganking Zoe the warlock who is level 30. Zoe's boyfriend Jimmy is a rank 13 epic warrior with multiglad in retail, better player than Chad and has better gear. Jimmy can shit on Chad in a 1v1, but Chad can 1 shot Zoe. 
---
If Chad has Lamar and Brad in discord, and Brad is on layer 1 and Lamar is on layer 2, Brad can invite Chad to group to bring him to layer 1, Lamar can invite Chad to layer 2, all he needs to do is drop group when he wants to shift. 
---
If Zoe is on layer 1, Chad can gank Zoe until Zoe calls Jimmy to bail her out. With sharding, any time Jimmy comes close to killing Chad, Chad can get invited from Lamar to layer 2, which Jimmy is not on. All Chad needs to do to shit on jimmy and escape any punishment is get invited by his buddy during one of rogue's half dozen hard CCs. 
---
*cast kidney shot*
---
"hey dude invite me now"
---
As long as Lamar is responding in discord, Chad is fucking gone. He's out clean. All the mobs on Chad's screen fade out, he phases into layer 2, and he's fucking clean, he's out. 
---
Chad is one shotting Zoe from stealth and Jimmy can't do anything unless he chases the dude to the next shard. Chad is LITERALLY cuckolding Jimmy here. He is fucking Jimmy's girl and Jimmy can only watch.
---
I know speedleveling routes and can get to cap in under 7 days played. If I waste a bit of time, I wont be far enough behind that it'll matter. 
---
Also, phase 1 is going to last a few more than 2 weeks.
---
No, because 3x the demand drives the prices back up.
---
Go find a private server and give it a whirl. Won't cost you a dime.
---
There's always adoption.
---
Just saying.
---
Thank you for all the hard work to put this together!!
---
But there's 27 different specs which the gear could be BiS for. So they could intentionally weight gear to be BiS in slots that currently didn't have many good options, or for weaker specs. Moreover, content doesn't even have to be a side grade. Zul'Gurub is a perfect example of horizontal progression, where it provided a stepping stone in between Molten Core and Blackwing Lair that wasn't necessary, but helped, as well as the special enchantments and non-gear forms of progression.

You can tell from this link that the uncropped, full resolution image must be HUGE.  
---
I need it.
---
You could be right. I personally was hoping for traditional size(or slightly larger) servers with sharding for starting zones only for a month or so. In no way do I consider this is best solution, but I also think the potential downside are being over exaggerated a bit too. I still think the absence of addition layers when a demand threshold isn’t met is a crucial component in this.
---
Right, I meant "originally" as in when they first introduced cross realm BGs.
---
Phase 1 is the glory days of Classic, now shit on by layering.
---
You go enjoy your fractured community as you log on different layers for the first X months.
---
Easy to get angry when there are better solutions albeit more costly. I pay for a quality product not a watered-down version of its former self. Save that shit for retail.
---
You still can start at 0 on TBC release if you decide to roll a shaman as Alliance or paladin as a horde and will be very popular in PvE because not many people would be able to lvl 1-70 compared to having 60 lvl characters from Vanilla and both Shaman and Paladin are Extremely important for PvE content.
---
Welp looks like I am going to ruin my mid 30s the same way I ruined my early 20s
---
You are WRONG. They announced that layers are basically overflow servers. They aren't like layer 1 2 3 and you get put into a random one.
---
There is the server, you go onto that, if it is at its cap, you get put on the next layer etc.
---
Jesus christ, do some research before you sperg out.
---
As others have said, it's about cross-layer grouping, since you're all on the same server.
---
a. They'd get more money if they just released it today. That doesn't make any sense.
---
b. If you watched any of the beta videos, then there obviously were some pretty major bugs that still need to get worked out.
---
2005 - I hit level 40 and get a mount. My brother tells me if I summon my mount, I will need “mount food” or it will die and I will have to buy another one. My brother kindly sells me “mage food” (not gives, SELLS). He also has me pay guild dues. (No guild dues aren’t required)z . (My brother is 14 years older than I was.) 
---
I ask my brother a 60 mage to help me with my level 20 / Verigan’s Fist quest line, he shows me where the boat is to Theramore. I take the boat to and run from the Barrens to Ashenvale, instead of portaling me, I ghost run for 6 hours trying to find my way. He doesn’t tell me about the “other boat” that literally takes me to the area I need to be at. 
---
Revenge? I make an alt account with a Horde Undead Rogue and camp him while spying on his whereabouts. Oddly enough when he asks me for my help to “hunt this rogue, the rogue is gone only to return in 20 minutes and camp him again.” This went on until the launch of burning Crusade. 
---
I didn’t tell him that rogue was me. Going to name him Mountfood, let’s see if he gets it this time. 
---
I love this game.
---
What do you mean? It‘s only may and this is coming out in the 27th month.
---
+1 and to be honest i doubt many kids will play classic anyway, and if so i dont think the fortnite kids type would play atleast. Spamming and being toxic wont Get you far in wow
---
There will be plenty world PVP to participate in during layering and there will be plenty after.
---
I think we need more info. Its at least conceivable to me that rather than 'fill layer 1 to x players, then layer to to x then layer 3' it might do that the first time and then will try to prioritize 'your' layer and would only move you off of it if yours is over its cap so if there are 4 layers then perhaps each one could sit at 60% capacity regularly rather than layer 4 only ever having players if layer 3 is full
---
BiS comes in sets, something being BiS depends a whole lot on the rest of your stats.
---
For instance, early on, Darkmoon card: Maelstrom is BiS until you get enough DPS, and then Blackhand's Breadth becomes BiS.
---
LOLOLOOOL
---
Yes! Exactly this but make it like Diablo 3's seasons, where once you finish vanilla it copies your character onto a master classic realm, and then your character moves to tbc and the same thing happens.
---
So if you only want to play a specific xpac you can anytime. This also fixes the what happens after naxx issue. Since there will always be a fresh realm.
---
&gt; The thing that frustrates me is that if layers are as large as they say then they'll do little to solve the issue of starter zone bottlenecking 
---
What? How do you figure this? It literally reduces the number of people in an area by 3/4ths with 4 layers....
---
I legit found 4 interviews, I still don’t feel like I have been fed enough info, I need more!
---
I didn't even know Thottbot existed until I was level 40ish, possibly later.
---
Are you really arguing that it's called layering and not sharding? You really have no clue what you're even saying bud
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
---
Vanilla wow came out when I was in college 14 years ago, and did some serious damage to my studies. Now, 14 years later, I'm back in college trying to finish the degree I started, and wow has come back to get me once more. Fall semester starts on the 19th and launch day is the 27th. Oh well, maybe when I'm in my 40s I can finish that degree.
---
Wish it was in July but yesssss!!!
---
Thats on my bday
---
Asking here before I make a main post. What is the REASON behind layering. And no I’m not talking about “oh server pops will be too high and it’ll crash/queue times.”
---
What’s the main reason Blizzard won’t just build more server blades. Are they really trying to save/squeeze that much money out of this.  I understand how sharding/layering and the whole cloud style virtualization shit going. But why are they so against old fashioned hardware servers with zero sharding/layering and normal server caps.
---
If the initial influx of players leaves some servers barren, just transfer those players to an average server and shut the old ones down. Tf?
---
Classy watermark
---
I'm just as happy to see this as the lot of you, but just ....prepare yourself, not as a pun but actually mentally make sure you realize that nostalgia is going to hit hard for a good day or two.  But depending on your level of nostalgia, it's going to wear off *fast* and suddenly this game is going to feel less compelling.
---
Still, I am looking forward to just seeing the places again for a good week before I quit again.
---
&gt;they gave up as was too big a project to make.
---
Yeah, that's why there isn't.
---
Technically the databases have rare mobs listed if you put in the right search query [\(like this one\)](http://classicdb.ch/?npcs&amp;filter=rank=[2];), but listing out the exact spawn rates of them as well is a massive endeavor.
---
Sharding and layering target totally different issues.
---
Sharding was being argued to alleviate launch bottleneck over mobs etc.
---
Layering is being used to eliminate queue times on servers (which honestly caters to streamers more than anything).
---
Layering in the size of 2 to 3k does little to nothing to help with starting zone bottleneck, all it does is split up the game world.
---
They're basically advertising cross-realm server groups with a planned merge as "layering."
---
I prefer Vanilla over retail, but I prefer TBC over Vanilla as well. I'd love actual Burning Crusade servers.
---
Even now I still get tingly on the login screen when I play on private servers.
---
1. The proper way to do it and they CAN do it. Choosing not to do the right thing when you can is pathetic.
---
2. Queues exist for a reason. Learn some patience. Things will die down. Hype stays high because everyone still wants to play. The game isn't going anywhere.
---
3. Nobody asked for 10k+ realms, see #1 with tons of 3-5k realms.
---
Absurdity is claiming a recreation of a classic but releasing a bastardized version and slapping authentic on it. I pay for a quality product representing my experience of the game in 2004. This is a poor representation of that.
---
LMFAO
---
The layering is going to have more people in it than 90% of the realms did in vanilla. It's possible to both enjoy people company while at the same time not liking a mosh pit.
---
Yea exactly lol. Sounds fucking terrible but /shrug

Sorry in advance for lack of knowledge on these matters.
---
Will retail and classic have a shared subscription or separate when the full game releases?
---
And do we know if the game will be available for download before release day? I just dont want to have to wait miss out on a whole day of play time because my download speed is terrible.
---
It’s true but people who graduate in the bottom of the class become overpaid code monkeys which will be outsourced once companies realize what’s going on. That’s more of the point of this post
---
&gt;Your first two complaints are based on an assumption that it's easy to abuse the system and jump between layers. It would be surprising if it's that simple.
---
Unless I'm misunderstanding, it's as simple as accepting a party invite from a player on another layer.

Welcome to most of the world month/day/year
---
What a nice present for my 30th birthday
---
Been waiting a long time for this! So excited
---
I understand for a low pop server with huge queue times why people feel this way.  For me, my realm never had more than 10 minute wait times. And yes, it was the reason I lost interest because I spent 1000s of hours gaining a reputation on my realm.  What was done in BGs translated into other aspects of the world.
---
If they are going to cap out at 3500 then there is no reason to layer. It actually might be more stress that’s on the server. The populations are going to be much bigger and their will typically be 2 full layers on almost every world AT LEAST on the day of launch. After then, the amount of layers used will only lower.
---
What about private servers? We're discussing authenticity here.
---
They share a subscription. A WoW subscription lets you play modern and classic.
---
AFAIK there are no details on pre-downloading.
---
Original sentiment was good but your edit makes you look like a bitter whiny old man.
---
If you merge servers then players may not keep their name, etc.. The whole point of layering is such that you are having "multiple servers" at launch and will "merge" them once the initial population rush dies down. Therefore, you merge them and do not lose your name.
---
Really? And missing the launch moment. Okay...
---
It’ll be fine. I promise.
---
I'd say stay in game as much as you can. If you find you simply *cannot* figure out what a quest is trying to ask you to do then turn to...
---
Thottbot? wonder what the new resource will be....
---
As best as you can, try to *enjoy* the questing. There's some remarkably interesting stories in there.
---
That’s the 26th’s night.
---
It means guilds can’t attack other guilds on the way to raids
---
It means you can sell invites to layers with better resources or rare spawns that hunters want to tame
---
It means it can and WILL be taken advantage of
---
*cries in United States*
---
Doesn't change that they didnt make it into the gamefiles until patch 3.x, so the earliest we could see them make a return would be if they revamped TBC and subsequently WotLK :p
---
there will def be apps to abuse layers you wont need to relog
---
&gt; what they are making is a retail version of classic.
---
If you haven't figured this out since their first interview then that's on you bud. If been obvious from the beginning that it's going to be classic but built on the retail engine.
---
Devaluing how? I'm pretty sure the definition of value in wow differs across players.
---
&gt;Trying to level but this group of Horde keeps ganking you in STV? Np bro just log out and log back in, boom new layer.
---
No, you never leave the same layer unless you join a group
---
&gt;Trying to make some gold? Just go camp Black Lotus and keep relogging to get on different layers.
---
Again
---
Because my work contract last till the end of August, so I will have the time to grind like hell before my new job! &gt;:D
---
I hope you’re right and would love a source for this
---
You don’t get moved off a layer to deal with load. So that would not happen.
---
I thought the badges were fine actually. The only thing I ever bought with them was fire resist for Leotharas The Blind, raiding gear was just better.
---
Or you could have it first come first serve of release day?
---
The only thing I'm bummed about is that i though i would have a classic summer, not a classic fall. But lets be real, student have it good anyway. None of my classes have ever required attendance apart from labs and seminars. Play until 3 in the morning and then skip the first 2 classes and show up by lunch. I had way more free time in Uni than i ever had working, especially considering that i didn't have to commute for 3 hours a day like i have to with work.
---
&gt; If that's the case, John will simply go play another game.
---
This attitude is what caused WoW to stop being the thing WoW Classic is supposed to be in the first place. What are you going to advocate for next, dungeon queues? After all, that John guy is impatient and he'd rather click a button to find a group than interact with people.
---
Well, its sold out apparently.
---
Nah
---
Yuuuup. I've been traveling for a year and a half so no problem there! Also tail end of summer so I can get everything fun in before hand!
---
Staysafe said in his stream you get assigned a random new layer when you log in.
---
Why are you saying that it will be unavailable for them... it’s not like they won’t be able to play. I just don’t understand why we’re all of a sudden expecting to have students and teachers be able to spend their summer playing WoW... they can play like the rest of us... when they have free time.
---
And I will have started a family a couple months before the release so no, I also won’t have a ton of time to play either.
---
Guys like OP haven’t played original wow or pservers. They act like they know what’s best for all players without even being the target demographic
---
And unfortunately these idiots are everywhere. It seems they’re the loud minority and they support Blizzard no matter how stupid their decisions are
---
Fanboys will cheer as Blizzard runs every franchise into the ground
---
Phasing is entirely different than sharding/layering. Phasing is when the world changes due to some variable, like finishing some quest that unlocks the next part of the zone. Cataclysm had a lot of phasing.
---
Many times I tried jury-rigging up a controller.
---
Never worked that well.
---
These days I want to play it in VR. God what I wouldn't give...
---
It's honestly been over a decade since I've thought about it, but probably. I never probed that hard since at the time I was in a guild stuck on the Twin Emperor's and when I rolled to join a better guild I wasn't asking about AQ progress as a new recruit. I just have this distinct memory of someone saying they thought it was possible but needed perfect execution (and over a decade ago so very possibly they said good luck and perfect execution).
---
That leads us to now where we know more about the game and you can get better groups and that makes me wonder. I got top 10 kills in Naxx after I re-rolled and I was in the raids in sketchy gear and there were certainly sub par players in some spots so it would be interesting to see if an insane super guild could pull it off now.
---
Give it any level of value you want and then lower it. That’s how.
---
While true, that doesn't change that the flying mounts in this collector's edition (for the 15th anniversary) won't be carrying over to Classic.
---
Same. It’s killing my hype so hard
---
He is incorrect
---
how does not having a queue time cater to streamers more then you or i? id almost argue it helps normal players more since streamers generally have all day to wait in queue whereas normal people have to play around a work schedule and whatnot so sitting in queue for hours would limit them even more. and yeah sharding would have been better for the initial starting zones but blizzard might have a reason for using using layering instead. its a good way to deal with the uncertainty they have with how popular it will be and the realm pops and whatnot, also itll just make it feel more immersive then seeing people randomly vanish. both systems have their ups and downs
---
Goodbye doing anything other than work and WoW lol
---
i second this
---
And you know this how? You were at the meeting in Irvine too?
---
Well you can't really blame people. If they didn't want to mess up with peoples hype they would have said late summer, instead of calling it a "classic summer" when it's right at the end of summer, when everybody have to go to work/school.
---
You will fai. You, me, everyone will be doomed once again!
---
R.I.P. world pvp, and say hello to people selling invites to better layers, people logging in/out to escape ganks, basically people mass exploiting the layering system.
---
This is WORSE than sharding the entry zones. 
---
This is quite possibly the most immersion-destroying thing they could’ve come up with
---
I think they will get rid of the layers faster than even they think. The point of them is to avoid some other problems (like server queues, dead servers after people fall off, etc) so if they see that there are only 2000 people above level 20, they may drop all 20+ players into a single layer together and merge other players into that layer as they hit 20+ etc. It will be something they are constantly looking at and constantly assessing IMHO
---
I dont think it will last all the way to phase 2 on most servers.
---
....And they're selling their pre-orders on ebay for 500.
---
Oh, sorry, I thought we were exchanging opinions. Next time I'll make sure to speak for what's objectively best for everyone.
---
All TBC at level 60 please.

---
Says it about half way down the page.
---
Name your kid after green jesus.
---
LMFAO!
---
Or just merge realms like normal whenever populations dip below a certain threshold.
---
There is still NO reason to create 3 or 4 layers per realm
---
good thing Aug 26 is on a Monday as we will probably celebrate it that weekend prior, leaving that entire first week free
---
One for Martin. Two for Martin!
---
jesus christ you're both being dumb af
---
you wont be able to keep relogging to get into a different layer because there will likely only be 1-3 layers per server, so you wont be able to spam relog for new layers like you could with cross realm zones. also layering will be gone starting phase 2 at the LATEST, its likely going to be gone before then
---
Is that how they said they're splitting up the layers though? My first thought is that they would do a round robin approach where each server initially has X layers, and when person 1 logins they are put in layer 1, person 2 in layer 2, person X in layer X, person X+1 in layer 1, and so on, and add additional layers if all initial layers are pop capped. Not necessarily exactly like that, but something similar to have the pops between layers naturally balanced.

Tipsouts interview of Ion
---
I have been watching this all day.
---
Well, we will be able to name our characters on August 13th, so I think at some point we will be able to download the client on or before that date.
---
Y good 4 u, but in my case, my courses start a week after Classic comes out and because of dat I wont have time to play it like I wanted to, if they released it early August I would atleast have a month to grind to 60 and get pre-bis gear
---
I really know a guy named Dale who lives in the North
---
That is a good point. I was never one to take down the names of people I ran into throughout the world unless I added them to my friends list. 
---
I can appreciate that some people so keep track of others they meet, so that could definitely be a bummer. 
---
Hopefully they do the layering correctly. It will be awful if we dont anyone on our way to 60 because the numbers per layer were off. I would much rather be able to continue to quest rather than compete for mobs/items with too many people around, but we are all allowed our own preferences and unfortunately some of us won't agree with their approach.  
---
I hope this doesn't ruin your experience and you still enjoy the game !

As a father of twins, I can honestly say that having a newborn is the BEST time to play games during parenthood. Yeah, you'll be at the hospital for a few days, as long as things go well. But they sleep for 18-20 hours a day. You will have plenty of time to enjoy some classic!
---
boohoo.
---
I think with specific raid comps and absolute max level of consumes and skill its doable. I wanna see someone try.
---
Because that's when it'll be done. 
---
Unless you want them to wait until it's good for you?
---
Not sure what you don’t understand. There will be 3 times the supply of items in the realm and also 3 times the demand.
---
Not to mention, it would be an unique chance to claim a World's First on a boss from over a decade ago.
---
Wave this in front of the top guilds, I bet they can smell the blood.
---
I explained what it is.
---
Im also not your buddy, pal
---
And an Onyxia pin
---
it's like being in a booming party and everyone is having fun and enjoying eachothers company, almost everyone knows during expansion releases (i can only speak for tbc and wrath before crossrealm sharding shit) that if you want to relax while leveling you wait a few days for it to die down a little bit
---
&gt;And unfortunately these idiots are everywhere. It seems they’re the loud minority and they support Blizzard no matter how stupid their decisions are
---
unfortunately they aren't the minority
---
From what I read this won’t even last until phase 2. So who the hell cares
---
id play retail if i want new content
---
bc is the only content after classic i want
---
Im just talking about the initial launch, you know that part where everyone is level 1 rushing around in the starter zones and its all hectic and stuff? I didnt realise people are complaining about playing all summer, thats ridiculous tbh, they should not have had such expectations, especially if your a kid going to school lmao.
---
Seems like we were both talking about two different things here. 
---
Congrats on that family business tho.
---
Good catch. I meant layering.
---
They are going to have to test it, but it's not complicated. Same authentication server very likely.
---
Looks like its just PvE, PvP and RP for now.
---
&gt; **Will there be dedicated servers for Roleplaying on Classic?** On larger regions there will be Normal, PVP, and RP realms available on launch. There are no current plans for RP-PVP realms. These plans are subject to change.
---
I mean maybe but I can't even imagine the leaps of faith you would have to make to come up with some sort of conversion formula.
---
We will see if, afterall, the "casualization" of WoW was due to bad Blizzard decisions or they did in fact listened to the vocal population and followed their sugestions.
---
The idea is a lot of people are simply tourists. For example, let's say you have 10 servers (I am just picking a number here) and after a month "only" 5 servers are decently populated, you would eventually have to merge the other five. Layering allows them to only have five servers to begin with, and when the initial zerg is gone, you can merge the layers and still only have five servers. This means players who want to play on the same server won't have to change their name or guild on a server merge.
---
To avoid exactly having to transfer players to a different server from the one they started in (like wtf solution would that be) if they have more servers than necessary and to avoid overpopulation at launch. resources and mobs are not shared, it would be impossible to do any leveling
---
Remember when sharding was ONLY supposed to be in the starting zones for the first two weeks? Now it's for the entire first content phase all over the map. This is a huge letdown and a big step back for classic, make it known we don't want layering past a certain point especially for high population pvp zones such as STV.
---
I’m gonna gank your little brother then message him I liked his drawing
---
Games not even being made with you in mind, you're just a bonus
---
It's a better solution than sharding, but if I'm gonna stand at the same location as other friends, and I'm not going to be able to see them because I'm on a different layer... that's gonna suck. 
---
I would much rather be in a queue for over an hour to be honest.
---
Agree.
---
Honestly if layering is as bad as it sounds, pservers can steal the legit values by datamining and then they’ll offer legit servers with no layering. 
---
I can’t believe after 15 years pservers might STILL have better immersion than actual classic
---
It's the developers answering the question.  I agree, I would like a blue post describing the full logistics to how layering works.
---
Thank you. I feel much better now..LOL
---
I am NOT pro-layer but there has been 2 things mentioned:
---
a) Ion has quoted as saying it won't exist in Phase 2 and onwards
---
b) The layering is only for initial wave - HOPEFULLY, this means a coupe weeks TOPS.
---
If it lasts the whole phase, I'd be pretty bummed but that's where feedback comes into play. Let's make our voices heard. If Layers are going to happen, the best we can ask for is for it to be severely limited to the first initial wave (i.e. 2-3 weeks). Having Layers for a whole phase (estimated to be maybe 3-4 months) would suck.
---
Agreed
---
Broke my heart man.
---
That would have nothing to do with the actual game client though. If there were issues it would be on the battle.net people to fix within the battle.net site, the WoW team wouldn’t really be able to do anything there.
---
It’s only for the first month. So it’s unlikely that guilds will be on their way to raids.
---
Sure, and with respect to what you said I 100% agree with you. Layering is better than having extraneous servers that will eventually merge.
---
because progression and powercreep tend to be the same thing.
---
I would like it if some of the weaker specs could get some good gear (not better than everyone else, but just good gear too)
---
Streamers are most heavily effected by queue times because their presence causes population growth. You or I can just hop to another lower pop server and play there, streamers bring the population.
---
Do you have to be subbed to be able to be picked for the beta? I know that you're able to opt-in without a subscription, but what about being picked?
---
wait - you live \*next to or your house \*is the daycare?

This is Diablo Immortal all over again. Blizz acting like this is what’s best.
---
How inexpensive must it be to buy a few more server blades and not pay for any software creation of layering? Yet this idiotic company goes ahead with the approach that will destroy immersion.
---
I just don’t understand how Blizz keeps running their franchises into the ground
---
It doesn’t have a good anything quest hub. Awful for Allies too
---
server A - layer 1 - layer 2 - layer 3 - layer 4 - layer 5 etc
---
this could easily be solved with 5 realms instead of this stupid shit allowing people to go to other "layers", it's needlessly complicated and fucking retarded, everyone who played vanilla or during an expansion pack release that you had to wait in queue always, why is blizzard catering to kids that don't actually care about the game
---
the only reason they're doing this layer shit is because they're scared that if they make too many realms they will cost too much and not have enough players (which is solved by merging), they're already letting people reserve names so how is that relevant
---
new blizzard is a real piece of work
---
They’re throwing out sharing for layering so you’ll be waiting in que for quest mobs like everyone else.
---
They're saying layers will be 2-3k players large, that's still as much as 700 players in the most crowded starting zones at launch. Is that not crowded af?
---
No, it really didn't.
---
&gt; But why are they so against old fashioned hardware servers with zero sharding/layering and normal server caps. 
---
Did you play back during Vanilla? 
---
Closing down a server and moving players was a very long and tedious process. 
---
First, they would have to identify a server that needed to be shut down and merged. Just because a server is medium/low pop, doesn't mean that they should disband it. What if that community is happy with the size overall? Make sense right? 
---
Then they would have to inform players what the process was happening. Usually Blizzard would come out and say, "Hey, we are shutting down server A. You have two weeks to pick a server between B-F to transfer your character to. Otherwise we will do it for you. Sorry about that." 
---
Then after that time period the server would shut down and transfers would be complete. On Blizzard's end it wasn't as simple as moving a file from here to there and calling it quits. They had to put work into it. On top of that, there are bound to be problems with transfers in general. Players losing stuff in the move isn't unheard of. 
---
Not to mention that it would upend communities entirely. Let's say you were happy with your server, but now you're forced to change. Suddenly you're in a brand new community of people you don't even know. That feels bad. I wouldn't be surprised if they found that players would stop playing after a transfer like that. 
---
The end goal here is to use their new tech to give players the benefit of always having a full community without all the negatives that come with servers that don't do well. 
---
This is all just conjecture though.
---
It's lasting like 2 weeks.
---
Dont be a moron.
---
lol @ all these ppl whinging about school.
---
Interesting, so lets say I made a character, I get put on layer/shard 1 and my friend on layer/shard 2. He invites me to a party and I get sent to his layer 2. We meet some good players, we grouped for a bit but then I have to call it off for the night. Next day, when I log on I'm once again back on my "home" shard 1 and if I want to see either my friend or the other nice players from shard 2 I need to wait for my friend to log back in and wait for him to invite me back to "his" shard 2 right? Seems intersesting and a really clever way to make the zones not too crouded
---
Yo. 
---
A Tuesday?
---
You have 3 months notice....
---
Because they aren't close to finished. Just watching Alpha footage from today there are still tons of bugs and inconsistencies. It would be a trainwreck if they released the game like this.
---
It's going to suck hard. Part of what made WoW great to me was re-encountering people that were progressing similar to me. I might not add them the first time I see them, or even really talk to them. But if I saw them again then there's a much bigger chance I would. If there are layers then you've got a much higher chance of just seeing random people instead of the ones you saw before.
---
it's much better than sharding...
---
You left out the part where you sound like a giant tool on the internet. That's a very important part.
---
RemindMe! One year
---
Winter time for me. My older kid just put in preschool and my toddler is on the waiting list. Husband busy at school. I've signed up for next year when my kids will both be in preschool. Oh hell yeah, I will have a whole shit tonne of free time until next February. Bring it on!! Milo and WoW on a cold winter day,  CANT WAIT.
---
I mean, you'll have all of phase 1 to do that stuff. The game isn't going to be that full of content for the first however many months phase 1 lasts. I understand the desire to blaze through it but there's not much there past leveling in phase 1. Maybe by your winter breaks there will be more going on.
---
I'm not sure that there was a good solution that would please everyone, but I think there were certainly better solutions than sharding-not-sharding.
---
An open beta period would have helped a ton with the need for sharding, for example, and would certainly catch more bugs than a small closed beta limited to bfa streamers and bfa subscribers can hope to.
---
Hell, most of the tourist problem they're trying to fix with ~~sharding~~  layering is self inflicted because they are insisting on a shared sub to try to cushion subscriber numbers between retail content drops.  And those dipping subscriber numbers are just another example of them doing something to themselves and then making classic deal with their bullshit stop-gap solution.  If you make your game so that someone who plays for an hour a week can easily see all the content, you can't expect someone who plays 20 hours/week to pay a monthly sub every week when you're dropping 4 hours of content every 3+ months.  If you want that money every month, you need to give people something to do, and I don't mean dailies.
---
The whole classic launch feels like a rehash of WotLK where they were trying to force arena as an esport so they started to make PVP balance changes that the larger PvE community had to deal with.  Any time they want to stop shooting themselves in the foot and then making it the players' problems would be great.
---
I'm just happy because I'll be back from my deployment by then. Glad Classic isn't going to release while I'm stuck in this shithole.
---
You must be trolling.
---
But if layers are going to be as many players as they say they are, isn't it likely that a SS vs TM battle would be happening on each layer? My understanding (correct me if I'm wrong) is that layers are going to be about the size of old vanilla servers, so a given layer should have those battles happening as frequently as they would if it was instead 3x the amount of servers that then merged later?
---
Other than the actual ability to join the battle via grouping (which is its own discussion), how is this any different than an epic battle happening on Ragnaros that you can't join because you're on Moonguard?
---
So, depending on how big a shard.. uhm layer will be..
---
when i join a guild that is on a different layer, i leave a few thousend people behind and join a completely "new" pop?!
---
It’s sad man. We waited so long only for them to implement layering.
---
Icing on the cake? It was probably more expensive for them to pay for software teams to create layering, than it would’ve been to just buy some more server blades.
---
Blizzard is dead
---
you can 'not rush to 60' wether there's shards or not.
---
and when it come to enjoying sitting on your thumbs fighting against 40 other people to tag a quest mob... you are part of a very, very, very small minority that blizz would be wise to ignore.
---
by 'cream' i suppose you mean those who will play 24 hours non-stop in order to get ahead of the curve so they don't have to compete for spawn?
---
Hey man, whatever works, works. I too suffer from depression and overwhelming anxiety. I am heavily looking forward to Classic for more social time with other humans without having to go outside and actually interact with people who I just don't often get along with. We all have our problems, dont be ashamed of them 26 August 2019, lets go home!
---
People think that there is going to be similar respawn rates to the incredibly broken private server ones. 
---
Hint: it’s not. Takes minutes for some mobs to respawn.
---

By being invited by friends or other players who are on other layers
---
Man - layering, phasing, sharding...what happened to just logging into a world and that's it?
---
The best guilds got him to like 28% pre nerf from what i remember
---
But that doesn't only mean do 28% more damages to boss, it also means doing another tentacle spawn phase.
---
Anything that destroys immersion this much and can be exploited by groups and guilds is *never* smart or a good idea.
---
*You can just merge regular servers when they get low enough population.*
---
There’s no need to layer.
---
“BFA will be fine it’s only an alpha”
---
Two servers that are earmarked for merging with each other would share one name database. Basically I'm proposing the same thing as the layers... but without sharding.
---
We are getting that in Phase 2 at the latest. This is just so we don't have "dead" servers after a month.
---
I mean, that's what happens every new expansion right? Some people continue to play their "main character" that starts on the previous expansion's max level and just play the new content
---
That makes sense.
---
Yikes haha  
---
Thanks for the clarity.
---
from the last information I heard they were going to consider it but had not yet confirmed that they would.
---
It was some bug fixes, reduced the number and frequency of tentacles spawns and also a nerf to health and damages of tentacles.
---
like?
---
if you are playing with your friend, you will naturally group with them.. voila, same shard.
---
raiding with your guild? shame shard.
---
instanced PvP? instanced.
---
I've yet to ear a single argument against sharding that worth something. nevermind actually outweight the pros of sharding.
---
HAHAHHAA fuck the baby , get that toon maxed br0
---
Layering will kill the game if it’s in there on release 
---
It will immediately be exploited by guilds and players to farm mobs, resources and rarespawns
---
Not to mention it will kill immersion when people can just logout/login to escape pvp
---
I'm not discounting Blizzard fully.  They could have decent intentions, but with how this all was revealed to us, I just instantly distrust them.
---
Oh hell yeah but its doable. 4 times that at 2800 players is impossibly ridiculous.
---
While I don’t know how meaningful the number will be compared to the number of players there will be at launch, having the sub requirement gives you a better idea that everyone who signs up is probably serious about playing. If everyone can make characters for free then there will be a lot of people that aren’t actually gonna play and meaninglessly inflates their numbers. This also presents the bullshit problem that somebody that never intended to play takes your name without having ever subbed. Which also introduces the thing that would 100% happen (and still probably will tbf, but less likely and slightly less sheisty in any case) that people will claim names to sell.
---
It doesn't fix the overpopulation problem since there will be 3k players per continent all playing together.
---
this is why you dont get married and get life cucked. lol!
---
Victim blaming lol, it’s a computer game. Grow up
---
Must be one of the fanboys
---
There was this one horde rogue that I pretty much leveled from 52-56 with. I was an alliance hunter and we killed each other so fucking much
---
The thing is, in TBC atleast, many things were developed with flying mounts in mind. The cipher of damnation questlines comes to mind, or the entire tempest keep dungeons/raid. WOTLK had this also, think of storm peaks or ice crown.
---
No fun allowed.
---
Yea because you can play wow when you have a young one... that was JUST born. LOL someone's gona be in for a treat regarding the amount of time a new born takes.
---
Bro. I got mayonnaise on my dick. You think I care? I call it a dick sandwich with cheese. Guess what the cheese is
---
“Sacrifice”
---
&gt; Honestly, layering being continent wide isnt gonna do much to help the starting zone issues. 
---
"This fix doesn't 100% fix our problem. It only fixes our problem by 60%. So let's not do anything at all."
---
That doesn't make sense to me, although it's a very common human perception so maybe that's why you said it.
---
It's really not that complicated. Take a deep breathe and think about this. Why have multiple (extraneous) servers that will most likely not have high population after a month or so when you can have fewer, fuller servers? The layering will exist for Phase 1 at the longest. I'd imagine after a month or so layering would not really be prevalent since most of the zerg would have already stopped playing by level 30 or so.
---
Oh so just ignore all the devs that they interviewed, because the interviewer streams, k
---
Lol what.
---
Your wife will be recovering for a few weeks and you will have to get her everything. The baby will get gas and you play the guess how to make it stop crying game. Then you're going to post delivery checkups. You're wife is stressed because she has to feed the baby every few hours on top of trying to teach it how to breast feed which is actually hard to do. You're not just going to come home and everyone will be sleeping lol.. it's going to be hard. Everyone forgets.. That's why you have multiple.. I remember because mine is 6 weeks old..
---
nah i did too. and i dont play retail at all.
---
You're free to feel like shit for the next few days then forget I suggested anything
---
drastically different lmao. its the same tech literally. too much people in same place = shard.
---
It wasnt only bugs, the nerfs were also numbers.
---
Because it destroys immersion, something that is integral to the Classic WoW experience, and because it can be ruthlessly exploited by guilds and players to farm resources mobs and rare spawns, further increasing their lead ahead of average Joe
---
And to think - regular merging servers and buying some more server blades would cost peanuts in 2019.
---
They fucked up with this approach
---
Yeah, I heard somewhat similar numbers, so yeah I really don't have a clue but would be really interested to see if it was actually truly impossible or just practically impossible (C'thun was before server transfers too so every guild had some number of not great players I think).
---
But I can't give anything useful on that since C'thun is one of a handful of fights I didn't see pre nerf so it's just pure curiosity.
---
What of server sizes don't drop to reasonable levels, will there be forced server splits?
---
try doing the starting zone with 1000 players next to you and we'll see if you change your mind about the phase 1 layering
---
They could’ve done this without layering.
---
&gt; But if layers are going to be as many players as they say they are, isn't it likely that a SS vs TM battle would be happening on each layer?
---
Those battles are totally random; there's no correlative mechanism between layers for stuff like that.  Furthermore, it's not just about the big battles.  It's about _anything_ that can happen in the game world.
---
Server decoherence is totally antithetical to an MMO.  Even Ion said as much at Blizzcon.
---
&gt; how is this any different than an epic battle happening on Ragnaros that you can't join because you're on Moonguard?
---
Because, in this context, you're not on Moonguard-- you're on Ragnaros.
---
I would be fine with new content as long as existing content is being thoroughly beaten. Once guilds have naxx on farm, what more does the game have to offer? You can't expect an MMO to hold interest for years to come without increasing content, hence TBC, WOTLK, etc.

UK is 11pm BST on 26th.
---
its not for phase 1. its for whenever there are too many players in the same place. its a huge assumption that such scenario will only occur in phase 1.
---
One of the parts of DBT (an emotion regulation thing that helps people fight depression) is finding a life worth living and I think something like Warcraft can definitely qualify!  If you enjoy it look forward to it!
---
They will in Classic because there is nothing else new.
---
Play what you find fun because it's a big investment unlike retail. People picked CLASSES to play and not individual specializations although swapping specs did cost a lot. Each class had its strengths and weaknesses. Look up some of the gameplay since classes back then were a lot more unique than they are now.
---
No matter how you chalk up "Layering" it is the same as sharding, at a grander scale.
---
Aside  from the player experience, the economy within phase 1 is going to be  devastated by botters/gold farmers, World PvP will be awkward,  communication will be restricted to your layer... It is very convenient  to move between layers; what happens when you get ganked
---
"Sharding"  was only supposed to be within the starter zones, now "layering" aka  sharding is going to be across an entire continent that may be 2 weeks -  1 month or even up to 5-6 months when Phase 2 comes out.
---
Beyond disappointed... really kills my hype for release.
---
Aye, nae takers [https://youtu.be/reR1YFFCx08?t=65](https://youtu.be/reR1YFFCx08?t=65)
---
Only 10,000 people saw it though
---
It's an actual mmorpg.
---
welp, there goes classic being good. fuck this shit
---
I was pretty sure it was like how I said.  I'm probably not paying enough attention to phasing stuff to notice when it happens.
---
I know for a fact summons are disabled while in combat.
---
man i am so glad $15 isnt a lot of money to me anymore
---
Slow your fucking logic there bud, this sub is for retards.
---
I feel this. 
---
The real test is will I be productive during the summer break and plan for the fall semester well in advance or will I spend it looking up builds, routes, and guides for my character?
---
It is human nature for starters, and I think mass communication like this can easily spawn misinformation and unrest easier. 
---
Instead of throwing a guy in the crowd throwing a tomato (or [maybe a chair](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cIuTPKpQjI4)), it's a guy throwing a message. 
---
Perhaps it's a genuine misunderstanding. Perhaps they're really upset. Perhaps they are just trolling. Hard to say.
---
Clip missing. Plus, I'm really not assuming anything until I actually hear from Blizzard on this.
---
&gt; Also why the downvote? Can't we have a discussion without being malicious?
---
I'm not downvoting, fyi. 
---
You could just wear the actual armor though. You don't need transmog for that. If you want to look like a peasant, wear peasant clothes. You might not be as powerful anymore, but that makes perfect sense. If you want to show off your cool armor set, wear it.
---
Indeed.  I wasn't opposed to sharding in the first or even second zones.  But they said specifically we would have it for rare resources and later zones.  Yet here we are.
---
I'm not that chaffed about it, but it will have a huge impact on the economy, particularly going from phase 1 to 2 (or from layering to no layering).
---
I don't know how technically feasible it would even be to just shard early zones and not the whole continents, but it seems like it would have solved the same problems without causing the economic issues.
---
I will have a newborn Son 1 month earlier ... I srsly hope my wife can look after him for a while each day haha XD
---
It could involve, for example, off-spec gear that's worse than Naxx/AQ40 gear, but still worthwhile for those specs since they weren't represented in vanilla. Rare mounts/pets. Pre-existing consumables. etc.
---
Hmmm, thanks for the info!
---
If you think layering is good news, just wait till you actually login and see endless global chat prompts selling invites to empty / new layers.
---
Guilds will abuse it, players will abuse it, all to get better resource farming, mobs and rare spawns.
---
The worst of all: it will kill immersion. People in front of you logging in/out to escape pvp, vanishing into a new layer.
---
Layering will make Classic not feel like Classic at all
---
Wife.  Scarlet Monestary run.  She had to remove me from /ignore when she joined the group.
---
Yea wotlk is trash imo. You just use dungeon finder to level with barely any risk of dying because they made everything too easy. Its boring
---
Good job man! Slow and steady wins the race. You can do it! &lt;3
---
As if there will be a "you're number 1438.72 in the queue"-experience.
---
No. I hated that shit for the most part. There is nothing fun about a jailbreak run that lasts hours and ultimately fails to succeed. And these off-specs aren't 85% solution builds that are just a little off. That came with BC and everything after. The specs were poorly balanced and unplayable. It's not minmax - it's viable and not-viable. And fun? Nothing is less fun than being left on the sideline when you want to run group content. Heck, talent choice was arguably MORE important then than now. When I was a hunter main I was fairly competent - but it was hard to find groups when there are just SO many hunters. This time? If I play more than a just a little bit I'll main a warrior, priest, or mage. Fun is important but MMOs play by different rules - other people matter.
---
Dragon Isles.
---
&gt; What was done in BGs translated into other aspects of the world.
---
Right, on this we agree (mostly). I know full well how small changes can have unintended negative consequences on the community so I understand that it is a legitimate concern.
---
But I just really disagree with it being that big of a deal. Reputations weren't forged in BGs then translated to the world, but the opposite. And x-realms didn't mean there were endless waves of faceless players, the same avid pvpers still showed up because it was only a handful of servers, so still 7 of 20 players would be on your realm. BG reputation was still very much part of the experience.
---
Obviously everyone should follow the academic calendar not the real calendar seasons.
---
can we keep him away from classic please?
---
That was indeed lucky for you :)
---
It's hard to exploit without us knowing more about it though. Like guilds would need their members to leave, and then hope people are on different layers and cycle through people in specific orders.         
---
Merging servers ends in people losing their names, and the MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT EVERYONE IS BITCHING ABOUT LAYERING, people's IDENTITY. Oh you were on server 1 and you have a rivalry with guild X or person Z? Sucks, welcome to this realm that you've never interacted before.          
---
Layering at least would let you be able to deal with people for the servers lifetime, albeit that initially you might not always see some people
---
Fuck me... I have nothing going on that week but I’ll sound upset to sympathize with everyone!
---
Is anyone asking for 10k population servers?
---
Make a bunch of servers with populations between 3-5k. There's one world, everyone deals with the two weeks of launch rush, of there are population issues than Blizzard selectively merges servers or moves players.
---
Classic solutions for a classic experience.
---
Do you hear that? That is the sound of "no changes" goalposts moving lol.

---
Dynamic spawns are much easier to abuse though, since you can keep timers on everything compared to keeping time on layers that you have no idea which is which
---
Participants. It says participants. You're not a participant until you've already been invited.
---
Lol when you can’t make any good games, you just re-release the old ones!
---
Blizzard could’ve just made more servers
---
Layering isn’t needed to merge servers. Can merge normally after populations dip below a certain threshold.
---
Layering destroys immersion and the alternative is so simple. 
---
Blizzard in 2019 is mindboggling. This is Diablo Immortal all over again
---
Layering will already share one name database. They are all on the same server already.
---
Emerald Dream used to be one of the largest servers ever bro.
---
&gt; but a date further back means more time for the devs which in turn means it wont be rushed
---
This makes no sense. What date is the date where it won't be rushed? Why don't we push it back to 2020 so it can be the best it can be, no?
---
Level to 60 without killing anything! Can it even be done? IDK, you should find out
---
Of course its hard. I never said it was easy. Im not sure how the birth of your child went, but even with multiple babies, it was nearly what you are making it out to be. I don't consider myself an expert parent, but having twin babies gives you a completely different perspective on it all. Your time to play will be less that when you didnt have a kid, but when you compare it to them being able to walk around, open doors, talk, etc, its not even a comparison. Playing during the newborn stage will be easier and more consistent.
---
Bro get off the horse before it pukes. It’s a memejoke, must be older than you at this point. Dear lord
---
Do you write down the names of everyone on your server? I barely noticed who I played with on server until Max level...and usually it was guildies anyway!
---
Probably just free server transfers as they've done before
---
I wouldn't actually care about the subscription requirement if I *knew* I could get into the beta. I don't want to play retail and I also don't want to gamble buying subscription time on getting into the beta, especially when they said the beta will be small.
---
they'll move the goalposts yet again. They've done it three times already
---
I like how the people saying to relax are the echo chamber when the sub is flooded with people crying about this being the death of WoW...
---
There will be raids after the first week. You underestimate how hardcore the scene is. Google the timeline of pservers for examples
---
Of course we do! You stole it from us.
---
You are asking for login queues. Which is why they are layering to avoid. I thought you knew that. If you are asking for login queues there's not really much to discuss. They said 'No' to that from the very beginning. This system literally exists to get rid of them. It's fine that you have a different preference, its just, that discussion is kind of over, they already said no.
---
The screeching over the release date has made an august release better than early.
---
I don't think we'd see that unless people would be willing to fork over money for more expansions.
---
I went one step further and straight up handed in my notice.
---
fuck off plz
---
They can never let somethings die.
---
&gt; Taking 2 hours to complete a single quest is not my idea of "enjoying the ride"
---
Ok, I do. Why is my enjoyment any less valid than yours?
---
... so?
---
it's not like you'll never see them again, the guilds don't change , the PvP squad don't change...
---
you might actually be able to quest in redridge after the first 2 week because one of the 4 layer won't have a demi-raid of lvl 60 ganking lvl 15... THE HORROR!
---
When was xx/08/xx summer og anything 😖
---
I know. I was not suggesting an innovation in that regard. He was asking how it was that a server merge *wouldn't* result in a name change, and the answer is exactly that: just like layering.
---
Can someone make a 1920x1080 version? Would really appreciate it!
---
I will come to crater and take crater.
---
And this is how both versions of WoW will perpetuate each other.
---
8.2 -&gt; 3 months later -&gt; Classic release -&gt; 3 months later -&gt; 8.3 -&gt; 3 months later -&gt; Classic phase 2 -&gt; 3 months later -&gt; New WoW Expo -&gt; 3 months later -&gt; Classic phase 3.
---
Etc etc
---
This also raises, and probably maintains, the culmative WoW sub numbers at all time high.
---
It destroys immersion, and therefore destroys the game experience so many of us have been looking forward to, at the most crucial time when the game world is liveliest
---
Welp that's life. *You can't always get what you want*
---
Yea but i dont know that it would be the same on classic. Im not knocking it. I just dont think the audience is there. RP is a dying breed.
---
What a let down
---
Yeah I get that, but I’m wondering if I have to have BFA also to be considered for beta, cuz I haven’t bought BFA

Pserver leveling will be tame compared to the shit show that will be classic leveling. We’ll all be in que for quest mobs constantly.
---
I first played Horde in MoP as a Fem Orc Warrior, never looked back.
---
This is the better solution if it's the only solution.  But that seems like you're just constraining your analysis to come to this specific conclusion.  
---
In short; why couldn't they stick to their original vision of sharding only in the starting zones as opposed to the entire content?  Why did they go back on their promise that you wouldn't have sharding that affected things like rich thorium veins?
---
For like 2 servers.  WoD and Legion were smooth as hell for the vast majority of the playerbase.  Even BfA was fairly smooth with the exception of a single US battle group which is still having issues.
---
So is Brad just chilling as a ghost on Layer 1 near where Zoe is being killed and telling you when she rezzes so you can be invited back and kill her again? And that's all he's doing? Man I wish I had slaves like you do, that would be dope.
---
Then I die over and over in Westfall and don’t have enough gold for repairs so I kite mobs to the guards for copper
---
Just because they made their decision doesn't mean that they're not wrong and negatively impacting the classic experience. Add additional servers, lower pop servers never had queue time issues. If you want to play on the same server as Sodapoppin join the queue like the rest of the fanboys.
---
I won't have enough information till I'm literally playing the game.
---
The diamond industry wants a word.
---
Think of it this Way. If they want 3k population servers and 12k people pick the same server, that's 4 layers of 3k people. If it is split 50/50 alliance/horde, you are looking at 1500 alliance players being visible from the start. Now Obviously some will pick gnome, human, dwarf, and Night elf, but it is by no means split evenly. Human starting zone will be packed so bad, you may struggle to even tag mobs.
---
Im not sure what the numbers will be on server total capacity/layer capacity but of course it solves overpopulation. we know that on launch a lot of people are going to try classic and then slowly abandon as the hype dies, so until the population stabilizes of course it helps to spread players into layers instead of letting them all pile up in a single server, thats the whole point
---
just in time for South Park!
---
Absolutely, I just have seen a few people asking about the old pets
---
Sharding is flawed because of how people phase in and out of the shards. People said they didn't want that. I didnt read your post as it was long but the reason most people say sharding is better is because it was going to be limited to the starting zones. We dont know exactly how layers will work and thus can not say it will or will not be better. Time is all that will tell
---
Depends on the person, I had a STEM degree but also had to work full time
---
ZG wasn't better gear than BWL and it was a huge success, even among BWL raiders
---
The point is Layering isn’t needed to solve that.
---
They can just make more servers. No need to have this layering and players vanishing all over the place and logging to escape pvp
---
The amount of players who have a negative opinion of upcoming classic because of sharding or layering is roughly 1% of the full future classic population, it will have absolutely zero impact on the games health. Because there's nothing to compare it to to judge its health. Blizzard is writing another new chapter in their MMO how to book
---
Thank you, I won’t. Yes yes I’m clearly just out of touch or lying. Except I’m not. I do not care about the bloody  inconvenience if it means sharding of any kind. Call me a fool and worse, whatever you want, it’s not worth it to me. Not even close.
---
So how is that any different than free transfers by merging servers?
---
i mean, i think that'd still take away from the world of classic wow.
---
these ideals are cool for like a WoW: Remix version, but I don't think it's good as a continunance of Classic.
---
There's going to be a lot of disillusioned people. Today's filthy casuals can neither understand nor handle vanillas ball busting grinds.
---
So even if it's cold as hell where i live, I need to call it summer?
---
It's not hard to coordinate that, you severely underestimate people's dedication to this 15 year old game. If this happens layering is how it's speculated to be, there will be certain guilds with 40 Tidal Charms and 1000 lotus in bank before you've hit lvl60.
---
Sharding would result in even bigger issues. How is layering worse lol
---
Sugestion for a possible tbc follow-up (WotLK would be the same after TBC ends) and assuming they're gonna do "seasonal" servers like Diablo:
---
1) You have honestly 2 or 3 years of solid Vanilla content to play;
---
2) After around half a year of Naxx being released they open a fresh new Vanilla server (called "Seasonal" for example).
---
3) People can choose between playing on Seasonal server, starting everything all over, or just stay on the "Original" which will be perpetually on Naxx patch (let's assume they don't go the OSRS way of making new vanilla content).
---
4) After 2 or 3 years of content on the Seasonal server, a new seasonal one opens up and all the characters from the seasonal server are sent to the Original one, again just like in Diablo season leagues.
---
5) At the same time that the 1st seasonal server is opened, they release a TBC server (again, after the suposed first 2 or 3 years of Classic), and people have the option of copying characters from their Original server into the new TBC one, and continue their adventure into Outlands.
---
6) After 2 years of TBC content, a similar Seasonal TBC server is released, with people having the option of rolling there or just stay in the Original TBC server that will be perpetually on Sunwell's patch (again, same thing that happens with Vanilla).
---
Rinse and repeat *ad eternum*, and similar situation if they follow-up into WotLK. And before you say that this is too much stress for their servers with so many of them available, it really isn't. They'll have 2 "server modes" for Vanilla, 2 server modes for TBC, possible 2 for Wrath etc etc etc. This will please everyone that likes to only play vanilla, or only tbc, or only wrath, and at the same time having the content being refreshed after some time. After 2 or 3 seasons of Vanilla you're bored of it then just grab one of your characters and move to TBC to play on Outlands!
---
This is what I’ve imagined. Gear for some of those other specs. It’s all a long way off though.
---
It's not brilliant, its garbage. Opening of AQ? Uh oh we have too many people, lets shard. Bye server communities.
---
Interesting. It cannot be done...and i see this is the type of response I will receive on this post.
---
Activision *cough*
---
Only cosmetics.
---
The original collector's edition is only available heavily marked up from third party sites such as eBay.
---
&gt; If I'm not mistaken wasn't flying a major part in wotlk?
---
Yes it was, but in my opinion TBC was peak wow (not wrath.) Now the interesting thing here is how greatly players' experiences varied depending on exactly when and how they played. When I was playing through TBC as it progressed real time, it was *very much* an extension of vanilla. Hands down the best content the game had seen and the most memorable for me. But during that time, very few people had their flying mounts yet. The world and the feel of the game changed drastically once everyone leveled their mains and got their flying mounts. Of course flying was fun. It was new and exciting, and it added a very interesting new aspect to world pvp, which seems great on paper except it wasn't great. If you were on the receiving end of it, you weren't having a good time, period. It didn't encourage wpvp, it just gave birth to the most cowardly type of ganking there is in game. Unfair and unfun.
---
They're probably thinking more of giving enough developer time so that the game is polished sufficiently rather than calculating how they can cater to the students. Stop looking at everything according to your narrow point of view.
---
I love how you can parse 1-60 record times from a Fargodeep pull.
---
I played exclusively on RP-PVP servers for the better part of a decade without ever rping.
---
The community is just better on RP-PVP servers.
---
Players won’t be vanishing that’s the point, and no one will be avoiding pvp except for specific situations. People who have friends in one layer will probably already be on that layer.
---
Yes. 
---
TL;DR, met ex-fiancee on WoW 11 years ago, moved to Sweden to be with her. Broke up after 7 years, stayed in Sweden because England is awful, met my current gf and her amazing kids and life is great. One of my lifetime dreams has been to master a 2nd language, took 3-4 years. Swedish get! Thanks, Blizz &lt;3
---
Im more concerned with TCG redeems.
---
About to invest in those.
---
Good thing about closed beta is it is so "closed" only one burning out is the content creators. We will be doing actual testing. We got some idea of what needs to be tested mostly way buffs debuffs are out and some quests, spawn rates etc
---
Summons are yeah, but phasing isn't. :(
---
If you really think it sucked you probably just don't like Tool very much. I mean sure you might not like it as much as their older albums, but it's almost objectively not a terrible album.
---
Ah, thank you.
---
Seeing as how people don't have to purchase this new classic, it comes with the $15 subscription fee, it then follows that there is no collectors purchase pet or cosmetic feature for New Classic players. The collectors purchase is only for Original Classic players.
---
The OG collectors edition is physical only and usually sells for $4,000-$5,500
---
Odds are you’re already on their layer.
---
Merging servers causes:
---
1) whatever server is merged into another loses all player identity, and names
---
2)initial fuck up of the economy when you introduce a full servers worth of mats in at once.      
---
         
---
Free transfers just let people who want off the highly populated servers if they regret it. Some people transfering != Entire server merge
---
They are not redeemable
---
Thank you for sharing a snippet of your diary.
---
&gt; Once you jumped into BC however, the very first green items you found from mobs or quests literally trashed your top-tier raiding items from level 60.
---
Please stop repeating nonsense you have heard.
---
T3 gear was equal to pre-raid BiS 70 gear. People could and did clear Karazhan in their Naxx gear. If you don't believe me check the on-line databases yourself and compare the numbers.
---
The people whining "muh purplez got TRASHED by FIRST GREENZ" were wearing MC loot, probably the crappy items most raiders didn't really want, and were butthurt because MC loot didn't make them "elite" any more. IIRC I had a MC belt that I didn't replace until I got a good quest blue the end of the second zone, so level 64.
---
Top-tier raiding items would massively carry you throughout levelling and let you totally skip the gearing-up phase between hitting 70 and being ready for Kara/Gruul.
---
It's not just a stress test. You stress test with a fully open beta, not a small amount of people. That's the complete opposite of a stress test i feel like you're making shit up
---
It's only at release to deal with all the players being in the starting zones
---
Nothing to expect. It’s a rerelease of a game i’ve already played before, I know exactly what it’ll be.
---
hueheuhue. \*just finished school\*
---
You mean marriage? As the wedding part doesn't really matter.
---
A little dramatic..
---
It is true tho. Same goes with all the nagging that you can buy classic gametime by farming gold on retail. You hve to be literally rettded to do that. One shift at your shitty retail job will net you like 4-5 months of gametime..
---
[So..](https://media.giphy.com/media/ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu/200.gif)
---
arent you a little hateful troll, not understanding sharding/layering and its implications, no intent of playing and still trying to downtalk the devs decision..
---
It is just for phase 1. After phase 1 ion has stated the layering will be done with
---
It will only be for one month not months.
---
They just had a great point on ClassiCast. Why not just do layering in 1-10 or 1-20 zones? You can test out layering in increments to see if it works before you just do layering for all of phase one for everyone.
---
So you don't think it's as bad as some people are making it out to be, but you think it's more than 1%. How about you nail down the specific percentage of people.
---
Also something can't be very wrong, just wrong.
---
 :)
---
Sorry if my post wasnt what you wanted, just was trying to help
---
Global channels need to stay global across the server.
---
It's going to be a mess though.
---
What happens when you and your guildies decide to form up for a dungeon but you're all in different layers?  Is someone supposed to be magically teleported into another layer so that the group is on the same layer?  How do you stop people from abusing that, because that's an exploitable thing, if so.
---
Is everyone in the same guild just going to reside on the same layer?  Again, that's exploitable.
---
Does everyone merge together once inside the instance?  How do you assist a groupmate who can't get into the instance because they are being killed by PvP?
---
A month is not really a long time at all
---
World PvP.  There could be awesome world PvP going on in another layer.  Unless someone made you aware of it, you would've missed it.  It's about what you're not seeing.
---
Resources.  You might be gathering Iron Ore to sell it on the AH to make some money.  Meanwhile, there are _several_ other instances of the game world, each with their own set of resources, all funneling into a single coherent AH.  The market suffers as a consequence.  It's about what you're not seeing.
---
Population.  You log in and the world is a ghost town because you were placed into a newly-spawned layer.  Maybe it fills up.  Maybe it doesn't and despawns, placing you into another layer.  Maybe it hangs just above the minimum threshold and you're with a couple hundred other people spread throughout an entire continent while everyone else has a full set of players to interface with.  It's about what you're not seeing.
---
So there's a _few_ examples "worth something".  You're missing out on things going on in the world-- even if you didn't know it.  That's a fact.  _It's about what you're not seeing._
---
And no, it's not like "if something was happening on a different server".  You're not on a different server from these other people.  You're all server mates.  Intra-server decoherence is not the same as inter-server variance.
---
'nuff said
---
After careful revision... you're right. So technically, you could get invited without having a subscription, but in order to play you will need to activate a sub or game time.
---
Keep saying the release date will kill the game! It makes me happy so many kiddos will be busy with school.
---
The number of posts complaining of no release date, and then complaining it's not early enough is the mentality that led to the current neutered retail wow.
---
Eh. I think thats silly. Of all villains and expansions, Arthas was handled properly and Wrath is probably the only expansion ending I think is actually good.
---
you can still redeem the code, but good luck, they are $1500+ on ebay.
---
They've never required it before, and the point of classic is to bring in people who aren't playing retail...
---
I'm seeing all of these complicated theories on how multiple expansions would work. I have one that I think is simple and will likely be the answer.
---
Obviously, they don't want us to download multiple clients for multiple expansions. It's not called Classic for nothing; Classic covers a wide variety of meanings, and many expansions can be considered "classic." Not just Vanilla. That, and multiple clients is extremely messy, and so is any "in-game" timewalky bullshit.
---
My theory is before logging in you can select your expansion. Classic, TBC, Wrath and so on, right before you click play on the launcher and the game starts, much like selecting a region.
---
Same client, different servers. I highly doubt they will launch TBC over Vanilla and so on. That would enrage many, many people who prefer to stay in that setting with what they have.
---
Player-base split is a worry, but many will come back for each different "launch" and stay. It will attract many old players and some of those older players will remain. I don't think any expansions will die or have dead realms. As long as they keep it on a smaller scale with fewer realms to choose from it should be just fine, years after.
---
Aaaah yeah fair enough then, thanks
---
Another video talks about "session", which to me seems to be a strong hint towards it changing between each time you log on. 
---
Another issue I didn't think about, if it is like I assumed, is that there may be no off hours. If there are 4 shards at peak time and 1 shards at night and early morning, you may see the same number of players no matter when you play.
---
You say all that as if - and others like me - are not well aware. We are. The thing is, I’ll take it. It will be chaos, inconvenient etc. I don’t mind, I will in fact relish it. A genuine launch of a world erupting &gt; carefully controlled hand holding roller coaster. It doesn’t matter to me how slow it will be, it would be epic. Epically inconvenient and absurd, yes, but also truly epic. That’s why I care about this thing at all, because it’s not a fkin mobile game like retail. You lot can do the whole “you think you do, but you don’t” all you want. I do. I want it.
---
Well yea that was the point of my post. Sharding is much better because it’s limited to only starting zones. Because it is, the fading in and out will matter much less especially when the alternative is being able to essentially server(phase) hop essentially whenever you want, which isn’t like classic at all. Rather than 1 unlike classic thing during starting zones, it’s 1 unlike classic thing for the first month or longer.
---
TCG codes no longer work?
---
How dare the game devs not think of the students time?! Shame on them for not thinking of the children!!
---
&gt; inventible knowing that there could be someone doing the same as them and they will never meet
---
If this is what's on your mind while you're playing Classic WoW for the first time... perhaps layering isn't the core problem in your life.
---
Yeah, every phase should be dlc and you should be able to buy epics on ye olde classic armaments app. $$$
---
That isn't how I interpreted Brian Birmingham's comments in the interview Staysafe posted. Sounded to me like starting zones will have sharding AND the layering system will apply to the entire world.
---
How do you use skill to determine which mob the tank is targeting if there are no marks set? Or is skill just another word for setting marks for a Kill Order?
---
At first I was kinda pissed because really I want wow classic yesterday...but after thinking about it I’m happy with the release date.  Keeps me social and active during the summer months when it’s nice out as I’m bunkering down for the first 3 months regardless - kind nice that it’s in late summer/fall
---
I gotcha now. Yea we were kinda talking about two different things. I mean the rush with a bunch of level one characters will last at least a couple days. Maybe not the intensity of the first minute, but still pretty packed. And at least in most of the US it will release after 3pm. Europe will be hurting more from what you’re describing with the morning release there.
---
Oh no what will Blizzard do without your sub? Oh no.
---
Dont understand the reference.
---
"We want to make Classic pure"
---
"Yes, you can realm transfer in Classic"
---
Fuck this . . .ninjas will rule Classic.
---
Remember that time they made you pay like $50 to try out a weekend long demo?
---
Wouldn't be surprised if Classic had micro-transactions. 
---
Still hoping for the best though.
---
Probably. Just something you'll have to deal with for MC, after that no layers.
---
Everyone have to roll from lvl 1, no leveling gear? Plz confirm.
---
By all means please tell me what you meant by a "classic summer" then, and how Blizzard has lied and deceived the community.
---
I expected it for the launch, maybe the first week at the most, but it's for all of "Phase 1". It'll take people 2-3 months to hit cap, so I can't see them releasing new raid content during that time frame, meaning we aren't actually getting "authentic" vanilla servers until *months* after release. I'm leveling on a private server right now and it's been so fun running into players across multiple zones, or talking to healers about their network of tanks they've met leveling. So much will be lost by having servers split up and not mattering like this.
---
Layering is temporary and probably the best solution. Yeah there might be a few abuse cases. I’m sure blizzard is aware. Dynamic spawn rates won’t solve the server stability problem if they let ten thousand player on the server at a time.
---
Sounds like something good for someone to test in the beta tomorrow!
---
I’ll ask one of the streamers tomorrow to go look and see if the vendor guy is in the Beta.  Plus I’d like to know if any of the other limited vendors are there.

yeah fair enough
---
i did EE and software with internships, but i still found myself with some time
---
Imagine not having a legacy or continuing your bloodline because of vidya.
---
Pretty sure this is completely wrong.
---
1) they've never required you to have game time for previous betas
---
2)the point of classic is to bring in non-subs
---
3)Can you really not think of any other way to give out a beta than dishing it out to random accounts? I hope you're not a decision maker wherever you work
---
Hi, /u/RealnoMIs
---
But WoW is a huge game, there's probably a lot of different understanding of what's valuable. How can we be sure that everything has less value if you play beta, and not only 32.3%?
---
tfw classic releases 1 week after my compulsory internship for college
---
Did you even read what he posted? You're missing the entire point...
---
Need moar DOTs
---
Why is your entertainment more valid than the hundreds of thousands of other players?
---
I did
---
So what was your first comment then, do you want me to argue over your false statement?
---
Imagine the last time you were (seriously) playing wow...ever think you'd be getting married?
---
I mean Blizzard is free to release WoW whenever they want, just as the people who were eagerly anticipating and hoping that a "summer release" meant they could play a lot of it during the summer are free to be a unhappy and make their opinion on the release date heard.
---
$$ Greed $$
---
Make servers into groups, 1 2 3 etc. Everyone in group one has to select a unique name despite being on different servers. This solves the name issue. And the reason not to do layering is because i think its going to fundamentally affect the experience to a degree, the economy a lot and have potential for PVP abuse.
---
When you target something in WoW, you see the unit frame.
---
In modern WoW, you can have a unit frame for the focus target. In Vanilla, you could not. I am just asking will we have this frame or not.
---
With this frame, you are able to write macros to automatically cast spells on your focus target. This greatly cahnges gameplay so I am trying to plan ahead.
---
Just seemed like troll lol.
---
I have thought about this and i dont know of a way to do it without having someone else just do the killing lol. Lol
---
And then the right click reporting will sort out the rest.

If you have a 10k population server that needs to condense down to 5k, that's not "a few people transferring off"

---
I sure hope not.
---
I guess it depends on the attitude of the group.  If everyone is positive, and having fun, it's a blast.  Not so much if things turn salty.
---
To each their own, I suppose.
---
How many? 2800. At least you can infer that, because he says each layer is the max size of a traditional wow server from back in vanilla. And Kevin Jordan (an old wow dev who has done popular interviews recently) has said  the old world was built for 2800-3000 people.
---
As far as I understand it, the group leader sending out the invites dictates the layer everyone else moves to. Which would mean in that situation, you would have to have a friend online, have to beg that friend to quickly invite you before you get ganked, hope he's not AFK, and then you would have to cross your fingers and hope that he's on another layer, which you would only know if you went up to your friends location in person and didn't see them.
---
Assuming OP is the DAD maybe he can, but for some reason i was under the impression that OP was the mom. My point still stands :D
---
They work in retail still yes
---
It’s the start of my fall term but I don’t care I’m just hyped about a date
---
Yeah that's what everyone keeps saying but with Blizzard's recent track record I wouldn't be surprised if they find more ways to justify it later.
---
I really don't this think protects us from 'dead' servers any more than a standard release.  Less competition for quests won't do anything to tourism since things naturally calm down after a few days once the levels spread out.
---
On the inverse - what happens when you have a densely populated server and they suddenly flip the switch at phase 2?  Now there's potentially twice the number of people competing for things.
---
Servers that need and rely on their new 'layers' will be in for a shock once phase 2 hits.
---
Right? I started playing vanilla in the middle of the school year and had a blast.
---
So entitled.
---
Where did you see they'll have layering indefinitely? Oh, that's right, you didn't.
---
Should have used a condom
---
Unidirectionally it does sound trivial.
---
Conversely, tracking when layers are available and building a network of accounts that tether you to them via party invites to let you go both directions makes this sound like an incredible pain.
---
You'll also have to avoid actually being in a guild as it's likely you'll get automatically logged into the same layer as your guild if any is active.
---
I'm not saying it won't be abused, but it is in no universe 'as simple as accepting a party invite' to set up a multi-layer farming mafia to benefit from the server scheme.
---
We're getting updated mods and macros. Don't worry you will have something so similar to focus target you won't know the difference unless you're a rogue.
---
The footage you're seeing is an offline Alpha that content creators were invited to play last week. I think invites will be sent out tomorrow. I haven't heard anyone claim they have one yet.
---
It's a little unclear honestly. Hopefully we get a full release blue post. Right now we're all interpretating various disappointed interviews lol.
---
Yeah na
---
You can still do both with character copy...
---
&gt; It should be further clarified that there will still be independent realms and there will NOT be any cross Realm Layering/Sharding
---
IMO, a realm subject to decoherence is no realm at all, irrespective of whether or not it is intermingling with other servers.
---
It’s like watching a movie twice in a row back to back.
---
Many. I was in a national guild. We had drinks every 2 weeks. Fun times.
---
they actually didnt start in tbc, they had realm transfers later in vanilla and let you transfer from high pop servers to low pop servers, and im pretty sure thats what theyre referring to in this video as ive seen other posts talking about that.
---
It’s not good but realm transfer did exist in Vanilla.
---
Layering will be exploited but i don't think to a degree in which people think. It'll be so hard to do.
---
Say there is a very popular raiding guild. Unfortunately, there is an anti-popular guild on the opposing faction. The anti-popular guild knows their raid times and always camps them while they head out to Blackrock Mountain.
---
Can popular guild just find someone on another layer and just phase to that layer, by inviting everyone, just to avoid the anti-popular guild?
---
I could have sworn they said this was their original plan, but now that seems to not be the case
---
They said that may be one service that we provide.... title says "confirmed"
---
HMMMMMMMMM
---
You will have 6 months before the first phase even comes out, you have PLENTY  of time as long as you stay on top of your studies
---
The core system of the game will stay the same. I actually love the idea. It'll be like OSRS.
---
That makes no sense, when they take away layers.. suddenly 1/3 the "necessary" resources. Therefore whoever layer jumped and hoarded all the shit in phase 1 is rich af.  The correct answer would be 3 servers.
---
Yeah but people giving their life stories why they're so important to have the release date catered more towards them is delusional. I'm surprised Blizzard even had the release date by Q3 and not delayed to Q4.
---
The dates between summer soltice and autumn equinox.
---
Companies use the actual calendar when announcing the season of release, not school calendars.
---
Find more
---
Well, the reason it changed was because they found a new way to do it. 
---
Layering is a more true to classic method of handling release issues compared to sharding starting zones.
---
If they did sharding, it would have to be severely limited.
---
Layering sounds more like subdividing the server into "Sub Servers" with 3k players each.
---
Unless you go out of your way to get an experience different from classic, it should be fairly similar except for a smoother release.
---
Layers are only a problem if you try to leave the layer you are on, and if they Layer the chat channels, you pretty much need to have [Battle.Net](https://Battle.Net) friends on different layers in order to change layer.
---
Sitting on an ice trap was too fun
---
I ordered this stupid fucking useless piece of shit Blizzard stupid box thing the moment I saw it.
---
I love bullshit like this. I'll buy basically anything I see in an ad.
---
weird flex but okay
---
Tool is also more stubborn than Blizzard. I can't believe we're getting Classic before Tool joined the 21st century in regards to streaming.
---
Thats the kind of launch I want please.
---
I feel like of the blizzcon rewards happened between 2004 and 2006 then sure :)
---
the dream is dead mate, move on to eso or something
---
I am 32 now. Considering the severe neglect of the gf when I was in my teens, and prioritizing the game over the relationship...DEFINITELY didn't see myself getting married to anyone lol.
---
I read the big message saying that the beta will begin may 15th and that the release date being 27/8/2019 yes.
---
Did you come here to answer my question or just ask me questions?
---
What? This has nothing to do with my life lol. I Love classic wow, for the same reason a lot of other people do. It’s a real M.M.O.RPG. The community is everything. And if for the first month, where I will be doing most of my leveling of not all, I’m running the same paths as someone else but not coming across them, that’s pretty wrong for a game to do, that’s supposed to be about it’s community, making interactions, and the games economy and health of the game typically based on the interactions you make early on. 
---
I literally have buddies that I met during vanilla and BC leveling that I still talk to now, and that wouldn’t have been possible with layering. It would have been a 50/50 or 33% chance I even came across them....
---
You won't be picked, and if you haven't had a sub for awhile, you definitely won't be picked
---
&gt; Make servers fit into groups,1 has 10 servers 2 has another 10 servers 3 etc. Everyone in group one has to select a unique name despite being on different servers. 
---
That sounds like layering with extra steps.
---
Yup focus target will exist in Classic.
---
I guess...i mean if you dont take the true pacifist rules it might be possible.
---
I expect with updated mods, macros, times, talents etc were in for a brand new game with a vanilla feel to it.
---
Feels like all those higher percentage estimates are really under estimating how big New Classic is going to launch. That or it's the typical thing of, I think this thing is very important therefore of course I'm going to think many other people will think it's important.
---
The people who will think it is very important are the people for whom the first month of play time is vital to having their fun experience. Meaning, mostly the private server go go go fresh fresh fresh enjoy the chaotic Madness of a server launch people.
---
New Classic is going to be so so so much bigger than that and that is a very small percentage of the people overly concerned with the first few weeks of specific aspects of play.
---
Glad you got something going for you. I'm also gonna be reinspired to play WoW, and it will, like you, give me a reason to keep going, if not just a distraction from my current life.
---
What I'm not totally understanding, is what (in this example) is the difference between a layer with 3k active players and a server with 3k active players?
---
As far as things happening in the world, I don't understand what the difference is between Moonguard being a server with a 10k pop cap split into 4 layers of 2.5k, and having Moonguard, Tanaris, Ragnaros, and Darkspear as four separate servers each with a 2.5k pop cap? Won't there be as many events happening in the world on each layer as opposed to each smaller capped server?
---
I'm not saying that Layering is the best thing to ever happen, but it seems like a more reasonable solution than pre-planned server merges? To me that seems more discoherent in the long term than temporary layering...
---
I don’t want an unarmored epic mount.  They don’t even look cool... so not me :)
---
Do not underestimate the speed at which people will level up in Classic.  Many ppl know how to 1-60 in 140 hours or less, easily.  Easily.  People plan to take entire vacations when this shit finally launches.  Your "long period of time" is 2 weeks in the real world.
---
Loving the release date as much as of prefer it sooner. Travelling to Europe for a month in June so this gives me enough buffer to take another week without the dirty looks :D
---
Haha how times change hey? Gratz!
---
They probably shouldn't have said anything about a classic summer then
---
Thank you very much :)

If a shard contains 3000 people is it really a shard?
---
I pray you get through it my friend.
---
Oh please.  Layering and sharding are exactly the same with a few irrelevant tweaks.  Yeah, it's continent-wide instead of zone-wide.  Yeah, it's less aggressive at re-allocating players to different instances.  So what?  All of the same issues with wPVP, resources, and population variance still remain and you have absolutely no answer for them.
---
And capping servers at 4k isn't a good enough sollution? IMHO server merges for dead servers are less harmful than the abuse this can offer. If the issue is limited servers with high capacity, I could see this being the only viable sollution, but then I could also say they could just get clever with sharding/xserver tech and effectively create multiple realms on the same server.
---
imagine being so retarded and having kids as a young man, when you can just do that at 50/60 years of age, and enjoy your youth banging young lassies and living a free life.
---
Yes?
---
&gt;  Post-Naxx content is all I've been asking for and I'm going to be loud as hell about it until the time comes.
---
SAME! I think that vanilla WoW as a formula(/game) has so much potential it's ridiculous and I really hope they go this route.
---
Bad news?  She’s not going to say no.
---
To assume a lot don’t have an active sub or like me subbed yesterday because the announcement could have been anything. 
---
We good 
---
Let us in
---
Not authentic if you dont play in the college dorm.
---
This is essentially the idea of server 'groups' that some of us were asking for, better :)
---
\&gt; How do you coordinate if you have 0 control over what layer you are on? 
---
if you can change it by joining groups then you can definitely control it
---
my uncle told me not to talk to strangers! besides, he told me to only trust mr. stinky. luckily mr. stinky comes around a lot! hes so cool but i wish he was less hairy
---
You bring up a great point. I hope they stick to their word. BFA was a massive letdown for me and a lot of their careful word play in the Q&amp;A didn't help build any trust. I think discussion around this is great and I think it's great you replied with good questions/statements
---
To discuss some of your points:
---
I think it helps a bit with "dead servers" because you will have fewer initial servers. IMO it's easier to add more servers (assuming the initial servers aren't enough) than to do server merges where players/guilds will have to rename. More specifically, if there is some server where a lot of tourists leave, you would then have to merge the server(s), assuming population was low enough to harm the experience. 
---
I think Blizzard could offer a free server transfer from some massive server (probably the streamer servers \[Asmongold, Esfand, etc.\]) to a low/medium population server once they remove layering. That seems like a logical choice, but we will have to see what they say. Blizzard hasn't had the best track record recently so we will see :)
---
I caught that too, as a Swift Spectral owner I am praying to the old gods that might be the case but I'm not holding my breath at all.
---
USA confirmed for not developed (although I have unlimited PTO)
---
That's true, but I'd rather deal with the disappointment of a delay than the disappointment of a rushed product at launch
---
Congrats man!
---
Yea I just wish you would take 2 minutes tops to read my post. Regardless between sharding or layering, there would be the same amount of servers. If there’s 5 servers with layering, there would only be 5 servers with sharding. Kind of also doesn’t make sense to try to make a point without reading my actual post, doesn’t seem like you understand why I was making this post to begin with.
---
Their end goal means it's not WoW classic, it's WoW kinda classic. That's his point
---
Actually yeah haha
---
They should have brought some people on who strived to get vanilla brought back. I don't have anything against these two but when he mentioned a year long journey I thought back to how long ago nost got shut down and just cringed.
---
they moved the goalposts three fucking times already. Whose to say they won't do it again
---
Retail never was a great name for it but its what stuck. I tend to call it Live WoW and Classic WoW but Modern works
---
But what if your goal actually was to be the most knowledgeable man alive about this particular movie? Wouldn't it have great value to watch it twice in a row, or even a third time maybe?
---
Birthday around there as well and I also always considered it summer.
---
I met a mage named Lateralus while leveling up, I helped him AOE grind for a bit (I was a priest) we were friends from that point on.  Gods I miss vanilla WoW community.
---
My guess is that layering will probably be turned off by the time your average player starts hitting 60.  So I wouldn't worry about this
---
Jokes on you, school doesn't start in Canada until a couple weeks after
---
I haven't really followed. Will it have updated graphics or nah?
---
Time to injure myself at work for long term disability
---
I’m not having a go, I agree with you it being a way to cash in.
---
But really is it that bad to sub a month or two early? If you’re getting things out of it yourself (I.e reserved character name + beta) it’s not like you’re paying for nothing either.
---
It’s upto you, I subbed and I’m okay with it. I’m just excited for classic now
---
&gt; It's actually drastically different...
---
It's not.  Layering and sharding still share 90% of the same problems.  You still have a decoherent game world and all of the issues that come with that.
---
When you play the game of waiting, you either wait, or you die.
---
wait but I thought all the people saying the playerbase was going to die off fairly quickly once the nostalgia wears off were just big ol' haters? Now you're agreeing with them?
---
he was legit about to die multiple times but i guess OMG EZ CLASSIC IZ RUINED
---
And so the layer memes begin...
---
It started in the TBC pre-patch. I would know because that is when my guild transferred to another server and it really ruined the experience for me since I liked my old realm. 
---
TBC pre-patch is NOT vanilla.
---
Retail sounds more derogatory. I’ll allow it.
---
The internet exist. Everyone knows everything about anything.
---
Then there is also working, clubs, school events, parties/bars, hanging out with friends. College should include much more time than just going to class.
---
Paladin is not that bad in vanilla :D
---
Do you perhaps have the list of cosmetics?
---
It's true you fucking baby. August 27th leaves an entire month of summer left.

For arguments sake, let's say that on launch there are 3150 players in Barrens. Will they split the players so that there are 3000 people in one layer while the 150 other players are put in a second layer and have a much easier time leveling and shoot way above the rest of the pack? There's tons of questions we need answered before we can accept this.

---
But they wouldn't be forced. Farming for the unarmored mounts would be optional, like it always was.
---
This is a weird deviation from actual vanilla WoW. It's actually the first thing I've heard about Classic that's made me want to think about reconsidering the decision between Classic and private servers, because most private servers I've played on have had the unarmored mounts.
---
One of the reasons I was looking forward to Classic was the chance for a fresh start, an opportunity to have a new main that wouldn't miss any time-limited stuff like the unarmored mounts and the AQ war effort event. I hope they reconsider their decision and decide against making this change.
---
as long as you aren't just doing silly stuff like herbing all day at level 20, the no-life should be able to keep pace with the vetarn given your time frames. Maybe even out pace them.
---
Nice. I was subbed until late WoD and haven't been subbed since, so I suppose I won't be considered even if i resubbd today :(
---
Just kidding. Love you!
---
Tips out is so cool, the developers look more comfortable because he is a familiar face
---
Yeah dude nice fearmongering. It's funny you think there will be enough people sticking around 6 months in that you feel they will need to continue layering the realms.
---
I leveled up with swords in vanilla/TBC/wotlk... wanna give it a shot with daggers this time to see if I can come up with good strategies that I can share with others or maybe write a guide. I have a feeling that ambush -&gt; gouge -&gt; BS -&gt; KS -&gt; BS, BS, SS, SS..., will be enough to deal with most solo mobs.
---
What the fuck is this? 
---
&gt;  I have never even heard of solstices and equinoxes until religious studies in college

Oh okay you're just retarded.
---
Well fuck that's a hard no from me.
---
Like yay, but already beat it 🤷‍♀️💁‍♀️
---
Not sure I would want to grind to level 40 for a mount.  Lol
---
All we can do is hope that layering doesn’t last beyond the first few weeks. We know it sucks, you don’t have to make a list explaining why it sucks. We can just hang in there and hope for the best.
---
Lmfao because i stream that means anything??? Bro you're a bit dumber than i actually thought. the only "Notice me senpai" crowd i see is the crowd thinking streamers are gonna ruin their gaming experience. Iv also watched that video you linked its kinda fucking stupid tbh... You legit think people are gonna follow you around? Are you asmongold? Watch his streams then and dont go on his server... OR just dont fucking play at all if you're so worried about someone else being followed and not affecting YOUR gaming experience. This is a prime example of someone wanting to bitch for the sake of bitching. Its so fucking hilarious how you think people are gonna be messing with you, a nobody some random fucking person... Streamer or not you're gonna have tons of people trying to do what you're trying to do.You're kind of just a whiny bitch. And if its all good then why you still bitching and complaining about it???? You're bitching about something that has no affect on you nor anyone else BUT the streamer...
---
Exactly, so his earmark would work fine thanks for agreeing with him
---
Vanilla didn't have focus as we know it today, however it was possible to mimmick the way focus worked by using the API in 1.12.1 to create scripts or even addons.  
---
Anyway, it was recently discovered in [this reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bnn2jp/diff_of_current_classic_vs_live_part_2_framexml/) that the focus frames has been removed, so while this isn't official it does indicate, so far, that we wont be having focus in Classic.
---
Peter Mark and Justin have a guild with about 15 people in it, they all crash level to 60 and start abusing several layers to farm blacklotuses and devilsaur as much as they can and have a huge inventory head start when it comes to valuable materials. They corner the market and buy any supply of black lotus that arrives while inflating the prices like crazy as they are still camping the black lotus spawns and still have plenty of supply. What little black lotus they dont buy up goes for their listing price of 200g. 
---
I think this is what /u/Silent_E is afraid of but i dont know for sure.
---
no wdym, op says its 3 times the supply but only 1 time the demand
---
no matter when they release it its going to be at a bad time for somebody, nothing anyone can do about it
---
"Staring zones sharded" only was never an option. Barrens is an even bigger choke point than durotar, so that would have had to be sharded as well. Now you're past only that being sharded, who knows where it ends?
---
Also people keep saying layering is going to last the entire P1 with literally no evidence as far as i can tell. The two statements I've seen are here https://www.wowhead.com/news=291722/layering-in-classic-wow "Layering for a couple weeks and maybe a month" and "Layering will not happen again after P1." I dunno how people are reading this and getting "Layering for all of P1." Clearly it just means they won't chuck layering back in during high pop events like world bosses or AQ opening. I was super worried about that so it's good news.

It is summer you retard. The world doesn't revolve around school children.
---
They'll still have population caps
---
You're putting words in my mouth. I also don't speak for the subreddit. :P
---
Are you implying the population will not go down after a few months?
---
Pretty obvious how to exploit it. Leave out-of-guild bank alts always logged in on each layer. Have devilsaur farmer leave guild, get invited by Bank alt to whichever layer, farm, join guild again after. A single guild can be farming on every layer and switch between layers at will.
---
can you walk into a shop and buy classic?
---
i guess its retail when that happens
---
That's beautiful
---
Wow classic is shaping up to be the biggest mmo launch ever, bigger than any wow expansion releases which would have likely held that title previously.
---
They need to implement something otherwise it will be fucked honestly. They’d rather piss off a few actual classic players than deal with the thousands of screaming autists that emerge when there is launch/server issues.
---
School what?
---
I just use the Gregorian calendar. June July August
---
I'm sorry he moved the goal posts after the intial post. He didn't mention anything about it being temporary from the onset.
---
I'm not a troll, he's a dick. Sorry you can't see it.
---
Enjoy your game.
---
&gt; Can you find any complaints between that time frame about "dead servers" or people not being able to find groups for stuff
---
Yes, I complained a lot about my server (Malorne-US) being dead around 2006-2007. My guild collapsed shortly after BC launched because around half the raiders server transferred to higher population servers and we couldn't find replacements. I ended up rerolling on a higher population server because I was a broke college student and couldn't afford the transfer fee.
---
Yup. Hell of a lot better than queues and waiting for mob respawns
---
I mean, it was meant more to re work the lore so as to “fix” the expansions after Wotlk.
---
Yes, the release date is a bummer, but it is still during the summer whether you like it or not. You can't just change how the seasons are counted based on how you feel about a release date. I never said they'd do something that would cost them money, don't be illiterate. 
---
People who sub for a beta invite are most likely not going to play BFA, but okay.
---
&gt; Hopefully they do the layering correctly.
---
We're talking about Blizzard. The company who currently has a retail game that a bunch of people don't like because of their decisions, so now they're releasing an old untouched version of it, and you're currently in that sub
---
Blizzard has been given their outs, they continue to fuck up
---
"screwed over by some streamers" Everything isn't about you, you think the world revolves around you... No streamers ever anywhere are gonna screw things up for you...
---
Then what's the point of layers if there are still population caps and therefore login queues?
---
Lol, in before this gets deleted
---
Some people just want to watch the world burn
---
You've replied to a lot of my posts now. Not sure why you're so salty, I feel bad for your son. Hope you work out any issues you have!
---
nice argument smoothbrain.
---
keyword: ending up.
---
Classic August 27
---
New TOOL album August 30
---
Jesus christ this is almost too much for me to fucking handle.
---
no wait, that is actual BS from Blizzard. Thats one of the legitimate points, so quit your complaining about presumably invalid complaints. It really is nonsense to require a sub from wow for an entirely different game
---
which could be 6 months. That's a long enough span to kill classic
---
Right now we are stuck in a weird limbo with focus targetting being removed from the CDN build according to data mining, and the functionality that made it possible through addons in vanilla no longer exists in the API. But I guess the beta tomorrow will tell for sure.
---
Imp SS no doubt. Again there will be many occasions where you can’t use Backstab and you’ll be spamming SS instead.
---
I'd love to have all 3 as an option. I really enjoyed TBC.
---
&gt; you'll only be able to make marginal progress during time off
---
This is hilarious. I'm taking a week off and I'll be so far ahead of you that you'll still be looking for SM groups when I'm gearing up in BRD.
---
Hey, I got a chuckle and that's good enough for me!
---
Yeah you're right. They're aware of all the bugs and they're just refusing to fix them to con people out of money that they would spend on a subscription anyways. You figured out the conspiracy.
---
This isn't about your perceived usefulness of being knowledgeable about a certain movie, it's about if it'd have value to watch a movie twice if your goal was to be knowledgable about said movie.
---
People have different goals, and therefore actions have different value to them. You might not perceive their goals as useful, but that's not relevant.
---
As some one who can only play 6 hours a day, I’m 100% confident that I could out level someone going in blind
---
Whatever it takes.
---
Hi, /u/Ultima1221
---
the whole point of the layers is so they can cram more people onto one server.  So you start off with 12k per server and as the tourists go away you can peel back the layers.
---
I think you are right about Imp. Gouge. In solo PvE it will give more time for energy regen as well.
---
I think you are also right about RS... there's just something so unsatisfying about having 4/5 in a talent.
---
101 cashflow
---
Really wish they weren’t letting streamers handle the communication for things like this...
---
No you're wrong. They said it's continent wide
---
You wont be playing it solo. Are you Alex Jones or something?
---
That's kinda my thoughts.  I'm fine with it initially if it goes away in time.
---
I want to play WoW:Classic, not relive the WoW:Vanilla launch cluster.
---
Leave booked for Tuesday 27/8/2019 all the way through to Friday 9/9/2019!
---
I was a student when WoW released in 2004 and I am a teacher now, this is sad.
---
Taken 3 days off for this bOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIS
---
It’ll work like retail with sharding. Second you’re in a group you’ll be in the same layer regardless of how far you travel whenever they enter the same zone as you, you’ll be together (while in party).
---
You can do this on retail to visit moonguard for example while playing on a normal server
---
Also you: wtf why is my server dead.
---
August is basically christmas
---
&gt; But why are they so against old fashioned hardware servers with zero sharding/layering and normal server caps
---
Because they can cut server load (costs) in the name of stability and convenience.  It also greatly reduces bandwidth.. costs.
---
You’ll be able to get it with an addon.
---
No. In server merges, everyone you met you can still meet. In layering that is not the case
---
Yeah, but I dislike the idea "returning" of Arthas. Of all characters that should return, I think Arthas should be completely disregarded.
---
World of Warcraft expansions uses too many War3 characters as crutches, and I think bringing Arthas back would look so creatively bankrupt.
---
Great comeback - did your mom help you with that one? Or does she only know how to help herself to more dick?
---
You can google your optimal build and gear, and where to get that gear. Class rotations are simple. If you've played GW2, ESO, any WoW expansion, FFXIV, you've already played a game more complicated than Classic. Classic is time consuming, not super complicated. So assuming the no-life newbie and time restricted veteran stay with it and seek the same content, the no-life newbie will win out in the end...it just doesn't take long to become competent.
---
Appeared in r/all ...can someone explain to me what this means?
---
about 7000 - 20000 hours of playtime
---
Do you need to be subbed to get into the beta? That would be awful
---
You imply that I and Blizz have said we can play classic the whole summer, you ofc had nothing to say in the next comment after I replied " When did I or blizzard say a whole summer? " because it was not true. And now you want to continue arguing on something that you made up.  If you are just in here to be a troll I suggest you find another thread.
---
I hate that I feel forced into abusing this. I don't want to... but I will.
---
Every game needs a beta i mean its not the original client running battlenet its a ground up rebuild of vaniila in the bfa client so yes it needs a beta
---
I’m not looking at everything from my point of view. I’m saying it’s a bummer. That’s it. If you were in my position you would be a little bummed too. 
---
It’s called empathy. Learn to have to some 👍🏻
---
cool, doesn't really matter what you call it
---
The world doesn't revolve around seasons as well. There's no such thing as seasons - it's a human construct you moron!
---
they will, theyre being put on the store in august.
---
We did a lot of things {x} years ago just fine. That does not mean it's tolerable now.
---
A poor launch kills a game. There are way too many alternate options out there for people to just sit around and be patient. 15 years ago, Blizzard was trying the MMORPG thing for the first time. Now they are arguably the pioneers of how to do it successfully, and from whom we expect much better than some random indie developer.
---
Wait a second, this sub has been saying the people who say the game's pop will die off shortly have been called "haters" by this sub, and it's been said they're just big dumbs dumbs who want to hate fun
---
Now you're saying they're right? I just want to make that clear
---
i actually also called it "live" for awhile then adapted to "Retail" for consistency but I started calling it "modern" now.
---
On the flip side, I'm sitting here being more depressed than I've been in years as a result of cross-realm BG's being confirmed. I have some vague semblance of hope that it may get delayed to Phase 6, or be limited to groups only 2-4 servers in size, but if not one of those then I can't see myself playing Classic anymore.
---
This is the best timeline
---
No, on any operating system. And you don’t have to be a software engineer to understand or do it.
---
PERHAPS non-Windows operating systems’ window managers (think Gnome or KDE on Linux as an example) may switch you to an active window if you try to “double click run” a program in their OS. This is a feature of the window manager and not the OS itself.
---
I will reassert that any operating system can launch as many instances of any user program as they wish. The limit might roughly be the 64 bit address space, or about 2^64.
---
Beyond tier 2 is where warlocks become OP. 
---
So T2.5/R13.
---
&gt; Spiritually it's not

Hahahaha what the actual fuck. Feels &gt; reals reeeeeeeeeeeeee

I picked up quite a few across a few accounts. I'll keep two and probably give away the rest.

Might not even be worth it, you die 2-3 times and zone in.
---
&gt; You could do all that anyways.
---
No, you couldn't.  Being able to exploit layers to farm is not the same as just farming normally in a single instance.
---
"Rares were usually up on my server anyway" is not pertinent retort to the assertion that people _will_ abuse the layering system to [insert multiple] their rare item output.
---
idk if "Won't be used after phase 1" means "Will be used for all of phase 1". I've heard that they plan to only use it for a month at max.
---
They needed to mention that it wouldn't be in phase 2 onward since later phases will have population spikes, and they're clarifying that they won't be using sharding for those (important for world bosses and AQ gates).
---
Now i understand. Modern... Retail is a Massively Modern Online Game.
---
retail's fine imo
---
live's a good blanket term for the entirety of wow 1-max.
---
retail's a slightly more specific blanket term for current xpac
---
modern didn't work as well without classic
---
The amount doesn't matter, the fact it's there at all matters. If the other layers are much less populated in fact, it's makes the layer that much more valuable and open for abuse
---
You can raid in phase 1.

---
Guilds and groups of friends have navigated and exploited far more complicated systems that that in the past.
---
It would not be difficult to ensure there were always characters on each layer for the exclusive purpose of hopping
---
Cant play if you're dead o:
---
Lollll bud I've asked three times now, what does "Classic Summer" mean then? (: You said we did not recieve it and that Blizzard are lying. When you make a claim, the burden of proof lays with you (:

Yes but their given proposal of each continent being a layer would be the same as going to kalimdor / ek.
---
.....because classic had flying mounts?

If they keep the original cooldown the paid transfer was introduced with back in 1.11 (6 months) the ninjaing factor will at the least be somewhat mitigated.
---
Guilds going for greener pastures is definitely a concern, but maybe the more experienced (overall) player pool will help counter-act that desire.
---
And what happens when in your option 1 50% of the population was tourists and you are now level 50 on a server with 1.2k pop
---
Mmo-sa. The most delicious of alcoholic beverages.
---
Its not Cross-Server....
---
It amazes me how well people can do at NOT listening.
---
Pleb.
---
TGC codes are TBC.
---
Almost 30, just got my AA. Better late than never, keep it up!
---
I wouldn't say economy. That will shift every phase.
---
I don't like the potential effect on the community, though
---
Lol okay rick. But seriously having layering will result in exploitation. I would rather have Deathwing 1 Deathwing2 Deathwing 3 and merge them after 3 or 4 months.
---
So in that case, the people in the less populated layer will be selling invites to the low pop layer full of mats and rare spawns. That's the problem. The amount of people in the layer doesn't matter, if there's a layer at all it will be open for abuse
---
The even worse part is potential guild scalping. Losing your main tank to another guild on another server is heartbreaking. LOL
---
Agreed. I mean I get it, small changes have unintended corrosive effects on the game and a player's sense of identity within it.
---
My point I'm trying to make is about how much xrealm BGs changed that server identity. Did xrealm change server identity? Yes, a little. Was it a total loss of pvp identity? I don't think so.
---
In a totally pug WSG game at least 5 people will still be from your server, and with premades you'd oftentimes go against your server's faction counterpart. It was a handful of servers in a group, not the endless sea of faceless players like retail.
---
GG the economy of high end materials of Black Lotus and Devilsaurs.
---
i got depression/adhd/ocd. i too am feeling this game will be a saviour for myself
---
Well yeah it can be misused but it seems far better than just flat disabling it and screwing over 99% of the legitimate cases where it would be used, like when someone moves overseas, or wants to play with a new group of friends they found on another server.
---
I was just making sure you knew it will be hectic as some people thing we'll be split apart to the point of no real competition or craziness. No need to be hostile. I think it would best if you couldn't change layers once you join a guild to avoid hiding. I want to feel like world is populated by the same people.
---
Yes, how dare we want coherent realms for a game that had coherent realms.
---
Also good point
---
If there's 1200 players in Barrens it's still unplayable, so how exactly will this layer solve this? 
---
At that point we're back to dynamic respawns, which again removes the need for the fucking layers.
---
They should at least come up with a more reasonable alternative instead of just making them impossible for anyone to get.
---
Their goal is to provide as close to an authentic vanilla experience as possible. If they're just going to not even put the unarmored mounts in the game at all, they're not trying hard enough.
---
So annoying. Basically release it when summer is over.
---
My windows sit along their playground, so the noise is deafening all day long.
---
Unlike reasonable pre-k who have maybe 2 hours of yard time a day, this school has children outside 6-7 hours a day. It is an expensive private school and have basically refused to do anything about their excessive noise pollution in any way.
---
I'm looking into lawyers cus it's genuinely affecting mine and my family's health.

Do you not understand the concept of a budget and talent assigned to a team?
---
You think billion dollar corporation activation couldn't get this done if they wanted when a few guys chilling in their under wear did?
---
I've got a bridge to sell you
---
Where am I gonna find you proof 14 years after the fact? Account transaction history got wiped when they updated battle.net, only goes back to 2010.
---
On one hand they can't have people getting their free vanilla fix from beta servers and then bailing before release  
---
but on the other hand they can fuck right off with the *For ONLY $14.99 your subscription now has a CHANCE to TITANFORGE into CLASSIC BETA ACCESS*
---
&gt;or you can’t find someone that’s not in the same layer as you.
---
Are you really that dense? You can't think of any ways to find others in another layer? in 2019?
---
Yeah, only for phase 1, the most important phase for establishing a community and an economy.
---
100% sure it’s just impatience.
---
Yeh, we did that in vanilla. It was called making a new character, and it was fine and happened all the time and nobody bitched about it.
---
As an EU nolifer i kinda like the midnight release, i can use the unpopular morning hours to "get ahead of the pack" and then stay ahead because they hinder each other whilst leveling at daytime :3
---
By data values do you mean experience and drop rates, etc. Because I don't mind if those are altered a bit *wink wink*
---
“Summer” release
---
"Most surprising to me, got them to openly state that developing brand new level 60 content after Phase 6 and Naxx is possible if the fan support is there."
---
I honestly am I all for this so long as the content is consistent with the vanilla philosophy. Also could even break it down by servers that will never progress and those that do add NEW content. I would NOT like to go from classic-&gt;tbc-&gt;wotlk.
---
There is undoubtedly going to be a huge spike and a drop. Especially since it’s bundled with retail. Is that even a question?
---
What if they simply give you the option to copy your character to a "classic progression" server while keeping the original toon on a fully cleared Naxx server?  I feel like that literally solves everyone's issue.
---
Remain on a fully cleared vanilla server, AND check out cool new stuff IF you want.  Win win imo.
---
Hi, /u/powerfist89
---
You’re right but let’s be real, if you made plans with somebody ‘in the summer’ nobody would think you’re talking as late as sept 23.  It’s a cultural thing.
---
Yep. Completely true. How about this guy gives us proof of these perfect servers he remembers instead? Anyone else think these pristine servers were real?
---
Remind me of how you can mount while in combat/stunned/dazed...
---
&gt; closed beta that of course streamers get access to and us plebs just have to get lucky.
---
Betas have always been exclusive. You have no "right" to be in them. Only dumb, new gamer kids think like this.
---
Clearly these people have not.  They're all talking out of their asses.  I've played on fresh servers with 15000 players.. it's the greatest thing ever!
---
I would pay to replay their content up to Legion. If they want to stop at WOLTK, that's fine too. Think about it, paying to replay the same content again. But I would. They'd make years worth of money off me, for something I already paid for once. It'd be a no brainer, instant sale to play progression servers.
---
I'd basically be paying for old design, which I prefer over this modern mess of BFA.
---
No u
---
Today there's a tourist attitude towards new games, whatever the new game may be. Whatever number you think will try out classic day 1, multiply that number by 10. Gaming tourism is HUGE today and no matter how good Classic Wow is it will only capture a fraction of the tourism community.
---
Man everyone knows all about layering.... think of server layering as mini servers that at a certain point become one.. thats all it is really
---
We're talking about Blizzard. They say a lot of things. They said a classic summer yet we're getting it in at the end of august.
---
I guarantee you they will stretch the layering out as long as they can because it's more beneficial to them
---
Argh, this is rough. If you’ve got your pets on say an EU server originally but now will be playing on an ANZ server you will not get access to your pets. It’s based on what you’ve redeemed already.
---
source?
---
Completely agree.
---
The general consensus around here is that we’ll be able to get some pretty sophisticated addons in Classic that are not available on private servers. This makes me confident that focus framed will be a thing in Classic.
---
Wont lie, I dont get it
---
How does this solve not having a que when 10k people are trying to get onto one server?
---
Most realms will have 1 layer, the largest will have like 5. Even layer will have thousands of people with the same idea as you. Have fun getting level 10 greens when everyone else will be leveling.
---
Yup, Monday at 3..LET THE NERD RACE BEGIN!!!!
---
The vanilla wow Collectors edition is attached to the wow account, not the servers or region.
---
The queues in WoD didn't _actually_ last that long.  And it's still not even close to 10k.  I never once saw a queue anywhere NEAR 10k in vanilla.
---
&gt;  so I assume there will be some way to manipulate layers by joining and leaving groups or raids.
---
100%. There will day 1 addons that do it, and there will be plenty of other ways to do it.
---
First law of security is if there's something that can be abused, it will be abused. It's not even a question, people will absolutely take advantage of layering
---
I am so excited to get ganked on my alt by some shitlord 60 running around STV. Swap to my main and be on a different shard and never find them.
---
Don’t ever feel embarrassed or ashamed about liking things.
---
Unless it’s like really fucked up or something.
---
We can do it!
---
All I'm saying is it literally doesn't let me downvote this meme
---
oh come on... all this moaning about it being during the first week of classes is ridiculous.
---
If you weren't planning to cut classes to play WoW anyway then you were never planning to be truly hardcore
---
;-)
---
BINGO
---
&gt; Assuming that they have an indicator of which layer your in advertised and assuming you will be able to find someone not in your layer to invite you and assuming that layer isn't getting wrecked as well
---
How dense are you exactly? You really think it will be hard to find that? Especially when abusing it can be beneficiary? Sorry man, but you can't critically think if you think it won't be doable
---
Starting a 90 hr/week job...that has a lot of downtime in airports.
---
Public WiFi shall fear me.
---
No, I've played on fresh servers with 15000 concurrent players.  Done the aq events with several thousands of players in the zone.  Being surrounded by other players is what classic wow is all about.
---
To temporarily increase the size of the server. You still have to have some sort of maximum of what your server holds because like you said, condensing 10k to 5k could get messy.
---
And we don't know yet what the caps will be and how large the layers will be. Maybe the layer is a direct capacity copy, maybe it's only an extra 1-2k.
---
"Michael - I have lined the inside of the banana stand with $250,000 in stacks of $100's. Literally. Go and retrieve it."
---
yeah thats what they should do imo, just allow you to copy your character over to a post naxx server, and do the same when BC comes out, allow you to just copy to the BC servers rather then progressive vanilla servers
---
Good on you, mate. That shit takes forever when life doesn't allow you to take two years off to attend school full-time. Seems everyone and their mother had an Associates by age 20. Man, if only I had them working-class parents. :/
---
u mad?
---
&gt; How do you get your buddy on a different layer? How do you even know he's on a different layer to begin with other than physically trying to meet him in the world somewhere?
---
How are you stupid enough to not realize these questions have very simple answers?
---
There's very little to no _active_ load balancing.  Layers are supposedly much less aggressive at re-allocating players to different instances to compensate for population variance.
---
Which makes sense.  You can't have a cohesive layer where people aren't phasing in and out _and_ have active load balancing at the same time.  They're mutually exclusive.
---
i mean its only going to matter for the first few weeks. They said it will be going away after the initial chaos and will never come back to the game again even for new patch drops
---
someone link this guy the ed lawbringer tanking patch vid
---
So fkin pumped
---
They could, or should have separate servers for it. A classic server(s), then TBC server(s), then WOLTK server(s). Play the era you want, but they could all be separate.
---
Only a sith deals in absolutes.
---
Or... I wouldn't speak definitively unless you're a WoW Dev. Is that you, Ion?
---
You're missing even more from the login queue screen.
---
But at the same time the files for "Modern" are literally installed in a "retail" folder lol
---
WOW
---
the only transfers they should allow imo are transferring from high pop to low pop just like they used to. you should be planning ahead for what server youre going to play on with friends since theyre releasing a realm list and allowing you to reserve names ahead of time so theres no need to transfer a character really.
---
It's pretty clear you never played classic wow if that's what you're thinking.
---
What about the mats and rare spawns? You couldn't think of that kinda abuse? I mean if you can't critically think about how layering can be abused why would I expect you to know it's not a good thing
---
It was at the height of WoW popularity, and a lot of people liked WOLTK. If they keep it on separate servers, then you never have to leave classic. Separate servers would mean you could play classic, or TBC, or WOLTK as you wish.
---
What are you talking about? I never said everything was about me.
---
Nah don’t worry buddy I can resurrect you after that 3 months as Death Knight...Oh wait
---
why did we need to know this?
---
Sorry bro, I'm in #nochanges camp. It was in 1.12, it should be in Classic (imo). Good luck getting Classic changed to whatever you think it should be though.
---
\+ every popular streamer that wants to cash in on the hype
---
Hi, /u/luxembourgs
---
The word you are looking for is anhedonia. The fact that the original game is getting a re-release and being supported by an official server, after years of Blizzard saying, "No we aren't doing this.", isn't enough; should tell you all you need to know about these people.
---
I mean fuck, I never even got to play classic wow. And now I'm hearing that it has an official release of August 27th, and they might even throw in TBC, and WoTLK?! Are you fucking kidding me? People should be ecstatic about this. These games are basically cornerstones of video game history that will be talked about 100 years from now. 
---
And yet here we are, with a bunch of grown ass baby men pissing their pants about a compromise being made so everyone can play when it launches, so it's smooth, and so literal physical server blades don't fucking burst into flames. 
---
Even Ion said, "There will never be layering after phase 1", and it's still not good enough! I'm convinced you could give these people the launch they want, and they would log out of the game pissed off at something else.
---
Yes, and that was what they originally said - just the starter zones. Then it was the whole continent, now it's just for phase 1. Soon is be just for phase 1 and 2 - then it will become permanent
---
Can I play this on a 2010 mac again
---
I love this
---
OMG this was fantastic
---
Highly doubtful that by the time players are that level layering will even be a thing.
---
Dont forget, if you are NA, the game comes out @ 3pm on the 26th
---
I know, I played one as my main in vanilla.
---
When mangle became a thing in the pre-patch and into TBC... Feral druids became fuxking monsters.
---
With that knowledge, I ain't playing druid in classic.
---
That’s the thing, it’s not going to be anything like real vanilla launch was. Wow wasn’t that huge (relatively) to what it is now and will be on launch. 
---
It’s going to be 100x worse if they do nothing.
---
I'd imagine they charge money for the character copy as well.
---
Try doing this on a Warrior and see how "easy" it is.

You're hilarious. You're on the sub of a game people are hyped over BECAUSE OF ALL THE BAD DECISIONS BLIZZARD MADE TO THE CURRENT GAME. You just expect them to not make shit decisions because they say it's classic? It's still actiblizzard my friend, and layering saves them money so they will do it as long as they need

Different than theTBC TCG then? I have TCG pets on my EU account but they aren’t available on my Oceanic. I asked blizzard if I could transfer them but it’s not allowed.

Along with bad AV, dishonorable kills Fucking up world PvP... looking not that interesting anymore.
---
It was not in 1.12.  It started in the TBC pre-patch. I would know because that is when my guild hopped to a "better" server and it was a shitty experience.
---
Will this have updated or original graphics does anyone know?
---
Actually no. I don't really watch Twitch all that often. Just wanted to point out that you sound like tool.
---
It's the old design I am paying for, really. I'd be happy to give them years worth of additional moneys if they did progression servers. I'd be willing to pay for any progression up to Legion. Post Legion is where I draw the line.
---
Go to pvp and Just rp there. Will be fun.
---
bruh
---
*Whaaaaat?!* not us! Nah, get out of here, *that's* crazy.

Youts?
---
Jesus he has 30+ buffs. 
---
How much DPS is he really putting out relative to other classes?
---
It was added in TBC I think...but there wasn't an actual modal for it. It just acted as a target for @focus commands. And you needed to use a script to set a focus.
---
You mean divorce?
---
Because when you cross into Westfall you would have the exact same problem. 2k people doing 1 quest. And I ask you this: what is more immersive:
---
1. Playing in a layer, seeming a large amount of people around. You quest with the people around you and team up for Hogger at lvl 10. You kill him, thank your group and most of you move onto Westfall. In westfall you meet the same people and you can greet each other and continue on your journey.
---
2.. Playing in a shard. seeming a medium amount of people around. You quest with the people around you and team up for Hogger at lvl 10. You kill him, thank your group and most of you move onto Westfall. You walk across the bridge together and suddenly 1500 people phase in. You cant even see the person you just walked across the bridhe with in the sea of people that just appeared out of thin air.
---
im ok with that as long as it got a fairly long cooldown (someone wrote 6 months). Although i think the name-changing part of the server transfer is worse than the server-changing part. I like having a permanent reputation stick to my character once again..
---
Yes yes you are... you're so worried about a streamer being on a server and it ruining YOUR experience... you're not the fucking streamer everyone is following...
---
amen
---
No you'll always be kept in the same layer
---
Give the title Godslayer to the first 40 man raid to pull it off #changes
---
Wings for Marie 😭😭😭
---
put "\" before the hashtag to make it show up
---
Oh I see. The stick is up your butt.
---
Bold moves hope it works out.
---
This is literally the only thing about layering that worries me, I'm glad someone else gets it. Because as of right now it looks like some servers will turn into a 12k population sh*t show after phase 1.
---
“Classic Summer” implies you get to play classic throughout a significant portion of the summer, not just have it tossed in at the end.
---
I’d be jealous of you enjoy both your trips.
---
After a while there will just be a queue and people will have to deal with it. Most servers will normalize after players drop off as the hype dies. Some streamer servers will remain super populated but thats on those people who choose to roll there.

Their musicianship is High Warlord status
---
r/unexpectedfreefolk
---
Nochanges
---
It shouldn't drastically. Most private servers have increased herb/mob spawn rates that are probably more detrimental than anything on classic will be.
---
I'm also wondering if this might be a mistake but towards the other end, being logged of during raid times on shattered hand EU in vanilla could mean you lost your raid spot as i want to remember some 30min queues.
---
What happens if not enough players stop playing after phase 1?
---
The one that understands arithmetic .
---
ah yes, not playing the game you want to play is so much fun.
---
Black Lotus
---
and you can expect world PvP in every layer.
---
and you can be sure people will be vocal in general chat about it, especially if you seek it around the usual PvP spot : blackrock mountain, tarren mill, STV, tanaris... redridge mountains......
---
 atleast until instanced BG comes out, at which point world PvP will suddently vanish.
---
Ressource : you'll have X times the ressource and X times the player. supply and demand remain balanced.
---
Population : doesn't happen on live server where there's sharding everywhere. Definately not an issue for the first month where pop will be at it's highest. there's a thing called load-balancing, it's amazing.
---
next argument?
---
May the nerdiest of us prevail. Ha in all honesty I’m hoping to be 20 the second day so it’s going to be fun to see who’s highest in the zones when I logout and then back in on day 2.
---
30 is the year. As in 2030. August 2030.
---
Interesting, I wonder
---
A little early to be getting into this debate, but if people say "no changes" for classic, then I say no changes to any expansion. Release them as they were.
---
Each layer holds say 3000. 
---
At 3000 people you have 1 world per 3000 people.
---
At 3500 you have now have two worlds, and a ratio of  1 world per 1750 people. Right off the bat it will be different and thats  not even going into people exploiting it or getting lucky being dropped into fresh layer with unlooted spawns/less competition.

Tips: "uhh Yea, Yea, fantastic." 
---
This simian is an intolerably worthless conversationalist.
---
I had the opposite experience. I would level slowly, enjoy the quest texts, explore, and always noticed the same few people that leveled at my speed as well. Now they'll just be jumbled between the layers.
---
iirc the database lag was so bad when I was questing through westfall. You'd try to loot something and be stuck in loot pose but could still move. In the end the whole party was gliding round westfall in that position.
---
So did blizzard say that they were gonna remove the unarmored ones after a month and make it this rare mount that no one else can get later in the original vanilla? No they did not and it’s a huge difference.
---
People knowing beforehand that something is gonna be time limited is definitively not classic wow philosophy, there was zero stress of rushing.
---
From my understanding, you choose to roll on Server X.
---
Server X will have 3 layers, and after phase 1 all 3 layers will merge.
---
What if all 3 layers are all close to being maxed out after Phase 1? Are you going to end up with a 9k server after Phase 1? What then?
---
I can easily see people exploiting layering: Avoiding ganks/WPVP? Rare mob farming? Selling Brokentooth? Nodes farming? Exploiting devilsaur and black lotus farming?
---
Why not have separate 3 versions of the same server name, but without layering? (ie. Kel'Thuzad A, Kel'thuzad B, Kel'thuzad C)
---
If one of the version dies out, merge it with whatever has a lower population of the other 2 versions? Character names can be restricted across the versions.
---
Don't play lmao
---
You can mount before the ganker attacks you...
---
Write and answer with truth and i will also respond.
---
even vs my 14-16 hours daily? thats a bold claim, sir. but i have never seen you play so...
---
You seem to be misunderstanding. You can absolutely end up not seeing someone you previously saw with layering, and it will 100% be taken advantage of.
---
Iv done the same and loved every minute of it becasue im invested in the world not in rushing to level 60.
---
&gt; Write and answer with truth and i will also respond.
---
Well shit, I was annoyed it was at the end of the summer but I'm not in school anymore and I have a job so I guess it doesn't matter
---
Amazing! Thank you for this, I'm so glad I stumbled upon this post albeit late. I thought I was running out of hunter info and then boom. Best you could ask for. 
---
I'm an aspiring min/max classic hunter while being a retail min/max rogue and I got a couple of questions if you could throw a quick answer, please.  
---
1. So I guess weapon swapping isn't a thing due to the GCD? For example binding stat sticks when ranged and 2-H when melee. Won't that 1-1.5 gcd fit while moving between the 3yd deadzone?
---
2. Do you ever play with a wolf (while MM/SV specced) so you can always line your howl with your Aimed Shot, or is cat dps just flat out better even when not specced into BM?
---
3. For pre-raid and MC/Onyxia is it better to go 3/3 surefooted and only 2/5 IAotH ?
---
good to know, thanks. feeling very confident about it now.
---
Not to mention they said they're only picking dedicated players, so if you haven't been subbed for awhile you're not getting picked
---
This. If it were for an expansion I've never seen, I might want to beta it out of curiosity and to learn the best routes.
---
But I've played vanilla, I've played private servers. I'll pass on this beta, since I don't get to keep the character. I'd rather use that last bit of summer to get outdoors, eat right, do laundry. Because when classic hits for real, that stuff might take a back seat.
---
&gt; Why not just do layering in 1-10 or 1-20 zones?
---
I got the impression that the "layer" is the entire continuous open area. So if you just layered the 1-20 zones people would have to zone in and out when they reached the Darkshore-Ashenvale border, for example. Whereas if they layer the entire thing, players see a seamless experience.
---
This is complete 100% guesswork.
---
You’re actually saying that Blizzard market strategy should be that they need to focus on May releases for students in mind to make more money. It’s not just a bummer post, nice try on trying to get on the high horse.
---
No it's quite obvious. The monthly paid betas... It's genuinely just a ploy to get lots of subscriber money.
---
It's not the size that matters big boy, it's the fact it can be abused
---
That is a whole never level of boredom I have never reached and hope to never do so
---
because the server queues would be tied to the servers. In your example there could be significant queue times on KelThuzad A and Kelthuzad B, whereas the layer option would just add another layer. I think long queue times arent sustainable anymore in 2019.
---
creating soon-to-be-merged servers wouldnt help except name locking etc (so someone cant create a name on KT - A when ones already existing at KT - C )  
---
i understand the implications of being able to move  dynamically between layers but it still sounds like the best solution possible to me...
---
But if you hop on to Layer 2 to avoid being killed by Jimmy, and your Layer 1 friend is all the way in Hinterlands instead of STV with you, how the fuck does he know when Jimmy is gone and Zoe is rezzed for you to come back to Layer 1 and gank her again? Your logic is supremely flawed for this point.
---
And then the rest of your post is somehow even more stupid than that point, so I'm not even going to try and continue to argue it.
---
It's not their fault you interpreted it incorrectly.
---
although I find farming herbs and listening to youtube videos/podcasts a great way to unwind after work, so I may just do this.  It's not worth it **if** you don't find it enjoyable, which I sort of do.
---
&gt; My concern is how it affects farming and crafting.
---
Which it will effect BIGLY
---
I love how OP is being destroyed with downvotes in all of his responses. The game won’t die because it was released at the end of August instead of the beginning of August. 
---
People... it’s like they’ve never seen a game come out at the end of summer/beginning of fall. You know, when most games seem to be released.
---
You seem like the sort of dumb ass who spends 500 bucks a month of his parents' money on phone apps and then tries to impress chicks with it.
---
My second child is due 1 week before launch... I feel you brother
---
Shame on me 😯
---
&gt; On retail with sharding trade chat is still realmwide/realmbound. General chat is unique to each shard though.
---
Do you actually think there won't be ways to find other people in other layers? In 2019?
---
You can change layer by getting invited by a group on another layer.
---
I said september i was close
---
we don't know how long phase 1 will be, or if they even stick to that
---
Your latest Twitch broadcast has a grand total of six views. If you think any of this concerns you as a streamer you're flattering yourself. You're clearly just stubborn. Again, most of the people on this thread agrees with me. Like I said, Blizzard themselves have acknowledged the problem (which you insist doesn't exist) and have offered free realm changes for those who get stuck on a streamer realm.
---
Let's get one thing clear since you have been having trouble grasping this concept. The only problematic streamers are the big ones. There are fewer than 10 WoW streamers big enough to get obnoxious. You are not one of them so there is no reason for you to get insulted.
---
Since the problem has been resolved by Blizzard and you are clearly just taking offence to things that don't concern you, I will no longer entertain your childish comments. Please don't reply to this comment if it's just to bitch about how you don't think the problem exists.
---
If you do insist on arguing about this subject, there are many other posts discussing the streamer problem.
---
"He called the shit poop!"
---
You're not getting it. It can and will be abused. It won't be a 1:1 ever
---
Blizzard, please, NO LAYERING AT ALL. I don't mind sitting in queue for an hour. Sharding is the worst thing to happen in retail, I hate it so fucking much. I don't want layering in for weeks, hours or even seconds.
---
That would be even easier to abuse
---
How will it be hard? There will be a discord for it on day 1
---
Absolutely us.
---
&gt; they said for a month at max,
---
and previously they said not at all. See where this going?
---
Layering sounds like a much more acceptable version of sharding. I say this as an avid anti shard fanatic lol.
---
Are they trash at fresh 60? I don’t want to have to reroll if my class is garbage for the first few months at launch
---
Labor day weekend will be a black out week for vacations for a lot of jobs in US.
---
smh you all know it's only for a month yeah? I mean I'm as cynical as anyone else about Blizzard but - like, it's more realistic than private servers in that the server sizes are technically going to be closer to actual vanilla than 12k pop or whatever, and that only exists for the first month. I guarantee you won't give a toss about layering in four months time. There's like 3000 people in each layer, it's not like there's going to be private little layers with mass amounts of devilsaurs and black lotus.
---
&gt; You're going to have to hope that someone knows they are actually on the lower pop layer, and then hope that you would xfer to that layer and not vice versa.
---
I'm having a really hard time understanding why you think it's going to be hard to know if you're on a different layer
---
It'd be nice to have like, "a new dragon in a previously undisclosed cave is causing a ruckus, kill it with a 40man!", and the dragon drops like, leather gear with defense rating to help feral druid a little, as opposed to just a better version of naxx gear, etc.
---
by veteran, do you mean private server veterans or retail wow veterans? because private server veterans will be playing a lot more efficiently than retail vets imo
---
Sure. You're not wrong.
---
Followed the same steps, managed to repeat the bug. Definitely a bug here!
---
My original guess, with sharding, was that blizz doesn't have the ability to shard specific zones differently.
---
That seems to be the case, otherwise there isn't a reason to shard/layer the entire world.  It must just be the best solution from a development standpoint.
---
I'm glad they are meeting the community half way while realizing the problems sharding causes to the living world.
---
Funny, but unfortunately that won't result in me ending up in a BG with people that I can actually recognise instead of cross-realm nobodies.
---
For years we've fought to get vanilla back, and get back the golden era in which we had to actually form a party and run to the dungeon, with all the hassle and inconveniences that accompany it. Just so that we could have experiences, friendships and a community that actually matter.
---
It's unfortunate that so many people who fought so hard against cross-realm LFG don't understand that cross-realm BG's is literally as atrocious. Apparently 30 minutes forming a party is A-OK but waiting 30 minutes to get an actually fun BG is just flat out unacceptable.
---
Vanilla WoW + Tool album release. WHAT YEAR IS IT?
---
So are you saying people will be able to trade items between layers and move between layers to farm? Not sure it'll work that way but ok
---
its a retarded typical activision excuse. they take out the cool mounts to cater to the casuals, thats why retail is shit and i hate to see that aproach with classic.
---
I mean thats something that has been kind of a question since its original announcement...i have just been caling it current and classic
---
But before classic, even the devs called it retail.
---
It should work in classic. 
---
It does not work in retail. It occurs because of how spell batching worked in vanilla wow (400ms ticks) and blizzard have said that they are going to attempt to recreate this in classic.
---
So, as an athlete, training for a competition is just being impatient and devaluing the day of the competition?
---
So, like, you just don’t read, huh?
---
I've always leveled as Arms. Sweeping Strikes is amazing. Overpower crit is amazing. Anger management is amazing. Axe Specialization with WW axe... /drool. 
---
Also don't forget, Wpvp is amazing as Arms. 
---
Early levels I would use the hamstring method. Once you get some decent gear you won't need to as much.
---
I mean, this sounds immensely better than a huge number of dead servers 6 months after launch, or awful unplayable lag in the starting zones.
---
The literal definition of layering means that won't be the case and they've already said inviting someone will bring them to the layer so that makes it 100% not what you're saying
---
The Patient. On repeat. For 11 more years.
---
Gonna wait it out.
---
Dun mroogh was my wakeup alarm for the longest time ever. Now it's strangle thorn vale.
---
Omg omg omg 😍😭😭😭
---
&gt; Please stop repeating nonsense you have heard.
---
I was an active Naxx raider in Vanilla and have [Atiesh on my priest](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/character/us/dragonblight/hakot). This isn't hearsay but experience. 
---
That said, I sort of erred and should clarify that the quest greens were better than **most** gear most players had. The amount of Naxx raiders that were full-clearing content was nowhere near the amount of people clearing BWL and most of AQ40.
---
&gt; What I'm not totally understanding, is what (in this example) is the difference between a layer with 3k active players and a server with 3k active players?
---
I don't know how else to explain it other than how I already have.  The other layer is still your server.  The people in it are your servermates (many of whom you're likely to have intermingled with at some point or another).  You're sharing the same AH.  You're [possibly] talking in the same chat channels.  YET, you're experiencing different versions of the game world, each of which lacks true persistence.  That's antithetical to an MMO.
---
&gt; but it seems like a more reasonable solution than pre-planned server merges? To me that seems more discoherent in the long term than temporary layering...
---
The merging of multiple discreet, coherent game worlds into a single coherent game world does not at any point introduce decoherence.  Running different instances of the same game world on the same server does.  Especially when you have something like a single coherent AH being shared between them.  One byproduct of this will be the presence of several times as many resources floating around as there should be.
---
That's all I can really say about this.
---
But dryers is 99% overrun. B&amp;J is only 21%!
---
(though technique also matters. Turkey Hill is 97% overrun, but is actually superior to B&amp;J both in flavor, mouth feel, and consistency).
---
My only worry with layering is I hope they understand. Those zones still need to be crowded as fuck. Not mobbed to unplayable but, soloing should not be an option for a while. At least in my opinion.
---
What will the price be ?
---
Are you saying it's hard to find people in other layers? Because it won't be. There will be stuff for that ready to go at hour 0. Hell a simple discord channel is all you need
---
Layers hold thousands of people, I wouldn't be too worried about this. They aren't random, they're still on your server and even if you never saw them on the same layer, once layers are disabled you'll both be there.
---
Without this you would see so many hordes of players I doubt there would be so much close interaction.
---
It should be the father telling his wife and kids
---
Wasn’t starting zones only sharded the original plan for classic? 
---
Also, did you watch tips + someone interview with 2 classic devs? I watched the video through Kargoz’s stream so I don’t have the direct link, but they were saying that the phase 1 should be by the end of the first month best case scenario, which indicates that it could be longer, or maybe a little bit shorter. 
---
Also, your second paragraph has nothing to do with what I was talking about so I’m still unsure how to respond other than how I just did above.
---
They might. They're planning stress tests so you might see an influx of invited around those times.
---
I haven't made my mind up whether I like that or not.  Decursive addon was a *requirement* to join my guild back in the day, and that won't be the same. But that is not a big issue.
---
My only request is that autoattack spell is changed, or /startattack command is added. Currently every melee should have this macro to activate autoattack without canceling it:
---
&gt; /script if not IsCurrentAction(24) then UseAction(24) end;
---
This wont work anymore, and will change dps classes quite a bit.
---
I am not from the US but you mean it will be impossible for a lot of people to take holidays in that week?
---
im so angry about that. it just shows they still havent learnt
---
Wotlk had some flying required zones and so did TBC, in an ideal world they'd rework them and put in some elevators or some other mechanics so flying isn't required, because as convenient as flying is, it makes the world so small and kills off any world pvp.
---
How old are you?
---
You absolutely want Relentless Strikes. If you really want to min/max (and I'm assuming this is a level 60 combat dagger raiding build) you should move the 2 points from murder and take 2/3 Ruthlessness for MC, or 2/3 Improved Eviscerate if you're finding that you're Eviscerating often enough as a combo point dump. Murder won't apply to about 60% of the bosses in MC. For BWL you can take murder.
---
Are you planning to run swords until you get your hands on a Perd or Felstriker? Or are you going to run blue daggers from the get go?
---
August 13 people will be able to reserve their names on servers. This is when streamers and youtubers will pick their servers. Do your research and avoid them
---
&gt; So by the time things have chilled out, and layers are no longer necessary
---
Wait, this sub told me only haters think the game's population will die out. Now they're saying that it will so they can convince themselves layering is okay? You guys are fickle bitches
---
