---
Fuck no I would not need on it.
---

---
What the hell is wrong with you? Are your principles so flimsy that all it takes is a  shiny purple item in a video game to knock them over?
---
PServers are full of modern day drama and toxic greed from people who have grown up with matchmaking in games. No need for people to consider their reputation.
---
(Compared to Vanilla that is. There are definitely worse games out there.)
---
Imagine working with a company where there is so much red tape it takes that much approval for a blog post. No wonder Blizzard has hit the fucking skids lately.
---
To add onto your first point about feeling slow, unrewarding and boring, I disagree.  Well, about the unrewarding part, and maybe the boring part.  The rewards felt real back then, compared to recent expansions where gear is shoved at you constantly for little effort.  Doesn't feel as rewarding as classic IMO.
---
I personally think hunters have a higher skill cap in PvP, check some videos if you are unsure. [Hunter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O4FA16PU44), [Warlock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3iHXZXx7g0)

---
I'm not sure you understand how hard it is for even an undead rogue to win that duel. He has to use Clutch of Foresight. If you are using 1 time consumables in duels just to win, you would probably lose if the enemy was able to use them as well. Could you imagine if the warlock used Light of Elune?
---
Imagine a world without BoP.  There's no need.  No greed.  Just "Roll" and "pass".  
---
Doesn't matter if you're solo grinding, doing quests as a group, or in a dungeon.  It's all just "roll/pass".  Now imagine that instead of your theoretical "safe zone" of 100% being grouped with friends/guildies you are with at least 1-4 other random people.  In this world, according to about 60% of the people in this thread, everyone would roll "need" on every item because "everyone needs gold!".
---
This is your worst nightmare.  The world where everyone rolls "need" for boe's because "everyone needs gold" is such a laughably idiotic fallacy I'm sure I'll get downvotes for even mentioning this apparently unpopular opinon.
---
Imagine in this world where despite the drop being Green/Blue/Purple, you keep losing ACTUAL upgrades to your gear because everyone rolls need.  That's the world that this mindset is building.   The only thing that matters is apparently the lack of trust 90% of the population has regarding some random person 'need-ninjaing' a blue/purple and then not equipping it.  Oh, and for the record: there are some blue/purple BoE's at the 50-60 range that ARE BIS.  Enjoy losing a possible BiS blue/purple in that possible circumstance because everyone's acting greedy, instead of being respectful/trustful.
---
&amp;#x200B;

Im betting that the content rollout will be far more nuanced and perfected than that picture. I get that vibe from Ythsiens interviews and how he said stuff like: "The No changes guys are going to win more than they realize..." Its little stuff like the content patch rollout that they can fix during this development time to make the community pretty happy. Im betting the releases aren't all bunched up like that.
---
Oh, makes sense. I was thinking of twinks as lvl 19, but I suppose with decent server population there would be an interest in 39s.
---
"Raiders" 
---
For pronunciation;
---
Lore-dare-in for Lordaeron
---
Gnomer-Reagan for Gnomeregan
---
Sometimes I would call Orgrimmar Doomhammermar for the lolz
---
I think a majority of people thought Stromgarde was Stormgarde
---
Vanilla rules:
---
Need for need, greed for enchanting and pass for everyone else. 
---
Amazing lol. 
---
My personal Russian story -
---
We were in SM Library, he was a mage. All instance sheeped the wrong mob, if any at all. Only thing he said the whole time was trying to hold up the group by telling them to wait for him to drink, as the lowest dps spamming random inefficient spells. 
---
Everyone just kind of laughed it off/ignored him as it was to be expected, and the tank had given up trying to mark since there was no predicting what he'd do. Then finally on the very last pull, with two monks before the boss, tank decides to mark one of them for sheep. We wait for a second, and the guy just straight casts BLIZZARD on them to pull. Amazing. We all had a good laugh at him, while surely he had no idea what anyone found to be funny. 
---
A unique experience for sure. 
---
My bad, I remembered some of our tanks running some frost resist but it was probably the ones kiting the adds in P3 and not the MT. 
---
Unethical life pro tip. Save your shitty greens when you upgrade to blues. Equip them during random pug groups, and roll need on BoE's. 
---
You think complete radio silence is a good thing? The only way to get news about classic is ask someone who just got fired from Blizzard.
---
UD spriest.
---
If it’s not some big stuff like Edgemasters/Stockade Pauldrons nobody’s going to care. Who cares about some guy ninja’ing an SM drop or some lvl 30-40 epic?
---
Thanks Josh, a new episode is always a great way to spend a workday. Coincidentally, I binged every ScoreCraft last week. 
---
I think Barrens, Elwynn, STV, SFK, and Naxx have the best music. Naxx goes from creepy, to insane, to creepy again. Not to mention, the screams for help you hear in the background.
---
Getting a warning for insulting someone and getting a warning for swearing are not the same thing.
---
I imagine a /who 60 6 days after launch will give you a pretty good idea who could be in your first week raiding guild
---
My pleasure! Hope the workday goes quickly :)
---
Mining is for alts.
---
Ok and I am very sure he was very keen on his NDA. Several times he mentions "speculation" or how "this maybe completely incorrect" throughout the interview. This all hints to basically what is going on ^to ^a ^lesser ^degree. The guy obviously cares about the game very much and wants it to succeed. He pretty much hints at all our best possibilities for the game. 
---
The part where all the strings just go mad with plucking in tritones (I
---
Think) is amazing. I think it’s normally towards the spider part. The music and ambience of Naxxramas is 90% of the reason I want to raid it.
---
I don’t think it’s as great as people say it is. It has a cast time and a decent cool down. I would rate dwarf as more powerful racials in most pvp situations. Gnome still won’t give you wins vs mage/hunter but dwarf definitely gives you wins vs rogues.
---
I'm pretty sure that's only true early in the expansion. When the lock has late game gear, SL lock should win it.
---
Warsong Glutch instead of Warsong Gultch
---
Bllizzard wants to keep people tied to Retail in the meantime, it really shows.
---
You shouldn't be using regrowth as 8/12/31, perhaps only once per fight and in that case you use a rank 3 or 5. Don't downrank rejuv though. It take awhile until you get a hang of it. Just got to practice until you learn when to shapeshift so you don't do it for no reason. Druids are actually one of the most mana efficient classes in the game if you play it right.  
---
To be fair, we have zero proof that had Blizzard remained on it's own that it wouldn't have gone down the same road.  The industry follows trends - Activision is a terrible company, yes, but thinking that Blizzard would have done anything differently is a bit idealistic.
---
[removed]
---
Ideal raid comp is literally 8 Resto shamans, one for every group.
---
But they still bring mark, brez, tranquility. You still want like 2-3 of them, which is pretty similar to unters 3-4 
---
Comp depending
---
I'd sign the petition for this. It would be trivial for Blizz to implement. 
---
Sure go with product. The rest of your post I tried my best but couldn’t understand, I think you started incoherently rambling. Can you clear it up a bit, i had trouble with what you are communicating.

You are a low IQ individual. SAD!
---
&gt; I'd like to see them turn the "gates opening event" into something replayable, so that all players in Classic can experience the event.
---
Yeah on a new realm.
---
&gt;Otherwise, you're pushing every player who wants to do the event into speed-leveling to keep up with the bleeding-edge players.
---
This is the mindset Blizzard has been catering to that has ruined wow.  You can't all be rank 14, you can't all complete the scepter in time, you're not all going to be be close to best in slot, you're not all going to witness firsthand the death of KT before the realm dies.  If you're talking about just being there for the banging of the gong itself, if you're not 55+ almost a year into a server launch that's on you.

I enjoy Mining and Skinning because I don't need to think about them and they seldom cause me any stress.
---
I enjoy the prospect of looting my kills twice. (Skinning) Aint nothing better than killing turtles along the river all day for meat, skins, vendor trash, and the occasional blue.
---
Mining causes a bit of stress when something is too high level to loot but this is balanced by the mild erection I get when I see a Rich node.
---
Other professions require work and herbalism just never felt as good as mining or skinning.
---
what's a good one
---
Yeah you're really smart. Citing almost word for word what they said in the Blizzcon Classic panel then acting like you know anything about software development. That's why you had to ask reddit how to turn off your graphics card notifications right? I thought software developers knew how to troubleshoot. 
---
Forget the comedy, you should stick to writing fiction.
---
Funny, I don't remember having any business in Redridge as Horde at all. I often compare it to Stonetalon Mountain but I see you ~~night elf fuckers~~ dudes have a flight path at the peak.

I'm talking about copy/pasting text not playing.....
---
I started Vanilla when I was 8 years old in 2005. I was a huge fan of Vanilla, BC and Wrath, but subbed in and out for the rest of the game. It’s not my cup of tea anymore. I downloaded a private server a year ago and I’ve been loving it since, and I’m ecstatic Classic is right around the corner.
---
Everything *does* take a little bit longer, and if you just want to hit 60 and “beat the game”, Classic won’t be as fun for you as it will be for me. It takes time to form a group, travel to the dungeon, and figure out how to not die from some 5-elite trash packs. 
---
There’s an upside to that: it takes time to form a group, so people don’t leave at the first wipe. People actually socialize, because you exist in the same world as those people. 
---
Dungeoning is hands-down my favorite part of WoW, and since Wrath, it hasn’t been the same. I tried the Mythic keystone system in Legion, but instead of a hard skull-crushing challenge, it was more like bigger numbers you have to rush through in 20 mins... not the direction I was hoping for. 
---
I’d check out a few gameplay streams of the demos. You can get a lot of first-impression reactions about how much has changed; also, how much people just enjoy living in the old world, where everything is substantial and permanent in nature.
---
Don't know much about that SL Lock but the Shadow priest always wins? 😉
---
Seeing a hunter /hailing his pet bamed Satan made me chuckle. 
---
Outside of that, I can’t say I’ve seen that many clever names. Most I see are either 
---
* same name as the hunter
---
* some combination of obscene words
---
* a really dumb name (or the default Cat/Wolf name)
---
Are those wooden shin guards...to protect her rock shins?
---
But isn’t Classic going to likely have the ability to trade? So accidents won’t matter.
---
Definitley depends on what server you play on. Can't remember the realm name (maybe Frostwhisper) but the one I was playing on back in vanilla had several high-end premades on both sides running at least 12h/d, 7d/w. 
---
NOW YOU JUST PUT A BUTTON. YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO THAT? YOU WANT TO LOOK FOR PEOPLE TO PLAY WITH? YOU DONT WANT THAT
---
&gt; MC isn’t meant to be hard for an organized, experienced guild.
---
How did you come to that conclusion?
---
In a 1v1 like that a Warlock will win. The shadow priest is gonna run out of juice. That being said in group pvp. I would rather have he eng Shadow priest backing me. Shields and dispel magic too stronk.
---
Enchiladas is great but it’s a cash cow. Get a nice green/blue and instead of throwing it on the AH or vendor you DE for dust. 
---
That being said I’m rolling tailor/ench for my mage when classic drops. 
---
Confirmed here too. Standard practice in vanilla live and on every pserver as well. The people claiming otherwise dont understand 2 things: 1) the big picture and how much certain items go for like edgemasters/forors/ace of beasts/freezing band/Kang/etc and 2) how the drop tables work for that type of BoE loot. Those items are not something a player can come to the instance expecting to receive from a boss, they are random .01% loot from trash and as such are a lottery item, not something owed to a specific class. If you want to reserve loot, you specfically make a "X reserved" group (and watch how fast it doesnt get filled haha)
---
most private server class data is heavily skewed for mages as a large number of people make them as farm alts, though they shouldn't be that far behind the top 2.
---
I love those zones. The fear of death makes it all the more memorable.
---
Seriously, why are the quests in South Shore like 15 levels higher than Tarren Mill quests? However, numerous times I've seen Alliance players run north along the turtle river and completely leave me alone so we're cool.
---
Imagine being so low IQ you look through peoples comment history. SAD!
---
I only recently realized Dun Morogh is not "DONE MORE OH"  
---
I only noticed it after paying closer attention to the race intro cinematics.  
---
It wasn’t hard for hardcore guilds in Vanilla. It was barely a challenge for clueless casuals like I was in Vanilla.
---
Some will nod their head. Some will note it down. Most won't read it. Many that do will forget it. 
---
You'll save all of 5 people, MAYBE. 
---
You and me both, brother.
---
I just wanna log in for a few hours, kill mobs, and be left alone.
---
Depends on what time in Vanilla. Early on Spriest has the advantage especially against an Orc, but in BiS gear SL Lock becomes unbeatable and should reck the Spriest every single time. 
---
But Spriest is the 1v1 king vs all other classes. Warlocks struggle a lot against melee early on in Vanilla. 
---
Depends on the tier of gear. BIS Warlock, I say Warlock hands down. Felhunter pet devour magic, drain mana, and shadowward. I play both on a ~~~ server.
---
Priest doesn't have enough burst or sustain against lock.
---
&gt;You still want like 2-3 of them
---
And you don't think its shitty when you only bring 2-3 from a class in a 40 man raid? When warriors and mages are stacked to shit?
---
I agree with you, although i cant seem to enjoy the class as much without being a special snowflake but still dont wan to play druid lol
---
I thought that was enchanting?
---
shamans also have water walking, so just like druids can reach faster speeds on water aswell vs other classes, which can be useful to escape or kite.
---
How dare you sir! How very dare you!
---
All pirate server achievements are 100% totally legit unless you can prove beyond any doubt they are not legit by auditing the code yourself! Pirate server players are just so much better than anybody ever was in 2006 and that explains absolutely everything!
---
Now if you will excuse me I have just finished getting to sixty in three days /played while making 1000gp by grinding mobs in my super duper secret grinding spot, so it's time to clear MC in thirty minutes in levelling greens with my forty buddies using every flask and every consumable and world buff that exists which we all have unlimited quantities of.
---
/s
---
Imagine claiming you know a lick about software development, regurgitating what you heard while acting as if it's your own, then asking reddit how to disable something as simple as notifications. Embarrassing! 
---
Conversations over.
---
If you have a guild that is a mix of casual and more serious players that mix can be a godsend. 
---
Your hardcore BiS types just build and build priority, then get exactly what they want. People that can’t be bothered to farm pre-raid BiS or last tiers BiS get to pick up the rest.  
---
I feel like that’s better for something like a standard 40 man raid comp, than DKP. 
---
Dude I just owned your ass with FACTS and LOGIC while drinking your TEARS.
---
It's over /u/PartyAppeal - I have the high ground
---
Yea, I wouldn't want a SL lock for group pvp.
---
Lock gets access to T3 which probably makes a big difference if you're talking literally BiS, but before that I think spriest would have the advantage. Spriest healing scales with their damage, so you just can't ever kill them if they're also attacking and have mana, and they can do something like 15k damage before they run out of mana. It probably comes down really to who resists what considering they both will have 60 shadow resist so resisting a fear/silence/deathcoil will swing the fight a lot.
---
Playing vanilla is much different, and much more addicting. To the point where I'd rather put up with 500ms and gold spam whispers than play retail.
---
It actually feels like a world and even a shitty white item can feel rewarding.
---
The gear cycle on retail is seriously gross. Its just an endless cycle of ilevel gains and resets. Everything is just too bland and too easy.
---
What feels more rewarding? A glass of water in your house, or a glass of water after wandering the desert for 5 hours?
---
Anxiety about talking to (being around) new people here too.  I prefer the old way as well.  There were a number of conversations that started from helping people or grouping one day, even temporarily, to get something done.  Often times I'd group with them more or talk over the span of days or weeks.
---
The old way also seems to generate more conversations in general chat overall.  That really helps the world feel more alive and active when there is actual chat...even if it is all chuck norris jokes.
---
It is a cash cow, but it pairs well with tailoring because tailoring doesn't require a gathering profession.
---
I've never heard of a server first 60 being a mage who AoEd their way there, but I haven't heard of everything. It always seems to be a hunter or warlock on a questing spree.
---
Group mob tagging if you are all the same level stops working pretty fast when the person you are boosting outlevels the boosters. It could be useful if a team was trying to get one member to be server first (whatever), but not so much if forty people are all trying to get to 60.
---
Well not in an average guild, but I thinks its safe to say, that any progress guild not stacking mages and warriors would be in bad position. So I wont be surprised if I see 20+% mages or warriors in a guild like that. Also
---
&gt;it could be easier to get into raids rolling a: Druid, Dwarf Priest, Warrior-tank. 
---
A resto druid maybe, balance will be kicked out in short order (if its even got invited), and a feral have to be try-hard to justify his/her spot.
---
There will be plenty of dwarf priest, and for a 40 man raid tank you have to be pretty dedicated, to maintain your position. 
---
Nah, every class and spec has its time and place, and id say its less a warrior mage imbalance and more of melee focused raid comps towards the the start then becomes more caster focused in AQ and naxx
---
Soon™
---
I called Illidan as Lidian for a very long time. 
---
Someone brought up Everquest I’m done. 
---
Merely a setback
---
It’s been a speaking piece at Blizzcon two years in a row..
---
You’ve heard Ythisens say they’ve been working on Classic right after the Nostalrius take down..
---
It’s still February until tomorrow..
---
Think people just need to relax.
---
Well a lot of people use lower level BoEs for twinking, but also when you have a fully geared main and nothing else to spend gold on, sometimes buying BoEs for your alts can be like buying Heirlooms and help your alts level faster.
---
You want lock for group pvp (BGs), but not necessarily for the group combat. They are excelent for base defense (AB) and ramp defense (WSG), which they usually perform solo. They are just excelent in 1v1s and stopping the enemy, which has its place in battlegrounds. 
---
I'm glad we agree!
---
To be honest I'm just currently playing a 5 man TBC pserver and planning out/optimizing my classic run on a personal vanilla server :p I almost want more time before Classic to ensure my route is perfect for launch :)
---
Don't worry. With loot trading it doesn't even need to be for them. They'll just trade it to their buddy in the group.
---
&gt; It wasn’t hard for hardcore guilds in Vanilla. 
---
Didn't it take ~150 days from release for Rag to be killed?
---
If it wasn't meant to be hard, that was a swing and a miss.
---
Not sure why people are downvoting you. With loot trading, this will absolutely be a thing. Players will roll on things they don't need, just to give it to their buddy in the party.
---
&gt;I'm becoming genuinely worried it's going to be binned.
---
I genuinely think a lot of yall *want* it to be for some reason. 
---
Hell yeah, I used to play just tbc and wotlk (where the game was still pretty similar opposed to cata+) and I was in shock how much vanilla was different. It feels so much bigger, more free in terms of choices what to do. It is much more of a complex world rather than just lined up experience, more than any other expansion.
---
SL Lock is still very valuable in premades. They bring CoT, Fear, Coil, silence, dispel, and they can take a punch. A good SL Warlock can control the entire fight. 
---
This is what a priest does: mana burn, mana, burn, mana burn, mana burn. Warlock OOM. Priest wins.
---
Because 1000 gold can buy someone a gear upgrade. That's why some shit pre 60 warrior isn't automatically winning my edgemasters.
---
Also Russian clothies rage when a Holy Paladin needs a cloth piece with int. Even had one say I get a 5% int boost from plate.
---
Motherfucker that shit wasnt around until Cata.
---
iirc, didn't it take 3 people to summon in vanilla?
---
&gt;Nah, every class and spec has its time and place
---
Yeah, its called Burning Crusade (or WotLK). 
---
I wonder if you could name a place where a balance druid or even a resto druid can outshine other DPS or healer classes.
---
Very true.  Only thing that sucks about tailoring is you can't/won't sell stacks of cloth and trying to level FA at the same time is a pain in the ass.
---
SL warlock will win. 
---
I'm super pumped for Classic, like most people here, but want to take my time a bit leveling. My guild rolled Horde back in the day, so we're going ally this time for fresh quests/zones while leveling. I really want to get through some other games I never finished like Witcher 3, but I just can't keep focus on them. Cheers. Hope it comes out soon, and we can get those phat lootz.
---
&gt;undead warlock

Skinning Mining while leveling so you have a portion of your Dreadsteed quest mats assembled (Dark Iron Ore, Black Dragonscale, Thorium and Arcane crystals for Arcanite) yourself.  Your free Felsteed at 40 combined with two gathering professions you're going to have a lot of gold in the 40s for someone else to make your shadoweave and then at 60 that you can invest into the glyph, jar, lodestone or for the first good +shadow damage wand you find on the AH.  Then sell lock mount summoning services which if you find a good tank to cut in, you can make all that money back within a week.  Drop mining and skinning at 60 and grab engineering and enchanting or blacksmithing if you want to pvp for the mithril insignia trinket (you shouldn't be forsaken because the orc stun resistance is way more beneficial to you in the open world and in premades where you're going to get pally HoJ'd).  At 60 your income is going to come from mauradon solo farming and mount services.  Fuck all that devilsaur pvp shit and the massive anxiety that comes from seeing a black lotus in the open world.
---
Considering how fast searing totem attacks and how long it lasts for a small amount of mana that seems like really good scaling. 
---
They don't? Aww. I guess that makes sense.
---
I'd say Classic will come out between 2 Weeks before and 2 weeks after July 2, 2019.
---
Why do I say this? FFXIV's New Expansion will release on the 2nd of July. Blizzard has shown they often tend to release major patches and Expansions around similar times to competitors.
---
its definitely possible, but it will be a real challenge just to get the people together. getting 40 people doing 5 days /played to 60 and ready to raid MC within 10 days would take some real dedication by a lot of people. some healers and dps could be 58 or 59 and they wouldnt need a full 40 man raid, could possibly do with 35.
---
In general it's a lot better to just burst the skull target with your group.  It's much easier for your tank to hold aggro, and killing the first mob will reduce a lot of the incoming damage.
---
If you have a good tank  you can put corruption on every mob.
---
Don't forget your good utility and CC. If your group pulls packs further backwards you can chain fear a mob. Curse of recklessness can be used to control a feared mob or prevent runners. Banish for demons and elementals. Your voidwalker can off tank a mob.
---
Saaaame. I'm really hoping they announce the server names beforehand so everyone can plan on where to roll (and where NOT to roll)
---
As you can see from so many responses in this thread already, and hundreds posted to date elsewhere, the social aspect of vanilla WoW was one of the main reasons for the enjoyment we felt back then, and the excitement we have now to return to that style of game.
---
WoW is an MMO and one of the fundamental design pillars of an MMO is socialisation: promoting social systems within the game. Vanilla WoW was actually designed this way (we don't need John Staats or Mark Kern or other developers to tell us this - we can see it in the game itself). 
---
Not only do we have the specific group content, such as dungeons and raids, but the world itself promotes grouping and socialisation, pvp is based on a group dynamic with every class having a role in a more rock/paper/scissors aspect than every class being 100% viable 1v1 (which we all know is impossible, Blizz have been trying for 14 years - thanks Arenas - and still can't manage it).
---
Within the instanced content, all class roles were important, CC was required, communication was required. Runs took time and if something went wrong, people worked together to figure it out and make it work rather than kicking someone - you didn't want to wait another 15-20 minutes to find someone, then have them make their way to you. This promoted a lot of mentoring - when someone was struggling you figured out why and helped them, advised them on gear choices, talent choices, etc. Many times this would lead to an ongoing interaction and often friendship.
---
When was the last time someone talked in one of your retail instances, that wasn't an insult or a meme?
---
Questing in the world promoted grouping even more. There are a large volume of quests that suggest multiple players: and in vanilla they meant it. If the quest said, suggested 3 people, then you needed 3 people, unless you were overgearing/overlevelling the quest/zone. An elite was an elite - it made the world feel dangerous and alive, kept you on your toes and made the benefit of having someone there to watch your back so important.
---
Which also works in PvP, if you rolled on the right kind of server. World PvP sparked so many groups and interactions, each one of which had the potential to turn into a long term friendship, or at least an added person you could turn to for help. 
---
The world in vanilla just felt more alive, more lived in and more real. It was more enjoyable and more rewarding.
---
Almost all of my memories stem from vanilla: I can name dozens of players I played with and can recount hundreds of stories. I have some from TBC, but basically nothing from Wrath going forward. The only memories I have from the last few expansions are from solo things or from playing with a handful of real-life friends. No interactions with people in the game itself.
---
Retail WoW feels sterile and bland and has done (for me) since Cata. The constant of erosion of socialisation, often due to features implemented by Blizzard themselves, has made WoW into a shadow of an MMO. The current designers may be capable of making a great game, but they aren't capable of making a great MMO. To me, WoW doesn't really feel like an MMO anymore, it is something else. 
---
I want to play an MMO, it is my favourite game genre. Since 2004 no one has been able to better vanilla WoW. It is the only place I want to be right now.
---
Its not about out shining, its about having a role, 
---
Boomkin give 3 percent crit how much damage do you think it contributes to the 4 fire mages being able to equip more spellpower gear as apposed to crit gear (assuming thry are crit capped without it) 
---
What exactly is there to talk about? It won't get cancelled.  Vanilla will live on forever regardless of Blizz, so it would be dumb for them to not milk what they can. 
---
This is correct except the part about tier of gear. It won’t change anything 
---
You better not curse on my fucking server, bud.
---
I always thought it was cause gear looked the worst on Gnomes, hence why I love Taurens so much since the gear was massive on their male models.
---
Tauren &gt; Undead &gt;&gt; Dwarf &gt; Orc = Night Elf &gt;&gt; Human = Troll &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Gnome
---
The first time you saw the Bulwark of Azzinoth on a male Tauren... Mmmmm.
---
Most armor of note on Gnomes looks utterly ridiculous, and if youre melee all your weapons over 1 centimeter long clip into the ground. 
---
What time are gfpp’s normally used for ranged classes?  I seem to remember stacking some fr back in the day as a healer but I know private servers have come up with better strays since. 
---
Do you pop them if you get knocked back into the lava?
---
Hahaha yeah exactly!
---
Yea, you can’t afford to pay for all the ores and bars for pvp and pve anyway.
---
Wars got the highest maintenance fee. That’s why I am going with mage or hunter this time around, one spec to farm and pve. Less repair, it’s just all easier. 
---
yea this seems to be doing it for me in the mean time. There's a lot of people who want to take their time and enjoy the leveling process, then there's people like me who are trying to get it all done and "out of the way" in the first week. That's the beauty of the game, everyone can enjoy it in their own way :)
---
I see, and probably it takes less time and effort to join a raiding guild and get the weapons than grind 13 to 14
---
Yea, likely going Warlock this time as a lifelong Mage, but I have never played a warrior as a main, so I was just curious. There’s a chance I’ll need to MT for group, so always good to know.
---
Yes, play retail and farm gold to buy a lot of in game time to use during classic.
---
Gnomes are just too smart and incredible to have the need to show the gear. They already know they are superior, so why would they force it to anyone. They dont need to prove themselves to anyone ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Imagine being so neurotic that you spend years gearing a character, finally achieve the absolute BiS items, and then you can’t even see them because your character is two feet tall
---
I might be wrong, but I'm fairly certain you can be banned if you curse in public chat channels but you probably won't be, but guild chat is fine 
---
Nope 
---
I played on Tichondrius and called it titchondris. I also learnt pronunciations from my brother and most of them were wrong. Ahn-qiray, See-thun, Shorfang instead of Saurfang
---
It's a fun experience. Up to you if its worth it.
---
Kinda like Stardew Valley and My Time In Portia... similar core game - wildly different implementation.
---
Go for it. Have some fun.
---
Being a tauren druid I wouldn't mind this, but I understand why people don't want it
---
In all fairness, BFA probably has a good 1-3 months of content in it that you'd probably enjoy.  The raids and dungeons have been really good imo.  If that's worth the price of admission to you, then totally go for it.
---
Past that, the leveling felt pretty bad because of the scaling.  I've never been a fan of dailies or the new profession system quests, though I know some people prefer them.  Island expeditions were neat the first few times, then got kind of stale; same with the open world and instanced warfronts - they just felt grindy after a while - but again that's just my opinion.
---
All in all, it's good single player content with an interesting yet railroaded story.  That Sylvanas writing, though... Man, idk what happened there.
---
Just can't shake that feeling of genuine detachment from other people, though, which is why I think a lot of people are chomping at the bit for Classic.
---
Arm the proletariat!
---
Nope, you’re better off playing an unofficial server at this point. 
---
Wintergrasp is my favourite from WotLK. It's so different from anything else in the game and it gives me such a massive amount of nostalgia and longing for times long gone. 
---
I saw in this thread, that the same server (in assuming) just *added* the number of items currently in existence to the original total, so if everybody donated everything they had, they’d be starting at 0 normally. And apparently the biggest stockpiler guild never donated, so it was much worse than just a normal war effort. 
---
What class do you want next?
---
"no servers are illegal"
---
That being said, I should be able to call the assholes I see in the world, well, assholes. It’s not often, normally people in Classic WoW are exceptionally friendly and down to earth. But there are absolutely people that are trolls out there, or just horrible people in general. 
---
I should feel free to call them an asshole, and honestly, I’ve never gotten reported for that in my decade+ of playing WoW. I think some people take it *waaaay* too far and deserve a ban, but simply calling someone an asshole, for, say, ninjaing an item and hearthing out, is a far cry from harrasment I’d say.
---
Great input! I really appreciate it! I think if I was to play I would probably just start completely fresh and just level a new character just for the hell of it. Nothing else sounds that appealing to me. Classic just needs to hurry up already.
---
I mean, it will never be hitting in the triple digits, but its decent chip damage considering how dirt cheap it is mana wise, especially with resto -25% mana cost to totems.
---
its kinda like an extra free wand auto attack, paired with melee attacking.
---
A BoE is escencially gold. If a stack of 50g dropped on the ground, everyone would do need. On Nostalrius anyway it was our mentality, so when a BoE dropped we would make sure to say "everyone roll need" and everyone would roll need. 
---
Or just use that time to take an extra hour at your day job. It might be more fun.
---
Goddamn right. This guy knows how things are lol 
---
To help illustrate, consider the difference between these two sentences.
---
1. Oh, for fucks sake!
---
2. You stupid fuck!
---
Fuck you. Shit content 
---
Any time, and I feel ya man.  Been trying to distract myself with other games so much lately when I'm not working or doing stuff for college.  I've been saving up PTO for over a year now and am only planning to have one class over the summer  @_@
---
If you do decide to start WoW back up, pick something completely different and out of the way to do that you haven't even considered before - make a character with a faction/ race/ class you've never tried before; level solely through pet battles or PvP; only do quests in zones you haven't frequented and complete their stories since zones scale, now.  Mix it up!
---
Already did mage druid and rogue in vanilla. Looking for a different playstyle tbh. Between warrior, pally and hunter right now, but leaning warrior. 
---
So around Blizzcon, a longtime group of my WoW friends started talking and got excited to return for Classic. A few days later, we were all playing retail to kill time while we waited.
---
So I started at level 100 in late Nov. and started the journey, eventually also leveling an alt to 120 from 100 as well. I’d say I’m now finally getting bored with the game — I only log in to do a weekly +10, weekly Island Expedition, and our two raids a week. That said, I played a ton the last few months and definitely got some enjoyment.
---
Bottom line, if you have people to play with, id jump in — it’s still a great game, it’s just not as good as Vanilla.
---
lmao
---
I have always been attracted to playing the shortest race in MMO's since I was a kid.  Not sure why. 
---
Yeah but I mean, Tauren were getting butchered by centaur which is even more embarrassing
---
Yeah I think I'm only gonna take one or two classes this summer. Hopefully that leaves me enough time to play Classic a lot!
---
So this "level-scaling" - I've heard of it but I'm not sure how it works exactly. As a level 1 I can go to Hillsbrad and quest immediately? Or just certain zones scale?
---
Ret paladin. See if you can break 600.
---
How old were you to make these mistakes, 5?
---
I think you may get some haters. Because is like. Kinda stupid.
---
I feel like this is not what I want to see more of.
---
Just because it's out doesn't mean you have to do it. I'd consider myself an average player and I won't get all of that stuff done for  YEARS 
---
Gotcha! Yeah I know nobody anymore that still plays. If I was to jump back into retail I'd be flying solo, although I think I would enjoy that considering how casually I would play. Once Classic comes along I'm going to play more seriously, but if I was to play retail I would play very casually. 
---
Nah 
---
IIRC, you have to be at the minimum level of the zone to effectively be there, but once you've hit that level, the zone will scale with you all through that zone's rough expansion bracket, minus the starting zones.  So Elwynn is 1-20, Westfall is 10-60, Wetlands is 20-60, Hellfire Peninsula is 58-80, Mount Hyjal is 80-90, etc.
---
And if you take into account the divide, shaman is one of the most played for horde.
---
Blizzard's position has always been that the profanity filter isn't an excuse to such language.
---
You think theorycrafting is stupid?
---
Why do people assume this? Shaman is after mages and warriors the most played class for horde. 
---
This isnt theory crafting. This is ruining game play/spoilers.
---
it was hard in vanilla due to lack of 1.12 talents, 1.12 items and, of course, a lot of people thinking their BiS was their 8 piece tier 0 class set...
---
Well, there’s never been a better time to PUG than now. I’ve been pugging content harder than my guild the entire time I’ve been back. That said, doing so does feel a little hollow. It’s much more enjoyable to play with fiends.
---
If interested, you’re more than welcome to join my guild on Sen’Jin. Casual group of longtime players — the core of us met in 2006 pre-TBC — all planing to transition into Classic. Right now we’re running heroic BfD on Sat and Sun afternoons and some are running normal on alts on Tuesday and Thursday. 
---
1.Orc
---
2.Undead
---
3.Dwarf
---
4.Tauren
---
5.Gnome
---
6.Troll
---
7.Human
---
8.Night elf
---
From a PvP perspective, bottom 3 are kinda the same though, useless
---
It will be somewhere near 1k(maybe even somewhere higher)... On undead target :-P
---
&gt; So this "level-scaling" - I've heard of it but I'm not sure how it works exactly. As a level 1 I can go to Hillsbrad and quest immediately? Or just certain zones scale?
---
Pretty much. Vanilla content scales from 1-60.
---
Pros: nostalgia. Previously, with all the leveling buffs, you'd outlevel a zone before doing 1/4 of the content, so if you liked Hillsbrad, better get there early and try and get the experience you like. Now, you can do the quests you like, when you like, in the order you like.
---
Cons: Lack of a feel of progress, aside from Azeroth - Outland / Northrend - MOP - Draenor. (even though that kinda makes sense. Why would a boar in Felwood be 50x harder to kill than one in Elwynn)
---
well if you pick any other class you're probably going to have a better pre-raid time than warrior. They are the ultimate late game class but suck until they get gear.
---
I'd say keep that out as a baseline. Patchwerk is a target dummy, Exorcism is a boost, but only against like 5% of bosses.
---
Or do two. One with "normal max" and one "max but extra max cause patch is undead"
---
There’s a huge thread about this topic from yesterday. Just read that 
---
I remember scaring the hell out of people as a stealthed NE Warrior in the flag rooms of WSG when I knew a push was coming.  Getting charged from the shadows as a Warlock sure doesn't seem like a pleasant experience.
---
How useful is Shadowmeld?  Probably not that great.  How fun was it?  Total blast.
---
But how its ruining gameplay/spoilers?
---
Every ~~dog~~streamer already posted "dps ranking by class". 
---
The only thing I tried to show in that kind of vid is a class potential in extremely good  conditions.
---
My server got so much better when Russians got their own localised realms.
---
Interesting! I'm curious to know how that works with contested zones and world pvp. It seems as though there would be level 20s and 60s possibly leveling near each other of the opposing faction? If people even still quest to level..
---
It's an interesting idea for sure, not sure if I would like it or not. I'd just prefer to have Classic haha
---
I'm 41 years old and this makes me almost want to cry.
---
Yah man. I just dont like it. Maybe next season.
---
This trap is exactly how I fell into Legion, followed by 2 weeks of BFA....don't do it.
---
Yeah, that’s definitely the case at launch of a server. The part I was responding to was the “absolute fastest” (in terms of /played). But warlock and hunter definitely still take the cake day 1.
---
Wow I really appreciate the invite! I will definitely come back to this thread and message you if I do end up coming back to play some retail before Classic comes out. Being without WoW just doesn't feel quite right haha
---
Thank you ill check it out :) 
---
Yup. It is an unexpected lucky drop, not a normal piece of loot from a boss. You can run an instance 1000 times and never see the same BoE twice since there are many in the loot table, it drops from trash, and its a ~.01% drop chance. It is not something a player can come into the instance and claim they were hoping for that item lol
---
Can you please list all the buffs. I can only recognise half of them. Bonus points if you highlight the ones used commonly in raiding.
---
Sure thing, bud.
---
Troll shadow priest is underrated.
---
Uh-rick-uh-ruh &gt; Arry-karra (Arikara)
---
Been mentioned a few times, I'll have to give it a listen!
---
Gnomes swim in maraudon. On the other hand... getting ganked by a gnome  is the most rage inducing thing in all of wow. Their dance and laugh are the best emotes for that. Also, the way their little feet wiggle when they sit.
---
Rallying Cry(Ony/Nef head), Spirit of Zandalar(Hakkaar hearth), Sayge(DMF), Fengus Ferocity(DM tribute), Songflower(Felwood), Warchief's bless(Rend's head q, you need to be horde or become Mind Controlled by horde to get that), Traces of Silithist(Silithus world PvP), R.O.I.D.S. (Badlands q), Trueshot Aura, Feral +3% crit, Mongoose, 2x types of Juju, Smoked Desert food, Battle Shout, BoK, BoM, MotW.
---
Short "buffs": Mighty Rage pot, Kiss of the Spider, Recklessness. (De)buff - Death Wish.
---
Additionaly used Hemorrhage and Gift of Arthas debuffs at target.
---
you won’t like it. I Played warrior since vanilla. MTd in tbc and wotlk. Gpt server first kills in wotlk few times. It’s just too much work, 100% attendance, and at least farming in tbc was easier with dual spec, but in vanilla you pretty much forced to farm with mining, selling tank runs or make a money alt.
---
And vanilla needs more farming than all other expansions, you need flasks, pots, scrolls, and repair bill since theres no guild bank. Also MT in vanilla is much harder because threat is an issue, at least based on the pserver play style. Dps like to go nuts, so you are forced to play to the best as well, which I just don’t want to do anymore.
---
Most MTs will burn out I feel this time around since any competent guild will make people play to the best, which in vanilla is all about consumables, not how to avoid fire shit like in later expansions. So for tanks you actually have to pay 100% attention during raids because any slack dps will pull aggro.
---
If someone is needing things they don't need and you don't want to kick them just tell the whole group to start rolling need one everything. 
---
Gear in vanilla isn't easy to assign a flat value to due to all the strange effects and interactions, think stuff like Hand of Justice or Wolfshead Helm. BiS lists already exist anyway. Blizzard already stated that in some cases certain features would be disallowed for add-ons, specifically citing LFD-like capabilities. I don't have the link but I'll update if I can find it. Even if they did allow an add-on that could do it, that wouldn't make Classic "just like retail", there are too many other game systems at play that differentiate the two.
---
Was in a guild on a PServer (32 mage), and the GM was seemingly randomly kicking people, so I asked what was up. He said that people who are inactive for 5+ days get the boot. No one was even 60 in the guild yet. I told him that's not the best way to run a guild cause RL stuff can happen. Then, if it was 60, he'd be booting peoples friends from the guild cause they couldn't log in for a few days. He called me a bottom feeder and kicked me from the guild. So maybe don't do that.
---
That whole part about communication really hit me hard. It seems like every class I run on retail wow I never need to talk because half the time people are speeding through it all without a glance back. The pvp definitely seems more fun as well, so Ill give that a try.
---
Just because you don't have time for it (nor do I), doesn't mean that others should be gated as well. Faster paced people will have nothing to do.
---
ImWithStupid
---
That all sounds wonderful actually. I want a challenge, and not something to just complete daily.
---
How annoying is this swimming in mara thing? I'm planning on going alliance warlock in classic, and want to use mara as my main farming method. Am I absolutely going to hate it if I'm gnome, or is it just mildly annoying? Which part do they have to swim through? Is it the part at the base of the waterfall where all the hydras are? I do want to go gnome, but this has me worried.
---
Now redo it with the Omen buff if it stacks with ZG/kings.
---
If I remember correctly it's just the small section after you drop down the water falls. Where the hydras are. And then you should be fine.
---
Seeing how classes perform in optimal theoretical scenarios is ruining gameplay (or spoilers, wut) because... reasons?
---
The BC soundtrack is my favorite too. I will never get tired of the [Zangarmarsh music.](https://youtu.be/07SahS27dnk?t=80)
---
Warlock with skinning and tailoring. 
---
Awesome!!!
---
You remember me that video from 2006 Naxx(1550 DPS Fury warrior) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26ACEQmdslA)
---
Surelly you overbuffed him.
---
Nah. Just watching it for the bit I did kinda made me think this is wrong.  I feel like it's a spoiler to really getting to feel what it's like to do that yourself.
---
FUUUUCKKKK!1111
---
I totally forgot about Moonglade...
---
Certain blues were legit top dps over epics. Vanilla was wild
---
2.1 aka not Vanilla, nice find and ty for posting. The guy above is right about selling soulstones to other guilds for raids.
---
Tryhard guilds will literally all level warlocks so they can soulstone all 40 people in the raid. It definitely does not fade just by leaving the party considering their alts are not just out of party but OFFLINE entirely lol
---
Only the 1% of the 1% are going to get to that point of gear and DPS. You most likely won't even get to that point. Watching a video of someone putting out big numbers on a training dummy isn't spoilers no matter how you feel, just like watching PVP videos isn't spoilers on what your PVP gameplay is going to be. Learn to differentiate watching the game and playing the game. It's not like he's spoiling some major storyline.
---
That's exactly what I've had to do before. On a private server I was healing a ZF run once during non peak and we couldn't for the life of us get a tank. Took forever. Tank started rolling need on things better left to other classes so we all had to start rolling need. It was a quest run so most of us were just there for the carrot and the XP. I wasnt happy about it, but we risked not being able to finish the run otherwise. 
---
Yah I think you just dont like my opinion lol. You are gonna have to learn to deal with that. Sorry friend. Shits trash. Glhf out there.
---
Tautonym.   But your hunter’s name has to be Tautonym as well.  
---
A tautonym is when the genus and species of an animal’s scientific name are the same word.  
---
For example, [the scientific name of the American Bison (Buffalo) is Bison Bison.](http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Buffalo)
---
No, addons are necessary and were part of vanilla. 
---
What will it say when a vaguely promoted rerelease passes the current retail title in players and subscriptions? I think at least launch is going to be bigger and crazier than they are anticipating. I can name 5 streamers alone that will bring in half a million players on day one, and that is really barely scratching the surface... They realize they don't have to promote this. It's the game that changed the way people viewed video games on many fronts.
---
Full rank corruption won't draw aggro from a halfway-competent tank.
---
Yea, I agree with all of that. But I feel like it might be worse if a mediocre player takes the MT role. I want one of our best DPS to take on the role so I know threat won’t be as much of an issue, but if none of those players want the job, I might take it I guess. Feels like I’d be more frustrated as a DPS who has to keep stopping due to threat meters.
---
A few names i recognize unfortunately not the people i would love to find again.
---
Dps, yes? But damn fury warriors have to be some of the ugliest bastards in all of vanilla.
---
I was thinking about that or Just go double gathering, skinning + herb. But tailor would be nice aswell 
---
I mean, it *does* take up already limited bag space, because you’re using a quiver, and you might have not be able to easily get food from mobs if you’re using a gorilla or something, but I liked the mechanic and was disappointed when they got rid of it.  
---
It took the RP from my RPG.  
---
what the fuck 
---
Speaking of theorycrafting, I was raiding for a while on an instant-60 server and got advice from a former Dreamstate member (top guild back on Nostalrius) that you only want to use Overpower to keep Flurry up at lower gear levels (pre-bis/early MC) and that it's not worth it at higher gear levels. Especially when you've got full world buffs like you did.
---
You had nearly 100% flurry uptime throughout the video, I'd love to see you do it again without stance dancing for Overpower and see the results.
---
They do a lot in r/pathofexile
---
By an extreme margin
---
But Centaurs are at least sentient. Gnomes are supposably so smart, yet got shit on by braindead troggs that are barely bigger than them. 
---
Somebody get me in contact with their pr firm.
---
I do not think a gearscore will work well with vanilla just because of how all over the place gear was. And also raiding in Vanilla was not really about skill or gear as much as it was about getting together 40 people on a regular basis. 
---
Play horde for windfury. Get mind controlled and buffed with kings by alliance? More damage?
---
Sneaking into an enemy starting zone, taming a named animal (Sarkoth was my favorite) flagging myself for pvp and Shadowmelding.  People wouldn’t pay attention and attack my pet, then immediately get oneshotted.  Good times.  
---
Saying on /1 that they finally added a confirm window to the /gquit command :)
---
Ogrimar. For years. Literally years. 
---
Massive macro differences from 1.12 to 7.3.5.
---
But the addons are better these days. EMA + AutoHotKey and you're basically set. Barrier of entry for multiboxing these days is pretty low. Not a lot to learn.
---
Very cool. The meatspin song is pretty dope as well.
---
Humans take the crown in PvP. It's not a pretty crown.
---
this needs to get stickied! 
---
seems those are the majority considering the post is at 0 points.
---
Yep I was the guy who rolled greed. Quickly realized others were rolling need on everything so I started to as well.
---
The system is broken af for pugs
---
Hell yeah, I love Everness' ambience videos. I converted some of them to mp3 and put them on my phone to listen to while I fall asleep.
---
that's the best part though, they make them in midget sizes
---
Gnomer Reagan
---
Rouge
---
Ogrimar
---
Still lose my shit when people start talking about shame-ans
---
What are they planning on doing once they reach expansion content? Done? Restart? Roll out some blank servers again?
---
Fuck no
---
That’s about right. I’d put Gnome above Tauren though. Escape Artist is very valuable in Vanilla and it’s on a 1 minute CD. 
---
Troll is useless except for Spriest because Shadowguard does decent damage and can proc Blackout stun. This can really mess up a Rogues opener or Warriors Charge for example. I know this because it has messed up my Rogues opener more times than I care to admit. 
---
I don’t see a problem in allowing players (client side) to have whatever graphic options they want. I would like to have the option. 
---
I also think this way but about the music. I love the original soundtrack, but it would be great to toggle an option that also allows the new zone music (from cataclysm) to play as well. 
---
Well, all the minmaxers are gonna roll Gnomes and Human females. So get used to it. 
---
That's why I'd like it to be a little slower let everyone complete content together or at least before a reset or what I hope for possibly BC launch.  
---
Blizzard can shut down specific addons that automate parts of the game like Decursive, Healbot's first iteration or Lazyheal.
---
There's no point in disabling addons, it's like disabling keybinds so that everyone is stuck keyboard turning and clicking spells to "even out the playing field". It's absurd and fucking dumb.
---
Night elves. I believe out of all the races, they are the least impactful to classes in the basis or both PVE and PVP. The only class they are substantially impactful for is the class that can only be a night elf for Alliance. 
---
That doesn't mean they tackled rag for 150 days straight. It means from the second the game launched it took 150 days. There's a metric fuckton of shit to do and learn when you start a brand new game.
---
Honestly no, BFA really is the worst xpac by far.
---
I'm not trying to shit talk it for the sake of being edgy, it really is bad. 
---
I bought it and 6 months of membership assuming it would keep me entertained for at least that long, and it didn't. Within the first 6-8 weeks I was bored, ended up logging in for dalies or Arena points cap then logging out for the next month or two. Last 2 months of my membership went completely unused.
---
Gnome warlock tier gear is adorable.
---
"Fear me! Feeeeeeear! FEEEEEEEAR!"
---
The idea of eccentric gnome casters led to one of the best characters in World of Warcraft: Millhouse Manastorm.
---
If you don't mind wasting your money, sure I guess. Raids have always been great, it's just the rest of the game that sucks. I played Legion for a month or two until I got sick of all the bullshit, and I'm not going to make the same mistake again.
---
If the guild is good, or leadership any competent, bad tanks will be replaced right away.
---
I got my MT spot in wotlk cause the previous MT could’t dance heigan in naxx, LOL, and i took over during that fight with a priest and pally and like no more than 5 people alive, did it over and over for like 30 mins while the whole raid is dead and watches. Got promoted to MT right away afterward lol. 
---
Needing on all boes means you can never get screwed over. If people whine, and you win, tell em all to re roll and give to the winner. Problem solved. 
---
This message brought to you by the horde mage gang.
---
Actually true. You can put a timer when world chat is turning to shit and its always when EU goees to bed and NA goes on.
---
Tell me, weren't the Darkspear Trolls nearly destroyed by some murlocs?
---
Even assuming it took no-lifers a month to get to 60, which seems long, that's still ~120 days of working on MC, which on pirate servers gets cleared in greens (or so I am told).
---
&gt;Whats the best?
---
Dwarf.
---
I like that gnomes can fit under some architecture that other races can't.
---
Nelfs are for IRL females and weebs.
---
Play a priest. In pvp you'll feel like a monster as shadow, and in a group as a healer you'll be only second to the tank to be accepted or be able to make demands.
---
are you really worried about that? really?
---
I’m in the same boat as you. I want to play RP-PVP. Mainly because I’m a writer and I like creating stories, but also because I want to be immersed in the world. It’s not a big deal, but I like when people walk/run on the roads and not on the roofs of buildings. I like the idea of characters acting as they would if the world was real. I’ve also heard that more mature players tend to play on RP servers. 
---
I tried an RP server years ago and Thunder Bluff was attacked by elementals and I loved how the players reacted and rushed to defend the city. I’m excited to try this again. I just hope the population is high enough that PvP ques aren’t too long. But data I saw from a survey showed that the same amount of people interested in PVE servers (non RP) were interested in RP-PVP (I think it was around 17% of the votes). 
---
what kind of classes do you think you'd enjoy? lore-wise or anything. I played a lot of osrs and wow so I could help you choose, I just need a bit more info on what you enjoy. are you opposed to healing or do you want to stick to purely dps? do you think you want to commit to raiding? or are dungeons/pvp more your thing?
---
Addons and vanilla go hand in hand my friend. It’s a must 
---
Yeah might be better to just pick up tailoring when you're 60 
---
Thanks. What is EMA?
---
My take on it is that if I put in a lot of hours and work, I’d at least want to see the gear. I see the cute/ironic appeal tho 
---
Yeah, so what?
---
IIRC there are houses that you can get on top of in certain zones (EPL?) that you can drop down the chimneys of.  Gnomes can make it out of the fire place, other races can't.  Makes for some really cheesy PvP kills.
---
Is multiboxing allowed on retail?  If so I’m sure it will carry over to classic. I kind of hope it’s not though. As fun as it is would be to mess around with it’s basically paying more money for an in game advantage. 
---
Unpopular:
---
Get rid of addons. Unless there is a way to police it to the point where there are only addons that existed during vanilla, this is not no changes. 
---
Yeah i kinda agree, but im not that experienced with classic since i were 12 when i played it and went with hunter.. Lol. So Just wanted to hear what people think :) 
---
As a PvP list, Id for sure put Gnome at 3 and drop the rest down 1, Tauren might also be below Troll, while Warstomp isnt bad, Orc is just better in all 3 of their classes that arent Druid, while Troll Spriest is pretty good.
---
"Ebony's Multiboxing Assistant"
---
Used to be Jamba, but dev stopped on that tool. It helps keeping characters in-sync without too much fuss. Sharing quests, mounting at the same time, taking taxis together. 
---
Nope? I did raid lead no problem. But you do roll need on BoEs as everyone needs gold. 
---
There is zero correlation. What you describe happened 0 times.
---
One thing that might be more interesting for 5 locks is the possibility of 7.3.5 macros. In 1.12 it's hard to use ground target aoe (rain of fire) cause you'd have to manually target 5 times in five windows.
---
With 7.3.5, there's the macro:
---
/cast [@focus] Rain of Fire
---
With all 5 locks having their own blueberry (or a central one) set as focus, and it auto casts Rain of Fire centered on the focus target like it would had you clicked there. Great for AOE efficiency.
---
So, the raid loses like 3% of its dps?
---
It's worth it if you feel that your hype for Classic is starting to wane. Playing retail will charge it right back up.
---
&gt; With 7.3.5, there's the macro:
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; /cast [@focus] Rain of Fire
---
The only accepted conditionals for ground-target spells are [@cursor] and [@player].
---
I almost always equip boe’s I win in groups if I can. Have no problem with all roll need. Don’t really care if another class that can use rolls need and AH’s it, just don’t blow sunshine up my ass about using it.
---
&gt; Is multiboxing allowed on retail?
---
The multiboxing playstyle has never been a violation of their ToS.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/11704
---
I hope multiboxers in vanilla isn't wide spread. I think I'd rather deal with the chinese gold sellers than multiboxers
---
If I remember correctly the sundering left yhem on an island with little food so they were starving to death and beset by murlocs and Naga when Thrall and the orcs washed up and saved them
---
They walk the fastest. Feels like.
---
You can get rank 12 if you’re good/premade
---
I chose a gnome all the way back in vanilla and have mained one most of my WoW career because I thought the gear actually looked the best on them and the most "complete" per se, with no holes and large areas of skin showing. Am I alone here?
---
just going to list some features of classic that would immediately jump out to someone more familiar w modern wow, and you can decide for yourself if they are pros or cons.
---
-no automatic dungeon finder, raid finder or the manual lfg tool, just form a group by talking to people, walk to the dungeon, bada bing bada boom
---
-as you mentioned in your post, way less handholding. no heros call boards or popups telling you where you need to go next, though there are obviously still breadcrumb quests pointing to other zones. a typical questing zone has one, maybe two main hubs you'll go back and forth from, and quests scattered all over the zone you have to find yourself. no moving along the zone and through several tiny hubs in a railroaded and orderly fashion. on a related note, no quest markers telling you where to go
---
-the leveling is a big part of the game and not just an annoying hurdle to get to raiding unless you're a big minmaxing raidlogger (which is fine too). as a result it takes a slower time to level, but each level feels like a genuine accomplishment. there are only two continents, which makes the world feel more cohesive. there are plenty of reasons for max levels to go to low level zones. professions are useful from levels 1 to 60. gear upgrades provide a noticeable improvement over what you had before and aren't just +1 to your main stat
---
-some people have already said this, but i'll mention it too. the world REALLY feels like a world. the racials and the class selections aren't evenly balanced on both sides. some zones are bustling, close to home and feel safe. others don't have that many quests and make you feel like youre at the edge of the world. there are a lot of really interesting stories packed within azeroth that have now been removed or rehashed and devalued, that are slowly revealed to you as you make your way in the world.
---
based on what you've said i do think you'd enjoy it, but only you would really know. feel free to DM me if you want any advice playing on the private server that shall not be named, because it might be a good idea to see if classic is a good fit for you before it launches. either way, have a good one :)
---
Rank 10 lock gear is great?
---
When do warlocks get great gear from raiding? Will a warlock have different sets for PvP and PvE during MC or BWL? Why isn't R10 set good?
---
Isboxer has great solutions to this in the form of on mouse vfx
---
Looking forward to playing a female gnome with a non pissed off expression on their face .
---
Super late on this response haha, but yeah i was leaning herbalism and tailoring to start out with. Herb for money and tailoring for the BIS BOP robe. Once i have the robe made I might change to alchemy
---
At least they look decent on gnomes if you zoom in.  Most armor looks shitty on horde races.
---
Honestly a lot of sets look nice on gnomes than humans, imo....you just cant play fully zoomed out and see it lol
---

&lt;The Oran'Thul&gt; - Horde | NA | PvP | Hardcore
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
The Oran'Thul is a dedicated, goal-oriented group of hardcore gamers seeking raiders and PvPers for Classic WoW. 
---
Our plans for Classic WoW include being top guild on our server while still providing an atmosphere that also welcomes more casual players. We intend to have two 40 player raid groups totaling 80 hardcore raider slots. We have a ranking system that provides raid slot and loot priority to those that align with the hardcore play style and plan to show up to MOST raids. For more information, please review a detailed breakdown on our website: https://www.oranthul.com/home/m/49064920/article/4842852
---
While most of this post focuses on the PvE aspect of Classic WoW, we are equally as dedicated to PvP and greatly enjoy crushing the skulls of the Alliance. We have multiple Rank 14 experienced players and will allocate time for premade battlegrounds.
---
Our core members are extremely knowledgeable of all Classic WoW content and provide an environment where you can learn your class, ask questions and improve your skill set. We have cleared all content in Classic WoW including all world bosses and 15/15 Naxx. Furthermore, we have achieved world-best standing in past MMOs, most notably ArcheAge.
---
If you strive to be the best you can be, know what it means to put the organization first, and want a guild and community to call home from day one, then perhaps this is the place for you. With 15+ years of activity and an absolute 0% chance that we will quit Classic WoW or disband—as commonly witnessed with many other guilds—we offer you unparalleled stability and a place to call home! JOIN US!
---
One of the many projects that The Oran'Thul has painstakingly worked on includes a list of loot from all raid bosses including loot council priorities. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-raid-mc
---
In addition to this project, The Oran'Thul is creating a complete list of pre-BiS and BiS gear for all dungeon and raid content. This list is organized by class and role allowing each player to see the gear that only pertains to their needs. An example page can be found here: https://www.oranthul.com/raidloot-pr-warrior-prot

I don't believe I specced out of Arms until BWL or AQ. You could do better with other specs but it's absolutely not necessary.
---
My original prot warrior was gnome. Used him too tank alt raids in bc and wrath. I just thought it was awesome too watch my tiny character get beat on by giants and survive! 
---
The swimming in Mara and getting dismounted all over Swamp of Sorrows, Wetlands and anywhere else with small puddles is frustrating asf as a Gnome in Vanilla, lol.
---
but what does the name mean 
---
Something I created. Had to be unique in order to trademark it...which I did.
---
It’s supposed to give off the same feeing that “The Horde” would. An army, a group.
---
The Horde, The Kor’Kron, The Oran’Thul.
---
Sounds cool. Props for coming up with an original name, I don't see that often anymore. Best of luck to y'all 
---
Thanks! Appreciate it!
---
Yeah, *Darkspear* trolls had a rough go. The troll race itself has arguably the most prestigious history of anyone on Azeroth though, so. 
---
I can't offer advice but hopefully my plan will work for you or maybe inspire you. 
---
I'll be taking herbalism and skinning while leveling. Saving herbs and vendoring skins. Once I have my 60% mount and enough herbs to cap alchemy, I'll drop skinning and max that out. Then, once I have enough cash from gathering / making pots, I'll drop herbalism and level up engineering (gnomish, emphasis on pvp). 
---
End goal: engineering and alchemy 
---
I will also have a bank alt parked in Org that has enchanting. I'll mail greens to him and have him disenchant for extra $$ on the AH. 
---
I have a Macbook Pro 2012 with the graphics upgrade that has a dedicated fan for the graphics card. Without that extra fan, I'd be severely overheating. If the air is too slim to have the higher quality card w/fan, then you may have some heat problems. Make sure you have a really high quality external laptop fan to pull that heat away from the body of the laptop. I'm not sure how well the Air will handle the heat output. That said, it sounds like they're using the updated client, so it will likely run smoother because of that, but it will also probably run much higher power and overload the card/heat sink if you only have the basic model and no upgrades for graphics (i.e. you'll probably have to play on low graphics settings).
---
My wife makes fun of me when I play because it sounds like an airplane. 10/10 can confirm the noise and heat output while gaming on a mac (even with the new client). I have to run an external fan and set the machine on it, in addition to the internal and graphics card dedicated ones, and it could STILL fry an egg.
---
Shadowmeld is amazing for pvp if you do not want to get ganked, or if you want to camp a spawn.
---
Addons are garbage, but sadly not going anywhere.
---
This. Gnome may look weak but their health pool and resistances are pretty much the same as the other ravages with a similar gear. I tanked in MC on my gnome warrior and the guild cheered patronizingly as I would step in to tank. 
---
Thermaplugg staged the invasion to get Mekkatorque to nuke his own city so he could take over. Though that doesn't really put gnomes in any better light.
---
you can see the shoulders/helm/weapon which are the most important..
---
Then that guy is an asshole.  But I would hope that my ability to judge people's character would lead me to playing with people with a bit more integrity than that.
---
For all this sub likes to talk about community and friendship and server reputation, alot of you seem to have jack-shit to say for people's trustworthiness when it comes to BoE epics.
---
Hold on there, Satan.
---
Just a little PSA for those guilds:
---
World first C'thun was in 2006.
---
In 2019, you're not even going to get world second. Or third.
---
i can remember way back atleast the guild i was in they required every single person to have a decent amount of fire resist. on multiple pservers i've been on the people could care less
---
yup, wouldn't even call the shitstain BFA an mmorpg anymore.
---
Easy aolution. Make it bop when needing a boe in a party...
---
Josh, I’d like to point out that it’s not your opinion that counts but ours. 
---
Gnomes were the best shut up.
---
 They feel the fastest when running because their small size but same speed as everyone else, have the coolest hairstyles for looking like an old wizard, have second best beards next to dwarves, hard to click target in PVP
---
Humans are the worst because why play a fantasy game and play as a human how boring do you have to be
---
Dyslexic friend of mine used to call Magtheridon - Magridon. It hurt me deep inside every time he said it.
---
All the 'mistakes' the op said sound like they were contrived 2 minutes before he made the post and thought  a fake post about how he "messed up" names like noone would actually say them...
---
Ironically the ones that were real or seem real are most of the comments relying back.
---
You will see some, but it requires paying 5 subscriptions per month, so they won't be super widespread.
---
Ventrilo surprisingly still exists. The owner shows up to QuakeCon each year as a sponsor and does big raffle giveaways. Not sure how that's even a viable product anymore.
---
Gearscore definitely won't exist for the first dew months at least. However mods like Deadly Boss Mods will definitely be mandatory for most people who plan to raid. 
---
Don't think you'll be talking sense to this one... He obviously knows everything.
---
What’s next? Yearly crisis to be able to explain how miserable you are?
---
This is not directly to OP
---
As a 35 year old I would not join any guild that makes you fill out an application much less jump through all those hoops.  Fuck that noise.   I do enough paperwork for my day job.  Certainly not going to do it at night.  Anyhow guilds that recruit through rigorous applications like these are just asking for fake screenshots or bold faces lies on experience.
---
not to mention but the best way to recruit people is to run dungeons with them. If they do well recruit them. If not move on.
---
Gearscore won't be accurate, but it will 100% be used. Its just too easy of a method of vetting players, and there really aren't many other options for vetting in vanilla since things like achievements don't exist. 
---
You had me until weekends.
---
10 years sobriety down the drain. Classic, take me back.
---
You have to play a Nelf if you want to roll a druid on alliance.
---
Dun morogh is my favorite. It made me feel emotion like no other video game music has, save maybe ocarina of time.
---
That's a funny way of spelling tauren.
---
Though, Alliance-side, I totally agree.
---
People on ps dont use any gearscore addons and many ask to inspect you before joining a zg / aq20 etc
---
It depends on the size of the pull tbh and the group's relative threat. Sometimes threat is low, perhaps there's a pally in the group or the dps's are low level or bad. Sometimes you have Bloodrage off cd and can pull by charging.
---
Also single target tanking does not require much rage, multiple target tanking requires lots and lots, especially if the dps's want to AoE.
---
Or if the Dps's are not at all waiting for sunder armor. That's a factor too.
---
Whether fantasy, sci-fi or good ol' garden-variety reality, Rule #01 holds true:
---
Glorious Human Master Race
---
Macros are a lot better for multiboxing in general with the modern engine but you can’t do some of the stupid stuff that vanilla macros could, like having one button that automatically casts the most efficient heal on the best target. 
---
And multiboxing will be allowed. It was allowed in vanilla and I have a hard time believing activision blizzard would do something to stop people from paying multiple subs hehe
---
It's actually the other way around, japanese love western culture
---
I don't entirely agree with your order, but you've put the tauren in their proper place at the top of the list, so I'm not going to give you grief about it.
---
:( sorry!
---
Hahah inspect before and after to make sure he equips it🤣🤣
---
Holy shit am having flashbacks
---
Where is this recent news man. I need it. 
---
PS don't use gear score because the characters aren't available on all the WoW gearscore databases. Classic will be linked into Armory. 
---
Well of course.  Let’s not get crazy—OoT and Zelda music in general will always be #1
---
They are on databases like legacyplayers and many ps have an armoury on their site
---
legacyplayers doesn't show gear score
---
even if everyone rolls need? that’s just dumb. if not worth much and is an upgrade fine. if it’s a twink item worth hundreds of gold? you flushed it for no reason and will replace it in a few levels. 
---
You just need a BS to make the bars, but anyone can do that. Dont think you need BS yourself at any stage.
---
lol. that’s the classic nostalgia circle jerk position. never was the case in reality though. maybe for a few months after release. 
---
Like so many others, my first character was a night elf hunter (female, naturally; gotta' have that cheesecake). When she hit level 10 I ran her back to Shadowglen to tame a young nightsaber (specifically going for a level 1 kitty) who became her forever pet.
---
I eventually made the switch to Horde and found my home among the tauren, but despite my fantasy racism against the filthy pointy-ears^1 I still kinda' love the early night elf zones. Once Classic drops I'm going to roll a tauren hunter (among many, many others) and corpse-run her up Teldrassil at level 10 to tame a level 1 nightsaber in Shadowglen. Just for maximum nostalgia points.
---
^1 Trolls don't count; the kick-ass tusks cancel out the ears.
---
I know.. My original post said people dont use gearscores regardless of their access to an armoury
---
This is one of the top things gonna piss me off in classic. I try to be fair and open and then people so sneaky shit.
---
Also, hate "reserving" items in groups. That was never a thing before. Run the damn dungeon and wait for your rolls like everyone else.
---
/silly
---
Hardcore+weekend=:thinking:
---
&gt; The second factor is that your off-hand does 50% damage
---
Warriors have a talent that increases damage done by off-hand weapon by 25%, resulting in 62,5%, not 50% of damage.
---
Dwarfs and orcs, hands down best races.
---
Yes.
---
DME is a lowish lvl dungeon, and the boss mechanics aren't something to worry about. You want pretty decent gear like either full prebis or some raid gear. 
---
&gt; equip'd
---
This made me laugh for some reason
---
Instructions unclear:
---
Can’t see the armor under the shadow of the oversized helmet.
---
You've got a funny way of spelling WoD.
---
You can usually DoT the mobs and focus your shadow bolts on the main target no problem if the tank is highly skilled and the group is generally good at focusing. For mediocre tanks or poor groups, it may be too much. You can with a bit of extra DoTing early on in the dungeon and adapt accordingly.

I always found the male gnome faces extremely creepy.
---
Basic bitch Vurtne#45903 
---
Another thing is that if someone rolls greed without knowing those rules and everyone else needs, the winner should give the greed roller a chance to /roll and beat their score. If they win, they trade the item. This is assuming an honor-based loot system, of course.
---
Yeah, i think most drop tailoring for engineering after they get their BIS robes. Maybe few keep it to craft bloodvine later on.
---
&gt; Boomkin give 3 percent crit how much damage do you think it contributes to the 4 fire mages being able to equip more spellpower gear as apposed to crit gear (assuming thry are crit capped without it)
---
Less then having a fifth mage, who isn't dead fucking weight.
---
This time it'll be different. I can handle it.
---
People who think this don't understand why gear score happened. The direction of the game consistently removed the community aspect. In actual vanilla I didn't need to inspect anyone. On a medium-pop sever I knew literally every single level 60 since I played from day one. I knew which guilds were full of idiots and which weren't. I knew who I could take to dungeons safely. It had zero to do with their gear.
---
Gear score was a joke to the people who had established communities/guilds. They didn't use it and laughed about its various shortcomings in evaluating gear. It was useful only for the essentially the casual or non-social players who grouped with randoms, which became very common with LFR since it was cross-realm. Classic won't have cross-realm. Being non-social means you won't get anything done no matter what, vanilla wasn't that kind of game. 
---
People have been playing on pservers for over 10 years. Tier lists exist. Literally every piece of information and infrastructure exists to make a perfectly serviceable gear score add on.... and yet it just hasn't happened. It is almost as if some fundamental design aspect of the game makes it useless. 
---
20,000 Thunderfurys.
---
Yeah id say duel gathering and then maybe store away the cloth you get in your bank? That way when you hit 60 you don't have to drop the money you earned with your second gathering skill to buy cloth, nor will you alternatively have to go grind lowby zones for cloth. You Can just have it ready. Although lower stuff like linen cloth isn't as big of a deal cause you could get all the linen cloth you needed in one quick run through of RFC as a 60.
---
Because the ideal raid comp includes 8 shamans.
---
It won't, what people usually asked for (at least on the latest pservers) was to link your best 3 items in chat instead of inspecting.
---
This tells enough about your gear level. 
---
Just wait patiently until PAX east on March 28.  Then expect classic launch date on either July 16 or Aug 13.
---
Thats what i said when i hopped on a private server.
---
I was not prepared.
---
It amazes me that anyone can have any interest in Classic WoW and yet somehow not be familiar with the way Blizzard has done things for over 20 years. Radio silence is their standard operating procedure. It isn't just WoW, they are like this with every game they have literally ever made. 
---
&gt; Yea, you can’t afford to pay for all the ores and bars for pvp and pve anyway.
---
ITT, people with no understanding of opportunity cost.
---
Happily, most of Russians speak English now.
---
This was hypothetically with a full caster group, but i guess wf for the tank still is more beneficial for the whole group, and a lot easier to place and maintain.
---
We all know this is a lie.
---
Does wand do more dps than life tap+ drain life?
---
It's because they're not really developing a new game. There's no "look at this cool new feature" or "look at these new zones!". It's them fixing backend stuff and debugging problems while they retrofit Vanilla into a MoP infrastructure.
---
I'm not a Game Dev specifically, but I am a developer. A good chunk of their work isn't showy stuff, it's behind the scene knitty-gritty details. I'm not saying I don't want updates myself, or that they shouldn't - but I do totally understand why we aren't getting any. They just said like a week ago that Classic is still a go and the launch date is still set for 2019.
---
Take heart! 
---
If I remmember correctly BoE blues and purpz are for everyone for the AH.
---
I seen some bad grammar in this post
---
Wailing Caverns is notorious for a no people joining 40% through, bcause you get the first gem 5minutes in. After that people are a lot less likely to join.
---
BFD has such a shitshow predungeon that you either backtrack, fight your way to the new one or he dies himself through 2-4 times.
---
Uldaman has the same issue as BFD.
---
SFK takes ages to track from the Barrens where most level appropiate people are to come to UC, fly to the Sepulcher, run all the way to SFK to enter.
---
etc...
---
There are a lot of dungeons in which I will 100% tell people to roll need on everything except BoPs to avoid ninjas increasing my dungeon run by 30minutes when the run from start to finish would take 45mins.
---
Wands generally out dps drain life until around level 40ish.  ZFK is when I start drain lifeing instead of wanding. 
---
Gnomes are definitely the WORST! I have played alliance over the years but i don't feel like my opinion should really matter because i think the best Alliance race is the Draenei. 
---
As for horde it is so hard to decide, I would probably say Orc/Undead for tie then Troll/Tauren for the other tie. I love all of the old horde races. I am not a huge fan of the Blood elves but i do sort of like the Nightborne (AKA methed out NE)
---
Fuck off Jesus get your own
---
People with more time will probably have a gear advantage but a skilled or well practiced player can still crush people in blues
---
All of them
---
Beyond damage meters, I'm fine with getting rid of addons.  Since this is a classic version of the game, might as well play in the way the developers intended.
---
Gnomes deserve it.
---
Centaur are the children of a Demigod.  What are Trogs again?  Retarded earthen?
---
Why human females?  Hit box?
---
Throws off the napkin math a bit, but same overall effect.
---
In that regard you cannot compare pservers with how Vanilla wow was. Pserver player generally are a subset, generally reasonable hardcore players with years and years of experience v.s. total noobs in Vanilla. Back in Vanilla at release the game was new, ppl generally werent rushing to level cap or raid progress and whilst i don't remember for 100%, there might have been bugs involved which caused MC progress to take longer. 
---
Hahaha very good!
---
&gt; Funny thing is he never told me he was even dyslexic until Legion. Pretty sure he got diagnosed a little late in life 
---
I didn't realize I was dyslexic until I was 33.  I read that dyslexic people had issues reading and I speed read everything so how could I be dyslexic?
---
I agree, this sounds like a good rule. Was something like that ever implemented in WoW?
---
Same. My 1-60 run on Nostalrius had me playing more than I ever did back in the day. It was the best gaming experience I had ever since Vanilla.
---
WoW us good, but it's got nothing on castlevania SOTN
---
I think it was. But dont know when they changed it back. You could only greed to sell it. Need made it bind instandly. It even gave massage. Needing on it makes it bind on pickup
---
That said, time in practice is also a thing so you'll likely play to the level of your experience. Instead of thinking of it as "wrecked by people with more time than me" think of it as being wrecked by people who practice more than you. Regardless, you'll have fun if you want to.
---
Something to remember is that 2H fury is viable in pvp without respeccing. Which is nice
---
Mages are perhaps one of the best classes in pvp, but I agree it is not the easiest class to play. Watch a couple of pvp videos if Vurtne, and you will probably want to stick to playing mage :)

The Sundering was 10000 years ago. I don't think there has been any specific lore on the Darkspear islands in vanilla, apart from a generic "formerly peaceful Murlocs are attacking us" in Warcraft 3, there were also no Naga, only Murlocs, controlled by a sea witch that used the Banshee model.
---
Good luck without a threat meter and with your healers using 2004 raid frames. 
---
Hit Box  **( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)** 
---
I think that two different items with the same name would not be good for players. For example you might buy that item at AH to turn-in without realizing that it's a "wrong" item. That's the main motivation for changing name.
---
I still say that
---
Also when jumping it feels like you jump 3 times your height.
---
They're not bringing back 2004 raid frames.  And I did half of Vanilla raiding before threat meters were a thing in our raids.
---
These are all 100% correct. Pserver player?
---
seeing as though blizzard is a soy company ofc u would. Sucks i like p servers where u can say what u want. None of this mommy blizzard dis meany call me bad name mommy blizzard pls ban. 
---
&gt; Ahn-qiray
---
hmm, I used to say that the same way
---
&gt; See-thun
---
hmm, and how is it supposed to be called? Tsee-thun?
---
The thing i miss most between live and classic are all the rpg elements that got shed over the years. Classic very much felt like a world that you could use to find your own adventures in which lends itself to being remade as a standalone product imo. Live is very much linear path of killing the latest bad guys never looking back or diverting from the path.

[quote]Blizzard applied a loot-lock which if a player rolls "Need", it cannot be traded.[/quote]

part of loot trading

it probably did, as one of the "summoned" had to come on their own - fortunately, he knew the way.

ooo you are the perfect type of prey though!

PvE has always been a watered-down carebear experience
---
&gt; I called Illidan as Lidian
---
I called him Iladian, just like Iladian direct plus.
---
Don't know if the medication existed back then, but once I heard an ad on TV, it was very funny
---
Definitely a fetish.
---
So it's ok to be an asshole below 40? I think that's not ok.
---
If the original devs didn't intend addons they wouldnt have provided the ability or even allowed them. 
---
MC is already a joke. Making an entry-level raid easier isn't really that big of a deal.
---
Agree with other comments, but as you identified it is too completely different playstyles and you should select the one you enjoy the most. Personally, I have never enjoyed melee classes, but that is just me. I reckon Rogue will give you the most joyful group synergy in terms of gear development, professions and dungeon experience, but if you burnout playing rogue that doesn’t really matter.
---
&gt; a majority of people thought Stromgarde was Stormgarde
---
wait, isn't it Stormgarde?
---
Well, I thought it was Stormgrade.
---
such sad for carebear :( game too hard
---
This guys money's.

roll greed on BoEs that you will not equip, you may lose the item to a ninja.
---
roll need on BoEs that you will not equip, you become the ninja.
---
No changes. There are so many situations like this. AQ gates is just easily comprehensible by most.
---
No matter what is done, Classic won't be a *new* experience. That's not the point. It will be a preservation of authentic Vanilla for "as long as possible" as they said in Blizzcon.
---
Should they change the mat requirement every 5 years? Every time they make a new server? Should they change Argent Dawn rep turn-ins? Should they throw a curveball for interracial mount cloth turn-ins so people can't stockpile? Should they change Naxx attune requirements?
---
It's a fool's errand. We will know AQ gates is coming, and that's ok. It's not 2005.

This sounds funny, was the Indian headdress like a turban by chance? So in effect you were dressed as a suicide bomber? I think I remember some guys on my server doing this, top stuff. *tips ash*
---
Thank you so, so much for taking the time to write all of this to me. Really shows how caring you are and how much you want to help! Really, really excited about this mate :). You’re also into OSRS? Hell yes brother!!
---
So the kind of classes I might enjoy (lore, heal/DPS, raiding, dungeons/pvp)
---
Lore wise, I love druids and hunters. Warlocks are up there too, as I love their edgy-ness. Shamans seem really interesting as well (love the nature IRL).
---
Usually I’d set for a warrior, but they seem too... I don’t know, blunt? GW2 ruined my fun on warriors in MMO’s.
---
I don’t necessarily want to DPS; if anything, I love helping others out. Nothing too serious, just being in the background and letting others shine and them putting out the big numbers. I also love ranged more than melee in most cases, as I get to enjoy the environment more? Like, I love being able to stay back and fully see the boss we’re fighting for example.
---
As for raids, dungeons/pvp - I’m definitely most excited for pvp. I just love working as a team, and winning over the opponent. Later on, I’ll definitely check out raiding casually.
---
You know mate, I just want to play a character that’s set for a good while. That I complete. Get that “achievement, quest cape” feeling. Pretty good at everything, but doesn’t has to be THE best.
---
I was set on druids for a while, but them being mana hungry really puts me off. I don’t know... I’m so torn. I love that you’re willing to help me out brother. Seriously, thank you.
---
No. Addons should be there but Blizzard needs to be very stringent and pro-active and control how effective and powerful addons will be. 
---
I hope Blizzard doesnt give the opportunity for developers to prepare addons for release. The addons from 1.12 obviously wont work and hopefully the addons from Legion 7.3.5 wont work either nor be able to be ported to Classic quickly. Hopefully Blizzaz make it that addons will have to be made from the ground up for Classic. That way there will be no addons at lauch like in 2004 and those early raiders in Molten Core and Onxyia will have to do it without addons. 
---
Roughly speaking, gear, skill, choices (profs build etc) all of these add a chunk of the outcome.
---
If someone is vastly outgearing you but they're a noob, you might still lose. If they have a bit better gear but you vastly out skill them, you can crush them. Etc.
---
People farm maraudon at 60 for gold many times. You know that?
---
Cant be a gnome hunter
---
MC is literally the first raid. It's supposed to be introductory. Asking for it to be harder is like asking RFC to be harder.
---
Let MC be easy. It's ok. Get your ass kicked in BWL, AQ40, and Naxx.
---
Priest/Rogue has always had amazing pvp synergy in any expansion of wow. So I would stick to rogue, if this is how you feel. Don’t change to accompdate a friend, especially when it is 50/50 anyways. However, if you intend to play hardcore premade PvP, chances are that you will be solo guarding flag in WSG and gold mine in AB. And not be able to enjoy the synergy with your friend.
---
Like someone had said, "WoW never had more content than during Vanilla."
---
Counterintuitively, this is because so much of the game and world was relevant. Low level mats, every single raid, every continent is relevant.
---
As soon as you get TBC and with each additional expansion, even though 'new content' is added, more content than that is made absolutely obsolete. Therefore the overall amount of content in the game actually decreases, not increases.
---
I distinctly remember /joke making your character tell a joke. But on ~pserver~ the emote does absolutely nothing. Was it removed or something?
---
Don’t put words in my mouth. It’s way easier to get away with ninja’ing random loot or low level epics than it is to ninja 500g+ BIS BOEs. 
---
This thread is racist.
---
When an armless man tries to stop you, but gets at you from the wrong side.  
---
BTS: what's a "quarter life crisis"? 
---
BfA is awful. I just can't believe the total lack of content and the content that is there is bland and boring. Warfronts are so simple its mind numbing dumbness. The Island Expeditions are ok for the first few times but get boring real quick and only hold interest for mount and pet collectors.
---
The storyline is terrible. The zones are boring.Basically everything about Battle for Azeroth screams "done on the cheap". Warlords of Draenor had a lack of content but mainly in the 2nd year, not the 1st and the content that was there was pretty good. I really enjoyed Tanaan Jungle and its was a hundred times better than anything in BfA. 
---
Considering you played up until early Legion there isn't that much content you havent seen. Legion was a pretty good expansion. Personally I'd rate Legion ahead of Crapacylsm, BfA and WoD. Maybe just fork out the $15 a month to play and finish off Legion content and forget buying Battle for Azeroth.
---
You're just miring that +5% int.
---
My only level 60 in vanilla was a warrior and I’d wreck rogues most of the time. I’d win probably 80% of my duels outside of Org and I wasn’t very geared. I only had 2 or 3 purples and the rest were blues and I was able to beat rogues with much higher gear. Overpower is really strong when rogues pop evasion you can just mash them. I think the toughest rogues are the combat ones who can disarm you. 
---
/moo, but only for Tauren.
---
I think it has always been slash silly
---
a few PuG raids and offpieces can put almost any character at R10 gear level or higher.  
---
that should be good enough to enjoy the game.
---
I agree, i was thinking of it as time spent in game raiding.
---
 I mean in a PvP setting the guy that does a Bg once a week for fun but has a gear advantage from raiding 3 times a week is more likely to loose to the guy that has time to just  PvP -maybe even get rank 10 over time,and has some PvP rep rewards and dungeon gear
---
As you said though the thing you spend your limited game time practicing is what you’ll do best in. I’m just saying that gear definitely isn’t everything in PvP 
---
Thunderfury, for a wind serpent.
---
Warlocks can farm it too. Watch it on youtube
---
I used to pound warriors into the ground as a combat mace spec rogue, but that was leveling not at 60 against well-geared warriors.  YMMV.  I also spec Riposte which was quite useful at disarming warriors from time to time.  
---
Hot take, before bgs were introduced our rp pve server would regularly fight it out in dusk wood and tarrens mill.
---
Second of all our rp clan rp'd war. We had a partner alliance guild were we had rp wars.
---
Alliance even build their own stormwind guard to defend against the horde. 
---
So rp servers are the real experience. 
---
Also pve isn't easy mode. That would imply that pvp is hard. 
---
What really happens when you die on a pvp server?
---
Nothing. Absolutely nothing. 
---
Wow is very casual friendly pvp. In meridian59 every death meant loosing all your gear, stats and skills.
---
That's some high stakes you filthy casual. 
---
A well played rogue is definitely at least 50% vs non orc/dwarf.
---
Rubbish. There was a lack of content in Warlords of Draenor but that was mainly in the 2nd year and at least the content in WoD was decent compared to the bland BfA crap.
---
I never remember being totally bored in WoD just weeks after its release. We're coming up to the 7 month mark of Battle for Azeroth's release and what has Blizzard added in that 7 months? One raid and a couple of short and terrible questlines. It's painfully obvious that Blizzard has cut back on development costs to increase profits. 
---
Whaaat! Need to try this now, thank you.
---
I played paladin as main class in vanilla, let me tell you, tanking is off the menu. Sure, someone will probably link a video of the odd paladin tanking a boss, but that’s he thing... it’s the odd video. He majority of tanking was done by warriors for a good reason - no taunt. If you lost aggro, good look getting it back. Sure hey can tank, but it’s not convenient.. your best role would be healing as holy, utilising lower ranks of holy light for mana efficiency... off going dps with Ret and off healing as and when healing. 
---
I wouldn‘t say necessary as it sounds like you can‘t play the game without - which you perfectly can though (even raiding etc.). 
---
But I agree that they are definitely making your life more comfortable and as they were available back then I don‘t even get why OP bothered to make this post.
---
MDPS warriors, hunters, rogues
---
Healer Priests, Druids, Paladins, Shamans
---
RDPS Mage, warlock
---
Tank Warrior
---
Bland crap? The leveling experience is good, the raids have been good, mythic+ has gotten a lot better now that infested is gone.
---
Warfronts and island expeditions are, of course, shit, but so was everything related to the garrison.
---
What exactly were you doing for seven months in WoD that kept you occupied? 
---
thx thats helpful.
---
What kind of info do you all expect? Literally the only info worth waiting for is the release date. Everything else has been said already, most of it prior to 2005 actually.
---
Yeah wow soundtrack is really good. But I personally think nintendo has the best soundtracks. Especially the Zelda franchise. 
---
No damage = No rage = No threat = Boss runs towards the caster group and kill them all.
---
Good luck getting bis as spriest you're the very last in line on loot priority
---
Kill omen get buff and then do /dance with the revelers also in moonglade and they also give you a 10% stat buff ON TOP OF the omen one.
---
Perhaps, but you'd miss the human racial weapon skill instead which is quite a boon to your dps against raidboss targets.
---
Spriest being the "king of 1v1" is just a meme. Technically holy priest is way better in the warlock vs priest matchup bc holy priests can pretty much never run out of mana and the matchup ends in a stalemate.
---
Yes but FR gear lacks alot of other stats so you'll gimp your dps/healing/threat
---
No serious raiding guild in 2019 will be using fire res on anything except their tanks.
---
Because males looks god awful for everything but warriors.
---
*Wooo* It's your **1st Cakeday** omino23! ^(hug)
---
To be fair sitting right next to a murloc infestation on an island is the worst case scenario. Can't even evade them by going inlands. 
---
They are the zerglings of the sea.
---
But the same can be said about gnomes. Nobody could tell just how many troggs would be belched from the earth. 
---
lets say the duel is without any consum, nothing , just pure duel = Rogue will always win. Stun/garrote into rupture ant stay 5-10 yards in dead zone near warrior so he can't hit, re-stealth, do the same. Yes warrior can fear 1 time but the rogue is undead its over.
---
This comes up again and again.
---
It's not as easy as just a "toggle". The old data (models, animations, etc.) and code is intertwined. They need to work *a lot* on making sure that everything will look like it did. Even after more than a year of work, the demo was far from perfect. They promised they'll get it right.
---
I'm sure most people would agree that getting back the original graphics and the whole game to work without bugs is much more important than trying to add a toggle for new graphics.
---
(There will be optional graphical improvements. Things which are just a global, easy toggle. Modern shadows and water mainly.)
---
The first experiments of the titans before they got it right with the dwarven. One could say dwarven are better made troggs.
---
Just have enough of them and you can invade any town.
---
Spasstiger
---
Then there is a guy who needs and doesn't even need it, making the item basically vendor trash. There is no winning if people are involved. Then again classic is supppsed to have tighter community so stuff like this gets you blacklisted reaaally fast. 
---
The key is not to play russian rulette with russians who do not respond. Instead find a new party which actually communicates.
---
[https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=290](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=290)
---
It will be about Normal level with Rag probably a middle Heroic boss I think. 
---
This makes me want to play a gnome more. In fact, I'm going gnome-only.
---
Yea every caster uses the same bis list pretty much. Tier gear isn't that amazing in vanilla.
---
You have a great taste. 
---
Are you happy now?
---
I like how optimistic you are... and have clearly no idea of what you're talking about.
---
&gt;Stun/garrote into rupture 
---
Berserker rage says hello.
---
&gt;  stay 5-10 yards in dead zone near warrior so he can't hit,
---
This will NEVER. EVER. **EVER** happen. Say hello to Hamstring/Piercing howl. It was fun.

10.0 yards ≈ 9.1 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)

Combat rogues have chances if they time the disarms right. Also, using Evasion will insta-give the warrior the win.

Ignore them dude, this sub is also solely dad gamers who think that Classic is going to be everyone being best friends, holding hands and skipping in the evening sun.

Welcome to Classic private server hardcore raid scene.
---
I think they're silent because they know the community won't be happy when they reveal what changes they've made so they want to wait til the game is actually playable to announce them so all the people who've been waiting for a no changes classic get stuck in sunk cost fallacy and still give the game a chance.

It's a side game mode for WoW. It's *not* a new game. Realistically only about 5% of the current player base will play it after the initial rush subsides. Also, it'll be a freebie. You might be extremely hyped about it but from Blizzard's perspective, there is nothing to hype.
---
Because it's a recreation of an existing game, there is also nothing to say about how it'll play. (There are some things which will be different, like things related to potential sharding/loot trading/reporting but also opposed to some people here, Blizzard sees them as technical things which must be solved by them for running the game, not gameplay related and not something they need to talk about with players. You can not like that but I can understand where they are coming from. Also they might not even know how they will solve them yet. They might say something about it when they have done it.)
---
It'll not get canceled. It's worked on by a very small but enthusiastic and dedicated team. It's a love project, basically which we should be happy about. If it were a new, large game, Blizzard would be under extreme pressure to make it "successful" (meaning it would need to bring in a lot of money). This is not the case now, fortunately. It doesn't cost them much to create, it'll cost them even less to run (although that'll not be ideal, basically no GMs and such) and it'll bump WoW's subscriber numbers. It should be in a very cosy place.
---
Ghost crawler used to pump out blog posts like nobodies business the current employees of blizzard are just lazy it's as simple as that

Pure Night Elf race, preferably Ashenvalid. The race superior to all other.
---
Quelo-thalid is unacceptable, even if they have pale skin, blue eyes and blonde hair. Sorry, purple lives matter more.
---
When I heard about the antignomic movements, I thought people were just oversensitive. Until I came myself to Ironforge. And saw that little piles of fat, with their dick-exposing goggles and terrorism-ready backpacks, just walk the streets as if they were Dwarves. There is nothing I hate, than those little scum. They're not dwarves, they're animals. They are too dangerous to be let alive. They have to be exterminated, and their bodies burned in heaters. That's the only way they can be beneficial.
---
As with the goblins, they are too ~~semitized~~ gnomized to let them free. They will make good slaves, though.

---
/bored 
---
Depends what you do in retail tbh. Most of the game in Classic is "harder" meaning more time consuming,  more grindy and time consuming but raids are absolutely trivial compared to Mythic. The grind feels more meaningful than BfA though. 
---
It is amazing though, server community + feeling of true progression is so much better than anything since MoP. 
---
contact a GM, have it sorted out...  
---
reducing the amount of loot tickets does not mean they will not take action at all anymore.
---
With the gear and buffs you where using you must've been critcapped. You should do the same test with full bis gear and more hit pieces to counter the critcap.
---
I appreciate the comment, but I said skip PvE. :P
---
Never did. I asked a question. I know that it is this way, but I don't think it's ok to behave like an asshole, regardless of the content and level.
---
Just wanted to know if you think it's ok for you, or if you don't care. Maybe you think it isn't ok like myself, but you just accept it.
---
Unless the rogues gears up aiming for 0 agi he will dodge. The warrior will spam hamstring to proc OP. And it's not like OP has no cd anyway.
---
You don't need more than 1 to be honest. 2 is fine as well. 
---
Math backup:
---
161900 stacks of items (all 20 stacks, which was not the case at vanilla war effort if i remember correct but is to be expected)
---
This takes 10118.75 bags (16 slot) 
---
This equals 686.02 chars needed for storage (14.75 bags per char)
---
Each char costs 191.1 gold to get the backspace (5 gold per bag + bank slots) 
---
This results in 131098 gold for bagspace needed.
---
So impossible is an exagaration. But it is highly unlikly that this will happen.
---
IIRC it's anxiety on which direction to take your life in.
---
The math has been done, it is nowhere near 90%.
---
A good rogue should win most of the time against an equally geared warr it all comes down to execution and yes managing to stay in the deadzone is very doable.
---
But for most people this isn’t the reality. The majority will look like a naked she-elf ate a Green Ooze and vomited it back up on you. 
---
For me its Night elf or Undead for horde
---
Ah, thanks for the feedback, I really didn't know about it.  
---
I'm **very** familiar with the following one, though...
---
Someone hates multi boxing heaps of downvotes here
---
Am I alone in never ever equipping blues/epics while levelling? I much prefer having 100g spare cash by 40 to get a mount, something that dramatically speeds up levelling when compared to a handful of stat points.
---
Hey I PMd you regarding a couple of issues, namely to save you some sanity I could implement a DB check to prevent multiple entries, so you don't have to go through and manually delete them per request.  I have some free time currently, just hit me up.
---
Cool project btw.
---
&gt; In that regard you cannot compare pservers with how Vanilla wow was. Pserver player generally are a subset, generally reasonable hardcore players with years and years of experience v.s. total noobs in Vanilla. 
---
Although I wasn't around or part of it, lots of hardcore Everquest players and guilds migrated to WoW. It wasn't all twelve year olds who had never played a computer game before derping around.
---
&gt; Back in Vanilla at release the game was new, ppl generally werent rushing to level cap or raid progress
---
If you played productively for a couple of hundred hours you'd make sixty whatever you did. I can't imagine a serious player not being sixty in two months, three at the outside.
---
&gt; whilst i don't remember for 100%, there might have been bugs involved which caused MC progress to take longer.
---
Could be, I know there were for C'thun and I had a vague idea Rag got nerfed and that pre-nerf Rag was never killed but that could be wrong.
---
/lol
---
Most warriors who are serious about PvP will run with a weapon chain, making them immune to disarms
---
While some might be like that you also seem to miss the problem most people have with new graphics - development time. I don’t care if you can switch on modern graphics, but I do care if the devs have to spend time and money on making it possible instead of making *vanilla*.
---
I guess a good compromise would be to get Classic out, fix bugs and stuff and once it is under control they can spend time adding these non vanilla features that doesn’t impact other people.
---
Adding to this, generally unacceptable things are not allowed regardless of context - for example racism.
---
Moo
---
Adding onto the already given advice, you can take a class that doesn't have major gear dependence like a frost mage. Even with basic gear, if you practice enough you can kill people who outgear you by a fair amount.
---
Okay so you actually have no idea what you are talking about. Let me correct you :
---
Stun/garrote are not removed by beserker rage.
---
Rogues have stronger slow, 70% to wars 50%, but also have sprint/vanish if needed to get in deadzone.
---
Good rogues win this matchup 90% of time unless against orc, then it's like 75%.
---
blizz stated they will forbid any addon which is impacting the game in a not classic like gameplay. we are in 2019 so you cant prevent the game changing to what we know from 2004 but you can prevent addons like groupfinders and other nonsense. there have been addons in classic as well. 
---
there is a bluepost which says that everything is planned accordingly. stop spreading your influenca
---
Leveling Rogues &gt; Warriors.
---
Endgame Warriors &gt; Rogues but trinket usage and consumables play big parts in endgame pvp. There is so much variation the game actually gets balanced endgame in 1 v 1. Duels with no trinkets, engineering and consumables? Yeah classes hard counter each other. That's why those duels are stupid unless it's a mirror. Just like modern WoW where 1 v 1 is actually worse due to lack of consumables, trinkets and mind games to fix it.
---
With no trinkets (outside pvp trinket) and no consumables every class STILL has a spec to beat a rogue 1 v 1 or at least have a 50/50 chance of winning. The problem is that most people suck, while most people that roll rogue (and mage) are people who love to practice, duel and pvp. I'm not saying they are better than all players (druid prob has the highest cap), I'm saying there are more decent rogues than freakin ret paladins. More decent mages than hunters. These 2 classes dominate the "duel area" for a reason. People will never admit it though, so they have their scapegoats. Meanwhile most of the good rogues on private servers rerolled after Nost because in 1.12 warriors are simply better at more things and more flexible. 
---
Ask GOOD players of every class if rogues are overpowered and they will laugh at how stupid the question is. I main warrior now. Not because of 1 v 1, but because of utility with mstrike, insane dmg in bg's, synergy with healers, dominating 2 roles in PVE, ease of gearing and because they get more powerful each content release and scale stupidly well compared to other classes. THAT is how you should look at classes imo. Any good player can kick the crap out of a bad player with trinkets/consumables and the right race/class combinations.
---
If all you care about is 1 v 1 with no special trinkets, consumables roll a SL Lock. Have fun being bored out of your mind facetanking people. Shadowpriest is another good option. Spriest runs out of mana in BG's and SL Locks have no burst and are mediocre at BG's so enjoy. I would much rather play a ele shaman or a hunter over both, even if they aren't quite as strong 1 v 1 in silly "rule duels". I would much rather burst someones face off with ele mastery chain lightning or blow up a mage on a hunter and make them cry draining their mana with vipersting. Better yet do it to a spriest who already has mana problems.
---
orc = shrek 
---
Kuh thoon. 
---
No shield and no renew is the answer. ALWAYS let the tank do his thing, without healing (because that can cause you to gain aggro off a add). Id say depending on tank gear and amount he takes damage, let him go down to 2/3 to 50% before casting anything.

The leveling curve is pretty shit in vanilla. Even an experienced player is going to be looking at \~7+ days /played to level a non-hunter, more likely 10 days /played. Factor in sleep and I think we're looking at a couple weeks before we see the first guilds step into MC undergeared. From memory there is enrage timers as a soft gear requirement and there is also resist gear requirements. I think we're staring at 3-3.5 weeks before MC is cleared by the first guild.
---
Sorry dude, not true. Yes I know they have those moves but I’ve played with shamans since diremaul release. They cannot hold aggro against FPS classes UNLESS - it’s only 1 mob and the dps takes it easy. Unreliable, but good for temporarily picking up adds.
---
I was a hardcore raider in Vanilla and TBC. 12 hours of WOW per day was normal, it was closer to 16 hours during content push.
---
How do you skip the rest of the instance?
---
...what?
---
I raided with Eminence on Blackrock. My experience was the best raiding guilds also had the best PVPers and they typically had really good levelers. 
---
A mid-life crisis that happens at a quarter of your life, but is realistically closer to a third.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about.
---
I'm a level 14 dwarf hunter and I'm having so much fun helping people, visiting the quest zones, gathering my mats for engineering and just being able to take.my.time.
---
There is no rush to get to 60 to start the game as the  journey to 60 is the game imo.
---
True, that.
---
Blue pvp gear is easy to get and really good for a lot of classes.
---
Mage, Priests, Lock, enhance shaman (AV hammer and blue pvp gear), Ret paladin (same as enhance), hunter will all work great. Druids will too but druids, mix and match a lot of gear and some of them are really easy things to get.
---
So Holy Paladin (best gear is in raids), Ele Shaman (best gear is in raids), Pure Boomkin, Warrior is what I would avoid. Especially avoid warrior if you have limited time. A warrior with no gear is bad. Really bad. 
---
Mage
---
It's 5 days /played for the best levellers in the world. I practised power levelling in Vanilla and I raised about 10 hunters to 60. The 5 days /played mark is an incredibly efficient and planned levelling experience which also relies on being well ahead of the levelling curve.

You are a dick but Blizzard will tolerate you cuz of the MONIE$$$$. (but seriously, just don't go into battlegrounds like that...)

40 priests
---
are you healing bosses to death?
---
I think any kind of addon should be banned that automates something.
---
Like that stupid boss mod which tells you the attacks when they come... Defeats the whole point of the fight and promotes retail mentality.
---
I never did it back in the day - I MH with flash heal in my ignorance - but how important is downgrading heal ranks for sustainability? I had few issues in MC but that may have been the other healers going far and above to cover me. I’d like to expand my priest knowledge and be a better healer this time around. Any advice is very much appreciated.
---
I did pretty much nothing but PvP as a Mage in vanilla. They can do pretty well in just dungeon blues, even without the PvP set. In the end, you'll never be as strong as someone in raid gear, but you can definitely do fine without.
---
Is it really though, or is it based on assumptions and the state of the game during entire vanilla. This is 1.12 we're playing, with different items and talent trees. I'd like to see a real comparison taking everything in to consideration, not only dps. 
---
Smite it up
---
Gnomes are cool, though. On the highest hair option. Anything else looks awful.
---
My real least favorite is humans, since it makes no sense to play a boring-ass human when you have 7 fictional race options available.
---
Trolls are the best, though, and nobody can change my mind.

I just want the exact release date so I can book my long vacation. It's getting on my nerves more and more as the deadline to submit it approaches...

Yes a turban. 
---
Original World of Warcraft got amazing ambience soundtracks. They are a really good fit for the world.
---
In terms of music, FFXIV beats WoW out of the water because of its diverse soundtracks, all from soothing, calm melodies to straight up rock/metal with actual lyrics playing in the game during intense boss fights. It works so well and pumps you up.
---
To be fair. Private servers today are very different than they were back in 2010-2012. Today they have very large populations but still retaining a very low latency of around 30-50 and goldspam isnt even that bad if you got anti spam addon.
---
I like how you say he has no idea what he's talking about and proceed to make out like zerker rage removes stuns/bleeds and that a Warrior's slow is better than crippling...
---
so bored of these druid special snowflake posts... druids arent good get over it
---
Tauren only have a 3 yard deadzone, so that makes deadzone kiting them ~3x harder. Stuff is about as hard as the square of the allowable standard error. It might even be harder than that, because they kill the "safe" edge. Against other races, if you mess up and dip into range, at least you trade blows and you still get some value. Against Tauren, you just take 3.8s of white DPS (and give them rage). Either way, if you're speaking from experience, you would note Tauren are vastly more difficult to deadzone kite.
---
Hamstring lasts longer than poison, and is more reliable to apply. Dwarves also can remove the poison.
---
There's just a breakpoint where warriors get more value. The more health you both have, the more rage they get before the end of the fight.
---
I once had a rogue russian in my brd group, he stayed stealthed 100% of the time following us and doing nothing else but talk about his life in prison (idk if thats true, seem fishy that he could play wow there) he went afk to «hide the weed he was smoking from the guardian»
---
I only understood half of the bullshit he was saying but at least it was funny
---
Resto druid in TBC arena was incredibly overpowered.
---
Can always play with the back to the warrior in that case as a random thought, between energy ticks. 
---
Yeah, if someone equips it that is ultimately just them saving the cost of buying the item.  I never understood people that make this more difficult than it is.
---
&gt;But Hunters are bottom tier dps and not amazing in pvp.
---
My memories of AV, as a rogue in Vanilla, weren't great. Hunters at least had a role in that ranged combat.
---
He's crying now
---
Yeah, but you gotta reset your brain.

White shoulders: Huge feeling of accomplishment to vanilla players.

Just have to wait a few months, some dedicated people will have the gold by then
---
If I were that s priest I would:
---
1) start in shadowform and put some burst/presure on
---
2) switch out of sf and heal/dispell/dps 
---
At that point it is an attrition game which depends on gear. A sp can have healing gear on and mix with damage gear.... Can SL be dispelled?
---
Also instead of dumplings, use 10agi food that stacks with dragonbreath chili, and then shadow oils on weapons instead of shaprning stones as well as spelldmg consumables/elixirs/flask.

And saw that little piles of fat, with their dick-exposing goggles and terrorism-ready backpacks, just walk the streets as if they were Dwarves. There is nothing I hate, than those little scum. They're not dwarves, they're animals. They are too dangerous to be let alive. They have to be exterminated, and their bodies burned in heaters. That's the only way they can be beneficial.As with the goblins, they are too semitized gnomized to let them free. They will make good slaves, though.Heil Tyrande!

if you play a male warrior or female druid, yes, then learn to play.

Already upped mage and hunt 60 on ND but that's irrelevant, I just happen to have something else than wow in my life so MC can last more than a month. You should try having other hobbies it'll avoid you killing yourself when you clear naxx for the last time lul

I never noticed
---
I have the idea that an ideal raid conp includes 40 shamans
---
been playing this game whole my life, and im talking from warrior pov. if the rogue is realy good, u can't win a duel unless he does something wrong. Im not there to prove who knows better or stuff like that, dude asked whats it's like to duel a rogue vs warrior. In cassual pvp - yes warrior crushes rogue , overpower crit and thats it.
---
Well you can be frustrated no matter how well you are familiar with their way of doing it. 
---
I don’t think he knows what it is himself 
---
Yea, there is almost always a better option when you trade the item in for gold and then get the exact item that fits you. But instead you can have that stupid group pressure to equip it. When everyone trades their items, everyone wins. 
---
How about 1 rogue vs 2 Warriors with Sulfuras ?  Or everybody forgot the no gear , lvl1 dagger rogue who could kill full geared lvl60s ?
---
i dont think this will work out fine
---
why would they push updates to battle.net for **internal** testing 
---
At first I thought it was from actual vanilla because of the shit quality, but guess it's just a private server. For private server content, it's nothing special.
---

---
Keep in mind there will be no Ice Barbed Spear this time around. AV is phase 2.

and this is why any warrior seriouss about pvp should use weapon chain lol

I was used +100AP vs Undead stones, so no shadow oils then...

Well, I mean a BoP has value on vendor too. Smaller, but value still.
---
100% Stormwind and Ironforge. 
---
The SFK/MC battle music is amazing too.
---
The original WoW main menu music is good too, but it can't hold a candle to BC's main menu music.
---
&gt; Stun/garrote are not removed by beserker rage.
---
did I say I was using berserker rage as an **answer** to stun/garrote? *Please*, spare me the talk.
---
&gt; Rogues have stronger slow, 70% to wars 50%, but also have sprint/vanish if needed to get in deadzone.
---
Look at all those aoe abilities with enough range to keep you in the fight. but don't worry, blow all your big cooldowns in the beginning of the fight. I can wait. Oh I **CAN** wait.
---
&gt; Good rogues win this matchup 90% of time unless against orc, then it's like 75%.
---
LMAO you are so FUCKING deluded it's not even funny.
---
As you can see at the end of vid there is only like 25% of damage goes from white attacks... Thats why crit&gt;hit in that case.

maybe thats the point :P

I don't play private servers. Feel free to explain my obvious flaws.

well then i think the 40 priest variation is more fun :P

Whatever our goobers have rolled and leveled by then - personally playing a feral druid.

Shouldn't worry too much about composition I figure unless you are pushing for cutting edge prog. Enjoy the ride, raid, banter and fellows around.

As far as I remember it was instant.
---
Very
---
You made the right choice. That gold enables you to buy a great item that upgrades you just as much. You wouldn´t hand 500g in cash to someone. And that is exactly what that item is. 500g that just dropped for someone. 
---
thats interesting. whats your intention going for feral? is it pvp, or a more challenging rotation? did you play a feral on a vanilla server? just personal curiousness  
---
Yeah and then one person rolls need, dips out, and is 100g+ richer.
---
Sorry, but is what the real vanilla meta looks like, you stack as many warriors as you can.  Especially in MC, where warriors are capable of doing 3k DPS on cleave fights.
---
You can throw in a hunter for tranq/rogue for trap disarm in BWL/a few priests for dispel, but the core idea will stay the same.
---
&gt;  you can stockpile from day 1
---
Nobody in their right mind is going to be stockpiling mats from Day 1/Level 0 - not when those mats could be sold for mounts and consumables.
---
Private server people to this day keep making mistakes when writing names of stuff, examples like:
---
Ogrimmar (Orgrimmar)
---
Dun Balder (Dun Baldar)
---
Drak'thar (Drek'Thar)
---
Melinda/Belinda (Balinda)
---
Rouge (Rogue)

---
This, a million times over. There's also the whole concept of PvE - it is a scripted encounter. You know exactly what is going to happen, and more often than not, when it's going to happen. It's all so predictable. The exact opposite of PvP.
---
Hey, don't take the piss on gnomes. They are the funniest to kill as Horde!

Just one more hit Blizz 😖
---
&gt; but pvped a lot in TBC 
---
&gt; especially as a lvl 60 player casual player 
---
&gt; I feel i will get wrecked by people with more time than me 
---
If I understand correctly, you want to be a casual player in Classic, you like to PvP more than anything else, and you feel that players with more time to play than you will wreck you in PvP.
---
If this is the case, yes, you will get wrecked by people who play more time than you do. Why? Not because they play more time, but because the reason that they SPEND more time is because they want to be as good as possible, which means that those people won't be casual players.
---
They will have far better gear that you and much more experience in PvP (be it WPvP or BGs). Any player that have good gear and PvP experience in Classic is also a skilled player. Casuals, no matter how skilled they are, they will always fell behind hardcore players, because those guys are also skilled, but have the advantage of gear and experience.
---
However, if you are planning to play Classic as a PvPer...you will not enjoy it if you do it casually. But, thank God that Classic have so much more to offer for a casual, and not only PvP.
---
Horse crap - anyone who’s played a shaman for a

Long time at 60 knows you can’t keep that aggro

Both Dwarfs and Orcs are somewhat unique while still looking ok. Humans are just humans, boring but at least look ok. Everything else has serious problems. Trolls and Night Elves look derpy as fuck, Tauren are fucking cows, Undead are just edgy corpses running around, Gnomes are tiny and has the most annoying voices.

No love for non english server maybe?
---
Conseil des Ombres?
---
I also feel like classic/vanilla has better RPG elements.  Do you want to be that hunter that stacks agi and stam and tanks in melee?  You can try!
---
Do you want to be an agile, dodgy rogue that barely gets hit thanks to ghostly strike? Go ahead sir!
---
Do you want to make balance druid that can ranged tank thanks to the armor buff?  Sure, why not?
---
Are these specs viable in endgame raiding?  Not very,  but if you want to give it a try you can!  
---
Retail suffers from this, you literally couldn't stack agility as a warrior for more crits if you tried, which take a certain amount of customisation out of your hand entirely. 
---
Not true. Thunderclap and demo shout generate threat and reduce damage. I don’t mean to be mean but what you just said is quite nooby for a warrior Main.
---
To all the people afraid of the pvp advantage, keep in mind that multiboxing in BGs has been dead for several expansions now since they disabled follow command in BGs. And in bfa they extended that to world pvp, but there are ways for a skilled multiboxer to work around that but its a tone of hassle and very limiting. So it wont have as much impact on pvp as you think. 
---
You disenchant as many items as you can while having undergeared players for all eternity you mean?
---
Nagas, not murlocs.
---
Wasn't that before 1.12?
---
Starcraft Terran theme (SC1) dominates it
---
I don't know who you are quoting. All I did was to point out that Classic is Vanilla and Blizzard have said that their goal is that Classic should feel **just like** retail 2006, aka, Vanilla.
---
No. If you really 'need' that item, you can buy it from the AH. That is why rolling need is a solid and ethical choice.
---
Most BoE's have really low drop chance and you aren't doing the dungeon specifically for that item.
---
This. The server I currently play on has its war effort right now and the only stuff that was turned in fast was from people who wanted the rep and some greater eternal essences.  Since then everyone is just waiting for the auto complete. 
---
/rasp
---
Vendors around the world sell them, so you'll be fine filling up your arrow / ammo bags.
---
&gt; People advocating for full-need on BOEs are falling victim to prisoner's dilemma and are afraid of ninjas, which is fair
---
I am not afraid of ninjas. A warrior does not have more right to receive 1000g worth of item just because if it's plate and not a staff. Him rolling need and the priest rolling greed is unfair for no reason. Everyone rolls need and if the warrior really wants to equip it, just buy it from the looter or from the AH.
---
End of discussion.
---
&gt;human trinket racial
---
Wow you really are a vanilla PvP master. I trust everything you say.
---
What location is this? O\_o
---
I'm debating heavily between tauren druid (something like 29/11/11) or troll shadow priest for launch. I am prioritizing lv 60 open world, both farming and pvp mainly. Bgs are ok but meh. My big concern is just how bad are shadow priests' Mana issues?
---
Good summary, I am also currently doing my research on Vanilla mechanics since I plain to main a warrior.
---
Note that there still is some uncertainty about the "300-305 weapon skill is more effective" theory, it just happens to be what most private servers chose to implement.
---
There are contradicting sources from actual vanilla times, some supporting the "300-305" theory, while other sources support a minor constant progression from 300 upwards.
---
I personally hope that they will have some kind of beta phase that will allow theorycrafters to find out which mechanic is used on blizzard servers, because this will the difference between "nice to have" (300+ weapon skill gives minor constant bonusses) or "mandatory" (300-305 gives major bonusses) for progression oriented warriors, Fury or Def.
---
Any time you are using item you could have sold you are essentially wasting that amount of gold regardless. For example, If I need peacebloom and for some reason the ah price is 100g, I'm still losing 100g if I gather it myself and use it instead of selling.
---
Why are you so hostile against Private Servers? They are the reason we get Classic and especially Nostalrius.
---
Indeed looks like near Blackrock Mountain, but I can't remember exactly that arena
---
Gnome kinda looks like Asmongold
---
So awesome! Waiting for more vids now, keep it going, sir.
---
P.S. music rocks!
---
Honestly it depends on the situation.
---
If the tank is pulling with 0 rage, don't shield him.
---
A warrior usually shouldn't have to do that, though. Most tanks waste their rage when they already have plenty on threat on a mob, or keep spamming abilities when the ast mob in a pull is 20% hp (he could easily just taunt if needed, it's free).
---
Using bloodrage to prevent rage loss between pulls, and stacking rage at the end, a tank should be able to do just fine with shields.
---
Sometimes it's just inevitable though, don't shield the tank when he's pulling at 0 rage.
---
Look, you're not gonna do any extra leg work to get arrows. You're gonna be going through towns just like any other class but you will be buying arrows and ammo while you're at it.
---
I thought tauren extra range was a double-edged sword where the tauren can hit from further but also be hit from further. Do you have some evidence of:
---
&gt; Against Tauren, you just take 3.8s of white DPS (and give them rage).
---
Everything I've heard says its double-edged. Not saying the deadzoning wouldn't be harder, just that there's no them hitting you without you being able to hit them.
---
Ok so that wont be a problem, thanks!
---
Except the item in question can be bought from the AH, with money.
---
Thats my dps during tbc raiding :-/
---
Damn, it was.
---
My bad then.
---
Nothing special if the footage if from private server.

Another nice private server PvP warrior POV is Monkeynews 13: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZNMInFaik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaZNMInFaik)
---
I'd love to see what you could get out of a spell power SoR ret paladin 
---
&gt;  A warrior does not have more right to receive 1000g worth of item just because if it's plate and not a staff.
---
I mean, if he actually intends on using it, he does have priority whose only intention is to sell it; that's literally what the Need/Greed system was designed for. I'll admit for twink gear this is pretty fair since you will likely get more use out of selling it than wearing it no matter the class, but for items like Edgemaster's Handguards, where a warrior will 100% equip and use it for a long time, you're just a greedy bastard if you roll need just to auction it.
---
most of the time if you can find an NPC to repair he or another near will be selling arrows too. the only exception is if it's one or two npcs alone out in the middle of nowhere. most quest hubs should have it you won't need to be going to a city for arrows
---
Undead ?
---
They look like hobos
---
indeed
---
...with Lionhearts
---
Stratholme Holy Water ftw!
---
Yeah, that's why I put Troll at the top of the bottom 3. I think Tauren is better honestly, they're the best druid race, shaman/hunter is really nice with warstomp, and the 5% health is pretty good in PvP. Dont forget the range increase aswell. Escape artist is indeed nice, but its a bit over-hyped I feel, close call though.
---
Straight up in a 1v1 the SL lock but once you run into a paladin with full shadow resist gear youre toast they'll slowly burn you down and you'll OOM trying to apply any damage. Resist... resist... try to dps with fire spells they laugh and flash it back to full
---
How about... Melee Hunter? I wonder if it will have higher numbers than MM hunter :-D
---
It is a double-edged sword. To begin with, the default dead zone is only 3 yards anyway. If it wasn't a double edged sword Tauren wouldn't have a dead zone period.
---
Fuk u
---
...and is labeled a ninja that people won't group with because server reputation actually matters in Vanilla. Assuming you aren't in the worlds most desperate PUG people are civilized even with expensive twink gear.
---
Escape artist and with noggenfogger so small that clickers in WSG will report you for hacking. Gnomes and dwarves are the best alliance races for PvP.
---
Shadow priests are great for dps. I mained s priest in MC. Biggest issue is mana. But they are wonderful in pvp. Great CC with fear and are less squishy than other cloths.
---
Lets say the good items cost 1000g.
---
They can be vendored for 1g.
---
BoP sword drops:
---
What can the warrior do with it? He can equip it, and basically get to the same state he would've been if he bought a BoE sword from the AH for 1000g. He earned 1000g worth of progression. Or he can vendor for 1g, earning 1g worth of progression.
---
What can the priest do? Vendor it for 1g.
---
Let's say another piece drops, a BoP staff. The situation is similar but reversed. Now the priest would get 1000g worth of progression if he got the item, and the warrior would get one.
---
Now in this scenario it is worthwhile for both the priest and the warrior to pass on the incompatible item so that they get the compatible one. Hence the N/G system.
---
In a BoE situation this is wrong. __Everyone gets equal amount of progression__, regardless of current gear or class. Advocating for a N/G system here is silly.
---
What 
---
This is played on some unknown backyard private server. Most likely most of the numbers involved here are completely made up best guesses and it's not even the right expansion judging by the t6 wearing tank. This is about as good as someone testing their level 60 dps during retail cataclysm.
---
On private, it's instant. I have attack / follow bound to scroll-wheel right / left flipping and keep the pet on passive. Micro-managing my pet is fun and easy. Very responsive. 
---
They added a delay in retail? WTF? Was the pet too useful? Stray pets didn't wipe enough groups in dungeons?
---
Yeah exactly, the pet is fun to micro manage and have complete control over, retail is completely different now :(
---
Racist
---
Sorry I cannot take you seriously: 65% vs 70% mitigation is actually 14.3% less damage taken, not 5%. 
---
Probably 38 people of whatever class we can get to actually show up, hopefully with only 2 or 3 of them afk /following at a time. Hyper optimize all you want, but the real struggle is to just fill a raid and have people not fuck around.
---
5 warlocks is far too many. You will be significantly gimping your raid damage, especially in stage 1 gear (MC/Ony).
---
3 warlocks is ideal. Early on your tanks and offtanks won't be strong enough so you may not be able to tank the Garr adds to the side, so you'll need 4 banishes, so 4 warlocks is acceptable early on but still not ideal.
---
Source: Played during OG Vanilla and currently class officer in Naxx progressed guild on pserver.
---
While that could make sense you have to remember classic isn’t being made as a service for us. It is to get more people to buy a subscription. It would make sense to have a page for it. It shows you get more for your money in the sub and for people that doesn’t like retail WoW it *is* essentially a game like WC3 reforged.
---
This is assuming all gear types and BiS for each class is perfectly balanced worth-wise, but they aren't. This also isn't considering that value of an item will vary per server, and one some servers, an item may not be available on the AH at all, especially on new or low pop servers.
---
Not if you play a warlock
---
How did shaman rank when looking at horde-only numbers?
---
&gt; Modern wow music feels more like music to listen to. Which is great in it's own way. But Vanilla/TBC felt more somewhere between ambiance and theme'ing.
---
I had the same thoughts. Good game music should be different than music you just sit down to listen to. It is supposed to give an ambiance to the world, and I think soundtracks are at least as important as visuals (to me at least), for building an immersive world. The old blizz music did this amazingly imho. D2 comes to mind as well, i listen to the tristram track regularly.
---
Newer tracks are a bit "too epic" to my liking. TBC music was amazing because it often gave that alien feeling which fit Outland perfectly.
---
Retail is indeed completely different now but that should be irrelevant. Retail can do whatever.
---
In Vanilla, your pet immediately responded to any follow/stay/attack commands. If it's not this way at Classic's release it should be reported as a bug.
---
There will undoubtedly be dozens if not hundreds of inconsistencies and shortcomings at Classic launch which will hopefully be patched out over time.
---
Pretty awsome, curious as to why he picked UD. Orc is generally the answer you see parroted on here, does he like the racials that much or just for aesthetics?
---
r/tendies for more 
---
Lol that guy was abusing battlegrounds with his friends 24/7 on nostalrius. Made pvp hell for everyone, ruined endgame pvp basically with those fukin premades. Also he always had 2 or 3 healers behind him.
---
A day i found him alone in Ungoro with my rogue... i remember him at 1% hp, rooted by one of those mobs near the pools while trying to reach me, epic win and revenge :))
---
It is hard to call it greatest of all time. That title would be very contested. I wouldn't be able to chose just one.
---
Some great music that comes to mind:
---
-SC 1
---
-WC 2, 3
---
-Diablo 2
---
-Morrowind
---
-Witcher 3
---
-Eve online
---
-Baldur's gate
---
And probably a lot more i forget/don't even know about...
---
Im racking my brain as to whether you could join bgs as a raid/group back then. Im assuming you will be able to, and again assuming it doesn't just immediately match you against other pre mades it could be useful for you to set up a semi-casual pvp guild, so even if no one place super frequently and has field marshal gear etc you'll get an edge from having co-ordination, voice chat and familiarity with your teams play style.
---
There are a few websites with all the original stations, I found it a few years back.
---
Used to listen to wow radio when levelling/grinding it was just nice to hear people taking with passion about the game we all originally enjoyed!
---
I would love a special edition with as much as the original crew as possible! 
---
If it’s a Twink item it’s lasting more than a few levels. Why should I let what other people roll dictate what I do with the item if I win? To me that’s dumb.  Just cause everyone else rolled need doesn’t mean I shouldn’t enjoy the game the way I want. 
---
Also if you read I said almost always. So... of course if in sfk and I win ass blade or shadow fang probably not gonna throw em on. However as far as things like edgemasters, or other boe BiS. I think it’s dumb not to equip. You’re gonna want the item if you sell it so why selll?
---
Well, it really depends on what you like to do in a game.
---
For community I would say no, it is not worth it. Sure you can get a guild, but with how sharding works you won't feel like there is an active community outside of a guild.
---
As for content, it is worth it. Only people that haven't actually played BfA and just auto-hate says the content is all bad. The new leveling zones have great stories and amazing themes (a bit subjective of course, but they are well made). The dungeons are equally really interesting, especially due to the themes again. Like one is a big haunted mansion. Raids again, really fun.
---
PvP I'd say is fine for some casual BG's, but I can see why people might not think PvP is in a great spot right now for more serious PvP.
---
Some classes are butchered, but there are some really great class designs still. The BfA rework of melee survival hunter is a personal favourite.
---
If you plan to play "hardcore" I'd say it is really frustrating. Min /maxing gear is rather annoying and the Azerite gear (new system instead of set bonuses) is generally seen as one of the more annoying systems to ever hit WoW (just like Legion legendaries, which azerite were supposed to be an improvement over). For casual play, azerite isn't a problem.
---
TL;DR: if you can enjoy the *content* of WoW without needing a living community there is enough for several months of fun. If you are fine with being mostly casually playing it works quite well. If you plan to jump into hardcore WoW gaming in either PvP or PvE you will meet frustration.
---
Yeah, literally WoW is like heroin,once you try and it's damn hard to get off the needle. Played wow half of my life, so its like my precious home where u find rest from a crappy life. Im glad that i have opportunity  be able to escape from reality cause it sucks. I think I'm not the only one with similar story so many will understand me.🙄
---
just for aesthetics, he couldn't play anything else
---
If Player A wants an item and would otherwise buy it from the AH otherwise while Player B wants an item and would only sell it on the AH maybe we could use some sort of "Need" vs "Greed" system to sort this out 🤔
---
No.
---
I’m with a group of long time friends who have played since Vanilla. Some are better than others. I know now who I’d be comfortable with as MT, so no need to put ourselves in that position haha.
---
Too bad we can't play any of those more prestigious trolls.
---
That sucks man, but if it makes you feel better it gave me a good laugh. Sounds like he did you a favor
---
&gt; Dun Balder (Dun Baldar)
---
those Danes...
---
alll Icelanders know it's Dun Baldur!
---
&gt; WoD was decent compared to the bland BfA crap.
---
I feel like this is too subjective to really use for comparing xpacs.
---
I hated WoD, not because of lack of content (I feel like retail moves *too fast*). I hated WoD because of the story. To me it was the first xpac where I truly didn't feel like it was the WoW lore I used to love.
---
BfA on the other hand, I enjoy actually focus on faction war. And I enjoy how they actually *build up* all this old god stuff. It's great story telling, it is subtle and building up, really fit for old gods.
---
The zones are also amazing. Drustvar is especially amazing to me. WoD zones were super boring to me except one zone.
---
I also prefer the raids and dungeons to WoD. Mythic+ and general PvE mechanics are awesome compared to what WoD had.
---
Very is correct. You will have a spell or two recognized as your base heal(s). For mana efficiency, and try to avoid over healing. That principal applies to all healing classes. 
---
Priest are special because of there diverse heals they bring they bring great single/group healing.  In vanilla priest are the healers! (You’ll see plenty of healing classes wearing dresses because they want to be a priest!!) 
---
&gt; The storyline is terrible.
---
While I agree that hope for the whole faction war story being build up for something amazing is slim, they seem to move onto better stories. I no longer think they can save Sylvanas as a character, but looking at the upcoming naga stuff seems well written and what they so far have shown of their (subtle) old god stuff is very promising. I feel like the old god story arc might end up being one of the best written stories of WoW so far.
---
Came here to say that. Guy got me into Papa Roach thanks to his videos haha!
---
It’s not a “meme”. It’s generally accepted that Spriest is the strongest 1v1 class in Vanilla, by miles. 
---
Not sure what healer duels have anything to do with the topic. 
---
Pretty cool, I've been debating a warrior for awhile, might just do it
---
To me this type of question is a bit silly because the odds of this type of duel happening is so low that the whole argument wouldnt make sense.
---
For the S priest To be able to compete with proper HP pool would be to go rank 14 healing then gather off set pieces from healing nax then respeccing for the duel.
---
This already applies To like 0.01% of the population playing priest.
---
For the sake of the argument this duel could be skill based and depends on the consumnables/trinket used if the spriest was troll.
---
Undead spriest would be a loss in my book no matter what.
---
Troll spriest would stand a chance with hex on the pet and a clutch shadow reflector with some bad devour rng on the warlock side. Good rng on blackouts would improve the odds as Well.
---
Take out any of these components and the duels will be one sided for warlock.
---
Dwarf kick - "madness, no THIS IS SPARTA"
---
Gnome - sneaky boi with escape artist 
---
you reading a lot into my comment friend :)
---
just saying that some people be insane &amp; will surprise us all. i'm looking forward to seeing it
---
After I dropped in early MOP, I made a promise that I won't return to WoW as long as LFR is in it. It was hard to not come back but just as my will was about to be broken, the next expansion came out with it's new skins and other BS. Those new skins... to me, it no different than killing of all my characters and replacing them with garbage... therefore I no longer wanted to go back, and over the years this feeling was only stronger.
---
Part of me wanted to play wow again but at the same time, I didn't want to see how the one thing I loved in the past have now became an abomination that I was afraid to look at. 
---
But the time to go back is soon. (although after announcement of classic I did play PS for a while to find out whatever the current me still wants to go back... and yes, I do)
---
"It's not that we escaped wow addiction, it's simply that we couldn't find the it's supply anymore."
---
not really. you don't need a special vendor for them or anything, general goods and bowyers also sell them, and especially once you get a bigger quiver it's easy to stock up and forget about it for a long while. it's like the pet happiness; seems tedious at first but eventually you fall into an easy rythym with it
---
btw for what it's worth, my hunter is 46 and the only time i can recall going ah shit theres no arrow vendor here was in stonard :D
---
Yikes imagine calling people shit but thinking humans has trinket racial when it was introduced in FUCKING WRATH.
---
its like 6 days played for everyone else. there going to be some INSANE folks that will get this done my man.
---
I want to be level 30 killing boars / fucking around while i watch these crazy people knock rag down :)
---
Shadow priest is not gonna kill a lock in bis. A warlock in full bis has more effective HP vs shadow damage than a fully geared raid tank. The only way you win this matchup as the priest is to survive their cc burst combo, then you mana burn them oom so they have to lifetap between each spell. Once they're burning globals on lifetaps you can start to wear them down with dots and wand but you need a big mana pool to do this and keep yourself alive so imo a healer priest would be better off in this matchup
---
lol, see my previous comment. people are crazy man.
---
just need 40 crazy people to all roll on one server
---
Rogues shine in 1v1 but they’re awful in group combat. Too CD dependent. 
---
Hunters aren’t actually bad in pvp early on, but after AQ they fall off hard because they scale poorly with gear. 
---
clueless idiot, go spew your bullshit somewhere else
---
Yeah, but "really good leveler" on Blackrock meant level 60 in a month. Absolutely nobody on that server hit 60 in a week or less. The people who level to 60 in 4 days /played are in a different ballpark.
---
And TBH, this whole thing is moot. 
---
Even Joana, one of the fastest 0-60 levelers, took 4 days 20 hours to hit 60. That is time played, so you can't really get to 60 in a week unless you drug yourself so much you don't need to sleep, or you cheat and share your account. And that is with a hunter, pretty much the easiest class to level. Very few people will legit hit 60 in the first week, and most of them will be hunters, warlocks, or mages. 
---
iirc weapon chain reduces the duration but doesn't make you immune? 
---
I want to heal raids and dungeons in Classic but I have never played a priest. I'm trying to decide between Druid and Priest. How is leveling on a priest? 
---
to be honest, there is probably a guild of 50 people practicing exactly how to do this.
---
Hunters will hit 60 first, start helping out the warriors.  once the warriors get high enough to tank shit, everyone will attune / grind proper reps. out of a few million people i'm CERTAIN there is some awesome / crazy people who will make this happen...    god i'm keen for classic!!
---
nice thx
---
&gt; Because males looks god awful for everything ~~but warriors~~.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_emotes ?
---
Alright I'll google it for you... https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_emotes
---
I agree the 2H animations would look cool, but if the goal is greater melee reach there would need to be additional development to the combat system. (Or you could not mess with the combat stuff &amp; just have it there to look cool)
---
TBH, I think it's mathematically impossible without cheating. Especially for classes like warrior or priest.
---
Joana leveled to 60 in 4 days 20 hours /played.  That is already more than a week if you take out 6 hours for sleep and 2 hours for bathroom/showering/eating/ordering food. Now, I could see an absolute no-lifer making it to 60 in the first week as a hunter if they went on even less sleep and had someone to help them by making food and crap, but 40 people? I just don't see it. And those numbers are for hunters. No way a warrior can level that fast.
---
Reality is, fast leveling people might hit 60 early in the second week of the game. People who work and can play 8 hours a day? It's going to be into the third week when they ding 60 at best. And then if you do ding 60 ASAP, working on minimal sleep for the last 7-11 days, you aren't really in prime shape to raid at 100%. Your gear is crap, you need some people to grind rep to even summon rag.
---
I can see there being an awesome dedicated raiding guild killing rag week 2, maybe, but i don't think it'll be the norm and I think most guilds will be killing him after a month or more. Especially if it turns out that the real data from blizzard makes some fights harder than the private server players expect. 
---
In a PUG everyone should need on valuable BOEs. It's unfair if a Rogue gets for example Krol Blade for free just because he can equip it. The others in the group get just as much out of recieving the item as the rogue does. Put it this way: A rogue getting Krol Blade from a random drop saves him 200g (just an example, cannot remember how much it actually went for and that also depends on server economy). A Priest getting Krol blade *earns* him 200g. Either way it all just comes down to what monetary value an item has.
---
I know it's a hard pill to swallow as a Rogue, losing a BoE like that to a Priest. But that's the fair way of going about it.
---
world feels SOO BIGGGG!!
---
I was going to name my boar Serrano
---
And name your character Windseeker
---
That's what I call the perfect PvP character. Gnome rogue master race.
---
How did you not run OOM spamming max rank flash heals back in the day?  Did you only cast it when you saw the tank lost hp and cancelled if he got healed prior to your heal landing?
---
That was when content was new and player skill level plus lack of knowledge of strats meant those 12-16 hours per day netted you less progress 
---
Gotta say I actually love how endgame fury looks, especially on a gnome you're just a small rainbow of death 
---
I also can't wait to play without the Americans.. The amount of racism, homophobia and sexism I've encountered while playing with Americans is obscene. And I'm a straight, white male. They just spout it out for no reason whatsoever. And I know that not all are like this, but it only takes a few to spam guild-/part-/general chat for it you ruin your experience.
---
&gt;Garr adds is just marking them and using proper CC, so maybe the initial pull is somewhat tricky but after that its a joke.
---
Also, it may be a joke when it's a farm run &amp; you wildly out-gear the place. Try Garr with something like pre-Bis (or less) and there is a lot less margin for error.
---
wut
---
What was it like playing classic when you were only 5-6 years old?
---
kek?
---
EXACTLY THIS. I don't get how people don't understand that. The real value of a BoE is it's monetary value. Which is exactly the same for every class. A Rogue can buy Krol Blade off the AH if he really wants it, or win it on a roll saving him a few hunder gold. A Priest or Mage can win it, earning them the same amount.
---
If 5 people win a free car you don't just automaticall give it to the only one with a drivers license. 
---
i 100% agree that this wont be the norm, i think that most "no life" people will hit rag on week 3 or 4. (I will be week 6ish i think)
---
I still think at least one group of crazy fukkers in the world are going to make this happen on week 1 though.
---
If equal skill level of players the lock wins, in group pvp priest because of utility
---
While I agree in a vacuum it would be interesting to see rebalanced classes and redone bosses..it's kinda the antithesis of why we are getting classic, I and many others want classic as it was in 2004-2006 and changing that can only lead to disenfranchising the very playerbase who have been begging for classic for over a decade now.
---
I'm not even going to get into why rebalancing ret to be in equal footing as core dps isn't a great idea as it's been discussed a million times here but it's not a good idea.
---
No changes isn't based off nostalgia it's based off getting an authentic experience not vanilla but different.
---
Well.....NO!
---
you dropped this: \\\
---
Tons of variables in this matchup, maybe more than nearly any other matchup, not even including engineering. With no racials the rogue has the advantage if properly specced and played perfectly. Its a risky fight much like a mage though, requires nearly perfect play, your basically a bullfighter dancing around just out of range. Once you add in racials it's really a toss up though and no 2 matches are the same, you need to play around precept, escape artist, stoneform, stun resist, and warstomp differently, dwarf is probably the hardest consistently, orc is the most rng. Same can be said of the rogue though. Once you add in engineering and fap potions the metagames get have to be insane on both sides assuming equal skill levels.
---
2 average players war is gonna win most of the time though
---
&gt;Having a boom in the group gives 4 mages +3% crit which wont show up at the booms dps but the mages. It also brings an extra innervate and battle res, which is incredibly useful.
---
Agree - raiding is an activity than can only be accomplished by a team. The goal isn't always to go in &amp; see who can pew-pew the hardest. Most of the time in vanilla, it actually doesn't matter. The whole game does not consist of Patchwerk-style bosses.
---
I remember the "drop-in", but I can't remember what it was the drop-in for. 
---
\&gt; Captain. Luc Picard. Of the Uss. Draenei 
---
This subreddit has officially peaked 
---
They walk the fastest so your point is invalid.
---
Depends on the players that join the guild. I really dont mind any class if the player behind it is a good one.
---
From my current guild it looks like this:
---
Warrior - 1 tank, 3 dps, 1 ot/dps
---
Paladin - 2 holy 2 ret/prot
---
Warlock - 3
---
Priest - 4 any, if heals are needed any are happy to jump in
---
Mage - 6
---
Rogue - 1 or 2
---
Hunter - 4
---
Druid - 4, any spec
---
Which leaves 10 spots for whatever, be it more mdps or rdps or tanks
---
True but if everyone needs I’m needing,
---
its as if you always assume the worst of people and try to prevent it by beeing an asshole yourself.
---
imagine the one guy that really wants and needs that item.  
---
he is in a group with 4 ninjas now.
---
Lots of wanding things to death. It's boring until shadowform at 45. But you have high uptime, not a lot of drinking or eating.
---
That is not why need before greed exists, at all. It exists because of asymmetrical gains upon acquiring an item based on character class. This does not exist with BoE items.
---
Isn’t the mob in execute phase? That’s a huge dps boost.
---
I think it will be quite enjoyable in the early stages, but when people start obtaining bwl, AQ and naxx gear it's gonna be less and less fun
---
getting gear from pug ZG and ony maybe could be doable
---
4 8 15 16 23 42
---
No
---
blizzard is horrible at game design now, they would ruin the content thus ruining the game in one fell swoop... NEXT
---
Aaah, nice timing. I have been considering going priest. I would love to heal come classic. 
---
Is healing at 60 fun as priest? Is discipline healing a thing in classic? 
---
&gt;This is assuming all gear types and BiS for each class is perfectly balanced worth-wise, but they aren't.
---
What is 'this' in this sentence? To what are you referring to exactly? Obviouly not every BoE worth the same. Neither do classes have the same gold/hour farm ratio. But every class gets the same amount of gold out of a dropped BoE item and that is where this balance is really needed.
---
&gt;It's exactly the situation the system was made for.
---
No, it wasn't. I was for the BoP situation. If you really need an item that was won by someone who would AH it, you can just buy from him.
---
As others have said it's really not a big deal. Arrows are cheap, sold nearly anywhere there are NPCs that sell anything, and a full quiver will last a long time.
---
I hope you are right
---
iirc the pserver record from launch to a rag kill is something like 10 days or something close to that. I fully expect that the most hardcore of players will be trying to beat that.  
---
If anything modern WoW is easier to not pay attention to because there is literally 0 threat of dying. Even without heirlooms you run around 2-3 shotting stuff for most of your leveling, then once stuff has enough health to live more than 2-3 hits they do so little damage to you that it still doesn't matter
---
I think you may have misunderstood I but. My suggestion is to change the boss mechanics in raids and to not make any changes at all to the classes.
---
Can you elaborate?
---
I'm not subbing until classic. I played legion and enjoyed it but it was just too easy to do everything. 
---
Why tf would anyone resub for classic before it comes out, much less before we even have a specific release date‽
---
Wed is without a doubt the best vanilla mage I have met in over 10y of playing.
---
It can be a noun and an action.
---
Quite possibly. If it is only raid boss abilities changing, I don't think they could screw it that bad though
---
I did the first tier of Legion and bailed. I actually did not buy BFA. First expansion I could get myself not to buy.
---
They'll release the next major retail update at roughly the same time as the WoW Classic beta, which will require an active WoW subscription. You heard it here first.
---
Am I misremembering numbers or something?  I could swear back before I quit in TBC a 3k+ parse on my hunter was pretty good in black temple and maybe I pushed close to 4k but dont think I broke it in Sunwell Brutallus.  MC geared warriors in vanilla are doing more dps than the top parse in sunwell (I know armor,etc values are all different but still).  Maybe my hunter was doing way more ... I know it wasnt scrub DPS because I still topped parse by a good amount on our pre-nerf Muru kill which put us into top 100WW.  I know short fights with aoe can swing DPS meters like crazy but still seems ... off.
---
Yeah I watched all of his videos recently. The guy is ridiculous 
---
Ah after rereading I see where I misread, sorry.
---
Couldn’t tell ya haha. Maybe they get hyped and think they should try the new game and figure its a waste to turn the sub off before classic. 
---
Even that doesn’t make enough sense to me haha.
---
I'd say rogues have more burst unless you fight a lucky sword spec warrior that can end you with literally one attack+procs.
---
Early to mid range 60, rogue should win more often than not.  AQ40/PVP purples+, warrior should take it because the warrior just needs to outlast the main burst+CDs.
---
Evasion should still be used against a warrior 24/7 since OP does have a CD and you can dodge white hits and MS/whatever.  Bleeds via rend/DW can and will get you out of stealth.  Add in shouts and a good warrior that knows you're in the vicinity will likely get you out of stealth as well after you vanish and try to re-engage.
---
Trinkets aside, warriors also have zerker rage which get you out of sap/gouge.  Don't recall about blind.  Keep an eye out for retaliation, a lot of worse rogues get screwed up on that.  If no trinkets, watch the fear -&gt; bandage, which can fuck up rogues since their CDs are far more important to the fight than the warrior's.
---
BFA is waiting for you. /s
---
I personally like healing but also like tanking(especially in 5 mans).  Feral druid lets me do both.  Obviously don't plan on MTing but would be happy being offtank when needed and otherwise spot healing or putting out DPS if needed.  Druid with 1.12 has pretty good flexibility for OT&lt;-&gt;healer with a feral/resto build.
---
“It’s for my leveling spec.” Haha
---
Just to be clear not everyone on a private server had done all the raids hundreds of times. I think you'll likely be in the top 1% of players, especially if you take into account all the people that started during BC or later. And any completely new players to WoW.
---
Leveling a hunter atm and isn’t a problem. I forgot to keep food when I got my pet and he ran away &gt;.&lt; fishing helped haha
---
Haha this guy missed it over 9000
---
&gt;What is 'this' in this sentence?
---
The idea that because both a warrior and a priest can sell a BoE plate item on the auction house, they get the same value from it. This isn't even true from a purely gold perspective because that gold might be worth more to a class with more BoE BiS items than another, for example, and as you mentioned, some classes have an easier time farming than others. For a tanking warrior whose main source of gearing has to be instanced content is it really fair to say an item is really worth the same to them as a mage or hunter that can farm significantly better?
---
&gt; But every class gets the same amount of gold out of a dropped BoE item and that is where this balance is really needed.
---
Except one player doesn't **want** the gold and actually **needs** the item. Your insistence that if they really need an item that they can just buy it is assuming that not only do they have the gold to buy the item, but also that it's available on the AH at all, and if that's the case and you insist they just buy it from the winner, they have infinite bargaining power.
---
&gt;No, it wasn't. I was for the BoP situation
---
If this was the case BoEs would just go to the player that got to loot the mob like other drops.
---
&gt;If you really need an item that was won by someone who would AH it, you can just buy from him.
---
See above- this is the most ass-backwards logic I've ever seen, that the person who actually needs an item should just buy it from the person who should have rolled greed.
---
The entire point of classic WoW is to "turn back time and play the game like it was 14 years ago", it was never advertised as "turn back time to a modified version of classic WoW". Even though I would enjoy a more challenging classic WoW (because I love progressing through tough raids), it completely contradicts the entire point of classic WoW and what Blizzard wants it to be.
---
Not to mention that Blizzard has already explained why they won't touch or not even modify any health pools of bosses in dungeons/raids. I think we should just enjoy and rejoice over the fact that we will get to play on an OFFICIAL classic WoW server soon, which many of us has been wishing for since Wotlk.
---
He's saying that because you are already at crit cap fully world buffed certain crit pieces can be replaced with hit as you don't gain from going over crit cap, so hit would net more dps.
---
It's easy for you to think of it that way, until it happens to you.  literally every single on of these posts is assuming that something drops that YOU personally don't need that isn't BiS for some reason.  Every gear upgrade you get during leveling and even in-game is VERY SMALL.  Combined they make your stats grow to a respectable level, but individually a gear will never be "influential" and that's the problem with this thinking:
---
Just because you think something is "only a small upgrade" doesn't mean it actually is.  Each piece of gear is a small upgrade, doesn't mean they don't matter.
---
Naw, ne druids best cuz pallys unfortunately
---
Huge spike comes on classic launch day -&gt; investors and activision are like WOOT 
---
&gt;&gt; implement dem ingame stores bois A.S.A.P
---
You can dot multiple targets but if your tank misses a cleave or swipe, it’s not gonna be fun. Multi dotting doesn’t save enough time for this to be important in my humble opinion. I personally go for whatever makes the dungeon the easiest and not the fastest.
---
Wat
---
It has happened to me plenty of times, and although it has been disappointing, I have been completely fine with the logic behind it.
---
You are right that each piece of gear is a an upgrade, but that doesn't change the logic and fairness behind it at all. If I use my example from before again. A priest wins Krol Blade, sells it on AH and buys 5 items that are all upgrades on what he had. He has just gotten just as much value out of that item as the Rogue would have.
---
It was awhile ago, my mistake.
---
In vanilla wow the steel weapon chain makes you immune to disarms.
---
Haha I hope you’re wrong! I do hope it influences current WoW or other MMO creators
---
Depends on context.  Yeah if he is in a raiding guild then he would probably end up replacing it relatively soon.  If he's just a casual and does dungeons and stuff, that Krol Blade could be the last weapon he ever needs.
---
I wouldn't call some of the BoE epics a common drop, so to just say he can buy it on the AH is a bit of stretch.
---
Ahh, the old 3/8 life crisis
---
Even for rogues they just... The way they swing when dual wielding just looks weird. 2h animations are good imo but everything else is just bad and weird. Casting animations are also awkward and plain boring.
---
Factually incorrect.  Many dungeons will drop specific BoE's.  SFK is a good example of a dungeon that has specific BoE's that drop from it.  And that's not the only place.  Certain Dungeon's allow for a specific range of BoE's to drop, you can narrow your farming down by farming those dungeons if you're hunting for a specific BoE.
---
Also, all the Darkmoon Ace cards are all BoE but drop from either specific mobs, or bosses in dungeons (Beast for example).  I can guarantee you that the day you have the other 7 cards, and only need the Ace of Beasts, but your group all rolls need on it, even though the trinket would be an upgrade for you: you'll change your tune.
---
"It's not a problem, until it is".
---
But surely, if you were a player for example who hasn't tried raiding yet, it wouldn't matter if they changed the abilities?
---
If the server is fresh and you have some friends to give you trash greens, enchanting will give you some good wands while leveling.
---
Yeah. I really dont think classic will actually be that popular to actually make a big difference in acti-blizz business decisions, but yeah, it could inspire other game developers
---
Well, I also think that the classic devs may be doing that on purpose, to keep it as a low profile project so the bussiness people don't interfere as much.
---
Yep, I too have been waiting since TBC/WOTLK. But how many times have you run those raids. You know every single thing that's going to happen and when? If so wouldn't a challenge be welcome? If you're new and haven't tried them, does it matter if it's changed?
---
Prepare for BLOODSHED!!!!
---
What I really want is a massively open and interactive world with the slow grind and feeling of accomplishment that comes with rewards. Vanilla accomplished this. I'd be fine with changes if they maintained this at its core, but this is the most important part to me. I want my epic mount to feel fast again; blue gear to excite me; and to have a main and an alt I understand inside and out due to the time commitment and not 5-6 max level characters due to boredom. I logged into retail yesterday to learn I had a 110 Monk. I literally forgot I leveled an entire character (and it wasn't level boosted).
---
But everyone in the group can't be required to consider exactly how long a player they don't know may use the drop for. Therefore, the fairest and easiest way to do it, is to arrange beforehand that for valuable BoEs, everyone has the right to need. A mage could see Krol Blade and purchase a Bloodvine item or two, which he'll likely use until AQ40/Naxx.
---
Yeah 3%, nice troll interweb hero.
---
I am in the same boat. It's the core fundamentals that need to remain the same
---
&gt; it’s basically paying more money for an in game advantage
---
If retail is any indication, Blizz will be okay with this then.
---
wouldn't they be able to see the activity of their classic server?
---
An inverse way they could look at it that might make it easier is that it's actually very similar to repairing gear. Running out of arrows is the equivalent of your weapon breaking and you go back to town to repair it.
---
The only difference is the psychology of that seemingly finite resource slowly ticking down (and being down one bag, but us warlocks find it hard to sympathise with that concern : P)
---
God damn, I was SUCH a huge listener back in the day. I'll still throw on some Blue Plz or Casually Hardcore from their respective archives online. Serious nostalgia brewing just thinking about it. Casually Hardcore is actually still going, IIRC! 
---
My classic leveling experience consisted of "The grind" (which vanilla players already know) while having my pandora set to shuffle in the background and the game sounds turned down. Usually involved a few hits from the bong once in a while, too. It was great fun!
---
I would like to add to this, don't go to the movie theater for Endgame until it releases.
---
What do u mean make questing more enjoyable? Questing in vanilla is a joy
---
For those who are open to changes, such changes are not at all the antithesis of why we are getting classic, because people who are open to changes have a far more nuanced view of why vanilla is superior to the more recent WoW versions. For the pro-changers, it's not about damage coefficients, particular talent trees, a given class balance, because all of those things changed drastically over time. Honestly, as somebody who played from beta through 1.12, the thought of eternal 1.12 where warriors are the overpowered flavor of the month is very distasteful and not at all true to the actually vanilla experience.
---
The experience is about the fact that the game is a connected world where you have to physically run places, or if you get a teleport it's only because two classes are allowed to break the rules in very specific and limited ways. The game is about needing to work with other people. The game is about that feeling of gradual growth that binds you to your character. The game is about all kinds of weird items and crafted things and mechanics that let people explore combinations and personalize their experience.
---
Particular boss mechanics have nothing to do with any of this. Vanilla wasn't great because of MC boss mechanics, MC was a rush job done under pressure. The difference between MC/BWL and the ZG and beyond raids is night and day, Blizzard got way better at raid design through vanilla and it showed. They could totally redo the raids and the game would still feel like vanilla, because mechanics didn't define vanilla.
---
As for class changes, it's 100% possible to make the shit specs viable, and TBC showed the way. Heck even vanilla showed the way with their various class overhauls. You don't balance them with dps, you balance them with spec specific utility. Add a deep ret talent that lets your attacks refresh all judgements on the mob. Add a +10% holy damage increase to CoS. Neither of these things would really effect balance outside of raids, but they could nudge ret from utter garbage to worthwhile to bring along. The whole "If hybrids do the same dps then pure classes will be trash" argument is a straw man, particularly in light of how many people defend the utter bullshit that is 1.12 warriors who are already hybrids that excel in two roles.
---
Blinded by private servers?
---
Crit from intelligence increases DoT damage while you are in shadowform, it does not crit but provide bonus damage.
---
Its not as effective as +damage tho.
---
But saying that it does not boost damage is wrong.
---
But that is what I mean. current WoW, you are always in combat, there is zero chance of dying and you have a mount at lvl 1. You are conscious of your travel, you aren't scared of being off the path, always in combat, retail always commands your attention because there is no downtime. Classic, you are auto running 5 mins at a time, slightly changing your direction ever so often to stay on the path, your waiting for smart pulls of mobs, you're on 5+ min flight paths, your eating/drinking... their can be big pauses in dungeon runs. there are lots of moments to just sit back and watch your second screen. 
---
I've seen people 'preparing' by farming gold, with the assumption that WoW tokens will be implemented with Classic. I guess it'd work even if they weren't directly implemented into Classic because they will share a subscription, so by using the WoW tokens up, they get Classic time.
---
I'm not doing it personally, BFA gives me a brain hemorrhage.
---
Nice joke. 
---
Questing in Vanilla is the same shit. Kills X this, Collect Y this, Go to Z mark and so on and on. 
---
The only purpose of questing for me is to learn the class better.
---
Blizzard is amazing at raid design now, I for one would love to see what the BfA raid team could do. One of the reasons that vanilla specs change from awesome to cookie cutter in the transition to the raid game is because vanilla raids are solely about single target sustain dps. Burst, aoe, cleave type fights help create places where a wide variety of specs and classes can function.
---
As much as people, myself included, gripe about hybrid raid viability, imo the key to hybrid raid viability is not hybrid mechanics and abilities, but encounter design itself. If you mix up encounter design, you give more specs and classes opportunities to provide utility.
---
steel weapon chain
---
"use: attach a chain to your weapon, reducing the duration of disarm effects by 50%. Does not stack with other similar effects."
---
once again....i dont think so
---
Oh you're talking about Private Servers.  Sorry we're talking about original vanilla WoW...you know the real one.
---
Here's a sample from end of 2011...could probably be considered the average of the lifespan.  So where's your numbers to back your talk up?  Yeah didn't think so.  Even if you add up all of the non-asian and non-US countries it's still less than the US.  So wtf are you talking about exactly?
---
...and the only reason EU may be more on private servers is because private servers are illegal and can only be hosted outside of the US lol.  So thanks for breaking the law and using the loophole so that we can all play old style WoW for free.
---
 
---
List of countries with the highest population in WoW players. (**Rough Estimateas** of 4th quarter 2011 according to **Warcraft Realms** and total number of players released by Blizzard)
---
1. China, Asian Realms: 3.2 million players
---
2. United States and Canada, North American Realms: 3.0 million players
---
3. United Kingdom, European Realms: 1.0 million players
---
4. South Korea, Asian Realms: 800,000 players

5. Germany, European Realms: 600,000 players

11. Spain, European Realms: 80,000 players
---
12. Other, NA/EU/Asian Realms: 800,000 players
---
Because your quiver takes up a bag slot, you’ll be heading back to town to sell stuff wayy more often than you run out of arrows.
---
Resubbing at the launch of cassic is a double edge sword. As you know in classic what you pull only you can loot unless you are in party before engaging the target . Now at launch there will be a lot of players questing, server lag, dcs and what not. Or you wait a month and then the server load is better but there will always be a rogue to stab you in the back out of nowhere 
---
Oh yeah! I am not saying it is not enjoyable on it's own, here are just things that I find make it so much more enjoyable. Retail is just... the leveling isn't fun and there are no pauses in that lack of fun... every new expansion has just been... okay, let's steamroll to the new cap in 2 days. I should mention I have not leveled a new character since Cata, only doing the new expansion leveling.
---
Well i don't really have number in mind, but it's a budget for sure. 
---
&gt; never was the case in reality though.
---
You can't tell people that their own experience wasn't reality. Maybe it just hasn't occurred to you that not everyone had the same shitty experience you did.
---
Pretend for a second BoP doesn't exist in WoW. There's just Roll/pass.  You have it visually in your head? A world free of "ninja looters" because everyone just rolls need (I mean honestly who passes, amiright?)
---
Congratulations,  enjoy never getting gear unless you're soloing because everyone rolls on everything and maybe one day you just get very unlucky.  Enjoy that dagger upgrade going to mage that's normally BoP just being "a pile of gold" because your asinine fear of ninja-looters has caused you to act like a greedy asshole.
---
I know you'll downvote me, but guess what: the truth hurts.  Anyone who's IMMEDIATE first reaction to a BoE dropping without any consideration that someone could actually possibly use it in the group it dropped for is a greedy asshole.  
---
Every. Single. Piece. Of. Your. Gear. is a small upgrade.  Together they provide you the stats to be able to do better, individually they look like crap.  That's the point of gear.  ALL TOGETHER it makes you a stronger character player.  Trying to justify the "roll need for all boes" arguement with the fact that "its only going to be used for a few levels" or "it's just a pile of gold in reality" is such a bullshit greedy logical fallacy it makes my head spin.  
---
It's this kind of cognitive dissonance people use to justify their actions that ACTUALLY makes me afraid for society.
---
Apparently yes, [don't forget anonymonity+video game= TIME TO ACT LIKE A JACKASS!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/news_feeds/icons/mobile/000/030/895/129.jpg)
---
There is only one real chance you could run out of arrows, and that is if you are grinding/questing right before you are doing a dungeon. It happened to me twice when running Deadmines, but apart from that I never had that problem on multiple hunters.
---
I did not know this gave you a link to casually hardcore? Would love to listen! 
---
You don't really need NR for Visc, you just blow him up after 1 or 2 shatter with a ton of aoe with sapper charges.
---
Oh they'll get a spike, a big fat spikey spike.
---
One hand:  "The WoW community is the best ever, and create a level of comradarie and uniformity never seen by the likes of greek champions!"
---
Other hand: "Everyone is a ninja and an asshole: so in order to protect myself from assholes I must become that what I hate most...an asshole who ninjas shit to prevent other assholes from ninja-ing shit!"
---
You have a very nice pre-bis item in tailoring.
---
Enginering must have for pvp(and late pve).
---
Other than that you can do w/e.
---
It would be welcomed in a sense, but not for classic WoW because that's not what it's suppose to be about.
---
We're suppose to relive classic WoW as it was back in the days, not relive a modified version of classic WoW.
---
Blizzard have better metrics than simply seeing how many people are subscribed at a given time.
---
They'll know if people are enjoying Classic regardless of when people resub. 
---
I agree completely with your statement about the abilities not defining the Classic experience. In fact it was kinda the whole premise of my idea. 
---
I also agree with your analogy of the warrior issue. Unfortunately you will not get this as warrior is a large % of the player base 
---
I had a few "oh crap" moments where I ran out but those are few and far between, even for forgetful players like myself
---
I always rush to 60, and I plan on doing it again. I'm a very competitive person, but against myself. I love seeing how efficient I can be, and if I can beat my /played to 60 again :). It's the way I like to play. I love waking up early in the morning, grabbing coffee and logging in and doing quests! Twitch, discord, dope music, can't wait to be able to go ham again!
---
You get special bags (quiver / ammo pouch) that are bigger than normal but can only be used for arrows/bullets, and they also increase your attack speed.  Ammo stacks to 200, so you carry hours worth of ammo on you at any given time.  There are vendors in every major town and some smaller outposts.  The best ammunition in the game require you to get AV rep which isn't hard, but takes some time.
---
I fail to see how retail is different. There are specs that are brainless easy while other specs are extremely hard to truly max out every last dps from. Much harder than in vanilla - I’d argue that your comment is more relevant in regards to retail.
---
I don't get these summon trolling, why would a random player join your group and then even accept a summon? 
---
Ninja looter....
---
You are not wrong, you don't get numbers like this under normal conditions in vanilla. 
---
But sometimes (and no, not with MC gear but better) you are capable to push these crazy numbers on certain short multi-target boss encounters.
---
The only moment you shield a tank is : you think he's going to die if you don't.
---
I have several times and its just as easy then lol
---
Just because you have a different opinion doesn't mean you have a more "nuanced" perspective. 
---
Honestly some changes could be inherently benefitial to the game (guild banks are one thing I would be okay with) but even then I don't think they should be added, I wouldn't be upset if they were but I'm not for them either.
---
Not saying boss mechanics in vanilla are perfect either, some bosses are total snorefests, but they shouldn't be changed as that defeats the purpose of classic. Which is to be a recreation of the game, and getting 1.12 is simply a convenient option for blizzard as we would end up there anyway.
---
Could classes be changed and balanced? Absolutely. TBC is my favorite period in wow and I think it gets almost everything right, but this is classic...not TBC.
---
I understand what you mean, the things that make classic great aren't mages with rolling ignites or warriors oneshotting people with MS.
---
It's the world, the community, the wacky weird things that add charm and make you personally connected to everything, this is all true...but adding new mechanics, new talents, rebalancing and other changes that were not part of vanilla intrinsically changes how the game works, feels and plays.
---
Let's give a personal example, I love elemental shamans, I played one on nost, I like the insane oneshot burst they have, if blizzard were to rebalance how would they fix ele? Their main issues are resistances and mana management and threat. sure you could add nature resistance to curse of elements and give them a mana regen talent but surely you would have to lower their burst to counterbalance so they don't become OP, suddenly the thing I enjoyed most about ele has been taken away. 
---
I never gnometiced either
---
Ok but the other guy is saying that so much of his damage is yellow hits by this point of the game that crit cap isn’t as relevant in this circumstance
---
Honestly, I agree that a few very minor tweets would indeed shake things up enough to potentially bread a new meta which would be cool. 
---
However, during the 2018 Classic panel they’ve already said the data is Sacrosanct, aka what ever data is in their 1.12 log is it. They said they feel they have no right to alter the game because it’s not theirs it is the 15 years ago teams. 
---
Then why bother doing it at all. There are a plethora of private servers to choose from?
---
I think what most people forget is that all servers have a lifespan. This lifespan is not very apparent when you play on private servers because generally private servers are fairly short lived. They open, everyone flocks to them then after 1-3 years they either close down or open a new realm for everyone to migrate to and start the race all over again.
---
That's all fine and dandy but when happens when you wanna roll a new character but everyone is already running around in T2 and T3 gear? Blizzard aren't going to wipe and make everyone start fresh. 
---
Take it further, what happens in 3-6 years when people can pug Naxx because guilds can afford to take pugs along because everyone in their guild is already T3? Now those pug people also have T3. Pretty soon you don't even need a partial guild run because everyone will just be farming it. 
---
Fast forward another year or 2 and people will be going back and asking Blizzard to make a couple new raids to keep them going after Naxx. I imagine Blizzard will tell us to poke it up our arses. We made our bed now lay in it.
---
I am concerned about the longevity of Classic.
---
A problem no, something you keep your eyes to not run out yes, much like the food for your pet.
---
All those things are what make Classic feel like a world, and that youre "just a person" in it. Which is part of what makes a good MMO. I get what youre saying. But if those are all cons, then maybe WoW isnt the game for you. And that's ok. 
---
woot?
---
&gt; I know a lot of people who have already resub’d for Classic. 
---
Really?  how many "people" do you know?  give us a count.  I'm just curious.
---
yes lol
---
My (geared) shamans searing totem hits for 122 damage. So 61 dps assuming no crits or resists. Not bad!
---
I think you may have misunderstood slightly. In answer to your question. Your shaman would not change a single bit. Nor would any other class. The ONLY change. Would be new abilities for the raid bosses.  NO CLASS CHANGES OF ANY DESCRIPTION
---
Same, and I'm only subbing before it's released so that I can get all of my addons and settings in order on a character so that I can copy to Classic character...just in case any current addons work with Classic.
---
Troll master race. Even though I won't be able to play because I'm rolling drood 
---
Yes and yes. As Horde (lacking pally) you're the best single-target healer and have a lot of specific utility in boss fights, so there's always a need for your class (fun not to feel superfluous). Discipline healing up to Power Infusion (31 points) is very legit and very appreciated by your raid's mages. You swap some +heal for a larger mana pool which somewhat balances things out, but healing as Discipline instead of Deep Holy is still maybe a little safer once you are somewhat geared (into MC/BWL territory) and your gear has the +heal to make up for what you lose from talents.
---
On Alliance side you face single-target healing competiton from paladins, but Dwarves' Fear Ward is legit one of the best racials in the game and will always be in demand in any raid group. Your fort and stam buffs will also always be desired. 
---
I know that's a little more utility than it is "fun," but I find having a distinct niche and executing it to the betterment of the raid to be pretty fun.
---
You do get some actual "fun" perks here and there, like Mind Control (useful and sometimes necessary in some dungeons/raids -- Scholomance comes to mind -- and a BLAST in PVP) Levitate.
---
**tl;dr**: Anecdotally I have a *blast* healing as 60 priest. You'll pretty much never not be in demand to heal and you'll always feel useful. Discipline healing is a thing and a VERY powerful raid asset a little later in your 60 progression.
---
I must admit that while I definitely do remember the leveling experience of vanilla being more of a challenge than retail, I am actually really looking forward to that challenge. Some of my best video game memories were leveling in retail, with buddies on skype (now discord) and just grinding it out. Although I had significantly more time when I was in school to play, I'm hoping that the experience in Classic will emulate that feeling of grinding the levels out again.
---
Go gnome anything. 
---
insert &lt;fuuuuuuuck.gif&gt;
---
As someone with social anxiety, this is spot on. There's a need to communicate with others in Vanilla. 
---
He's literally talking about class rebalancing in the last paragraph.
---
I can't give count ofc but i actually saw some posts here on reddit and also some on WoW forums from people who resubbed "to play wow while waiting for classic". I don't know what were thinking about but such people actually exist.
---
Retail is basically "hurr durr main stat"
---
Yeah I didnt buy BFA or MoP only 2 I dont have the box for. 
---
Agreed. It's not super speedy, but I do think speed runners have it in the top 50% speed-wise.
---
Get spirit tap, improved wands, and try to kill one thing at a time and you'll be good.
---
No one except tank use FR in MC. You get a fire pot for ragnaros, maybe an arcane one for shazzrah, and that's it.
---
If your only concern is PvP undeads probably your best bet cuz of WotF
---
Alright, let’s get down to the real question here. Troll or Undead for Horde Priest...what is best for PvP focus/PvE focus/your Personal Preference
---
I think after all research I’ve done, Troll seems to be better for PvP and PvE, with my personal preference going to Undead. Also it seems Undead’s base stats may be better but that is probably neglegible in the long run.
---
When in doubt, pick gnome.
---
Would you play a druid or a priest? I cant commit to a raid schedule due to a rotating schedule so I would mostly be a pick up healer and dungeons. 
---
Actually no, most times it will not last more than a couple levels, because items that drop for you are always lower than your current level.
---
For example Shadowfang is a level 19 item, but you rarely do SFK before level 24/25. By that time you already are eligible for BFD runs in which you get Outlaw Sabre [https://classicdb.ch/?item=16886](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16886). 
---
Needing and equipping Shadowfang in a regular SFK run throws out a potential 100g+ out the window with no advantage to the equipper. I for one most certainly would roll need with everybody else in chance of getting my mount gold by level 24.
---
Started in TBC. Rolled on pserver last month. Got gifted shoulders at 21. Feels amazing man
---
During a fledgling economy, (i.e. first 3 months minimum) of a server.  No-one is going to have the spare gold to buy BoE blues/epics.  It's a catch 22 system there where everyone needs/wants gold to buy their mounts and thinks "i'll sell this boe and be riiiich!".  In reality, noone has the spare gold, and I'd argue that with Classic people won't be buying things as frivolously as they did during retail launch because they are more informed.
---
In fact I'd argue that attempting to sell anything boe for overpriced markups is going to result in a lot of sad sellers during the first few months.
---
MT and OT need 255 fire resist and doesn't hurt to have another OT have same. Rest need 0.
---
For nature again ideally 255, but gear is harder to come by and around 150 is nice.
---
You want 2 warlocks with SR as close to 255, but doable with lower as well. Not gimping stamina and some spell damage/crit in the process.
---
Frost resist for Saph and KT is about 150, only crafted and dropped  epics basically for all raiders.
---
There should not be any class rebalancing of any description
---
Gnomes Rule!!
---
Spriest mana issues are real, and they also can generate and annoying high amount of threat for less-geared/low TPS tanks. Their shadow-weaving also occupies a debuff slot, which is less of an issue if Blizzard is implementing 16 debuff slots from the start as they purport they will
---
Hot take, but farming might actually be easier Holy specced. The AOE Holy Nova is only available after ~15 talent points in Holy, and it's the only ability that makes farming things like DME lasher packs viable. You will, however, get merked as Holy in solo PVP whereas you will do the merking as Shadow.
---
If you like to punish yourself then yes. 
---
this is a big misconception, Orcs stun resist is the best pvp racial in the game.
---
Wrath also closed up a HUGE existing story for Warcraft. So while it's set in another continent, it still feels like part of the existing world.
---
I feel this is condemning the longevity of the game 
---
I'm glad we agree
---
Wow. Thanks for this, that's an awesome resource. I noticed that the tab for fire resist gear shows no entries when I look at it, is that a bug?
---
Savage.
---
And if its big stuff, people will tell you that you were dumb for not also rolling on it. Who got 1.000 to 30.0000g depending on the item lying around so he does not roll need?   
---
They will just blame the noob who did not roll need on such a valuable item.
---
&gt; dungeons are long
---
First WC back on a pserver was easily over an hour. I think you can clear on retail in 20 minutes.
---
Yes, as he said - the math has been done. The extra crit does not make up for it. Neither does innervate on a mage.
---
The only thing they bring is utility like battle res and innervate on a healer
---
The thing is, those only bring value if someone dies and resto druids already used their battle res or a healer goes OOM and you literally can’t survive without that one healer getting mana.
---
For the majority of raids it really isn’t needed to bring more battle res or innervate for healers - only in Naxx, but there min/maxing becomes more important so you can’t afford to change the dps for the utility of a boomy, you can get that utility from a Resto.
---
If your Shaman remaining exactly as is. Would you be against changing the boss abilities to spice things up a bit?
---
If you're gonna be a PUG healer go priest all the way. Until their full T2 druids will always be at the bottom of the total healing done lists. In 5-mans you take the priest heals every time pretty much. Resto druids are in demand in a larger raid setting for the other functionalities they bring to the table and for their support with other healers involved. But priest is definitely the stronger choice for 5-mans imo.
---
And we can round the value of Pi down to 3. It's just so much more simple that way.
---
just go reckoning with a two hander and win the game
---
My bad I didn't realize you did a full character assessment every time you join a pug or recruit people to your group. 
---
If you pick warlock as your class... then you need to be Horde. Being an alliance lock and having to deal with all the Undeads and their will of the forsaken is hell in pvp. The 2 minute fear/charm trinket is just so strong. Being a horde warlock, you are free to fear and seduce all you want :)
---
You can buy extra arrows and put em in your regular bags if you plan to have a long raid night etc. 
---
Do it with friends! I think I'd go bald if I had to level completely alone to 60. The only way I can get through it is by having friends to do it with me. Running dungeons, doing elite quests, ganking, invading zones etc. 
---
On Classic I'll probably go quite fast to 60 and start grinding out my ranks, but BGs might not be in the game at release so we'll see how it works. 
---
None of that is true except for specific boxes being on certain loot tables ,I'll respond at length when back at a PC lol ace of beats is only card worth 600+g
---
I have multiple opinions, on one hand I think it would make the raids more interesting and dynamic.
---
On the other I don't like the idea of changing things in a project that's meant to be a faithful recreation, as I see blizzard only losing in a scenario where they do changes as they alienate the hardcore no change crowd.
---
You don’t know what you are talking about - you just follow the general “balance sucks” without any knowledge.
---
Balance is know to suck in PvE only - for PvP they are great, especially 1v1.
---
I just cant get invested in private servers.

I was on a private server a long time ago for a while, got druid to 60, got good gear, got my epic mount, decent gold and bam blizzard had it taken offline. Tried again on another server, got my shaman to about 47, got my 60% mount etc. So one day server had an "issue" where it deleted a bunch of random characters and they could not  restore them and would not try.
---
Now I just dont trust them
---
I think that the launch classes will be considerably different then the first run of level 60s in a server. People think they love rogue and warrior but face tanking for weeks takes a bit of a different style. 
---
This perfectly sums up my reaction when I saw they were doing Wow classic. I thought it was all behind me, but nope. I instantly felt the urge to play this game for hours on end again. I can't wait for it to finally release! 
---
Nah man you just gotta work that shit into your routine. Baby crying? Need to rock him to sleep? Let the drums of war soothe him into deep slumber. Put that baby on your shoulder while you play. Use the random name generator to help you and your wife/husband figure out what to name the baby. Talk to the baby about what you're doing. Talent specs, what quest you're on, who you're playing with, the lore, guilds, levels, etc. babies love to be spoken to.
---
This baby can come between you and WoW........ or WoW can bring you and your baby closer than ever.
---
The choice is yours.
---
I like the 1H + Shield playstyle
---
with good gear and decent damage when getting hit you could kill like 6-7 mobs at once which seems pretty good
---
/train was the best. So obnoxious. 
---
Ok. I'll wait for refuting that Ace of Beasts doesn't only drop from "The Beast" in UBRS and that SFK doesn't have specific BoE's that only drop from there.  
---
You can downvote all you want there buddy.  I know I'm right on this, but I'll wait for you to google search it up and be willing to accept your apology later (but I know you won't apologize, cause you know....gotta keep your internet cred up ya know?)
---
I used to stream the episodes while leveling on various private servers years ago. Got so popular that I was banned. 
---
Check my response to Score Hidden down below about the longevity issue. That's my concern. 
---
Everyone will have different opinions. But that's mine
---
All these dungeons however drop loot that you will have outleveld by the time you get there. Pendulum of Doom? Replaced by Rockbiter, Ragehammer, Stoneslayer, &lt;insert 15g BoE here&gt;. 
---
SFK Shadowfang is already replaced by Outlaw Sabre.
---
So you cant really claim an item for you to wear in 99% of the cases in leveling dungeons.
---
Projecting this hard lol
---
Raids are at the highest quality they've ever been, it's the total lack of social interaction and the forced grinds hat have caused people to abandon the game.
---
Greetings, Almightyfarseer here\~
---
I agree. Also have a memory from my own past logs: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWLclA6MrCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWLclA6MrCU)
---
AMAZING! 
---
You are making a joke. But I was a little concerned when I tested the game after 9 years, how addictive it is. 
---
“Welp, looks like were both melee for this dungeon Scruffy”
---
&gt; am I the only one
---
Browse through a few pages of thread topics. You are most definitely not the only one to bring this up.
---
Amen sir. I used to listen to so much friggin' music while playing for hours and hours on end. As a musician now, I feel like in ways I've regressed since those days since there's no way I spend half as much time just soaking up tunes without WoW. 
---
Alright so who wants to repost this for us tomorrow? Looking for volunteers 
---
love mage, so this seems a good idea
---
If you like it, go for it. Dont let another decide how you have to play. 
---
Don't even need to look for volunteers. Just you wait!
---
Talking about pre-made only situations is hardly a good argument for choosing a race. A Human paladin once made me win an 1v3, so NE is best race. No best race is Tauren because a Shaman literally won us the AB I just played in. You go down this road you will need endless amounts of statistics, random data, etc etc, basing how good a race is on how good your faction class is and how skilled that player is versus how skilled the opposing faction class is and how many there is of them and how good they are compared to eachother etcetcetcetcetc
---
Go read my post lol I have farmed it many times. My original post was speaking broadly about how you cannot have the expectation of treating it like normal loot due to the drop rates. I've studied the drop table and drop rates extensively I promise. The only one showing ignorance is you with your claims that a pig group is going to allow you to have the 600g ace for free just bc you have the 10g worth of other cards LOL when is the last time you played? 
---
As someone who did sword and board back before I knew what I was doing.. sure you can do it (paladin or warrior). In fact, as a paladin it will be extra ridiculous in that you can survive most non-elite encounters around your level. Random wandering adds? No biggie. Some troll kite a few extra into your path? No worries, buddy, I'll get those scarey men off your back. 
---
Just be prepared to take a while. It will not be fast. 
---
True, I'm comparing this to levelling on a live server. I still don't think I'll use BoE rare/epics, they won't help purchase my mount but I will save them for a time when the server has a healthier economy.
---
You asked what is better. I have found that 2H reckoning is best
---
It's rarely a problem, unless you entirely forget about it.
---
Source: Me, who went into BRD with 154 arrows left.
---
Jesus guys, sorry I don't spend 10 hours a day on this sub. I'll try to do better. 
---
Cool. So someone posted this today. 
---
Does that mean we won’t have to read it again until tomorrow when someone else posts it?
---
We would just /who low level players and invite them. It was amazing how many people actually accepted the summon. 
---
Did a similar thing on my pally, when the recruit a friend rocket first came out u could dismount with a passenger in the seat and they would fall to their death and i would just bubble. Now its fixed and they parachute.
---
I also used to duel low level players on the zeppelin on my priest and mind control them off of it right before it left lol. I was a huge troll.
---
Lastly, i would trade BOP items to new players and just put it in the do not trade tab, they would trade me 10g or so and never receive the item. I had one guy try this 3 times in a row and i just kept telling him i never got his gold lol
---
i agree with the title of post, im doing the same thing
---
Absolutely. Somebody can lowkey roll need every so often to get one. 
---
Items such as Elegant Robes [http://classicdb.ch/?item=10215#disenchanting](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10215#disenchanting) is a level 57 which can give up to three Greater Eternal Essences. Depending on the server progression, each of these level 57 greens of the falcon/whale etc. is a potential extra 45gold lining your pockets.
---
That's pretty solid, then!
---
I agree with your thinking, but I can think of one reason, however I obviously can’t say it applies to all of the people OP is referring to in this post.
---
If you were good at farming or running the AH you could potentially play modern WoW and farm up WoW tokens so that you can earn some free play time for classic. I don’t fully support this logic, but you technically could still be ‘playing WoW’ while you wait for classic launch and then when you switch to classic at release you will have a few free months...
---
&gt; am I the only one 
---
 Yes you are the only one. It's definitely a brand new idea that hasn't been discussed at length many times over.
---
I'm really looking forward to the day when I can turn up the volume on Lord of the Rings soundtrack (something I played a lot back in the mid-2000's while playing WoW), run around the mines of Elwynn Forest (YOU NO TAKE CANDLE), hit a few copper veins to make my own gear with, and maybe fish a little in the rivers and lakes. 
---
I'll get antsy at some point and begin to worry more about efficiency, but that'll prolly come somewhere in the mid-20's. It'll probably be a slow, relaxing journey early on (and I am anticipating a practice in patience while dealing with the initial crowds).
---
People opt in to world PVP manually now. It’s not a per server thing. 
---
To be honest you don’t see a lot of ganking in lower level zones. 
---
People still do quest to level, but you generally don’t see a ton of folks all leveling at the same time in the same zones. Unless it’s right after a new allied race drops or something.  
---
For warlocks this is an advantage because usually our BiS looks like shit since T1 and T2 is useless. 
---
T3 looks pretty stupid on most races though. Not looking forwards to wearing it one bit.
---
I agree with this, undead is overrated. Troll spamming hex of weakness in BGs is really strong, it also allows you do destroy paladins much easier 1v1. Shadowguard can also proc Blackout which is really strong against rogues. 
---
Same,
---
Whenever I get close to 60 on private servers or the world pvp slows down, I just stop playing.
---
No point in investing in 60 gear or raids because there is alway a *F R E S H* server popping up which kills the current one.
---
I really want classic.
---
You'll be able to get Rank10 blue gear set, AV exalted weapons, and sometimes join a pug raid for some trash farming that may give you something.
---
You'll be able to fight back, yes
---
Holy shit you're a greedy asshole.  You're saying if you KNEW someone was there to just get Ace of Beasts to complete the set you'd be that much of an asshole to them?  Doesn't matter if they were friends or not, guildmates or not.  
---
You're truly an asshole.  And the fact you keep trying to disguise it as some form of "gold equality" is probably what bothers me the most about this.
---
But keep typing LOL instead of facts and using terms like  "Speaking broadly".  And I'm speaking specifically, but nice attempt at deflection.  But please, continue to insult me instead of addressing the issue at hand.
---
And thats why people just do it from the beginning. Just roll on all BoEs  from the start and there can be  no bad blood.
---
What do you mean why bother doing it at all? It's not like Blizzard wants people to play on private servers and of course they are going to draw that community into their ranks rather than having them play on unofficial servers.
---
What we know as of now is that Blizzard views classic WoW as a museum piece, which means that post-Naxx the classic server will just exist on the BattleNet client for everyone to play as they like until retail WoW dies. This is why classic WoW has a shared subscription with retail WoW, they view classic WoW as pretty much a "free" DLC that you can play on the side.
---
A Blizzard expansion has never been meant to last for over 2 years, so expecting classic WoW to last for like 8 years or however many you got up to is just crazy. It's completely up to them if they want to continue past the original content or just freeze the game post-Naxx, we're still getting the product we were promised.. we were never promised a modified classic WoW that will last for 8+ years with servers wiping and fresh content.
---
What we will PROBABLY get is classic TBC, but that's most likely it if Blizzard doesn't change their minds post-Naxx because the community is still large and hungry for more. We will have to wait and see.
---
Had a thought. Posted it to related subreddit looking for discussion. Fuckin fuuuuuck me, I guess. Bunch of salty fatasses
---
Lol so are you asking or are you telling?
---
&gt;Congratulations, enjoy never getting gear unless you're soloing because everyone rolls on everything and maybe one day you just get very unlucky
---
False. 
---
You would get just as much gear as any other player after a give time due to how /roll and RNG works. Some of those you won't be able to use, so you will sell them and then from that gold buy items you can/want to use.
---
But sure, label me as a greedy bastard and continue spitting fallacies if that makes you happier.
---
Premed&gt;CS&gt;5 point CB Evis&gt;blind&gt;Prep&gt;do it all again...if warrior isn't dead or even close, run away lol.
---
I can't wait to gank every little gnome bitch I see
---
Pet food is the problem, if pet is angry = 25% lessDPS , more angry = pet leaves you. And it takes time to level pet and it’s happiness to get the points to give it skills, on the plus side your class is the only one that plays this very cool and complex mechanic ( pet collection, pet skills ..etc).
---
But one thing your not thinking about, you have ONE LESS bag that everyone else , bag space is a problem 
---
I tried it on a pserver recently but I found it inferior to 2h reck and ret. 
---
What profession makes arrows? My alt was a Dwarf gun hunter. I took engineering, and made my own ammo. Was something of a game to me, to make the toon as self-sufficient as possible (had to buy ammo pouches since I couldn't make them). Kept up the secondary professions, had plenty of food to keep the pet going, ammo in my pouch, etc. Only reason I had to return to town was to clear bags. Was kind of fun in its own way. Note it was an alt I could meander on though, it was not a fast track if one is trying to level and get to end game.
---
Basically I had my main tank, with a specific role in the guild/group. I had a holy priest alt that I leveled entirely in dungeons to fill the 'I want something simple yet social' moods. And I had the survivalist hunter alt in the 'I just want to get lost somewhere in the world and not talk to anyone' mood.
---
Man you are so right in a duel of SPriest vs SL lock the paladin with shadow resist gear wins 100% almost every time 
---
Yea, I really feel like WotF can be so clutch in PvP in those few scenarios that you need it. But if you are in PvE and need to use WotF you have a more of a problem with your raid since the strategies are well developed and there are like 3 or so total fearing raid bosses to date.
---
It's a subtle point that I personally believe is the elephant in the room when talking about class balancing. The primary problem with hybrids in vanilla is not the mechanics of the hybrid themselves, it's that the raid mechanics don't create opportunity for hybrids to shine except in rare cases.
---
I like to use the example of the Rajax fight in AQ20 as an example of a quest where hybrids are very strong. A druid in this fight is amazing. They can start out tanking an add, swap to healing form to help top people off from the chaos, maybe root a few of the mobs too, then swap into cat form to help finish off the wave. Hybrids bring utility, burst, and the ability to swap roles to a fight. None of that matters in long single target single phase fights like MC and BWL. Better raid mechanics would go a long ways towards addressing the viability of hybrids in raids. After all, vanilla "class balance" as it is is really quite good 1-59, it's only the raid game where it falls apart, and then because the structure of fights has changed from 5 players vs 5ish mobs to 40 players vs few mob(s).
---
I think after lvl 41 you can afford it but before that obviously not
---
A lot of bosses fear, so saying it is useless is incorrect. In fact, on alliance Dwarf is almost a must because of fear ward.
---
You ever seen 40 retarded kids trying to dance together?
---
WoD had only two raid tiers. 
---
We are going to have at least three in BfA. 
---
BfA has adaptive difficulty with M+. WoD had nothing like that until the very end of the xpac. 
---
BfA has stuff to do. WoD didn’t. 
---
 *We are the Forsaken*. *We will slaughter* anyone who stands in our way. 
---
Stance dance on tank for fear?
---
I'm not disguising anything in telling you the facts about how the community handles this. It's not an opinion lol. What you are describing as your reality is what people refer to as "reserved" runs. You can go look on /r/wowservers for details on that. And you can also use some reading comprehension and go check out my original post where I also reference forors and freezing band and you will see I know exactly what I'm talking about and its consistent with the other drops that are specific to a certain table or set of tables while being very low percentage. Maybe you can do some of that googling you claim I've never done lmao :)
---
 If you think a pug group is giving you forors from a DME run without you specifically making a reserve group, you are in for a big surprise when you actually play these dungeons lol
---
I understand where  you're coming from, but at the same time now you're trying to dictate how people level.  
---
For me personally I hate running BRD.  When I am running a class that needs a melee dps sword, I'd rather run SFK.  Sure I won't have a guaranteed shot at a blue sword, but there are other upgrades there that people can get.
---
Unfortunately the logical fallacy here is that "you outlevel &lt;X&gt; within &lt;Y&gt; levels" and that's true of ANY gear you get, regardless if it's BoP, BoE, or Quest rewards.  You can't dictate where other people level, what dungeons they choose to run (or choose not to run) and how they level.  
---
So you can't assume that the rogue in SFK can easily get Outlaw Sabre and therefore shouldn't be rolling on Shadowfang as an upgrade need if it drops.  
---
Do you understand where I'm coming from here?  Assuming that something is "easily replaced" by a comparable green or quest reward is then dictating how they play.  Do you want someone you don't know coming up to you randomly going "You have the wrong gear equipped, you need to go &lt;here&gt; and &lt;here&gt; to complete these quests for BiS items at your current level".  
---
Even if that person would be technically correct, wouldn't you consider them a condescending asshole?
---
Sounds like you are pretty much in agreement then . Changing the classes is a no go but changing the boss encounters to allow more class options might be a good idea?
---
Yea only did it once and learned my lesson.
---
Feels hard knowing your server is dead and its never coming back
---
While everything you said is true and would make for a more interesting game, that isn't how vanilla is and I'm just against the principal of changing something in a restoration project, if they did make boss changes I would still play and honestly probably have a better time, but I'm still not in favor of them.
---
My plan was always to throw them a one-year sub on release date if they actually made vanilla servers. So that's what I will do.
---
I think as Horde you want more Shamans than Alliance want Paladins since totems only affect the group the Shaman is in.
---
Nightblade is crap for all parties involved. Normally you dont get much gold from it and its bad for twinking because of its insanely fast speed. No warrior or paladin would want to wear it. 
---
Paladin at 39 is reck with Pendulum, warrior is arms with Pendulum.
---
If you subbed for BfA, you enjoy BfA, and want to continue playing BfA then keep subbing for BfA.
---
If you're subbing for Classic before it's even out yet you're doing it wrong. Activision Blizzard isn't some small indie developer who needs the revenue stream just to keep their doors open.
---
No, Duskwood is 20-30 (give or take depending on who you ask). It has more quest available than hillsbrad at the early 20’s and is on level with Ashenvale.
---
You’ll be able to do it, but the rig you’re currently running on may not have adequate RAM or CPU. 
---
Modern client is much more resource intensive than the 1.12 one. 
---
Also requires a PC that can run 5 copies of the retail client at once. That’s a taller order than trying to run 5 copies of 1.12, which could likely run fine on a good tablet. 
---
Even "regular" quests can be hard for a solo player. Grouping is pretty much always beneficial. 
---
Silly to think like that he says. Irony much?
---
And how does that help you specifically in this instance? You just lost 100g (Shadowfang), 200g (Stockade Pauldrons), 1800g (Alcors Sunrazor), 30.000g (Titanic Leggings pattern as the first crafter on the server). 
---
I for one would be more than happy to not be invited into 5% of groups anymore in exchange of 30.000g.
---
I think the more likely outcome is that once classic hits it's peak, probably 2-3 years, someone will open another blizzlike private server and everyone will move there for a "fresh start".
---
Effectively meaning they put in over a years worth of development into Classic just to lose all the subbies to another private server.
---
Acti-Blizzard is a business, nothing more, they wouldn't do anything that wouldn't be a large benefit to them. 
---
Spending 1-2 years developing something with a similar shelf life would just be bad business. Do you really think they are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts?
---
I would say the basic gameplay is a lot more interesting in Vanilla as monsters in the world pose a significant threat to your character. In modern WoW you are pretty much guaranteed to win all encounters during the leveling process even if you barely pay attention, which makes the basic gameplay boring.
---
&gt;For a tanking warrior whose main source of gearing has to be instanced content is it really fair to say an item is worth the same to them as a mage or hunter that can farm significantly better?
---
No, you are right. However, neither do these classes need the same amount of consumables to raid, neither have them similar difficulty getting BoP gear in raids. Some also have easier time gathing ingredients in the open world, others have harder time avoiding corpse camping. Some classes have good itemization with lot of options, others dont. Some classes are popular thus you have lot of competition, some dont (druid) Such disparities exist in the game, but N/G for BoP does not exist because of disparities, it exists because these can even themselves out quite easily and everyone is happier with that system.  This isn't true with N/G for BoEs. 
---
Also these disparities are somewhat evened out on the market: classes that are harder to farm with or play with are less popular thus there is less competition for their gear on the marker, thus those items are cheaper.
---
On the other hand if you really delve into this then the warrior should also get the staff so that he can vendor it and spend that gold on repair bills and the more  expensive and more important gear updates (main tanks need better gear and warriors have bigger competition)
---
All of this combined makes for a really messy system that is just not feasible. BoP introduced a small problem that had a really easy solution with N/G
---
&gt;If this was the case BoEs would just go to the player that got to loot the mob like other drops.
---
That is a faulty argument. N/G exists because the players use it, not because the developers implemented it. I've played wow before N/G was just not implemented (the way we use it now, with the greed option) because everyone profited out of it long-term.
---
&gt;See above- this is the most ass-backwards logic I've ever seen, that the person who actually needs an item should just buy it __from the person who should have rolled greed.__
---
That is the backward logic.
---
While you may not have much time to play, make the most of it!  Research preraid BIS for your character and focus on that when you feel like doing PVE.  AV gear and lower few ranks of blue PVP gear are very attainable as well.  
---
If Classic is popular there will be a constant stream of people in BGs in the process of gearing up.  If you see a guy in full t2/t3 that doesn't mean they can't be killed it just means to be very wary of them!  
---
I'm not looking forward to the t3 mages/warlocks in bgs as they can just 2-shot so many people from 30+ yards away.  You're in a nice even fight and then this pyroblast comes off the top rope and 1shots your healer.  You see it coming but can't get out of the way and it all *fades to black*
---
&gt; some are close to home and safe
---
Some are close to home and not safe...I cant wait to have to walk between Xroads and Ratchet even though I have the flight path :)
---
Yep. I can confirm for every interesting quest line, there’s five “collect 10 gnoll boar snouts” quests pet hub. It was a part of the experience, but definitely not what everyone remembers. 
---
I haven't leveled past 20 simply because I know I wouldn't be able to handle the emotional loss.
---
Gnomes can't even heal. Puny little creatures.
---
Omg good idea I should at least sell my gold for wow tokens. 
---

A few posts here and there is not alot of people and probably not enough to make a full Reddit post about it...unless you just wanted attention...if so, gg.
---
Ouch. Tell me you guys at least had a warlock.
---
If you're trying to say you've never seen someone get very lucky in a dungeon run and win a ton of BoE greens/blues and didn't feel the list bit salty then you're being untruthful with yourself.  And if you do admit to it, then you're agreeing that despite long-term statistical analysis suggesting an eventual equilibrium, short term analysis dictates otherwise. Streaks do happen.
---
And it's unfortunate but WoW's loot system doesn't consider "kiskoller" or "sykomykes" loot rolls over time.  This isn't hearthstone: there's no "legendary timer" that says "Player X hasn't received a good drop in awhile, better increase the odds to make him win something good!"
---
The statistical analysis that loot drops are equal only exists on a large scale (i.e. an entire server player base) it's entirely possible for people to get very unlucky in one dungeon or several walking away with very little gear compared to other people in their group.  
---
*And by the way: you missed the entire point.  You focused on the statistical analysis portion instead of the premise behind it...*
---
That just because something is a boe purple/blue doesn't negate that it could be an upgrade for you or &lt;insert player here.  if you think of blue/purples as nothing but gold piles that are meant to be sold then you don't grasp the fundamental aspect of gear in general: all gear is incremental.  Even at 60, you're not "using gear forever".  You have many pieces of gear that at 60 eventually get replaced by a +3 stamina increase or a +2 int increase.  Are you saying that just cause it's "a small upgrade" it should be forfeit?  I'd argue that at lower levels small increases are actually MORE important because you have less of a stat pool to "draw from".  +4 stamina at level 20 is much more valuable to your survivability than +4 stamina at 60, and yet would you turn down a piece of gear at either level? generally speaking no you wouldn't. 
---
I'm not spitting fallacies. You may not agree with my opinion, you can call me names, insult me, downvote me: I care not.  The point is that you are attempting to make a moral debate on the forums that you will holistically not follow when in-game because of a theoretical situation that doesn't exist in reality (i.e. Retail Vanilla WoW/Classic WoW).
---
Fear does not only hit tank, and it may give you an extra 3-9 sec uptime doing healing and damage at certain bosses. As shadow, I say undead for pvp, troll pve and undead for both.
---
Do you know if there is any similar BiS list for PvP?
---
nah
---
Ghostcrawler also constantly got flak for pissing portions of the community off. Since his message was generally blunt. 
---
Nah, but was lucky. A teammate was still on his way so I whispered him and asked him to buy some stacks on the way. Worked out fine.
---
&gt; Edit: shit someone already posted it today

And someone removed it already too. Thanks mod!

Reckoning is bleh in Classic, because you can't abuse /sit.

fuck man this hits too close to home..

You know they have medicine that helps people suffering from needless paranoia? Right?
---
Well if you go back and look, it worked in patch 1.12 and theres proof of it. But theres also proof that it didnt so who know
---
You assume people don’t like the things you don’t like. 
---
You say leveling time is bad? Well a lot of us really enjoyed it. You might feel it is a chore before the real game starts, I feel it’s a fun part of the game.
---
And yes, finding a group took long sometimes, but I liked it that way. Doing other things and chatting with the two guys I might have found already. Maybe you see an hour to find group as boring, I see it as an hour to make new friends.
---
As you can see, we don’t glorify - we just like those things. It’s like saying CS:GO is getting glorifies when it’s all about shooting - well of course that sounds boring if you don’t like a shooting game. Doesn’t mean the players that do like it just glorify it.
---
Yes. Your OP is correct. Based on Ythsiens comments on Classicast it really sounds like marketing and the Activision side of Blizz barely knows classic exists. 
---
Which is great because it means they won’t ruin it by insisting on a cash shop. 
---
There's going to be sharding in the starter areas blizz has said, so no need to wait a month. :)
---
As to whether you will be able to get logged in when the login servers get smashed is another thing all together. 
---
Shadowform at 40* 
---
lots of folks choose not to respec though til 45 because to go shadow at 40 you lose improved wands, which some will argue is not worth the shadow DPS boost / physical damage taken reduction.
---
I wish everybody would act like this for BoE's:
---
"NEED = I want the item"
---
"GREED=I'll take it if nobody really wants it"
---
Gets rid of all the OMG 2 more DPS for me, 1000g=insta-epic mount for you crap.
---
Barrens Chat.
---
A lot of shady shit goes on on private servers too. GMs selling gear, gold and characters secretly. I spent like a year on a server only for them to sneak in cash shop bullshit. It was no surprise the server died soon after.
---
Where is this proof you speak of? Because /sit was changed to not proc Enrage or Reckoning many patches before 1.121
---
" Anyone who's IMMEDIATE first reaction to a BoE dropping without any consideration that someone could actually possibly use it in the group it dropped for is a greedy asshole. "

I play warrior and I tank 99% of my time in 5men. I dont have a farming alt, therefore I play all my time on the warrior and do all content  on him. I am in groups 95% of my playtime.   
---
I can tell you that my gaming enjoyment is severely hindered by ninjalooters. Just have 1/5 or 20% of people roll need on various items, maybe only once per dungeon, sometimes notoriously and you can expect to have constant - and I mean *constant* \- discussions about loot, ninjas, need/greed and further arguments.
---
I dont play for arguing about loot rules.  
---
I as tank and group lead state them once before the run starts and end of discussion. I honestly think you underestimate the amount of blatant ninjas and people who will just need on everything. They are everywhere and I will not have my enjoyment reduced because of that.
---
Need for everything except BoPs all the way.
---
I'm personally a basic bitch who *absolutely loves* Human Males. The fact that all vanilla armor is made with a human male model and that I am a fashion slut probably helps. Recently started liking Dwarf Females as well, for the memes of course. Worst alliance race has to be Night Elf males, because they're almost exclusively played by 10 year olds or toxic tryhards.
---
When it comes to the horde I'm a sucker for Undeads, for dat dere race fantasy. Taurens are personally the worst horde race imo, just because they feel so *incredibly slow.* Something about finally getting that level 40 mount and it barely feeling faster than running almost broke me when leveling a Taruen Warrior in TBC.
---
Sure, but it's just not my play style for bgs.
---
&gt;That just because something is a boe purple/blue doesn't negate that it could be an upgrade for you
---
Or the unlucky BoP drops (from your perspective) could be negated by you rolling on a BoE and having equal chance of earning money. This goes either way, so this isn't really an argument.
---
&gt;you don't grasp the fundamental aspect of gear in general: all gear is incremental.
---
I don't deny that, nor did I ever do that, so I don't get why are you arguing against my supposed position on the matter.
---
&gt;you can call me names, insult me, downvote me
---
I didn't call you names, didn't insult you, nor downvoted you. You called me a greedy asshole
---
&gt;Congratulations, enjoy never getting gear unless you're soloing because everyone rolls on everything and maybe one day you just get very unlucky. Enjoy that dagger upgrade going to mage that's normally BoP just being "a pile of gold" because your asinine fear of ninja-looters has __caused you to act like a greedy asshole__.
---
&gt;It's this kind of cognitive dissonance people use to justify their actions that ACTUALLY makes me afraid for society
---
At this point I like to close this discussion because it is going nowhere.
---
Well, it's no problem if the person that equips it rolls need even if it's replaced. The fact that it is not frowned upon if you roll need on an item worth a 1000g so you can sell it on the AH already is a vast improvement on the crapiquette that was uphold by crapiquette nazi's during vanilla.
---
Not really. You used to be able to dot snapshot. They used to make actually interesting trinkets with powerful on use that you could time properly for massive gains. Now you do the same fixed rotation from start of fight to the end. Your rotation doesn't change as you get new gear. Blizzard actively tried to dumb down gameplay and shorten the gap between experienced and new players. Vanilla embraces this gap. Don't want to deal with all these intricacies? Play mage. Do you get penalized for picking an easy class in vanilla? No mage is one of the best dps in the game. Wanna play a class/spec that isn't #1 dps on the charts? Go ahead we need 40 people and multiples of every class anyway otherwise we die to boss mechanics. Try killing chromagus without a hunter. Vanilla has so much freedom. Sure you could be an objectively worse player but as long as you showed up with your consumables and world buffs you could top the meter with the best of them.
---
The activity of their classic server is one number, but that won't represent how many people subbed to WoW for Classic(since many who are already subbed for BfA will also try out or actively play Classic too).  
---
Having a separate number for Classic only players would be a really good thing, and subscribing when classic drops will show really well how many people wants to play WoW Classic, and not BfA.
---
he doesn't use execute 
---
I had similar troubles with ressurection reagents. A particular party kept wiping and i forgot to restock seeds. I had 3 of them and used them pretty much on CD (every half an hour someone died that needed a rez by me) Thanfuly I only ran out at the very end of the dungeon run.
---
give me an example where youd use demo shout over battle shout in a 5 man. demo shout doent make more threat unless theres more than enemies. thunderclap is only for lots and lots of enemies.

Never pvp without this as a warrior, i had it on my Whirlwind Axe first and then all of 2H weapons... its even helped in lvling cus lot of humanoids have disarm
---
Sorry, but getting mount money at level 24 is much more valuable than a couple of extra dps for 2 levels.  Imo the person that AH's it should get prio over the one that wants to wield it. It has always been terrible unforced rules on vanilla. I really really hope people have wisened up by now.
---
It depends entirely on the tone of the person. 
---
I for one would be actually grateful when I am about to make big mistakes regarding gear.   
---
I honestly had this in MC when Flameguard Gauntlets dropped. They dropped, I won the MS&gt;OS roll and was about to get them. Another warrior offered my like 300g and I thought that might be a good deal. Then various people stepped in and told me, the person was ripping me off.   
---
And - lo and behold - I had Flameguard another year without ever getting anything new, because the next better ones wouldve been Annihilation from AQ40 or R12 gloves. 
---
In the same sense I would tell somebody to keep hold of his 15dps sword and not upgrade to this 17dps sword so he can get 100gold, buy his mount for 80 and still have 20 to buy all his spells while leveling.
---
I didn't think of that, what a great idea! Let's discuss that on this post! Go ahead, everyone, share your thoughts!
---
Sounds great. I love exploration, and it seems like retail just left out a lot of zones leaving me to just swim and walk to places Id prefer. I think ill hold off on a private server just so Ill get that new player experience that Im sure everyone fucking loves especially since im a new player to retail in a sense. Thanks!
---
It kind of worked but you had to spam it to abuse latency. You might get 1 reck proc per 4 enemy hits. It wasn't reliable like pservers. 
---
Either way it didn't work in the blizzcon demo so it probably won't work in classic at all.
---
[Here is the link that I use to listen to their old episodes](https://player.fm/series/casually-hardcore)
---
Recent player history, recent time played can show this. 
---
Just don't make a warrior and you should be fine, atleast until Nax comes out lol. Rank 10 gear with exalted AV weapons and Tier 1 bracers + belt from auction house can fight back against people in BWL gear. You can even hold your own against people in aq 40 gear if you're good.
---
My argument has two points:
---
1) Loot trading is irrelevant because loot etiquette will be enforced by the community regardless of its existence (and quite frankly encourages discussion between players, which is pro-social and not a harm to classic)
---
2) The player base is not stupid enough to be unable to notice players need rolling on stuff they do not need themselves, and thus would be exposed. Further, if a player does roll and win an item that they need, but choose to give it away instead (even withing a group of friends), that is not an evil exploit.
---
Lastly, as far as 'good faith' is concerned. You have offered little of value to discussion, and just wielded claims without detail (exploitation without any relevant detail, claiming that not inspecting them means you can't tell who improperly rolled, and then just down voting me and making a claim about my behavior). So I will take you next down vote gladly, knowing that you learn nothing and will return to circle jerk with others who share your opinion and are unable to bring substance to discussion with others.
---
This is literally me. I plan on taking two weeks off to relive my clearly teens at launch, but Im seriously fighting the urge to quit my shitty job and just take a month off. 
---
But I just know that will be the death of me, I will actually OD in classic and out even Asmongold's neckbeard nest to shame. 
---
Anyone else want to retire to a cabin in the woods with a puppy, a stable internet connection, and a classic WoW subscription? Just me?
---
I was amazed by the number of times someone used the N\*\*\* word in general chat and nobody batted an eye. Hardly ever happens on EU servers/ playing times.
---
Way more probably. You can basically upgrade your entire outfit on a krol blade AH sale.
---
MF rank @ lvl 44 makes it a much better DPM than the rest the spells. I plan to respect @ 44 unless I am enjoying rolling through dungeons fast with my duo
---
Cmon man.  Gnome warlock with giant mustache, frustrating melee characters by jumping around inside large fights and being literally hard to track down among all the other animations and players/npcs around.  AV was great for this if I ever got caught.  Also having your pet in melee range being way larger than you and you can sometimes hide inside it, juking people and they start running off being like where did this stupid tasty morsel go.  Then the immolate/conflag (still can't see you at all) and then the fear lands and the soul fire is queued up.

&gt;Also these disparities are somewhat evened out on the market: classes that are harder to farm with or play with are less popular
---
While I don't like using pserver stats as a base warriors are one of the most populated classes even at max level, and they are probably the worst farming class in the game. 
---
&gt;All of this combined makes for a really messy system that is just not feasible. BoP introduced a small problem that had a really easy solution with N/G
---
Somehow I don't think everything being BoE is such a great idea, even if it is interesting to think about. I don't think there's anything wrong with most drops being BoP.
---
&gt;N/G exists because the players use it, not because the developers implemented it. 
---
Except they did implement it? I have no idea what you're trying to say here.
---
&gt;I've played wow before N/G was just not implemented (the way we use it now, with the greed option) because everyone profited out of it long-term.
---
You played before 0.11? People were familiar with and used the Need/Greed system before there even was a Greed option by just using pass.
---
&gt;That is the backward logic.
---
I don't see how. One person actually wants to equip a piece of loot while another person might not even be able to use and and regardless just wants it to sell. Seeing every piece of loot you can't equip as a bag of gold is absurdly greedy.
---
/roar
---
And I'm telling you back when I played RETAIL vanilla/TBC no-one did this.  Ninja looters were fairly rare. Yes they happened but assuming everyone is a ninja looter and then behaving like you do doesn't not make you an asshole.
---
I don't give a fuck what the private server cancer scene of people who have literally ZERO invested interest in being nice because guess what: it doesn't cost them ANYTHING to download a private server client.  You cannot compare the private server scene behavior to anything that a retail environment would compare to.  (and if you're referring to the reddit community I have a rude awakening for you: [only 9.6% of the average population uses reddit.](https://i.imgur.com/jBqsHj3.png)  So even if you managed to have some vocal coalition on reddit agree with you, it's still a vast minority)

Also, as a word of advice: typing lol, haha, lmao, or any variation therein after every sentance/paragraph makes you look infantile. Especially when someone is trying to have a debate with you.

---
After the blizzcon announcement last year a lot of people regained some faith in blizzard. I know I did. Atleast until this year.
---
The way I look at it with classic on the way I'm no longer mad at them for ruining retail. They can do whatever dumb stupid change they want as long as it doesn't affect vanilla. following that logic I was able to give bfa a fair chance without bias. Played for maybe a month before I got bored of running the same content endlessly.
---
Now I'm unsubbed again waiting for classic. If they mess this up it will be the nail in the coffin.
---
That's the definition of greeding an item over needing the item. 
---
A mount at 40 isn't something players have a right to. It's a goal you work towards. A lot of players don't get theirs until their mid 40s, others have money set aside since level 20. 
---
If you cheat your way towards your goals and fuck people over for your own gain then that says an awful lot about you as a person and maybe multiplayer games where you play together with people, fighting over scarce resources ,aren't for you. 
---
What do y'all think of this smite build: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bA0MsZbxtcfbqZxMo

Maybe it's meant to play like that? They haven't tagged it BoE for nothing after all. 
---
People *still* pre-order shit even in this day and age. How many times do you people have to get burned by asshole devs who release incomplete games before they stop enabling the cycle. My friend pre-ordered Anthem and my other friends are continuing to roast him for it. 
---
And seriously, if it's 10g-15g blues, I have no problems greeding, but those insta-mount-money items? I will slam that need button.
---
Save your retail gold people will be trading between the two games. Let's say you had 10 mill gold on retail you trade that for 1k gold in vanilla so you can get your epic riding quicker.
---
Yeah the game is bad, no argument there. I don't mind the AH game tho. Using TSM once or twice a day to make gold is kinda fun. 
---
As someone who hit 60 in Vanilla, I want everything exactly the same as it was, mechanics and bosses included. My reason for that is simple: I never raided back then. I’ve literally never set foot in a Vanilla raid, and my personal goal for Classic is to clear Naxx. Changing mechanics and stuff would make it feel disingenuous, and I’d miss out on what I was looking forward to the most.
---
I guess we'll have to agree to disagree there because a +2 dps at Level 18-21 is a fairly large increase.  hell that's a fairly large increase even at 60.  It also depends on class.  Classes like Rogue/Warrior are more weapon dependant than say a priest/mage who just need "stat sticks"  Admittedly in your story that is a true situation, and you're right: Tone has a lot to do with it, not to mention familiarity with the person in question.
---
But generally speaking: it's considered a social faux pas to roll up to someone and just hand out advice in-game like that barring specific circumstances.
---
Twink gear is handled differently than regular gear since even a class that can equip it likely won't get as much good out of it as just selling it, and items like Alcors and Titanic Leggings plan rarely drop outside of raids where you might not be able to ninja it or doing so will get you blacklisted out of far more than 5% of groups.
---
Amount of originality it the idea is immeasurable.
---
I've been playing on it instant 60 server and dueled people as a high armor, holy / disc troll priest with blackout. Against melee it's superb. I definitely know what I'm picking
---
I resubbed, briefly, back in January. The only reason I did was because I was curious about the current state of the game (my toons were still in MoP content). Needless to say, I was not impressed. Cancelled my sub at the end of the month and now I'm just waiting for classic.
---
I still prefer undead 😍 fear immunity is so useful
---
To be blunt, if someone tells you the best thing then everyone sees that and that will no longer be the best thing.  In general, look for things that are in low supply on your server and farm those things. This will vary widely from server to server.  Generally everything white quality and up has a use, look for stuff used in popular gear crafting and raid consumables and find what your auction house lacks. There will be tons of people farming overworld things and the more easily identifiable the item, the more competition there will be. Sure there's a chance you could be first to devilsaurs but there's usually always someone ahead of you even if you're in the top 5-10 %.  Low contested or uncontested things are usually the best farming. Instances for example are great.  Also, early game gold comes from vendoring. Most items should be stockpiled and sold later when gold inflates a little bit.  I know it's not a direct answer but there is no one good answer to this question, it all depends on your competition particular to your server, your class, etc. 
---
I'm personally planning on skipping professions early (using enchanting for d/eing only) to level faster and check out what farm spots aren't crowded. I also plan on doing solo maura princess runs when the non instanced locations are packed.  I'll focus my professions based on what my server seems to be lacking after that.
---
Wait. Is Jesus a junkie?
---
Invest all your gold into items that are useless on launch but become useful later on. Ex. Nature resistance potions, grave moss, pristine black diamonds etc.
---
Engineers make bullets/shells, but at 60 the thorium ones can be traded in for arrows from either of these quests depending on your faction:

https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7341
---
https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7342
---
Agreed. But considering that we're talking about ActiBlizz, they are probably looking more at the $$$ numbers than the player numbers.
---
If you really want to min max and will play any faction then orc is the best bet for lock/warrior (overall) followed by gnome for mage (undead for horde). Ally side warlock and mage is easy you go gnome. Ally side warrior im unsure if gnome or dwarf, mages are really annoying for warriors and are more prevelant in premade bgs but I would imagine warriors and rogues are kinda everywhere so maybe dwarf. 
---
mid-life crisis occurs literally when you realize that there's less life ahead of you than behind you.
---
Somehow I doubt that. We complain about the game and they always twist it into something else. Not maliciously, but they can’t help it. We need to send a clear message that can’t be misunderstood.
---
They know I’ve been unsubbed since Wrath, so when they see me return, it will be unambiguous as to why, and they can’t say “oh, classic is making people sub to retail.”
---
Funny stuff!
---
As far as supply goes, no, it won't be a problem. There are vendors everywhere that sell them. What might present a problem is bag space, as your quiver/ammo pouch gives you one less space for a bag.
---
Depends on the class you are healing on but in my experience it's not too bad, worst comes to worst you have to make buddies with a warrior in your guild and play together and become unstoppable gods.
---
Go holy till 20 till concecrate then swap to prot thats how I do it and you can tank dungeons while leveling and aoe grind.

I was about to comment that the difference between the most and least played classes is something like 20% vs 8%, and that could play a role in selecting what to main.
---
But then I figured, “Nah, I’m just gonna play whatever the fuck I want. MAYBE I’ll take what’s being played a lot into consideration when choosing an alt. Maybe.”
---
Depends on the game. Usually with Nintendo games I know what I'm getting, its the PC titles lately that have been polished turds. 
---
I wouldn't say it's better, it's rougly on par but it's definitely viable. I've done it multiple times myself. Even if you don't AoE level it still holds up. Thrash blade alone is such a good weapon that it's better than a lot of similar weapon level two-handers and will easily last you untill 60 and beyond. The people who say no don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
---
...or worse: the person that can use it as an upgrade is of the 'greed for money, need for upgrade' type and goes ballistic in /p and in /1 and leaves group after losing the roll...
---
It's not much to manage. And it's really fun to have something to prepare before venturing out and questing. I've ended up in really fun, but scary situations where my arrows have run out in a cave because i've forgotten to buy them. Getting out is suddenly a big challenge. I've also forgotten arrows in dungeons. That's a sticky situation, and required me to leave my group and refill my arrows. It's a conversation starter if anything. I think hunter would've been a lot more boring without all that management. The pets food, the arrows. It's a real survival class. So fun!
---
Please stop. Undead is only one race of four, and wotf is 2 minute cooldown. warlocks on horde side have to deal with fear wards and palas. 
---
Alright man lol you win :) you can keep insulting me as much as you want, but I've gotten my point across for anyone reading in the future and your "discussion" is circling now so have a good day haha.  
---
For anyone else reading, since this info is on a public for people trying to learn more about the game: I played a priest on live servers myself and then a warrior and mage on privates, which is why I have personal experience with each and every one those specific BoEs I mentioned in my posts above. If you expect to be handed incredibly valuable items without contest, you would advertise your groups as "X item reserved". That's the key word people use if you want to look up further discussion as well. Cheers haha
---
Are you me, im having huge problems deciding if i want to main Paladin or Warlock in classic too.
---
I really love healing in games, but i also like to burn and make my enemies suffer so there is that.
---
does this mean multiplayer in MMORPG? 
---
Shock horror I know
---
They can actually tell ingame which game u play. They will know what the interest for classic/bfa is, naturally.
---
And what about Staff of Jordan, depending on the server progression, its a crappy midlevel staff that is used by 60s as a solid preBiS item. Do you want to tell people what they cant and can roll need on?  
---
Some will roll need on a 6g item (travellers backpack), some will start rolling at 50g(pristine black diamonds), eveybody and their mom will roll on Teebus  worth 3000g dropping in a UBRS pug. To spare everybody ambiguity, everybody just rolls need, so nobody has to assess when one wants to start roll need.
---
Pick mining or herbalism to avoid farm by killing mobs.
---
There are actually quite a few instances of NPCs not knowing the names of zones in-game. It’s pretty funny seeing a goblin saying “uhh what was it? Tanris? Tarnasis? Trina’s is?”
---
If you think one of those 16 debuff slots is going to serpent's sting, I don't know what to tell you.
---
Or you just say what rolling etiquette is expected while the group is forming like everyone already does, especially in high level PUGs.
---
While the return might be good, you can end up waiting a long time before you see your investment pay off. Say you invest 200g into Nature Resistance Potions, and expect to be able to resell it for 1,000 gold once AQ40 releases. While it's a 400% return, you won't see a dime for many, many months. If you need gold anytime soon, investing in something that will be useful earlier on is probably a better idea.
---
People would undoubtedly upload videos ASAP to YouTube explaining the mechanics and how to beat them. I'm not sure if that would be much different from back in the day though as I was never involved in any vanilla raiding. To me, figuring out how to beat a difficult encounter sounds fun, but I feel like any guild I join in classic is just gonna expect me to go study up on every encounter before I even set foot in the raid.
---
And this is the wrong attitude, which has been explained a lot of times. Need for upgrade, greed for AH is an obsolete bad mechanic, especially for real valuable BoE's. It's a terrible mistake by Blizzard to have implemented it in such a way and causing needless drama. And it has been a terrible etiquette to have developed in early vanilla times.

Insta-mount-money or saving yourself 1 day /played of grinding because the lottery went your way is vastly more important than +4 agi, +3 sta or +2 dps.
---
&gt; It's 5 days /played for the best levellers in the world.
---
Not just the best levelers, but the best levelers on an empty server with no competition. Everyone's ideas of how fast they will level are incredibly skewed by retail and their private server experiences.
---
Everyone thinks that, deep inside, they are Joana and world-first Naxx raiders combined. They think they are going to roflstamp Classic servers, down all of the bosses on the first available reset, and receive accolades from the WoW community as if they are doing world firsts.
---
They not going to be that fast, a good chunk of them will burn out, and in general no one is going to care about their accomplishments. A chunk of them will find a way to blame Blizzard (or the cliche personal issues) and quit when they don't live up to their own inner hype.
---
Im not sure you understand what marketing for a re-release is supposed to do.
---
Yes.. I know a lot of pserver people only enjoys the launch of a vanilla server because they don't have the attention span to keep on playing one pserver before wanting to play on another fresh server again, thanks for reminding me I guess. 
---
But yes, this is why I said it's up to Blizzard to realize that if they want classic WoW to continue growing they will add new content to it.. BUT they have no obligation to do so whatsoever.
---
I do actually believe they are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts, even one of the main developers at Blizzcon said that they expect a substantial drop around mid-way into classic WoW so I don't really think they view classic WoW as a completely profitable project (even though I think it will be since people underestimate the power of old games).
---
Depends if you wanna spoon at night and who gets to be the big spoon.

Seems good, my only thought is that imp mana burn is so strong, I get why you'd want imp sw:p, but I think I'd take those extra 3 points in shadow and go for imp mana burn.

So far, nobody has ever has taken offense when I told them they might want to switch OH and MH, because they had their lower topend damage weapon in their MH, hence lower sinister strikes and a DPS decrease.

Upvotes for hex of weakness. Healing mitigation has to be one of the most powerful effects in the game and there's only 2 other sources of it.
---
Quivers aren’t worth it until level 60.
---
The system didn't take 1000g items into account.

Basically yes, without dual spec you can't just go out and do something else so you're basically screwed outside of group content. 
---
&gt; If 5 people win a free car you don't just automatically give it to the only one with a drivers license.
---
This is just silly. A piece of gear in World of Warcraft isn't comparable to a car, the 4 people without a license can still get one while a warlock isn't going to be able to equip a non-cloth drop ever, BoE drops are never "free" since even if the drop is random it was acquired by doing content 5 or more people are putting effort into, even if unequal amounts.
---
&gt; Wailing Caverns is notorious for no people joining 40% through, bcause you get the first gem 5 minutes in. After that people are a lot less likely to join.
---
That never happened one single time out of all of the times I ran WC in Vanilla and TB. 
---
I think you are vastly overestimating the number of private server players who will be playing Classic and will be min-maxing everything they do.
---
Play what you want! 
---
If you plan on healing dungeons though, you should know druids don't have resurrection. Some people really hate
---
Pot meet kettle.  Honestly I don't mind being wrong if you could even provide a basis for me to be wrong, but people like you are the worst type of person that provide no actual information and use "argumentum ad antiquitatem" as the basis of your platform.  If proving you wrong, telling you to stop acting infantile, and providing statistics/google searches to back up my claims is "insulting you" then damn I must be Bill Burr by your standards.
---
I was more thinking of tanky gear with lot of buff / gear that inflict damage when getting it so I could take pack of mob and let them die while I tank them
---
Really hope they implement some kind of system for this to not happen. Also really doubt there’s going to be too many people who are diehard enough to have 1k gold on vanilla but somehow need gold on live. There will be people like this and trading will happen.... but it just kind of depresses me to think about it.
---
You really only need 20 or 21 points in Holy for Paladin. You can do 20/31/0 and AOE grind DM or out in the world.

Healing in PvP is great. Just keep throwing out heals and hide for a moment and people will shift their attention to your buddies. Then you just keep throwing out heals, and everyone seems to think they can still DPS your buddies down anyways.
---
A good PvP healer is rare and makes a huge difference.
---
There's a pretty large fanbase to go off of. Tens of millions (I assume) of people have played WoW and the diehard fans are a pretty large userbase.
---
That said, I don’t think that's nearly the potential they could have compared to marketing it more. I wish they did market it more and not just rely mostly on word of mouth.
---
However... when they dump resources into marketing is when Activision gets involved and starts seeing dollar signs in their eyes. That's when they start trying to guide where the game's development goes to make money.
---
If I had to choose between little to no marketing and an undefiled product and a well marketed abomination made cash cow, I'd choose the former. And that looks like what we're getting! 
---
It's not entirely ideal, but it'll do.
---
The system doesn't take anything into account, the players have to. You can discuss roll etiquette with your group and not just assume everyone is out to stab each other in the back at all times. It's not insane to use N/G for most items and full need on items of extraordinary value like dungeon mounts or twink gear.
---
For shadow priest PvP I highly recommend Troll. Shadowguard can be applied in advance and all of its three charges will apply a stack of shadow weaving and have a chance to proc blackout. Shadowguard also scales very well, as it has a spell coefficient of 1. While it can't be spammed since you need to wait for the charges to be consumed, it is a considerable DPS increase over using mind flay, DPS scaling more than four times as much with spell damage.
---
Due to its scaling and the utility of blackout procs, in BWL or better raid gear (or epic PvP gear) Shadowguard outperforms Devouring Plague even in a 1v1 where the enemy can't dispel devouring plague.
---
Rank 1 Hex of Weakness spam is also very powerful whenever there are enemy healers and allows the priest to be more mobile while still being useful.
---
I did resub after a 5 year hiatus over my hype for Classic. 2 hours later I issued a refund. 
---
I'm waiting for the actual release! 
---
I had someone in a group one time (on a pserver) who always needed on every drop no matter what, and never won when they didn't need the item (ie a warlock needing on a 2h axe). All group members were freaking out, then he said that private servers rolls aren't random, so it didn't matter if he needed the item or not. I've never seen any evidence to prove this, as the player always lost when he needed on a non-equipable item... Any thoughts?
---
&gt; I want to be level 30 killing boars / fucking around while i watch these crazy people knock rag down :)
---
I'm seriously considering sitting out the first 30 days until all of the assholes clear out of early zones so that I can play the game like a normal person.
---
No, there is no cross over, this has been confirmed by devs.
---
I got two 60 day membership cards for Christmas. I’m waiting until classic to redeem! 
---
Check out this leveling guide.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CLytIpJniY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY)
---
I think they did some statistics but Smite builds can actually be faster early on then trying to rush shadow talents early on. (barring spirit tap, which is of course the best leveling talent)
---
So no one makes arrows then? Interesting. 
---
I only played a bow hunter for a few short levels. The quiet-ness bugged me. Melee I have the smacking and thwacking sounds, gun hunter has the gunfire, casters have spell effects happening. Bow hunter was just so damned silent.
---
Nah, I was thinking let us just go straight to retail after a month of classic
---
Loving that interrobang
---
Healing specs aren’t unusable. Holy paladin tbh is probably the worst, but a very common shaman healing spec involves 20 points in Ele and DPS isn’t terrible. For example a full t2 geared Resto hybrid would out-DPS some pre-raid DPS specs
---
TBC still had progression though. WotLK is where that died with catch up mechanics. People only ran early raids for achievements/mounts.
---
Druid is probably 2nd/3rd fastest right after Hunter and maybe Warlock. Priest comes right after that unless you are AoE grinding as a mage, but with regular builds Shadow Priest leveling is actually awesome due to spirit tap and wand specialization.
---
You will eventually find a rotation that is mana neutral or slightly mana-negative while leveling depending on the mob. You also adjust your spell rotation based on mana costs due to newer ranks being more expensive, so every 2 levels the rotation may change. That being said, I found leveling my shadow priest to be way easier than my Shaman as the Shaman is feast or famine with windfurf while a Priest is very consistent. The Shaman was good for occasionally blowing people up in WPvP but I still prefer the Priest.
---
If you aren't garbage, you'll get whisperered to heal dungeons leveling up. Dungeons are fantastic because they fill in the gaps between zones. If you look at Joanna's guide you have to jump between zones a lot to maintain quests of appropriate level. Dungeons are a great change up and are nearly a full level every run as long as you collect all the available quests, as the mob XP is not where dungeon exp comes from in Classic.
---
After you hit 60 you'll be in high demand with either Priest or Druid. I had a lvl 70 priest and Druid in BC and found my Druid way more versatile and slightly more fun, but I liked healing with my Priest more. 
---
Obviously it's not a developer sanctioned crossover but these sort of trades happen off the books all the time.
---
When runescape released their 2007 servers it was huge. Players with years invested and literal mountains of gold were dumping everything for a leg up in the old school version.
---
I took a hunter out to the Barrens to camp for Humar.  I was determined to do it at level on Mannoroth.  Shadowmeld saved my butt big time.  
---
I still can't believe no one saw me sitting up there.  After I went Horde, everyone camping in that tree got taken down.  Good times.  Can't wait to do it again.
---
&gt;whether you will be able to get logged in when the login servers get smashed is another thing all together.
---
Again, the infrastructure is there these days for this to be unlikely to be a problem.
---
youll lose a bag slot. thats about it. a fully stacked ammo/arrow pouch will last forever and you can easily refill when you have to enter a town anyways. 
---
i like it actually, it gives more depth to the class even if it essentially is a small inconvenience.
---
DPM-wise you get so much out of the swp talent. I do appreciate your love for imp Mana burn tho
---
Ret can be fun in PvP though, as you say, it would involve respec's from time to time.
---
Once pet happiness is max you don’t need to feed it anymore.
---
no pet food is no problem either. once you lvled your pets happyness up it becomes very very easy to maintain.
---
If you're truly interested I've already explained in other comments why you're offbase and even showed you where to go find more independent information but I feel like you are reacting emotionally to it. I've never said anything about you personally other than that what you remember from the past is not how things are these days. Check out "reserved" groups or runs, that is the keyword people use these days when they want to play like you are describing. It's a point of contention for some people but it's a minority who feel that way. You can confirm that independently on other subs and forums. It's very similar to the breakdown between people who are for and against "loot trading" which is a current debate topic that the classic dev's have teased at possibly making it into the game. Cheers
---
&gt;they can’t say “oh, classic is making people try retail.”
---
That would be true in this scenario, where people are resubbing to get their fix in anticipation of Classic. 
---
In *your* case, subbing for the first time since Wrath and only logging onto Classic servers (one of the other metrics I mentioned), they would know why you came back. But if you're truly pessimistic, you might still expect them to misinterpret that as "we can cash in on nostalgia by half-assing a bunch of other revivals," eh? 
---
The only "unambiguous" feedback is clearly written with words. But I understand many people think giving feedback is useless if Blizzard doesn't listen to them every time. 
---
How? WoW classic is a separate game. You will start with zero gold like everyone else. I get the Wow token argument for getting free play time if you are prepared to farm gold in the current game. But as for in-game benefits, none can be acquired. 
---
To hear news about when it comes out on their front page. Seems pretty simple.
---
Every day I'm tempted to resub to BfA and give it another chance.
---
It wasn't all bad... it's just not Vanilla-WotLK that I played the most.
---
This happens in a lot of games. I remember Diablo 2 had a forum, d2jsp iirc, where you could sell/trade things for forum currency. You could then use that currency on another game on the jsp forums. Something similar could happen, as well as people just straight up trading between vanilla and retail without forum currency. 
---
I watch kargoz religiously. Yes many priest will tell you it's just as efficient to go smite until level 44 for rank 4 Mind flay which has great DPME. However a lot of good dungeons happen around early mid 50s. I'd probably only Respec for 12 levels
---
&gt; However... when they dump resources into marketing is when Activision gets involved and starts seeing dollar signs.
---
You've just described how no business in the world works.
---
Marketing isn't the trigger for parent company involvement.
---
which game and when?
---
bur and shi
---
My current plan is to level these two classes. Likely to main warlock.
---
I get how good engineering can be for PvP, solo, and DPS.  It's also good for non-healers to get a resurrection ability.   
---
 What does a raiding Holy Priest get by having Engineering?
---
I'm subbed so that I don't feel like I'm playing a pserver for free.
---
Go gnome or go home. 
---
I’m not gonna lie I’d much rather grind to 60 in vanilla than 120 in BFA. It takes roughly 60% of the time to 120 but it’s sooo tedious. Vanilla leveling is a journey.
---
Damn that’s like, at least 15 days of playtime just for the leveling and professions. I understand people who no-life the launch that will be racing to clear MC while undergeared, but that’s a step too far for me haha
---
I can’t manage that much playtime while also a student with a part-time job.
---
so thats your thing then. doesnt change the fact that hardiness &gt; wotf
---
I was wondering the same, maybe they'd see that I do not play at all while my sub is going and active and think this is to support their background work while classic is being prepared. Nope, I came to the conclusion that I'm not gonna do that because I bet they'd legit think their current iteration of WoW rocks and that's why I came back and resubbed, which is definitely not the case. Especially after seeing how primitive questionnaire they sent our recently I don't think they'd evaluate sub data this way. 
---
DWARF MASTER RACE.
---
That is true. However Cow stomp &gt; hardiness + wotf. Facts
---
You sound like a dude that needs to try Old School Runescape
---
Except dwarf priests are PvE classes, 60% of horde PvPers are undead, and locks absolutely shit on Paladins but lose to Ele shamans. 
---
Play a shaman and you have quite a bit of fun while still in healing spec.
---
Also you don't really have to respec to farm gold. Very few gold farm actually require you to slay mobs. Herbalism, mining, dungeon farms etc. is the common gold making methods for a healer.
---
Hes good but way to many bugs being abused to take this seriously, casting sleep on stealthed opponent, cannibalize while taking damage, rocket helm and sleep lasting for 20+ seconds, reflecting AOE spells etc it doesn't work like this on servers that are properly scripted. And hes dueling a mage that is wearing lvl 45-55 blues lol﻿ 
---
thats like.. your opinion. cow stomp comes far behind hardiness and wotf. do a poll on it and the vast majority of people will tell you the same.
---
It’s not gonna happen. 
---
Player A and B are both logged on to Classic, player A gives player B some gold.      
---
They both log onto retail servers and player B gives player A some gold.
---
Play what you want to play and find fun. It doesn't matter if it's the most efficient. Don't buy into min/max crap for levelling. If they want to speedrun their way to 60 as quickly as possible, that's their choice. It doesn't mean you have to.
---
If you want to play a prot spec while levelling, that's fine.
---
The thing about me is that the Classic era is about strategy, and the Live era is about twitch reactions. 
---
* In Classic, you approached NPCs based on their movement patterns and which pulls were not linked together.  In Live, you charge in, and then react to whatever ground-target AoE the NPC puts out.
---
* In Classic, your rotation is about when to open up, when to trim, and when to use utility instead.  In Live, your rotation is about how fast you react to random occurrences and adjust to the priority queue.
---
* In Classic, a healer is considering their mana first when they heal, and often has to make decisions about who isn't worth the mana.  In Live, a healer is constantly spamming to keep everyone topped off.
---
I agree that GO GO GO can quickly lead to burnout, because when you can GO GO GO through the content, it gets over too quick.
---
WTF WHY WOULD THEY DO THAT?!
---
Well not that vast majority opinion makes a fact, but yeah, I was joking...
---
Pretty sure that's not how it works.  They spawn the demon and they are the primary target.  As soon as you get aggro, it will despawn.  You cannot receive any outside help once the fight starts and the hunter who spawns the demon can be the only one on the aggro list.
---
It is a good sound track...but I prefer the sound track from Doom.
---
Both 93 and 2016.
---
I will keep taking my downvotes, I guess. The retail game is still very entertaining. I understand why people should wait to resub, so they realize that that is the reason people are back. 
---
Believe it or not Blizzard can tell how many people are playing classic vs BFA so sub now and then play classic when it comes out and if you hate BFA don't ever play again.
---
There is a hate bandwagon for the game right now but it is still very good. I have been jumping into Mythic + and just finished loremaster recently (doing all major quests).
---
Either way i respect whatever you all decide to do. 
---
Straight from blizzard- case closed. 
---
Need if you want it at all, and greed if you are indifferent.
---
There's not really any sort of system they could implement. All they can do is state it's against the rules. 
---
I understand that marketing isn't typically a trigger for parent company involvement; they should (and are) always involved. It's just that from an outsider's perspective it appears that the side of Activision-Blizzard that is focused around profit over gameplay doesn't appear to be too involved or invested in Classic WoW. This is all speculation, but I'd assume that means they haven't been dumping a boatload of resources into it, and if they were they'd be more heavily invested and want a return on that investment. (ie. More marketing means more resources means more desire to see a hefty return on that investment)
---
But I am sure you were able to put that together yourself, guess I just felt like typing it for my own sake.
---
For sure it's a false dichotomy and overly simplified. None of us know for sure what's going on. What are your thoughts if you care to speculate?
---
Better?  Probably not.  Doable?  Probably.
---
I know in TBC I had a lot of fun alternating SoL+JoW and SoW+JoL, with about 6+ mobs wailing on me at a time and doing nothing.  But in TBC consecration was baseline and Holy Shield was better.
---
well not that i said somewhere that something subjective as a racial can be fact.
---
cheers
---
If it has spirit it is completely fine to do so pre-60.
---
I remember a time when no one had any fucking clue what to do or build or talents to get. It was the Wild West and anything went. Warriors stacking intellect to level skills faster and rogues in full spirit gear. Druids going full str gear to get better (non-shapeshift) autos. Priests needing on strength wands “just in case”. Paladins wearing cloth healing gear (actually not a bad thing sometimes lol). Hunters losing their pets because they ran out of meat. Warlocks dying to mobs their level trying to farm soul shards after running out. Shamans using totems.
---
God, I miss all that. It’s hilarious looking back, but at the time it felt like a million people all grinning ear-to-ear while whacking a piñata filled with who the fuck knows.
---
Agreed lol. Not sure what is so hard about this for people to grasp. I'm pretty sure the people arguing it are using fake scenarios in their head and not speaking from experience
---
Dead horse will start beating back soon.
---
ofc
---
If a piece of gear enhances the role you are filling in the current group, you can absolutely role on it. Druid, shaman, and paladins would have maybe 50% of the options necessary to advance their gear than other classes. And besides, you're healing, AC is a low priority stat when it comes to instance healing gear.
---
Yea, in the end it's all about the $$$
---
Same here. It's not even about my fear for Blizzard taking it down, it's the fear about the servers state. Will pay to win suddenly be introduced? Shady business? Those kind of those happens to most pservers. And when Blizzard announced Classic I knew I'd jump on their servers, so it gave a time limit on how long I'd be on any pserver before starting all over.
---
aye cheers have a nice friday
---
It's funny how similar that is to my experience! Did my 1-60 on nost at around 18h/day. So much fun though!
---
then we can progress to cataclysm right?
---
Sure, but to have that happen player A has to have farmed the gold in classic WoW first. Your point is valid but the eco-systems are not directly linked. No player when the servers open on day one can get gold that does not yet exist.
---
Just use noggenfogger or a savory deviate delight to bring yourself up to a normal size. It's fine.
---
No idea, it’s weird because I’ve never heard anyone talk about the changes like this
---
I want to roll a priest that will end up as Holy at 60. What professions should I go after? The most popular suggestions have been tailoring for gear creation and then enchanting as well. Will I be poor? Can I hold off on spending money on professions until after I have my 40 mount? If not enchanting then what is a popular alternative? 
---
Not if you have friends 
---
Um yes? Not everyone is going to raid consistently and rank 10 gear is very good for pvp. Has stam int and spell damage/crit. U gonna come back and list me a bunch of bis items? Dude said he loves pvp so I assume a lot of his time will be in pvp which offers probably the best gear outside of raids for locks. 
---
Yea that's part of what I mean. They aren't an after thought. You aren't in WC because you want to be in some raid. The point of it isn't to just farm it for gear. Raiders and Hard Cores see dungeon content like that so they always want it nerfed and stream lined. Thats why modern dungeons sucks. Thats why the modern game sucks. The entire thing is just a stream lined set up to dump you into raiding because they think thats the end all be all. Hence why they thought raid finder was necessary to make it more available.
---
Ahfuck private server brain took over
---
That’s not how it works. You can FD or run away to reset it, and then all you need is another hunter in your group that solo kills it. 
---
[Proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkd9Uezjb3s)
---
My friend. You speak the truth.
---
How did you manage to play that often? 
---
False. You need to feed it every couple hours as well as every time it dies. 
---
I like the fight where he uses a sword and shield and kill another warrior by critting and kiting him while the dots killed him. To do so he has to stay between like 8-10 yards or something to avoid intercept and piercing howl. Super skilled.
---
Ofc it's ok if it's a HEALING item. But if it's a spelldamage item then no, you should not do that.
---
I do. If a mage needs on krol blade but I’m a rogue and can use it right now id be pissed. 
---
Doesn't that just do the same thing as /train?
---
IMO marijuana is necessary for long grinds. Without it, I’m bored after an hour and never hit level cap. 
---
Absolu-fucking-luteley lol. 
---
I don’t see it that way. If that boe is an upgrade for me I’m using it not selling it. I’d be pissed if a mage took my rogue upgrade just so they could sell it later. 
---
I think about vanilla progression like this. 
---
There is a progression curve from green items to dungeon blues to raid epics. And within raids you have T1 T2 T3 and other stuff like later dungeon blues and resistance gear. But without getting too complicated, progression in vanilla was CLEAR and DEFINED and OUTLINED. Your path was before you. 
---
The more time you spend progressing, the faster you will ascend. But it's perfectly fine to take your time. You will still be able to get good dungeon blues and make your character strong enough to contend with people in pvp and pve even if you never raid, but casually raiding can over time give you access to more good gear and you can eventually become even more powerful. Super hardcore pvp and pve bleeding edge is different. They gear up faster, but all of the gear in vanilla is there, you just have to go get it. Go grind the rep in AV to get unstoppable force, go run that dungeon until that super good item drops etc. It's not like in modern WoW. The items are set and the ways to get them are set, so there's nothing random about it. You can set goals and work towards them. Even as a super casual, you can still have goals and work towards them! That's what's so awesome about vanilla. People say its a game only for hardcore players, but even if it takes you 6 months to level to 60, that is still progress and fun and now you're 60. You won't suddenly lose your 60 that you've worked so much on, and the same goes for gear. In the modern WoW, you have to constantly grind like a hamster on a treadmill or just get random titanforged gear that invalidates all your achievements. In Classic, you will permanently have the achievements you've earned like level 60 and your Tier 0.5 dungeon set or arcanite reaper or whatever. It will be yours when you get it, so even casuallly you can play and enjoy the shit out of the game. And I would say as a casual raider you could do MC ZG AQ20 easily and the gear in there is still nice.
---
Nothing to add other than you're 100% right. Loot trading is a "solution" to a non-problem that just creates massive problems. 
---
If Activision doesn't want to pay for GMs, that's fine, just tell people loot is final and move on.
---
If a lock and a Paladin greed a Krol blade and a Mage needs it, I’d be pissed. Better off needing on everything and then sorting it out with the person who wins. If they’re unreasonable, it doesn’t matter — you would have gotten screwed anyway. If they’re reasonable, maybe they’ll give it to you or let you buy it cheap.
---
This post assumes that everyone that is going to play Classic was a hardcore raider in vanilla or played private servers. This is not the case. I didn’t raid seriously until BC, and only really saw MC, ZG and some BWL in vanilla. Also, this was all over a decade ago, and I’ve forgotten most of the mechanics other than the really memorable ones like the living bomb in MC.
---
I want the chance to experience the vanilla raids as they were, and so do others like me, as well as people that never played vanilla at all. Keep in mind that this subreddit is a tiny slice of the people that will actually play Classic, and probably not a representative one. Leave it alone. Luckily there is about a 0% chance that Blizz will mess with boss mechanics, at least at launch, so it’s a purely academic discussion.
---
I was in my last year of high school and didn't care to much about my grades, great fun! Plan on doing the same if I can this summer, but then go down in playtime real fast after the first week.
---
I know it sounds like a lot but it's not that hard if you quit everything else.
---
Why is this so downvoted lol, sounds kinda hilarious to me
---
I'll happily admit that I paid some russian 30bucks to get me to 120 over a single night.
---
At that time I had leveled three characters already and i really just wanted to figure out if said character would spark my interest in keeping on playing. Needless to say it didn't :D
---
Ultimately it's all about personal priorities. What's worth more, being able to play what you want faster. Or have 30bucks in your pocket? To me - at that time - it was the later.
---
You can avoid having to downrank by rolling paladin though.
---
Or you sort it out before anyone rolls. Tbh I’ve never seen people outright need on boe’s before. Not in vanilla and not on pservers. I got krol blade in a run because I could use it right then and everyone passed. 
---
Man I’m torn between pala ( my main since actual vanilla) and mage ( great fun for me, lots of utility). Probably end up levelling both being such an altholic
---
Why does the community you speak of suddenly disappear because of loot trading?        
---
You make it seem like everyone and their mother is gonna scam loot away from you, all because it's possible for them to.         
---
That's en extremely pessimistic view of the community.        
---
The community will definitely be able to, as you put it "police itself", especially with blacklist addons and server reputation.         
---
Unlike the seemingly popular opinion on this sub; most people don't become dicks purely because they can.
---
I haven't been subb'd to retail WoW in 5 years - why pay for a product that sucks? Until they actually release Classic, I have no reason to think about giving them any more $$.
---
Are you guys willing to make the loot table and BiS list public?
---
I'm sure it would help a lot of people out.
---
Man, fuck that. I'm an irl woman and I'm going male dwarf. The weebs can have their mailbox dancers to themselves.
---
If that cloth gear has Mana/5 on it and plus healing, hell yes I'm going to mash that Need button (assuming my gear isn't already better).
---
There's a "class trial" option now though I don't know if it was updated for BFA. Didn't need to pay 30 bucks...
---
The only problem with arrows and pet food is when you forget to pick them up while in town then hop on a flight path to the middle of nowhere. So annoying.
---
u2
---
Why not bother with lotus?
---
?? They give 10 or 15% more attack speed and you're mostly doing white damage the whole time while leveling? What am I missing?
---
You will have the top zones to yourself for a couple days. Use the time to stockpile herbs, thorium, etc. Un'goro is not a top level zone so you will have company if you want to farm Devilsaurs.
---
Please Blizzard, please just let loot be final. The World used to have some sense of consequence attached to things — the trademark of Vanilla’s greatness. Like OP said, don’t try to “solve” a non-problem and dilute a core aspect of Vanilla gameplay in the process.
---
I plan on playing a lock, got any extra tips for my class to farm early? :)
---
It might pay for OP to learn the locations of the graveyards beforehand and pick places close to graveyards to grind at.
---
&gt;Think to self
---
Why did that hunter spend all his DKP on *my* [Deep Earth Spaudlers](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18829).  Who even uses SP on their serpent sting...
---
*Feelsbadman.jpeg*
---
+healing and +spell damage are different stats.  A +healing item is for the healer, +damage for caster dps, spirit items are also for heals.
---
Gotta earn hate here, but I think wotlk music was better :|
---
This, I had a blast priest-healing in AV. People love you for it.
---
&gt; I love ~~waking up early in the morning~~ *staying up late at night*, grabbing ~~coffee~~ *beer* and logging in and doing quests!
---
It's funny how this game brings us all together.  Brings a tear to my eye.
---
This isn't even a realistic expectation. 
---
1) Rogues excel in World PvP over things like Duels or BG's where they can dictate the terms of engagement.  (this is their strength at heart, but in terms of where it's most valuable World PvP&gt;BG's&gt;Duels.)
---
2) It's a 5 minute rogue.  He's burning all cooldowns and trinkets.  If you want to talk about overpowered cooldown centric builds/classes, the 3 minute mage is actually more of a problem than a 5-minute rogue.
---
Unless you REALLY love playing the AH I would think just spend that time working a part time job. Can't buy beer with wow tokens.
---
It does but you get several lines of text which spams the chat. 
---
I almost did this just to solo all of the content that I could, up until an expansion purchase was required and then waiting until that expansion was free. I know it’s stupid, but I’m mostly curious to see how the games has changed, first hand.
---
It feels like having a best friend who you grew up with since you were a kid, that cut everyone out of their life after high school, started getting into shady shit, and ended up homeless. You still care about them, you wanna know what they’re up to, but keep your distance because you know it’s not good for either of you to try to rekindle that friendship now. It’s too late.
---
So I decided that I’ll only do that AFTER Classic, when I wanna play WoW, but not get ahead of my friends who I’ll be leveling up with. Although, I doubt that’ll even pan out because we’re all hyped to play regularly enough.
---
To be honest, I kind of preferred having kill and gather quests over every quest being a scripted mess of quasi-cutscenes as you watch characters walk around dramatically and say things and stupid doodads you have to click on in your inventory to activate the goblin pop-culture-joke-o-matic that you need to complete the quest.
---
With the old questing style I can put on a playlist with some nice headphones, sip a nice drink, and just relax killing some boars. I’m actually looking forward to this quite a bit, it’s a great stress reliever.
---
I value my guildmate over random players so I will always roll items for my lads and most people will do the same. It just makes sense since I know for sure I will be playing with the guy more often. If you had the option to give a bonus roll to your friends and vice versa why wouldn't you do it? No one will be blacklisted for that because it will be common practice. That's what loot trading will do to the game.
---
Leveling a druid in Teldrassil was quite a bit different experience than leveling an undead warlock in Tristfal Glades and killing rotting undead and poisoning a dwarf prisoner in the inn cellar lol.
---
I thought I remembered it not making anything in the chat log. I could be wrong though.
---
Well, your survivability is sure a ton better than a ret spec Paladin.
---
You'll do fine damage (not as much as a DPS of course) by going full Prot due to Precision, Reckoning, Blessing of Sanctuary, etc. Once you get Holy Shield you'll really add up damage vs. non-casters.
---
Go Holy for Consecration first if you wish to AoE. If you just want to keep going without drinking/eating you can go full Prot and laugh at an enemy's attempts at actually dealing damage to you.
---
As far as I know it did this. Could be wrong also :p
---
False. In “true Vanilla” I had a hunter kill the Un’goro demon for me because he was specced survival and you needed to fight it at close range. I tipped him a small amount. For the rest of the demons, I had my brother (a priest) cast a shield on me before pulling the demons, and it never caused a problem. It would only reset if he directly healed me during the encounter. 
---
Once, I brought the Wintergrasp demon all the way down to 5%. A dwarf hunter saw me and stood by until it was at 2%. Then he shot it to reset it.
---
Those are my Vanilla memories of how it worked. 
---
Spirt is an interesting question. I used to just pass +spirit gear to the healers when playing mage or lock. However on the last few leveling playthroughs I've been going Imp Drain Soul and Mediation respectively and have become enamored with stacking spirit. It's an incredibly powerful stat even when you don't spec for it, and when you do it's amazing. However as an expendable dps I really don't want to get blackballed by healers. How does rolling on spirit cloth as a mage/lock sit with healers?
---
They are, bringing a feral (at least alliance side) is optimal, get over it.
---
My shockadin build tho :(
---
I would say they are both the place to be. Hop over to VanillaFriends and enter your info, then swing over to Barrens.chat (we have an image link on our homepage) and talk it up with the community. /u/Teeb has put a lot of work into his site and it shows. There is also a great resource for icons and old data from classic. Check them both out!
---
I can't speak to anyone elses experience but, from what I saw when I was on Nost, Emerald Dream, and Warsong. Was that while Shamans are fairly common. People that choose to progression raid with one are not. Most shamans bouncing around burn out pretty early when they realize lolfury is a meme. Not a powerful spec. Unless your a warrior lol.
---
This. I played classic every day and never heard of anyone petitioning a gm to fix a loot problem. Had no idea that was an option. 
---
&gt;abusing battlegrounds
---
dumb.
---
&gt;Made pvp hell for everyone
---
1 Premade that only ran the first 3 months of Nost made pvp "hell for everyone." Right. 
---
&gt; he always had 2 or 3 healers behind him. 
---
That's called a premade. 
---
Hell nah
---
You ever come across someone in World PvP kicking the shit out of a friendly, and you at 40 yards away start healing him back up to full?
---
Feeels good man.  Healing in general is super OP situationally.
---
It does! The site design is amazingly Blizzard in the 90s. Nostalgic af.
---
Right after warriors and mages
---
FYI if you have a bow you will want to buy a quiver and with a gun you need an ammo pouch. You lose a bag slot but they hold more than your average bag and increase your auto attack speed. 
---
If its EU related I can add it. Whats tough is I am NA (USA) and I dont speak German, French, Brazilian, Spanish, etc....so I would not be able to provide much support to anyone who maybe only speaks those languages. If you would like me to add this server to the EU side, I am more than willing to!
---
not resubbing till official TBC, been burned out on classic since playing on nostalrius and every vanilla ps since.
---
I'm actually considering a similar thing. Priest or mage. I do prefer healing but I can't play as much as I used to but I still want to do everything there is to do. I think if you're in spot like this, picking mage is much better since the class is just so stupidly time efficient compared to others and usually a welcome addition in groups.
---
If it isn't a BiS upgrade for the dps and it is an upgrade for the healer it is absolutely okay to take a spell damage item because they always have healing on them too. The fact of the matter is that there is almost no healing plate, slightly more healing mail, a decent amount of healing leather. The meme of paladins wearing dresses is very accurate, cloth is going to be worn by EVERY healer.
---
A pally is great in world pvp, it just takes forever to kill anything as you auto attack between flash of light. 
---
Well yes and no. Halwin created the google doc, then we spiced it up a little and have added 8000 unique entries to it since then. Its a little more than a google doc now.
---
Thats awesome!
---
This, 
---
The people who are really into "World of Economicrafts" their character build is mostly irrelevant as they just play the market. Similar to Diablo 2 or Path of Exile, fastest way to make money is just by trading and playing the market.
---
I am anti-loot trading, ill preface my comment with that.
---
But abusing loot trading isnt wholly different than ninja looting or needing BOE items (when you dont) or any other negative behavior.  If you get a reputation of doing it, people won't group with you.  The community in vanilla policed this type of activity, why is it any different now.
---
Battlestar Galactica on monitor two has me covered for 57 hours... what to do with the other 53?
---
Dragon Ball Super is good for 42 hours... maybe that?
---
You can technically put multiple guilds, but I would recommend sticking with 1 or 2. If you need to make an update to your entry toss us an email and we can get it updated for you!
---
There are no +spell damage items aside from specific schools like +fire damage or +frost damage. All spell damage items also offer the same amount of + healing. +healing exclusive items just have more healing on them for the same item level. 
---
We are in constant talks with the Mods here and completely understand their stance on not stickying the site. We are still in the Wiki and get plenty of exposure organically. The mods here have done a lot for us behind the scenes and we are very thankful!
---
/salute at TotalBiscuit.  
---
I dont believe this will be the case.  You know, you could have done this since the beginning of wow and GMs would have happily transfered the item if you submitted a ticket, yet noone did.  All that will happen is people will learn not to group with your guild.
---
First, it's a shame you're so downvoted, because even though I may very much disagree with your opinions, they are well presented and a great topic for discussion.
---
Having said that, I agree with the other poster who wrote "The entire point of classic WoW is to "turn back time and play the game like it was 14 years ago."  I think the most important thing Blizzard can do right now is provide that *exact* experience, for better or for worse, for the people who have been lusting after it for years.
---
Now, moving forward, I do see the appeal of what you are suggesting!  I think the idea of a "Classic+" server is quite intriguing, and if I'm being honest I would certainly give one a try.  But it would need to be separate servers.  They would need a safe sandbox to test out raid rebalancing, new mechanics, class changes without stepping on the feet of people who ***really*** just want to play the game they remember.  And trying to accomplish "Classic+" at launch would just be too big of a task.
---
For starters, the game needs to err on the side of hardline no-changes as closely as possible.  Perhaps 1, 2 or 3 years out, the notion of a Classic+ Server might be received with open arms.  Or perhaps folks would rather just stay in Vanilla forever.  Or maybe they'd want to move on to TBC and later WotLK.  There's a million and one different ways it could shake out, and right now all of those options are hypotheticals that are contingent upon a successful launch and a healthy player base a year or three from now.  And the best way to ensure that in the meantime is to avoid ideas like this.
---
Basically, I personally like your idea... but doing it right now would kill the game before it was ever born.
---
It's not the kind of thing I would brag about. Does anyone actually care that I reached level 27 (or whatever?) 
---
Nah it's not by default but advantage is huge for warriors. I beat the top geared top ranked warrior on our server in a 1v1 duel on my rogue in worse gear over a bet for mats on the AH.
---
What you need to do is use deadly and crippling poison, open with garrote and drop a rupture on him. Then you kite in their dead range zone until you can re-enter stealth. Let all 3 of the dots tick down, then repeat.
---
You repeat this over and over until you get them low enough that you can out burst them, then you go full 1v1 duel versus them. You will last all of 3 seconds so you have to get them really low.
---
The only way for them to remove you from dead zone is to use their fear, run out out of dead zone, and charge/intercept on you. Be ready to trinket fear/WotF fear and vanish.
---
If you get deep wounded don't panic, just kite, wait for a tick, enter stealth and immediately open again. Blind is helpful in this situation.
---
You can sub out garrote for cheapshot but this guy as an Orc and if you missed CS you basically set yourself so far back you already lost. However sometimes it's worth a gamble depending on the circumstances and cooldowns.
---
Gouge is useful but it'll break almost immediately, however you just want to use it create just enough space to get into kite range, so it's useful.
---
Make sure you're always approach from behind to force them to turn around to get white hits in. Sometimes you get lucky and they don't spin fast enough or it just doesn't register, and you can get your dots up and away without being touched, but don't bank on it.
---
Always use evasion when you decide to burst. Better to eat over-power and dodge everything else.
---
Anyways, this was so long ago I'm sure I'm missing some of the finer details but this is the gist of it. 
---
Really you only need Tailoring until you get the truefaith vestments. It's BiS for quite a while and since it's BoP you only need to craft it once. Then you can change professions if you want. People usually suggest enchanting as a second profession because you can disenchant gear along the way. If you know you will switch out tailoring though, then you can probably just grab a gathering profession while leveling.
---
Yeah, to be honest I havent tug into much of the discussion, I have only been to the pages where he explains how he built it and the content involved. Its very impressive and 100% nostalgic!
---
My wife is casual player, she seems agreeable to levelling a hunter or lock with my pala, while she isn’t on I’ll level the mage on my own. That might work, it would be six months before we hit cap, but who’s counting let’s have a blast 
---
The main issue with new economy money making is the lack of raw gold, Your best bet is trying to find something low to mid price range which *most* of the people who rush to 60 will need
---
Buff consumables and the mats for consumable engineering items come to mind
---
Everyone hates on the turtle fucker
---
Well if it's edgemasters then that's a no brainier
---
So I think it is situationally dependent. In a dungeon, if you’re the healer, and an item drops that’s gonna make you a better healer, it’s yours. Period. There should be no debate. If you’re a paladin healing, and a green cloth armor piece with +healing drops it’s yours unless you don’t want it. The shadow priest and druid in the group who are dpsing can cry all they want, but if they wanted healing gear in a dungeon, then heal for it. That’s how I think about it at least. 
---
In a raid it’s all about optimized stats. If a leather piece with a crazy amount of spirit drops, I don’t care if a shaman or a paladin want it (if they know their class, they shouldn’t want it). That’s a druid piece. A cloth piece with crazy high plus healing helps everyone. So that’s trickier - as a raid lead I’d probably give it to my best / most dependable healer (probably a priest, maybe a paladin). But that’s a different conversation about distributing raid gear, and different people do different things.

I plan on having my alt 60 rogue within the first month of release (playing my rogue when solo, shaman main with my group) to pickpocket and build up enough capital to start buying out highly sought after items and trade goods in bulk.  Most DM farming strats rely on selling herbs en masse, but if no one is buying, no one is making money either. Need to play the vendor market before people start looking to buy goods.
---
Start stockpiling highly valued items like arcane crystals, felcloth, elemental earth/fire, essence of water/earth/fire, etc.
---
When enough gold enters ciruculation, then the server economy starts turning into a seller's market where prices will start rising.  I expect within ~4-7 weeks this will happen when a lot of players start hitting 60.
---
So you think herb then?
---
30/0/21 is a fantastic PvP spec but isn’t optimal for PvE. Casual guilds might not care / might not notice. Any top guild and you need to eat that respec cost. 
---
Pretty sure? Well I'm 100% sure I did this on retail vanilla. I'm telling you I did it multiple times. I killed demons after finishing the quest on my hunter with BWL gear.
---
You didn't try what I'm talking about. You tried helping a hunter who had threat. What I am telling you is that the hunter has proximity aggro, but zero threat. (**It is the same as if you walk near a mob to aggro by proximity, but your party member immediately starts dpsing and kills the mob while you do nothing.**) The geared hunter can kill the demon so long as the hunter with incomplete quest does nothing.
---
Yeah I played druid in BC and loved it but they felt so good in BC all spec were viable and Druid heals was one of the best in the game for PvP and PvE. In Vanilla I remember priests being god tier for healing and it's the only class I've never played to max level. I've never even started a priest.
---
At least they’re gnot gnelves
---
When you got an organization moving from private server to privater server, forcing the system to work for you and only for you, also in cooperation with other peoples (TRADE WINS), that is abusing and you are ruining endgame to everyone else. This kind of thing go beyond fun/premade, it is called MAFIA.
---
Possibly, Although selling the actual consumables (Potions, Food) instead of the raw materials *might* give a little more profit
---
At the very least mining should be a solid choice for a long time due to the demand in metals/stone
---
For Progression, its naturally not as strong as full blown resto shaman, but for MC and Ony it should be fine.
---
I'm rolling a similar spec, just be sure to have both a normal damage/pvp set and your healer set with a focus on mp/5 and +heals
---
&gt; you could kill like 6-7 mobs at once
---
You can kill 6 enemies in the time it takes a ret to kill one enemy six (or more) times.
---
Even if they hire GMs I'd prefer they spent their time doing something else - another vote for loot is final.
---
Too me yes, just like warriors will roll on leather and post 40 mail gear if it's an upgrade. Vanilla didn't have the itemization that later xpacs did. An upgrade is an upgrade regardless of armor class if you can use it.
---
If I'm healing a dungeon and a healing item drops, I don't think anyone should be rolling on it except me if I need it.  I would consider it incredibly unfair to roll need on an item if you're not using that spec during that dungeon.  I'd be pretty pissed if I was healing a dungeon and a cloth robe dropped that was an upgrade for me and a shaman rolled need for "When I heal later." 
---
I personally wanted to shoot myself in the head whenever I tried to do any sort of solo pve on my paladin. My best in slot heal set, no matter the current tier, was almost always entirely cloth and leather pieces. You also have no spell damage because all of your gear is only +healing and mp5. So you are squish as fuck (literally having to heal yourself every other auto if fighting 2-3 at level mobs), do negligible consecration damage, and even with best in slot mp5, you will oom EVERY PACK you try to kill. Don't even think of trying to pull more for the sake of speed either, see the squish section. You won't even get the chance to auto as you oom yourself trying to maintain consecration in between spamming heal to desperately survive.
---
The flip side is that if you get a friend like a mage, you can aoe farm quite effectively. Righteous fury keeps aggro on you and blizzard will kill them before you oom. Free water as well. But no, solo is not even remotely fun as a healer.
---
Yo Dawg,
---
I heard you want to be a force multiplier in PvP.
---
Try an Ele Shaman.  Troll and Orc can use all mounts and have solid cast animations, Tauren have an extra stun.
---
Eithey way, go  Horde.  There will likely be far more alliance players for Classic, so plenty of Wpvp action available to you.
---
One of the things I’m going to chill out about in Classic is the race thing.  I’m not going to hate on gnomes, because I shouldn’t be hating on anyone.  
---
Yep.
---
What they need to understand is that this is a time where cooler heads prevail. We have our shit together and can think logically about these issues in advance.
---
Because by the time we're actually playing Classic we'll all be in full savage no-life addict mode and rage about everything imaginable. They can't take our words at face value during this time.
---
We will become monsters who hiss at the sunlight.
---
Generally speaking you should be fine.  Disclaimer: Most guilds will take about 8 shaman in 40 man raids if they can. (1 per group).  Roughly speaking you'll need \~4 of those pure resto for mana tide talent alone.  There's a little leeway on the other 4 shaman in a 40 man raid. (i.e. Gear/talents/playstyle/raid rules can dictate what builds your guild brings along).  At the end of the day, you're there for your totems and OOC rez/raid wipe prevention. 
---
Some guilds will hardline dictate only resto.  Some will allow 1 enchancement shaman to buff melee.  Others will allow hybrid specs (like yours) to either heal or DPS as long as it isn't holding the raid back or there's a clear lack of healers.  
---
It's too hard to really say since a lot of what you play is contingent on who you play with as a shaman.  Wish I could give you a better answer.  :/
---
No Resub Till Brooklyn.
---
I'm not a hunter, I was just listing stuff that isn't used in raids because of the 8 debuff thing.  You're the one that apparently knows everything so you figure it out.
---
I agree with what everyone else said. Pre-pull bubbles gimp the tank's ability to build threat and makes the pull more chaotic (other group members will start dpsing, they'll pull aggro, mobs running everywhere, tank can't build threat at all now because everything's out of range running around, etc).
---
As boring and low-effort as it is, you really shouldn't do anything at all as the healer until the tank's HP dips below half during a pull. A HoT is probably ok, but only after they've definitely hit every mob in the pull, or it'll just peel right off them and onto you, which is bad for both the healer and the tank. Overall, it's better to just watch and wait until healing is actually necessary imo. The more time you spend outside the Five Second Rule the better, too, for mana regen. So it's really better to just burst-heal when necessary and then wait until it's necessary again.
---
I wish Prayer of Mending was a thing in vanilla. It was definitely the spiritual successor to pre-pull bubbling and just superior in every way. Pretty sure the self-heal from it even adds to the tank's threat as if they healed themselves, so not only does it not rage-starve them at the beginning of a pull, it even bumps their threat up more. Alas.
---
I'm glad they are adding it.  It's way better than asking a person to manually do it for us, and it's a service the game needs.
---
loot issues don't happen often in terms of an individual, but when you factor that it's meant to service the entire community, there are always people who need a loot issue resolved.  It's a service we always had even back in vanilla, and automating it won't destroy the fabric of the game, personally I think it makes it better, but that is beside the point.
---
The main difference is there will be a little more ninja looting, and less time waiting for a GM to manually resolve your issue.  This doesn't even factor into my gaming experience, and it's convenient that if there IS an issue it can be quickly resolved.
---
I've never heard of gm that gave back ninja loot. It's not a gm's job and it shouldn't be. It's just part of community experience and it would be a pain in the ass in some cases to actually decide if it was a ninja or not. 
---
As to the guild point, no one wants to play with randoms if you can do stuff with the guild. I don't see a world where guildmates wouldn't favor their pals over pugs. There might be some cases but most people think like me or will be pressured to roll loot for their guildies anyways.
---
Thanks man I might level a Ele Shaman for my 2nd char
---
&gt; I think the more likely outcome is that once classic hits it's peak, probably 2-3 years, someone will open another blizzlike private server and everyone will move there for a "fresh start".
---
What's to stop Blizzard from recognizing this trend and, in addition to the standby, persistent servers, offering a rotating suite of "Seasonal Servers" with 1-year (or whatever) lifespans before they all get reset?
---
Well I suck and have played through alliance once lol
---
Because while it's a rare ingredient used for flasks: the recipes themselves are even rarer.  Rushing to 60 to farm an ingredient literally no-one needs?  Sure you can hoard them and try to bide your time and try to sell them later it's generally not a smart idea to farm something no-one needs at the moment.  It's a similar premise as to what restaurants do. They only stockpile enough food for 2-4 days.  Just enough to keep from running out, but not enough that if they don't use it it's going to go bad. 
---
If noone has the flask recipes, then noone is going to be needing the black lotus.
---
Maybe "World of WarEconomy" would be a better turn of phrase than "World of Economicrafts?"
---
Wait a month and get ganked 24/7 by lvl ?? Dbags roaming.

Hmm he looks familiar. Are you sure that hes gnot a gnelf?
---
Most guild will expect you to drop Mana Tide. 
---
They have metrics to determine if their subscribers are playing Classic or not. If you're actually enjoying BFA, by all means feel free to stay subbed and play Classic when it's out.
---
WE HAVE TO GO BACK
---
Im saying you could have rolled need on any item (even if you didnt need) then had a gm transfer it to any other player who was in the run with you.  Its not like loot was final in vanilla.  And you are correct, people prefer guild runs.  But you cant always do guild runs for every little tjing , and if you make a habit of cheating people out of loot, people wont group with you.
---
Indeed it do

Part 937929993788993995
---
I think that mentality is part of the problem. Despite you being in a guild with the other player, rolling on items that you can't use so that you can give the item to a guildie that can use it gives you an unfair advantage over the other players in the group. Blizz created the game with two roll options: need and greed. They didn't include the third roll option: being a dick.
---
At the end of the day, despite being in a guild, in dungeons its every player for themselves, there should be no unfair advantages provided to select players who decide to collude together to game the system.
---
I should not have laughed as hard as I did.

Wouldn’t be blizzard without creating a ton of problems from one non issue. This is why nobody would want them to continue building on classic..they are idiots!
---
What items do you suggest to farm first then?
---
What do you suggest farming at first then?
---
Why would a mage partner with a paladin for AOE grinding though? Does the pally bring something to the table that justifies cutting the mage's gp/hour in half?
---
&gt; That's what loot trading will do to the game.
---
Nah dude, that's what you and your lads will do to the game, not loot trading.     
---
Your way of thinking, or at least as i understand it, is gonna pay more of a role in the game going to shit because of loot trading, rather than loot trading itself.     
---
"Everyone else does it" is an excuse for people who wanted to do it from the start.
---
And no, i wouldn't roll for stuff i don't need if i'm in a pug, even if i have friends with me, because i'm not an ass.
---
Go for a reserved run if you feel the need to give someone a 'bonus roll'.

Buy gametime with gold now while it's cheap. It's going to spike hard when Classic launches.
---
I have played healer since vanilla up to mop. Cleared the majority of raid content and playing &gt;2.5k arena in all brackets with both pala, priest and shaman. 
---
I would argue raiding is one of the more boring aspects of being a healer. Raids are all about mana efficiency leaving you will a narrow set of abilities. There is no consequence of your activity, i.e you can go afk for 30 sec and the raid will generally be fine.
---
In battlegrounds, a good healer can carry the entire group and shift the outcome of skirmishes (and no, you do not need to queue up with someone specific, but identifying good players in the countdown and sticking to them in the start is helpful). You will get tons of appraisal and gratitute if playing well. While a pala in raid will try to only use flash of light, you will try to use the entire range of abilities. From breaking CC with blessing of sacrifice to freedoming the flag carrier to save the day.
---
I could keep going, but feel free to ask me anything and I will try to answer. :)
---
When you say roll for guildies, do you mean like a priest rolling plate for a warrior, or two warriors sharing rolls? In the former case people will definitely treat it like ninja looting, you'll get kicked from the group the first time you try it. They don't even have to know you're trading it to your friend, they'll just see someone taking loot they shouldn't.
---
It's only really the second case that's an issue. That's where people can't tell the difference between a legit roll and a roll to give to a friend.

---
The ideal raiding composition has 8 shamans due to totems being party limited.  The only real loss from that build is mana tide totem.  Typically there are 4 melee groups and 4 caster groups, so at least 4 mana tide totems are "mandatory", more are preferable.  You can definitely heal with that spec\*, just make sure it's cool with your RL, and don't be surprised if they ask you to respec.

---
Aside from friendship (and doing a healer a solid as a dps so they can get a faster PUG by bringing heals), yes. By the paladin holding 8-10 mobs on him (spamming flash of light like it's that MF'in like button) The mage can kill them with a single blizzard, maybe + a cone of cold. It takes less brain power on their part and is far more mana efficient. You can clear 3+ packs, safely, per oom vs 1-2 in the danger zone per oom.

The community wouldn’t disappear. That’s not what he said. He said it would poison the community and it’s antithetical to what vanilla wow stands for. I think it’s laughable you think people won’t be dicks. Have you played the game ever? Sure there are lots of good people but there exists a huge population of losers too. People will use this to screw people over at a high enough rate. It’s a poison pill all the way.
---
Indeed, so they can see me staying unsubbed for 8 years very clearly.
---
Hell, you could even get creative and offer summoning services to guilds and groups in kargath as horde needs to take a long FP to get there.
---
Yup! 
---
I'm not resubbing until the day before or during classic comes out
---
From CM Kaivax:
---
&gt;Hello Classic enthusiasts! We’ve been following the discussions about Classic closely here on the forums (and elsewhere) throughout the winter, and wanted to give you an update on a few things that the Classic development team has worked through since BlizzCon and the Classic demo.
---
&gt;The feedback we got from the demo was fantastic. Thank you to everyone who gave us so much feedback to work with, especially the community members who compiled lists of issues that people found with the demo. We’ve looked at everything that was reported, and want to share a few anecdotes with you so you can see how we’re tackling these issues.
---
&gt;One thing many players noticed was the incorrect health regeneration and the spell critical hit multiplier. Good catch! Going into the demo, we thought we’d fixed that and were surprised to see the issue crop up. Before BlizzCon, we specifically checked health and mana regeneration, and fixed the critical hit cases. We also did combat and regeneration tests to make sure we had those accurate.
---
&gt;It turns out that there was a discrepancy between how Classic was configured on our environment at the office (correct!) and the environment serving the demo to you (not correct…). Tracking that down taught us how to best check our environment configuration as we prepare it for launch.
---
&gt;Another issue players reported was that Warlock demon summoning was broken – lots of players said that you shouldn’t lose your current demon until the new one appears. We double-checked and in the original 1.12 WoW, and there, as soon as you started summoning a new demon, your existing demon disappeared. So the demo actually matched how the game played originally. There were a few other reports – such as “rare mobs do way less damage” and “Kobolds at Jangolode Mine run faster than walking speed when running away” – where we were able to confirm that the gameplay was the same in the demo as in the original 1.12 WoW.
---
&gt;It’s important to point out that there are some bugs we’re going to fix before launch, and there are some bugs that we don’t intend to address. As we mentioned in our BlizzCon presentation, some differences aren’t worth fixing, like differences in how the mail works. Nonetheless, we’ve fixed some fairly high-priority issues:
---
&gt;- Critical Strike rating: Each item now “Improves your chance to get a critical strike by X%.”
---
&gt;- Rogue Energy didn’t work right: it was both benefiting from melee haste and re-calculating more often than it was supposed to. Both issues were fixed.
---
&gt;- Slow Fall no longer applies to your jumps.
---
&gt;- You again get pushback when hit by ranged attacks and wands.
---
&gt;- Dodge, Parry, and Miss were all not happening often enough.
---
&gt;That’s not all we’ve done, of course, but we want to give you an idea of what we’re prioritizing: core game systems, combat, and content. We’ve spent time on other things such as user interface and making sure graphics “feel” like they used to, but our primary focus is on gameplay.
---
&gt;Again, we’re following all of your discussions and loving your enthusiasm – and we’re going to get more information for you posted here soon (not soon™).
---
&gt;Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer!
---
Used execture only in last like 15-20sec, to "emulate" execute phase.
---
Paladin auras only affect the group they are in as well.  More blessings is also a good thing.
---
paladins can go oom?
---
Apex legends dawg 
---
If you are in party with your guildmates it's going to be 2 or 3 or 4 out 5. You already have group so you invite randoms to join you. Usually you, or your friends, are leader so there's no kick. Worst case scenario is someone leaving, that's it.
---
Also, I thought current loot trading doesn't allow to need on items you can't wear or you but at the same time classic is much more blurry then retail in that regard. I wonder how this will turn out.
---
This is unexpected. But awesome. Glad we finally got some news. 
---
Loot trading is prob only good to have in raids, honestly id rather not have any of it at all but its a seriously problem pretty much only in level 60 dungeons.
---
The way id avoid getting "scammed" I guess is to only play with people I can trust or use masterloot.  UBRS will be an absolute shit show though just due to the amount of cross class loot
---
Finally, a man of culture. 
---
#faithrestored
---
He said "summer"!!!! Its on track guys!
---
Ok, so you *are* 100% full of shit. First post should've been all I needed. 
---
I'd be very curious to see a list of things that are on their "not worth it" list.
---
What is the mailbox issue?
---
This should make the No Changers pretty happy.
---
You honestly don't think a multi-billion dollar technology giant doesn't have complex enough analytics to see this?  They will know every second a person plays both release and vanilla.  Subbing at classic release makes literally zero difference other than not giving them money until classic.
---
bag space is not a problem for hunters, u barely have different gear sets compared to other classes like a warrior
---
I meant the mage lmao. If the paladin has a partner, they won't oom first as long as they have decent gear. It's the spamming consecration that you have to do when you are solo that ooms the shit out of you. If you just flash of light the fuck out of yourself, the mage will oom first. Usually after 3 to 5 packs depending on their gear and how close the packs are to each other.
---
To clarify, this was usually also to farm towards a goal. Like in Silithus etc. Pack farming as a duo is still probably not optimal for gold. As a healer, your best bet is to just go money professions or play an alt. I guess maybe you could like sell heals, but that's more of a tank thing.
---
I asked a blizzard employee i met in laguna about the health regen on the demo and they said it was correct and to not worry about it.  Im glad that our feedback is actually making a difference.
---
I think the question is missing part of the equation - if your group has a clothy or two in it, is it okay to roll on cloth gear?
---
Love me some updates, Thanks OP
---
Overall, nice and welcome communication.
---
&gt;As we mentioned in our BlizzCon presentation, some differences aren’t worth fixing, like differences in how the mail works. 
---
-.-
---
&gt;Dodge, Parry, and Miss were all not happening often enough.
---
I wonder how this was happening. I know the current game calculates things differently, but they didn't say *why* it wasn't happening "enough". I assume "enough" means it was happening less often than the displayed %.
---
A lot of people just get hyped, get nostalgia, and resub to current wow thinking "It can't be that bad, and it will hold me over until classic comes out!" People resub regularly with this mentality all the time. Not super logical, but people aren't always super logical.
---
I have had to make myself remember this a few times. I see a screenshot from WotLK, think "oh, well current wow can't be *that* bad, I should resub. It could be fun again!" Then I resub, play for a day or week, realize how dull it is, and stop playing. Luckily, I have finally convinced myself to only but one month subscriptions. I used to do it with 3 or 6 month subscription and the cost was much higher.
---
Which still suggests that there is a difference.
---
&gt; Again, we’re following all of your discussions and loving your enthusiasm – and we’re going to get more information for you posted here **soon (not soon™).**
---
Bolded for emphasis.  Excellent to hear this, really hope they follow through!
---
Finally i can watch 20 different youtubers discussing the same update for 15+ min to satisfy my longing for classic.
---
Pretty nice to hear that they are actually listening to feedback people had from the demo and double checking things, good sign for the future
---
Totally fine with new mail; not gonna cry about that.
---
Of course, I'm going to give myself or my friend an advantage if the system allows it. Everyone chooses the path of the least resistance. That's why loot trading is a much worse system. I know for certain there are a lot of people like me and that's why I want the old system. That's the whole point I'm trying to make.
---
It is absolutely yours if:
---
* There are no clothies
---
* There are clothies and they rolled pass or greed
---
* The item has +healing on it (without +damage)
---
Discuss with the group if the clothies are okay on you rolling on generic caster gear
---
That’s actually helpful, thank you. My plan would be to try to be a melee group healer as they don’t need mana tide anyway, and I remember from my rogue days the tingly feelings I would get from having WF totem to show those mages and warlocks what for on the meters. That said, I can see how it the guild doesn’t have the shamans to mana tide the caster groups, I would have to do that.
---
They'll see you came back, played release, then dropped it completely for Classic, and deduce you came back solely for Classic.  You're really overthinking this, and vastly underestimate the metrics Blizzard does on their games and the conclusions they draw from them.
---
Just kite the Gar adds? We never banish those; it just makes the fight harder. The only thing we regularly banish in MC are the rock elementals in the lava packs.
---
The success of classic will be determined by its active users three months after launch, not by resubs at launch or lvl 8 warriors swarming Goldshire the first week.
---
Time for every content creator to make a 1hr breakdown video.
---
How will people find a way to bitch about this one?
---
A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 
---
Good luck on your rank 13 killing green geared players and happy chinese filled servers.
---
Dodge, Parry and Miss all were entirely calculated by defense and weaponskill in the demo. At least for npc's. So once your weaponskill was maxed and you were fighting mobs your level there wouldn't be any misses/parries/dodges.
---
see how little I know. I thought it was the same game lol.
---
oh woops, my bad
---
I think you are right but the amount of people who sub solely for Classic is important information for Blizzard. But if no one is playing in 3 months, then it doesn’t mean anything.
---
If you treat RuneScape as a source, the price/value of g on classic will get lower as the game gets older and the market becomes inflated. I wouldn't be surprised to see people paying $20-30 for as little as 5g on launch week.
---
Why the fuck would I "resub now for Classic" ?
---
Anyone have that image of a guy holding a recipt for Duke Nuke'm From like 2004... still without the game in like 2011?
---
"They won't fix the mail!"
---
Thank you Kaivax! Very cool!
---
It's for that super-secret Wyvern Sting build!
---
While at the same time I've seen only hate on the internet for it and no one I know has even touched the game.
---
Yaaasssssss, Classic Summer? Maybe even sooner than anticipated 🤞
---
Hahaha learn something new every day 
---
Can you g'not?
---
"not worth it" ???!?!?! surely that means sharding, lfr, and cash shop. Blizz is a slave!!! Classic is ruined!!!
---
THEY'RE NOT FIXING MAIL?!!?!
---
J/K no one gives a shit.  Thanks for the update devs!  I was hoping for a more specific release date, but can I infer that "get ready for a classic summer" means an early summer release?
---
Yeah but +damage can still be a massive upgrade to a healer and is not automatically a dps item due to it having the same amount of +healing. There are no strictly spell damage items aside from specific schools like I stated.
---
Like, don't be an asshole and snipe something that is preraid BiS for a warlock if you are a paladin. If it's just some cloth shit with +dmg and healing on it and s better than what the healer has, then they have just as much right to it. It helps their role and that's the important thing for rolling on gear in vanilla. There isn't any "plate mastery" nonsense that was added later. If you can wear the gear and the stats help, it's for you.
---
Also rogues and warriors...
---
Basically every class can
---
XD Your lack of knowledge gave me a chuckle, but not at your expense, we all lack the crucial information on some subject. Have an orange arrow
---
black lotus don't "go bad" the fk u  talking about
---
Yeah but then why even be a gnome in the first place?
---
I got it confused with Apex-Legends. I don't know anyone playing Anthem other then my boss. Who plays CoD, so I don't exactly respect his opinion lol.
---
Adds up with their explanation that it was correct in their internal environment but not in the Blizzcon one.
---
Great for horse, if you’re ally where is the next quest weapon that is an upgrade? Also assuming you aren’t doing it until you’re later in level. Personally I have SFK done by 21 or 22.
---
*2020
---
Note there's no mention of a beta. This community is very optimistic that we'll get a beta but I think it's very likely. 
---
You can do guild runs for every loot activity in the game. If there are not enough people, you will take some pugs but still be a leader and contol the loot if you choose to.
---
That's how it usually goes. Guild organises something and takes the loot it needs. The rest can be given to pugs. The best example would be Onyxia Pug runs.
---
[Sooner than Soon!](https://i.imgur.com/tbUObKA.jpg)
---
Probably nothing but at least it's not delayed
---
An issue with the mailbox
---
That’s the most relevant bit in the post.
---
Doesn’t mean there won’t be delays, but it appears to be coming in summer.
---
Even an acknowledgement is better than the silence we've been getting. Shame we were in the dark for so long, but I'll take this over no communication at all. 
---
So people can /spit on you in Stormwind I guess.
---
pre-ordering a game is not the same thing as paying a subscription to a game that is not yet playable
---
There is not much we can do about this though. They keep responding about core mechanics, which is of course good, but they totally ignore the most controversial reveals of blizzcon panel - sharding and loot trading. And that probably means their decision is final and they won't change it based on player feedback.
---
Are we still *at least* 3 months out, boys and girls? Can't take it anymore...
---
&gt; can I infer that "get ready for a classic summer" means an early summer release, as opposed to late summer?
---
That's kinda where my brain is at, too... but I don't want to let my expectations run too amok.
---
An unqualified yes.
---
It took them 4 month to respond to the Demo feeback? Yikers. Classic 2022 here we go.
---
I'm curious what changes other than the mail were deemed not worth fixing
---
Why not play all of them then? We have a loooong time now.
---
The delay in receiving mail will not be added back.  It will continue to be instant.
---
I await my state of supreme vegetation.
---
I'll just leave this here...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJhF0L7pfo8
---
Was it being able to send multiple mails at once?  I can’t remember the mail on the demo. 
---
If i were a warlock with dire maul being out in release I'd farm lashers. Consistent gold per hour use voidwalker aoe taunt, rain of fire, sacrifice, rain of fire. Instance farming for vendor trash is always consistent and uncontested so imo it's the optimal way to farm. Especially if you have a lot of free time because it's very even hold per hour over time, where either methods can be more based around rng
---
Why would I waste $15?
---
PvP scaling, flying mounts... you know things that don’t make or break the game!  /s
---
&gt;What if some knave rolls on your precious Robes of Arugal for a friend?
---
Is this satire because this sentence is cracking me up
---
Gno.
---
Smite builds are definitely better than shadow at lower levels. Around 45 shadow becomes the better option overall.
---
I have always used a wand build, w/ spirit tap and improved Regen. In my experience it is the best build for early leveling, as it allows you to fight multiple mobs easily and it doesn't have any down time.
---
You have to get the right wands though. The one in BRD can be obtained by around 22 and will out dps shadow and smite builds with zero down time.
---
Here is a link to an older post outlining a good wand build: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7iieiw/priest_leveling_guide/
---
A waste for you isn’t a waste for someone else, I was simply stating regardless when you come back they’ll know exactly why. 
---
Very good to know. 
---
Also he said "have fun Classic Summer", which means the summer is already expected to be *classic*, which means the release date is definitely not at the very end of summer. 
---
So it's not only "summer release date", but actually I would expect "first half of summer release date".
---
Don't listen to that guy about lotuses... They go up quite a lot. I wouldn't bank on farming them solely as there's a lot of competition and they can be camped but if you get some it's work saving until bwl where the price hikes.
---
I will resub to WoW, when Classic is like 5 min away from launch. Not going to give them ActiBlizz a dime before that.
---
Also, I will pay my sub on a monthly basis. Not 3 months, not 6 months, not 1 year.
---
Simply trying to add something to the conversation other than "SL lock 1v1 best class or shadow priest melt faces."
---
A lot of the Classic Youtube bro's are just giant wastes of time. 
---
Thank you for the numbers to aim for!
---
PvP scaling, arenas, flying mounts, and azerite power confirmed for vanilla. 
---
Are you retarded or just a moron?  Jesus christ.  The adults are talking. If you cant read and comprehend go back to call of duty please. 
---
You mean BFD heh?     
---
   
---
Would you go meditation first or holy nova? I like holy nova utility incase a mob spawns adds.
---
Woohooo! Can't wait!
---
I'm also very pleased they noticed our giant feedback thread and even took it into consideration.
---
Leveling 
---
Get 7 characters, one for each day of the week. 
---
Best response haha
---
And for Tips to somehow get basic, key elements of Vanilla wrong. 
---
Perhaps this is an ignorant question, but what if you could only "trade" it to the next highest roller? Like, if you get it, you can't actually trade it to someone, you can just click something to send it to the next highest roller, and even that goes away once its equipped? (For master loot, maybe you can't trade it at all, you can just send it back to the boss to be redistributed by the master looter)
---
"But how will the community know my reaction if I don't create a reaction video?! I've got to connect with the *people*!"
---
Wow. No information about sharding, realm pop, itemization, loot trading, etc. All the core systems really not touched at all. I think it will all be in the game at this point. Just slide right by the issue :(
---
I don;t know about current strats on Rag. But back in the day we split the group up so everyone had their back to a wall so we wouldn't be knocked into the lava
---
Honestly a good early profession for farming is copper ore and mithril ore.  It's one of the few gathering professions that has 2 associated crafting professions (BS and Engi). And everyone needs extra copper and mithril for leveling those professions.  That's just a personal opinion on early server economies.
---
***CLASSIC SUMMER INTENSIFIES***
---
I can guarantee Blizzard will release a patch for retail right before classic release that adds new items to retail, then at the end of the year give credit to their massive sub numbers due to the patch so that they look better to the investors. I really do not think that it matters whether you subbed now for retail or wait until classic release. Either way Blizzard will lie at the end of the year earnings call again. 
---
So presumably minor things that don't have much an impact on gameplay. Mail is actually a pretty good example to give us an idea of their mindset.
---
I saw a video with that strat last night. Looked crazy fun. It reminds me so much of a modern approach to a boss. I love how even years after vanilla was released new strats and metas are forming
---
Hopefully this means they can replicate the way latency and how two clients handled actions between one another, spell batching. It falls under the category of what they said they intend to fix. It has a large impact on how combat and pvp flows in the game, and would change many pvp interactions if they cannot emulate it.
---
And it’s soon, not soon(tm)!  Soon is sooner than soon(tm)!
---
Nice!
---
Can't you also just sub for a Classic Only account at half the price of Retail?
---
The best way of enjoying your main and making gold is usually having a main and farming character. Main would take engi because engi is op. The farming character could be gatherer, profitable profession or mage gold grinding in dm (other classes can do that too but mage is the most efficient one).
---
This is correct.
---
As a paladin main the thing i love the most about the class is my ability do to pretty much anything outside of dungeons and raids without much problem at all as a healer, i have played both priest and shaman end they're not nearly as strong as paladins solo. Holy is the strongest paladin spec overall since even outside pve you can still hold up really well and just straight out outlast most classes in 1v1 pvp with a few of the classes being pretty solidly countered by you.
---
Compared to other healing classes paladin farming is very good. Paladins are no mages but they got probably the second best aoe farming in the game. PvP healing is also very fun as a paladin imo since you're not just spamming FoL, your power comes from freedom, BoP, cleanse and stun.
---
This joke is as played out as the YouTube content at this point...
---
Not if you only use melee. 
---
This joke is as played at as the content it’s making fun of at this point...
---
I like how all these people say things like "we all know how our ZG,MC,AQ runs are gonna go because we've all done them hundreds of times" as if they were part of that elite group that cleared NAXX during  vanilla.  
---
I never cleared NAXX, not even once, MC BWL AQ over 100 times in vanilla? I doubt it.  Will raid  content be cleared the day it gets released on classic? most likely but not by you, all you casual players talk like you are going to be the most elite players in the world.  Lets be real here, most of you are not going to be clearing raid content on day one, most of you will have to "re-learn" how the raids work, there is no need to retune how the old bosses work. #nochanges xd
---
I find this strange because I was sure Ion very specifically noted the 1 hour delay as being a good thing, to encourage user interaction; and that he spoke of things like the "Open All" button remaining in place.
---
I mean, I preorder games because spending $10 every paycheck for a couple months is easier on my finances than $60 upfront.
---
“Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer!”
---
Nice to see they’re confident on the release schedule. Very optimistic!
---
circlejerk
---
/flirt
---
Oh my god yes! Give me the fresh new creamy update goodness! Note the phrasing: "get ready for a Classic Summer". I'm assuming it's gonna release early Summer (June).
---
Would have liked a tidbit about Alpha but this is nice
---
Gotta lend that int buff from a mage then ;P
---
Once Classic is out, its going to be easy to see how many people are playing it. Just multiply the numbers of Classic realms with 10,000.
---
And before telling me that it's actually 2,500...not, it is not. 
---
2,500 is the concurrent player cap. The realm cap is about 4 times that.
---
Back in the summer of 2005, WoW Vanilla had 700 realms, and 7.2 million subscribers. In other words, roughly 10k subscribers/realm.
---
They will absolutely know how many people subbed for WoW just to play Classic.
---
Dear Blizzard WoW Classic Team,
---
THANK YOU FOR THIS UPDATE.
---
As someone whose main stuff is like... WoW, FFXIV, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity original sin, Civilization... I do enjoy me some CoD multiplayer as well.
---
Threads like this are always packed with people praising Dwarves, yet they've always been one of the most underrepresented races in the game since launch. 
---
I haven't chosen a class yet, but I'll be rolling Human if I end up choosing one of theirs. Their racials are just incredibly solid across the board, and gear has always looked best on them.
---
The person you're scamming will 100% leave the group. Other players will probably leave too, figuring that if you scammed someone else you'll scam them too. Someone leaving in the middle of the dungeon is a huge pain in the ass, because you have to send someone back to town to spam LFM.
---
I don't know if you can need roll on stuff you can't wear, but the Warrior could be rolling on cloth for the Priest, so the argument is the same.
---
What I'm saying is, it's not THAT different from how vanilla played out with ninja looting. You need people to help you run dungeons and they'll stop helping you when they realize they're being scammed. The problem with loot trading is not that you can roll on items for your friend, it's that if you have the same loot pool as your friend it's hard to detect what you're doing. 
---
"adults are talking" proceeds to insult and resort to name calling instead of providing a counter argument.  I think you need a time-out kid :P
---
You can make goblin sappet charges they sell for a pretty good penny eventually as well as rocket fuel.
---
It's great to hear that they're releasing their trademark on "soon"  Now everyone can use it!
---
No beta news this late? I guess they wont have one
---
Azeroth her opened wooonds caused by ragnaros champion
---
More information is coming soon (not soon™)™
---
You think you do, but you don't.
---
:)
---
Ok
---
oh boo hoo, im playing the best leveling class in the game, aspect of the cheetah my way to level 60, but im gonna complain about having to vendor slightly faster than other classes cause I have to carry ammo
---
lol you think my disrespect of COD come from MMO's. No sir I came up on Unreal Tourney and Halo. I'm not anti shooter or anti game of any kind. I just like Arena shooters so I throw shade at the CoD kind.
---
It's July 16th isn't it? 
---
Can you remind me what the "mail bug" is they are referring to?
---
No. Was a pally at OG launch. Mained said pally for 14 years.
---
She shall live again.
---
Oh thank God they're still working on it. I just subbed here last week and the sub was already worth the instant news feed. Reddit FTW.
---
Holy shit, I love this idea.
---
Psh. You mean six 10:05 videos?
---
[yarp](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/)
---
Eh, I feel like this isn't that major of an issue. It literally only affects PUGs pre-60, and only if there is a group of friends who are going out of their way to be as terrible as possible. Ninja needing existed in Vanilla but it didn't really ruin my experience too often. Does a group of 2 or 3 friends really want to risk the group that they spent 30 mins getting together disbanding over a pair a boots?
---
This just seems wildly exaggerated. 
---
MAN YOUR BATTLESTATIONS MEN THIS IS NOT A DRILL. THERE HAS BEEN A BLUE POST ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS, I REPEAT THIS IS NOT A DRILL. GUYS IM SO FREAKING EXCITED IM LITERALLY SHAKING AT THIS MOMENT.
---
Thanks for the post! I know a lot of us here would love to hear small tidbits of the development like this along the way as a means of feeling connected to the process, even if there aren't any big developments to share.
---
I believe it takes an hour for mail to be sent but now it won’t?
---
What's sooner than being soon?
---
***IIIIIICE SOON!***
---
Alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright!
---
Hi, /u/SquilliePlays
---
Even if you expect an item to sell in less than a week its never guaranteed that's all I was saying.
---
Again, I'm not even disagreeing with you, but there are DIFFERENT mentalities than your own. You are talking as if everyone else with a different viewpoint simply doesn't understand. If you want to treat BOE's that way I think its totally fair. Its probably the most black and white way to go about it and 0 drama as long as everyone else you are grouped with is in agreement. 
---
Yea I think all their missteps are usually from trying something different that didn’t work. I know the big franchises like Zelda, Metroid and Pokémon all had titles that fell short... but not due to a lack of effort or predatory methods (some consider the ports predatory, but aside from the 5 or so people that actually for the WiiU it’s new games for the rest of us) 
---
3:00pm is **soon**, just sayin.
---
That doesn't make sense. A maxed weapon skill would work against defense. Weapon skill wouldn't help you avoid the base 5% miss, 4.5% dodge, and 6.2% parry, that would be hit and expertise (which wasn't in vanilla). Right?
---
There is no spot in raids for a shadow priest I'm afraid.
---
The best part imo is the challenge of classic wow. Single lvls and items made a huge differences compared to how it is now; even getting through the most basic dungeons still required the right amount of teamwork, cc, and luck at times. You know you are living the dream again when you find yourself as a ghost near Nessingwary in STV rezzing behind a tree to hide from the opposing faction just long enough to bandage up and get back out there and kill that last tiger before respawns appear. 
---
Yeah, my bad. Fixed
---
Im glad we got some info but im surprised that this wasnt part of it as well. 
---
While i am sure the community is going to turn many of the issues into i remember how it was or this is how it was on X private server.  Bigger issues may be found that a longer beta would be helpful for. I cant say that i memorized my time in Vanilla perfectly, however, there could just be some issue that are oh i didnt think that would happen unless this circumstance occured. Players seem to be great at finding those.
---
ah okay, thanks!
---
&gt; I don’t plan on joining an uber progression guild as I don’t have the time, but I would eventually at least want to see AQ40.
---
Well, a casual guild doing AQ will probably really need your mana tide totem.
---
I remember that too. Maybe it became more trouble than it’s worth. 
---
*Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer!*
---
To me this indicates it will not be a late summer release and that gets me so damn psyched.
---
The issue in the demo was there was no base miss parry or dodge chance. Everything was calculated only by weaponskill and defense. That was the entire problem they fixed.
---
"8 Mind-Blowing Ways This Classic WoW YouTube Video Can Hopefully Allow Me to Avoid Getting a Real Job"
---
It is VERY different then vanilla ninja looting because every item essentially becomes BoE inside the group. There's a huge difference in rolling for boe green/blue upgrade for your friend and rolling for blue/purple drop from boss for your friend. That is a very big problem since many pre-bis/bis items drop from bosses
---
Also, I don't understand the last part. "If you have the same loot pool as your friend it's hard to detect what you're doing".
---
Detect what? Ninja loot, buddy roll? It doesn't really matter. You yoinked the item for some reason. The guy who got yoinked doesn't care about specific reason why you did it.

---
&gt; Thank you, and get ready for a Classic Summer! 
---
Does this mean that Classic will be released at a date that will allow us to play it for the entire Summer, or at least a good part of the Summer?
---
Sounds like yes, and while June is most likely not the release month, July might be.
---
In an ocean of negative news relating to Blizzard, Classic gives me hope.
---
fuuuuuuuuck.
---
As a Paladin I loved healing in PvP, so much to do and think about. Plus 1v1 I was okay but obviously warlocks and shadow priests get me 
---
Considering they have limited time and need to allocate their attention and resources, skipping on this to ensure they get core combat mechanics right is something I'm all in favor for.
---
&gt;mfw we live in a world without perception

Why pretend ? Needing to sell for your epic mount seems fair to me as it provides a huge amount of utility.

Haha, ya BFD. 
---
I would put the points into imp sw: pain and the reduced shadow resist.  I don't like holy Nova as it doesn't produce enough dps for the Mana cost.
---
For multi-mob pulls/fights. I just use pw:s and regen while keeping sw:p up on all targets and just wand them down one at a time. Another thing I should point out is the rotation I use:
---
Mind Blast -&gt; SW:p -&gt; Regen -&gt; wand
---
Also front load any additional casts and keep Inner Fire up at all times. Be very conservative with pw:s, only using it in emergency situations. With Inner Fire and improved Regen, nothing (within reason) should pose a threat while leveling.
---
If you follow this rotation you will have zero down time and never have to drink. You should also always have a good Mana reserve in case of a gank or just pulling too much.
---
Stack spirit above everything else. A couple additional points into holy won't hurt and will help out with dungeon runs. If you're planning to avoid dungeons, I would suggest putting the additional point into shadow. As you can incorporate mind blasts into the rotation without adding down time. Going further into disc isn't necessary, as you should have more than enough Mana conservation.
---
Here is the talent build I like to use up until shadow becomes more viable:

---
We literally talked about getting a small blue post update to at least calm our nerves just 2-3 days ago. Sweet! 
---
I think the most important part of this post if you add stuff together.
---
\-CM blue post: "and we’re going to get more information for you posted here soon (not soon™)."
---
\-Poster replied and asked: " So does “not soon™” actually mean *sooner* than the traditional “soon™”?
---
\-Which the CM replied back: "Yes. Please refer to [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Soon](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Soon)"
---
Also, in the end of the blue post the CM said: "Get ready for a Classic summer" (a.k.a a summer of Classic). Does this mean it will release early/mid summer rather than late summer?
---
Possible hints! I'm thinking we will get some major news either this month or in April. I'm hyped.
---
Does that mean if I send someone an item, they get it immediately instead of in 1 hour?
---
So it's safe to assume that the "other mailbox issues" refers to auto-completion and/or the take all button. That's fine then. To be fair, as much as mail seems like a pointless thing to panic about, if a 1-hour delay on literally anything was seen as trivial then it'd raise a lot more questions on just what else falls under the category of "small differences that aren't worth fixing". So clearing that up is a load off my mind.
---
However it works today is how it will work in Classic. 
---
Multiple mails at once is fixed with an addon so I can see it not being a priority.
---
But instant delivery changes the dynamics of how mail works.
---
The warlock thing is funny to me. I remember being a warlock in 2005 getting so mad because I accidentally would click summon Imp and lose my voidwalker. Then you would have to farm a soul shard without the tank. I was a noob, but I distinctly remember that. Can’t believe so many people thought otherwise. 
---
I actually re-subbed last weekend for the first time since Cata. I could handle the hype anymore I wanted to play.
---
goddamn Im disappointed in what WoW has become 
---
Oh, I understand now. That's such a weird thing to have been in the demo though.
---
&gt; The community wouldn’t disappear. That’s not what he said. 
---
That's semantics, he stated that you either turn into a scammer or you're scared that every group you join is gonna scam you.        
---
I never said there won't be dicks in the community, that much is a given with any community ever.       
---
I said that loot trading will not turn everyone or even most people into dicks.         
---
I just think it's ridiculous to praise the so called community and then say it's gonna crash and burn because of loot trading.
---
I'm not for loot trading in the game, i merely think it's stupid to say it's gonna be the end of the world.
---
You got it backwards mate.
---
Ion specifically said that the 1 hour delay on mail from Vanila WILL BE in Classic. 100%. And the reason, as Ion said, is to have players interact more often, giving the example of a player that wants a crafted item. He said that it is better, for the community, that players SHOULD MEET in the world, trade crafting mats and crafted items, instead having instant mail delivery.
---
It's more like "hey, remember us? We do the thing."
---
Now THIS is a quality CM post. 
---
Its a reasonable theory, but it doesn’t confirm it. I’ve been through there in 3-4 clothier groups and had all good caster drops multiple times
---
The mail comment in today's post most likely wasn't referring to the delay, but rather the ability to send multiple items in a single mail.
---
I would expect the types of changes you mentioned to be a hard no.  I wouldnt be surprised if there were some very small variations on how a few things worked but nothing of the nature of rebalancing.
---
That is the question I meant to get across, yes 
---
I wouldn't just settle on a realm, look for a full RP guild.  I played on Sentinels when I was younger and was in a heavy RP guild and the experience is far more enjoyable than if you were just running around on your own.  
---
Also, avoid Goldshire - don't go near Goldshire... just don't.
---
But resubbing is nothing like preordering. You just pay $15 a month to not play the game. 
---
Nah the delay will still be there. There was probably some minor interaction that hes talking about.
---
Ion specifically talked about how the delay is gonna be there like before due to how it dynamically impacts the worlds movement etc
---
Not sure, but I’m gonna quit my job and leave my girlfriend at the beginning of May anyway for good measure. 
---
BfA is the worst expansion of WoW.
---
So, no. If you want to play, go to that famous vanilla private.
---
&gt; most people don't become dicks purely because they can.
---
Is this your first time on the internet?
---
This is why I'm playing druid and my gf is rolling a rogue.   Nice and safe in the low rungs...
---
In the Demo, the rate of Dodge, Parry and Miss were very low. Unlike Vanilla, where they were quite high.
---
In other words, in the Demo, a player would hit a mob far more often, which was the case.
---
I played the demo, and the mobs barely dodged or parry, as well as players barely missing hits.
---
It wasn't like that in Vanilla.
---
”and we’re going to get more information for you posted here soon (not soon™)”
---
Yay
---
can't you just pay in installments after release?
---
How can they spend so much time discussing something so small?
---
Also, what talent build for your 5th alt are you planning out in your head today? 
---
It can easily happen for a whole slew of reasons. Software is complex. You can have 5 different components that all seem to work independently, you can be certain your data is correct, then you put it in production and something you didn't anticipate gives you a bad result, or the data doesn't match what you had in the development environment for some reason.
---
Better fucking not be because I'm on vacation that week
---
Considering how the community reacts to these kinds of things, I consider it out of the question. 
---
Best thing you can do is to adapt and pick something more favored. I know I will. You got me once with the Kittybear fantasy, but not again! 
---
I knew Dodge and miss etc was borked just by watching people leveling warriors and not taking 30 seconds to kill a mob. They never missed, and what I remember from warrior was that missing was plentiful because it screwed you over so badly when it was followed by a parry or a Dodge.
---
It's going to be the old mail (the 1 hour delay) and the new mail (multiple items per mail).
---
You're the reason that players who want classic are a meme. What makes 1.12.1 a better representation of vanilla than 1.11? Vanilla was a constantly changing, tumultuous existence. 1.1 and 1.12 might as well have been separate games. If you truly wanted to "recreate and restore" vanilla, you would be open to patches every few months and engaging changes to fights, because that *was* the vanilla experience. You just want to minmax on a legal private server that isn't going to suddenly get shut down.
---
I loved Vanilla. I loved the way my paladin played in 1.7. I loved the way dungeons felt when threat was a legitimate issue and resource that needed to be managed. I hated how faceroll everything was in 1.12 due to overtuning and increasing threat output
---
Why is that any less "vanilla" to you?
---
It's because that's how it operates on private servers so that has fogged their memory.
---
That or blizz is wrong. But hey, who the hell am I to say who is right or wrong?
---
I unsubbed back in Nov or Dec. Honestly, even if someone paid for my game time I still wouldn't bother. The game is in such a sorry state.
---
Do we know if Parry Haste is working properly? For those that dont know, when you parry an incoming attack, your swing timer gets reduced by something like 20%. 
---
You can always switch to engineering after you've gotten your mount and some walking around money. You can power level it in a few hours. PvP rewards don't come out till the p2 patch anyway. Mining is only really profitable for arcane crystals or paired with another profession. 
---
SUMMerrrrrrr
---
More likely, in Vanilla you could only mail one item at a time.
---
It isn't.
---
I don't want loot trading either, but it's not this big devil that will ruin classic or something. The community will uproar against loot trade ninjas just like they did regular ninjas, all this shitposting is really pathetic.
---
Also, we should give everyone interrupt, self heal, dmg/healing/tank cooldown, dmg reduction cooldown, mobility ability and good AoE. 
---
How is that working in retail? You like it when every class feels the same? No one has unique class utilities. It's all about the numbers.
---
Ahh private servers is prob the reason everyone thinks that. Never played a lock on private servers. 
---
Blizz is 100% correct on this issue. Also I believe they have a 1.12 client in office they can verify. 
---
At least they're communicating - everyone wanted they to say something, ANYTHING, so they did.
---
Well, Ion said that a Classic beta is either going to be very short (couple weeks) or there isn't going to be a beta. I have no idea why the community was optimistic about it, since Ion said, crystal clear, that there won't be a beta,and IF there will be one, will be very short, couple weeks most likely.
---
They just fired like half their customer service. Loot trading is here to stay.
---
i really don't understand why he still makes videos
---
Imp sw:p is one of the strongest talents while leveling, with spirit tap being the biggest. I suggest a wand build while leveling until around 45. I posted a pretty detailed description of my build and thinking, check it out if you're interested.
---
I'm seeing a trend here: reddit gets grumpy we get an update.
---
$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
I really wish they would give us some info on the servers. Server population size and if we will be getting RP and RPPVP servers.
---
There is nothing else going on for Classic right now. After it releases, by all means criticize away for padded content, but right now with nothing new to cover, why wouldn't they?
---
"most people", not "people".
---
Take this with a grain of salt, but I have a buddy who works with blizzard and he said their timeline says July
---
Why not let people buy things they enjoy instead of trying to shove your values down their throat?
---
I don't really use the mailbox today.  When I do log in, all my toons are in the same guild with my own private gbank, and I don't bother with other people.
---
I mean I guess I could do the second one, it's just easier for me to remember to actually do it if I have the "Hey it's already been ordered, do the thing now" in the back of my head. The first thing though, I don't know anywhere that will sell you a video game on installments post-release.
---
Sorry can not play Troll Paladin 
---
Troll Shaman Resto
---
\- Since my preference in support chars is general in all kind of games, in Dota i loved play as Dazzle, Reghar in HotS, even Voltar in awesomenauts, I ll be a support in wow as well, so shaman, paladin, priest and druid are options
---
\- the only profession i never tried in wow was leatherworking so, shaman, druid, hunter and  rogue are the best options  
---
\- In the healers universe the one with the funniest skills is the shaman, far sight, sentry toten, water walking, ghost wolf, astral recall, resurrection, windfury and bloodlust
---
\- troll mocks when /lol and have awesome hairstyle
---
How do you know you enjoy things that are not released yet? In most cases even doesn't have proper gameplay on youtube.
---
make videos with false information is not helping anyone. making videos with clickbait titles like HIT 50 Fast! then make a video claiming your overgeared warrior can grind whelps for 13 levels. there are good content creators (frost) amd there are horrible ones. (@$$outbaby)
---
Exactly
---
Also the people doing these types of activities are often getting their ingame gold through nefarious means (hacking accounts) so it's not too absurd to see stocks of gold as early as a week in.
---
I'm a little confused where you got "1.12 is better than 1.11" from my comment but...sure please put more words in my mouth that I didn't say.
---
In fact where did I mention anything about any previous patches? If blizzard decided to do progressive patch cycles from 1.1-1.12 I'd be totally down for it. I don't want exterior changes that were NOT part of vanilla to happen. 
---
Maybe reread what my comment actually says.
---
He is not frustrated though, he is worried it is getting cancelled because nothing has been said when they never say anything. It is a little insane.
---
i just dropped my chicken tendies!
---
roll paladin, roll on everything except guns/bows,daggers,wands 
---
I was praying we'd get something on March 1st. Hype is full throttle, approaching Mach 1 speeds.
---
Can't wait for people to still find ways to bitch about this or the overall project. Not talking about people flat out hating the project, but rather the people still believing Blizzard is stupid as fuck and is going to fuck this up somehow.
---
Thorium arrows are an inconvenience but jagged are easy to get.
---
I'm so torn, 75% chance I roll female tauren shammy, then sometimes I say no way and want to level my 2nd shadow priest, then my desire to tank kicks in and want to level a bear druid...think I'm going with the shammy since I have never played one before....but that female dwarve shadow priest is to good
---
I can find a way. The post is just lacking in information. It's mostly just bug fixes, which we expected anyway, and nothing else of value. I hope they haven't spent the last 3 months just fixing bugs...
---
Banks in my country allow to convert already paid payments to 3-12 installments. Not sure if it's a worldwide practice.
---
It's just that if buying full price games have affect on your budget, isn't it better to only buy things that are good enough for you. You can't really tell that before release. And it's totally easier to create a calendar notification for release date than gamble $60 on whether the game will be good.
---
Words cannot express how excited I am for this summer. Can't wait to be 14 again.
---
You are so adverse to any change you might as well be a person playing on patch 1.4 and bitching that 1.5 got announced and will change everything.
---
You are complaining that if ANYTHING is different, that it will not be Vanilla. Well guess what, a lot of the deep spec Utility for shit 1.12 specs used to exist in the early patches. The reason they suck in 1.12 is that it was removed. So you complaining about changing talents implies anything but 1.12 is unacceptable.
---
As people have said, Vanilla is a state of the game. It's no flying mounts, no teleporting to dungeons, original classes, knowing people on your server by name. If you remain obstinate to the point of absurdity over raw numerical data, it's hard to take you seriously.
---
Please keep telling them you aren't playing with loot trading 
---
Kaivax 3000
---
I think we're getting one, but it's going to be pretty short, and it'll include the ability to create 60s to test most of the content properly, instead of having to level all the way.
---
Imagine doing PvE to get gear kek
---
But in all seriousness loot trading is fucking bs
---
I really enjoy his walkthrough videos.  I started late in Vanilla, and there are a lot of questlines and dungeons I never got to do.  It's fun seeing them and getting excited for the game.
---
forums (and elsewhere) - reading reddit confirmed.
---
Thank you!
---
It’s unbelievable how much I relate to this 
---
Okay I'm gonna try list the things, but trust me the list is pretty long and I will probably miss a bunch, but here we go:
---
Goblin sapper charges, instant AOE grenade around you that does 500 damage to everyone (including yourself), incredibly useful in raiding for AOE'ing down stuff or bosses like Vicidus, or even just for any boss for extra damage. That's PVE, it's ridicules for pvp too, very strong burst for combos, get rogues out of stealth, and in 40vs40 or similar fight over world dragons or just at raid entrances, these are absolute game changers.
---
Reflectors, these are pretty costly, but they are trinket that gives you a 5 second reflect on a school of spells, frost fire or shadow. Imagine reflecting a death coil from a warlock, or reflecting a pyroblast. So much fun! Also the fire one makes you reflect SAPPER CHARGES back to the caster and makes you immune to the damage, even bigger game changers for 40vs40.
---
Iron grenades, super cheap, with some skill you land these very consistently and it allows you to get a free chainlightning off or heal off doing the 3 second in-capitation.
---
 Rocket boots !!! Man these things are so nice 20 seconds of speedyboi.
---
Invis trinket, oh boi, I typically have this one on when im just doing my thing, 1 hour cooldown but this thing gives you instant stealth usable IN COMBAT. Almost guaranteed to get you out of jail card. 
---
Netomatic, fires a net at the boi for 10 seconds, issues with a warrior? no more.
---
Wanna kill the warrior in style? gnomish deathray(gnomish only!), it has a 3 second cast with some damage to you, but it does 1-4k damage on the target.
---
Want to cc the target to cast it? Try rocket helm, you charge to the enemy and basically put a sap on them. 
---
Or you can MC helmet the player and use him for extra damage or even heal yourself if it's a healer, Vurtne did this in one of his vids actually.
---
Ofc there's also teleport to tanaris(gnomish) or winterspring(goblin). These are very useful teleports for both factions since these locations are quite far away from any capital(mageport), especially the tanaris one. I esp. like tanaris as a alliance to get to diremaul a lot quicker. 
---
Oh and there's also a summonable chicken that buffs your party with atkspeed, and a dragonling that puts a fire damage taken increased debuff on mobs, trust me in AQ your mages will love you for this one. Both can be summoned before a fight and then trinketswapped.
---
My main is 100% set.  Tauren Warrior all the way to 60, bruh.
---
Where I flip-flop hard is on my first alt.  Hunter/Mage/Lock for farming, casual PvP, etc.  All of them have their benefits and honestly I'll probably just end up leveling all 3 on a sort of rotating shift, keeping them each on full rest XP.
---
The "community" and basic etiquette that will be established after the release of Classic will allow this issue to be self-policed. 
---
Literally as simple as: "X was rolling so that he could abuse loot trading to give it to Y, who lost the roll. Do not allow X into your PUGs, or at least not while Y is with them, as the pair are known for abusing the loot trading feature to give themselves unfair advantages with loot rolls." With a screenshot. This is entirely a non-issue if the "cOmMuNiTy" that everybody harps on both exists and does its job properly of expelling the abusers and toxic members. 
---
Right-click reporting is a new feature that needs to be heavily scrutinized and can't be policed by the community, though, because there's no way to prevent someone from using the report system (with loot trade abuse you can just not let them into your PUGs) and it's impossible to tell *who* is doing without Blizzard specifically telling you who all made their reports.
---
Hey, you can make a special ™ with ZERO special computer knowledge. 
---
Hold down alt
---
Type 0 1 5 3 on the number pad to the right of the arrow keys
---

---
*PROFIT*
---
That's still a great change, holy moly mailing stuff 1 stack at a time is painful.  
---
I don’t think tipsout making a 10:05 video where all he does is read the blue post and yak about his opinion of it really helps the community 
---
I’m on mobile and don’t have keyboards unlocked on my phone. 
---
Is name autocompletion not a vanilla feature? Private servers seem to have it.
---
The point is they exist, unlike the manlets mooching off the dwarves.
---
Check out the sorrow hill pvp videos fo inspiration on how much you can do with a mage in blues
---
Yes you get me lol. Other then your tauren should be male and your priest should be undead. We are clones lol.
---
Well now I feel like an asshole =P
---
Bfa launch would like a word. 
---
Good.
---
I carry around a like 10 trinkets as hunter as well as a few different gear pieces for pvp (mainly a beefy 2 hander)
---
LMAO. Hit em with the you don't remember this right
---
Where/when did Ion say this? I haven't heard this before.
---
It might help if I also mention that I generally only buy new games if I'm confident in either the developer or the franchise. Which means my pre-ordering of a new upcoming game is maybe once every couple years for something I already have a reasonable expectation that I'll enjoy. I only blind-buy new games if I feel like I know them well enough to trust it.
---
Whats your point? Trolls as a whole are pretty dope. 
---
Thanks for explaining that.  I’m OK with that because most people will use an Addon to gain that feature anyway.  So one less thing to worry about.
---
Auctions will also be instant sends, which means less reason to not use the AH.
---
Since you want to play a paladin THIS is the advice 4 you.  I'm 100% doing this myself, too. 
---
- you can dungeon heal with 20 points holy 
---
- you can raid heal with 30 in holy (maybe even with 20 if the raid lead doesn't know)
---
This leaves you with 21 or 31 points you can spend in the protection tree.
---
- 21 points in prot make you an okay dungeon tank - that means you will have no worries about dungeon invites and you can farm bastion and always grab the first orb
---
-31 points in prot make you an efficient AoE grinder for lashers in DM or BRD
---
There is also a 26/25/0 holy reckoning specc that's viable to kick ass if played properly (let's see what Activision Blizzard does with reckoning)
---
And in the end you converting just go full holy, team up with a warrior and face roll all your opponents in pvp while making money of playing the auction house or your professions. 
---
You see, Paladin provides a pretty big variety of options. 
---
He is getting more views than ever now...
---
Similar to how everyone thinks 16 debuff slots will make MC too easy, this is another alarmist view point that won’t affect “community” at all. It’s one thing to want something done a certain way, but another to pretend the sky is failing because you can’t have your way.
---
And less reason to undercut with a "sell now" mentality.  Which is why it's an issue for me.
---
The best ammo is from a brd or strat boss (arrows or bullets) and they drop less than a stack every run. The second best are made by engineers. AV arrows come in 3rd
---
And you don't have to watch it. Some people do find it helpful. You're basically telling people to stop liking the things you don't like. Kind of ironic, given you're on a Classic WoW sub.
---
I guess you make a good point. I am afraid min maxers will ruin WoW as a casual MMO. I miss the old community more than anything, and I think it might be wishful thinking to think of what once was. Regardless of how it ends up, I'm going to be a happy customer. I'll chill out. 
---
Time you enjoy wasting isn't wasted.
---
The only ones we get to play as are murloc-bait. I'll stick with gnomes. At least *they* lost to enemies their own size.
---
Yep - I really don't see what they would be gaining from the beta. The infrastructure is going to be the same as live - so they already have that under control. It's not some new environment they need to test. 
---
Having a beta also kills the hype. They would gladly trade a few minor undiscovered inconsistencies from 1.12 (which would be quickly pointed out and fixed AFTER launch) in order to maintain that hype. 
---
I think the game having maximum hype is in all of our best interests. An MMO lives and dies by its subscriber count - so let's stop worrying about it being 100% perfect right out of the gates.
---
Wtf are you on about? There is no delay on retail.
---
No u
---
Quivers and ammo pouches aren't any larger than a normal bag in vanilla, but you absolutely want one for the attack speed
---
There’s no “best race” per se, it depends on the situation: class, PvE, or PvP?
---
Nah, never said I didn’t like it or you don’t have to watch it. Just said it’s got a minimal effect on the community. 
---
That crowd never happy
---
I’m so glad they’re confirming all complaints on the 1.12 client in order to preserve the actual vanilla experience (such as the Kobolds running faster than walking speed) it should feel like a time capsule. I don’t mind minor QOL changes or game breaking bug fixes but other than that I’m team nochanges
---
The thing that worries me about this update is the emphasis on 1.12.  The WoW we played back in the day was everything but 1.12.   99% of the time was spent between 1.1-1.12.  So the more they mention 1.12 as their base the more I’m thinking they won’t bother making sure itemization is handled correctly. 
---
The not bothering to fix catagory has me a little worried. 
---
What are some noteworthy things that everyone should login and check ASAP? 
---
Trying to think of any changes that occured that were a bummer "oh you can't do that anymore" kind of things.
---
Literally no clue what line you're on now. 
---
Sounds like we should be getting a release date soon. I am almost fully erect. 
---
Also post 60, vanilla armor restrictions are basically meaningless. Just because you can wear mail doesn't mean that your best piece isn't cloth or leather.

This is the one. All others will be removed.
---
I know. And I literally have made my talent spec for my 5th alt. 
---
&gt; Your best bet is trying to find something low to mid price range which most of the people who rush to 60
---
I'm going to be Bronze Tube Kingpin. Every alliance member will want one for quick and easy XP at level 25. They should have 1G by then. So I'll be buying all them, all the bronze, making all the tubes, and listing for 1G.
---
Kind of a weird thought process imo, just because I don't want extra talents that were never part of vanilla doesn't mean I think 1.12 is the best patch, that's a massive assumption on your part.
---
Saying that I'm hard to take seriously because I think changing a game that blizzard has said themselves is meant to be a "museum piece" seems hilarious, just because you disagree with me doesn't mean my opinions are absurd.
---
If you read my earlier comments you'd see exactly why I'm not for class changes, as they can potentially take away parts of the class people already enjoy in the effort to balance them.

---
More effect than what you're contributing.
---
I'm doing the pala + mage combo with a friend. It goes well while questing regular and since I'm going to be prot specced (iall mail/plate gear and including consecration) we're also doing some decent aoe grind.
---
I'm surely keeping some spirit and heal gear, too since you never know what you need at your next dungeon run :)
---
If it is an upgrade yes. If its a dps item and not bis for healers (there are a few) then maybe ask first.
---
So I’ve mostly played a Mage, but my main alt during Cata was a priest and I played it in every scenario other than raids and loved him. He was a lot of fun in 5-mans and in pvp (especially arena). I always had the feeling I wouldn’t enjoy raid healing though, so I’ve never pushed to main a healer. For Classic, I have the same sense, so I’m not looking to heal right now.
---
&gt; for PvP they are great, especially 1v1.
---
Oh! I didn't realize 1v1 was an endgame game mode! Can't wait to see you convince players to main Balance for all the 1v1 action at endgame!
---
Good catch.  Do people actually farm the bosses for ammo?  Seems like a time waster for such a small DPS increase.
---
I read somewhere that there's an addon that makes every gather quest show up as "wolf dicks" - no matter what the quest text says.  So going 1-60 you just gather thousands of wolf dicks for the denizens of Azeroth.  
---
What does correctly mean to you?
---
Well that wasn't much info.... :(
---
brother, please make sure aggro ranges are correct. I felt that you were not pulling mobs you should've in the demo
---
lol 18h/day is a LOT, i don't care how you spin it.
---
I agree, loot trading in Classic will be a major issue. I also agree that we should not let this issue die until it is answered.
---
However, I am quite sure that ActiBlizz understands that loot trading will probably cost them hundreds of thousands of subscriptions, if the loot trading is implemented as it was in Retail.
---
But if loot trading is ONLY active when in raids AND master looter on...well, than props to ActiBlizz, because this type of loot trading (raid only AND master lotter only) can only be welcomed.
---
TBC also had the Kharzan music, which was just so good.
---
Depends if they are bop on launch or not
---
1-59 Herb/Skinning - Save some Skins for Eng Goggles Skill Ups / Save some herbs for Alchemy Skill Ups
---
Switch to Alch/Eng at 60. 
---
Now you have a Alchemy as your primary source of income and Eng for PvP/PvE.
---
&gt;dick-exposing goggles
---
lmfao.
---
They have said that they only plan to use sharding during launch, and it was not totally ignored. It was specifically addressed. 
---
Literally every other troll tribe is doing better than the entire Gnomish race. 
---
This is completely wrong. They're adding the hour delay back into Classic.
---
This is exactly what I took from it. In order for it to be a classic summer it can’t come at or towards the end. So now I’m hyped for July!
---
HAI GUYZ IM FROM WORLD OF WARCRAFT THE LEGION AND I WAS JUST WONDERING WHICH COOL RACE WILL I PLAY AS A DRUID!?
---
Having your enemies run in fear is what it means to be a warlock. If you want burst just spec Destro or roll a different class.
---
Just cut to the chase and do it now.
---
So satisfying
---
They explicitly said at Blizzcon that they only have 1.12 data, which they will hold as sacrosanct.
---
There will be no "itemization".
---
As to where I grew up with CS 1.6 so I was never really into arena shooters.
---
God I can't wait. The promise of a Blizz supported Classic server is something I've dreamed of for years. I'm praying this is a success and they eventually make a BC server. BC is my favorite "version" of a game I've ever played but Classic is still in my top 10
---
It was introduced on retail only recently, Legion or somthing. I think you're using some addon.
---
give me wod or die
---
There’s almost only caster drops in there though. It’s not the best example. 
---
It’s not the how, it’s the when. 
---
While there's a slim chance they are, considering they are going with 16 debuff limit and other larger changes from later patches off the bat I highly doubt they'll keep lotus bop. They did say a foundation of 1.12
---
Well, loot trading IS THE ADVANTAGE. And it is also FAIR, because ActiBlizz want this system in Classic.
---
Mentality have nothing to do with that. People ALWAYS behave in regards to what they KNOW. If you KNOW that you cannot use an item, most likely you won't roll need on it. But if you KNOW that you can TRADE that item, even if you can't use it...well, A LOT of people WILL roll need on A LOT of items.
---
Not because they are DICKS, but because THEY CAN.
---
Miyamoto once made a comment to the affect that a game released too soon will always be garbage. I think he implied this is true regardless of future patches 
---
We already had a beta, it was 14 years ago.
---
Get a credit card.
---
Is that 3 pts from imp renew really worth it? Personally I would always rather have more holy crit. Also I feel matyrdom is way better than the health from Imp fort imo (especially for PVP)
---
&gt;Also I believe they have a 1.12 client in office they can verify.
---
They 100% do (and they said so). I can't believe some people really think Blizzard cannot set up an internal 1.12 installation.
---
Why not just blessing of protection
---
Test
---
I never said to ignore them but the guy was specifically asking about what to farm in a new economy.
---
A new economy doesnt mean you spend time farming materials to sell that have 0 market demand. Copper and Mithril ore will be in high demand while people level BS and Engi.
---
New Economy practices =/= banking materials for later.  
---
Yea who needs those 2 subscriptions when the real one is around the corner
---
If they are a healer then it is fair game. a lot of Prebis healing gear is cloth.
---
Wonder if we get an Open All button 
---
Noon GMT+1
---
;)
---
&gt;I'm planning on going alliance warlock in classic, and want to use mara as my main farming method. 
---
Right here buddy
---
Items are released/updated during their appropriate patch.  You don't want 1.10 items that are better than MC gear at launch.   You want to look forward to new items/updated items every patch.  
---
It's even worse without addons, you have to click + drag the stuff in and out of the mailbox, no shift click
---
For certain fights or if they are pushing for high parses dmf week, absolutely. Most of the time all but the super hardcore will use thorium though.
---
For everything else I just use vendor arrows, can't be bothered to spend 10 minutes crafting arrows for a dungeon and AV arrows are too inconvenient to pick up.
---
wtf blizzard I can't frontstab pls fix
---
&gt; but its a seriously problem pretty much only in level 60 dungeons 
---
Clearly, you have NO IDEA what are you talking about. It is a serious problem in ANY dungeon level, because the items from dungeons are very good for LEVELING.
---
And since leveling in Classic is about 12 times slower than retail...ANY UPGRADE counts.
---
wtf blizzard I can't frontstab wtf wtf
---
Yes, it is an ignorant question.
---
Addon devs need Beta.
---
Same, which means it will definitely be that week.
---
Thank you so much. This comment is amazingly helpful
---
Depends if you enjoy healing?  My GF plays healers in almost every game we play - MMORPGs, Overwatch, etc.  She enjoys it (though she's doing something different in Classic).  
---
I love tanking, I always tank, even if it's slow to level, I love the role.  Psychologically, some people take pleasure from things others might find boring.   Look at people who play Euro Truck Simulator or Farming Simulator - it might seem dull and pointless to a lot of us, but they're obviously enjoying it.
---
Eh a few dollars a month is something 
---
That depends. Do you like healing? If so then no life is fine. If you are concerned you may not be able to earn gold. Healers have ways of making loot in classic wow like anyone else. 
---
so, how expensive do you think the Lesser Magic Wand is going to be at the start?
---
Can alchemy bring in good money just by buying herbs off the AH?
---
How about AVOID ALL this CRAP (screenshots, 1 hour talking in /trade about ninja looting, etc) and have NO LOOT TRADING AT ALL?
---
if they did wotlk spell batching maybe, if they have original spell batching I hope you enjoy watching people die 4 seconds after you kill them lol.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fh1wVvAy4es&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3m14s
---
I definitely have less time in my life this time around for the Classic grind, but I'll still love the time I'm able to spend. The grinding gives me so much satisfaction and I know I have stuff to do every day I login. 
---
Why do we need add ons right out of the gate ? 
---
Since announcement I got this problem :d
---
Narrowed down to 2 classes so far,but sometimes still I change my mind :D As I wont level up alts(thats what I think atm) and most likely will play Classic  many many years, wanna choose wisely .
---
So.... being shackled to a credit card and interest rates on the payment is... *better* than just doing a preorder?
---
It's apples and oranges.
---
What the hell have 16 slots debuffs in common with loot trading?
---
STAND BY FOR 10 MINUTE YOUTUBE VIDEOS.
---
Nostalrius was a BLAST! It broke my heart when they had to close. I thought I was done with MMO's prior to that having had to wander the MMO wasteland for years after I quit WoW during Cata and EvE Online. Then Nostalrius made me realize what I was missing after all these years. Tried to get into FFXIV after Nostalrius closed but the lack of bonuses on any gear makes the pursuit of better gear boring. Incremental stat increases are distinctly uninspiring. Now that Classic is coming, my excitement is at a peak level!!! Either rolling a dwarf pally or priest as my main
---
Lol you've really taken his comment to heart haven't you? If I was you I'd stop consuming so many soy products and maybe your bollocks will grow back. 
---
god i wish human females were real
---
Blood in the water!!
---
&gt; The main difference is there will be a little more ninja looting 
---
If by a little more you mean like 50 times more, yes, you are right.
---
I've wanted to do a shadow priest again, but there's a large part of me that wants to play a mage. I might just have two characters. One for playing with friends, and the other for just EXP grinding. 
---
rip ironfoe
---
It’s two examples of the Classic community being alarmist on insignificant issues.
---
Things break all the time. They need to test it. And what kind of hype are you talking about, this game is well known and you can literally play it right now if you want.
---
No mention of spell batching which was the biggest gameplay change in the demo by miles.
---
go paladin and become pvp jesus 
---
If they can add items when they release Blackwing Lair, why can't they check what other items were added at that patch?
---
You sweet, summer child.
---
No mention at all of spell batching. Gouging Blinks or Vanishing Death Coils? **Oh you can’t do that anymore**
---
Source please?
---
Why is it a great change then? Pain is good.
---
As many fury warriors as possible.
---
Well i have a feeling this is on the list of only .05% of the original population probably has any idea what this is, nbd.
---
I have a feeling Moonwalking won't be in. Makes me sad.
---
?????? They definitely need a beta what the hell. They need to ensure classic wow runs smooth on the new downported client. Saying vanilla wow was the beta is lunacy. They need testing, as evident at how much they had wrong in the demo. 
---
Interface, graphics, performance. There are quite a lot of things that don't fall under any of those tags.
---
After todays blue - they won’t do it. Be &gt;9000% sure about it. EOM
---
Here is what Blizzard said at Blizzcon:
---
&gt; first and foremost is authenticity as our goal
---
&gt; want to create and experience that feels just like 2006 World of Warcraft
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=1811
---
That would be the ideal for sure. As a software engineer who deals with DDL and DML deploys quite often, I can tell you that they probably don't have the data needed to make that happen across all patches of Vanilla. I'm resigning myself to being content with a game that fosters the same pacing, community, and gameplay that Vanilla offered. Anything that brings us closer to Vanilla beyond those three things are just icing on this tasty cake that I'll be devouring.
---
I hope they go this route. Let the pserver guys go in break everything on beta so they can fix it before live. 
---
Moonwalking definitely won’t be in because the game will be running on the modern engine. People are highly underestimating how much difference the game engine makes especially in PvP.
---
I know you think your hyperbole is correct, but it really isn't.
---
It's so easy to avoid it's ridiculous, and it won't even extend into 95% of raiding situations cause most of that will happen in guild.  More ninja looting in pug 5 mans isn't game breaking.
---
Also are crafted Stronghold Gauntlets and Deathgrips from Strath for the same effect.
---
When will then be now?!
---
Up until Warlords of Draenor, I always found it impossible to entirely quit WoW. It was seriously like a drug. I’d take a break for a couple of months and then before I knew it, the itch would be back. I went as far as deleting my characters and giving away my gold several times to try and deter myself from returning to the timesink. Of course, it never worked. 
---
I’m looking forward to Classic WoW but man...here’s hoping I can tone down my time spent on the game. It’s just really hard with how easily the game sucks you in! I wouldn’t trade my time spent in this virtual world for anything though, honestly. So much nostalgia and a lot of great memories.
---
Expect it to be 6 months. Earlier date would be a good surprise.
---
He hath spoken
---
Just make items soulbond if you need and traedable if its greed.
---
Wait what?
---
yeah I know it won't be in unless they hack together something for it, but its probably on that list.
---
I think they must be mistaken because we are so info-starved about classic that even the tiniest mention of beta would have been huge news, and I can't find reference to this anywhere.
---
Raids will often bring 1 shadow priest for shadow weaving
---
I want to play vanilla wow not WOTLK , lol.
---
MC being too easy because of 16 debuffs + 1.10 dungeon itemization + 1.12 talents is still a massive real problem hanging out there that absolutely is not a chicken little situation.
---
I dont believe people automatically become dicks on the internet, but I do subscribe to the idea that we have evolved a new generation of internet dicks that most of us internet veterans have learned to tolerate.
---
That said, Im thoroughly excited to witness server/community reputation take effect in full force.  Real, player driven consequence; a lesson in common courtesy.  The private server community is so segmented it is easy to gravitate to the project that best fits you and your preferred environment.  Slam them all into one final, official project and the real melting pot that was once vanilla will reteach the lesson of 'dont shit where you eat' to the masses.
---
It only negatively affects people who gamed it for an advantage, so like 0.01% of the player base. It's going to be a benefit for everyone else if they leave it out.
---
&gt; installments on post-release
---
Why would a preorder be involved here?
---
Gnomes are OP in PvP, seriously.
---
It wouldn't surprise me if they consider the old behavior a bug rather than a deliberate design choice since it could lead to counterintuitive interactions. Most players expect their actions to occur immediately.
---
&gt; especially when your company is in the gutter and doing horrible with every other game
---
Jesus dude lol. Can we not do this stuff? Unnecessary. 
---
Why isn't Paladin /sit reckoning working????
---
I think You have to be subbed if You want to get into Beta.
---
It’s still a change though. It’s not authentic, no matter how you spin it.
---
&gt; But instant delivery changes the dynamics of how mail works.
---
It's pretty minor.
---
I'm not sure why people still keep talking about sharding. We already know there will be temporary sharding in the starting zones at launch.
---
Hi, /u/lolzexd
---
Making sure certain items don't get released too powerful too early on so that they overshadow other items. Like the 5 man items got changed many times throughout vanilla. In 1.12 the blue 5 man drops are better than a lot of MC items for example. By releasing with only 1.12 data you would effectively make a lot of raid drops worthless and take away from the gameplay experience. This is just one example.
---
You seem to care an awful lot about what two strangers are talking about. Shame your mom raised you to be a busy body, instead of your dad raising you to be a man.
---
That already acknowledged it as something they were looking into, so they don’t see it as a bug. The fact that it was technological restriction is not relevant to if it should be in the game. It is a big factor in Classic pvp flowing and behaving in a similar fashion to 2004-2006.
---
My dumbass thought something with mail armor, like some visual but or something. I'm dumb
---
You will be fine. You have to remember as a Shaman you are a golden child and if thy don't like it you will take your totems else where. Honestly as this dude just pointed out they want 8 shammies per raid. Now I am no economist but to me thats a sellers market. They are looking for 8 of yall for 40 people. now I am not math magician but it seems to me that if they think they are going to be able to bully all 8 of you into being what they want you to do.
---
I would simply recommend to that Mage baby or Rogue beard. In between their autistic screaming of course. That if they wish for a resto shaman they may feel free to level one. If not as I said buyers market and all that.
---
I haven't subbed for 9 years, I think I will be fine. lmao
---
huh?
---
Well maybe not a dodge because at least as arms you are getting that sweet overpower crit/hit off.
---
Imp fort vs martyrdom is more a personal preference and could go either way. I like the extra stm and don't really cast enough to warrant martyrdom. It is also nice for groups and dungeons. 
---
As for imp Regen, the main focus and philosophy of my build is: spend as little time casting as possible and aim for zero down time. So, 90% of the time, the only heal I ever use will be Regen. Keeping Mana efficiency in mind, having the extra heal for no extra Mana is extremely beneficial.
---
Also, with imp Regen and inner fire, you should never have to use pw:s, which is very Mana inefficient. Occasionally you will have to cast a quick heal, e.g. if you pull too many mobs, which is why I get the reduced interrupt for heals. Otherwise, and excluding mind blast, I try not to use any spells with cast times and spend as much time using my wand as possible.
---
They could have said this a week after the demo.
---
The ONLY thing I want to be added is a taunt on Pally and Druid tanks.
---
It is impossible to get both Premed and Cold blood.
---
I really hope people remember we can't be comparing the release of Classic to private servers, especially Nost.
---
Even though Nost was amazing, they likely had a *lot* of stuff bugged. These aren't "changes" they're actual fixes 
---
Upvote from me.
---
I love to heal. But you picked the wrong healer, for what you want to do. So pick the Warlock.
---
I need it 
---
I NEED IT
---
That would be fine if a ragtag group of volunteers didn't already prove it was totally feasible based on old web archives.
---
It would matter because otherwise you wouldn't be playing classic original wow. And dont call me shirley. 
---
Yes, there are many items you can make that can sell for profit.  Some recipes are going to be hard to get like Greater Fire Protection Potion but can be very profitable in the long run.   There are potions I didn't know about that are released when ZG drops that really become profitable.
---
even if people "steal" items from you in leveling dungeons, who tf cares, you use those items for like 5-10 levels before u get a quest reward that replaces it.  Is it bad? yes, id prefer no loot trading option but its not the end of the world outside of level 60 dungeons.
---
They've got the ability to monitor how many people are playing classic, which gives them way more info than who resubbed the same month it's released. 
---
I play Druid, because I'm gross and no one loves me.
---
yeah? name those 10 trinkets then, a warrior has like 5 different gear sets or more
---
Well the community sucking versus being gone are two totally different things. It’s just something that could severely tarnish the experience. Who knows what else won’t be the same. 
---
Why would there be a beta? They can ignore feedback without any effort already. 
---
My problem is I always struggle with the late 30s-60 grind. I love the leveling/questing experience from 1-35. It’s absolute fun making my way through Dun Morogh/Elwynn Forest, Loch Modan/Westfall, Redridge/Wetlands/Duskwood, and then STV. I really enjoy all of those zones and how most of the quests are in close proximity to one another. The dungeons are simple to get to and group for as well - Deadmines is right there in Moonbrook, Stockades is in the middle of Stormwind, Gnomer is south of Ironforge, and even SM, while all the way in Tirisfal, is usually always being ran by people. 
---
Once I hit 37/38, leveling really seems to fall off. Experience gain starts to become a slow drip, quests become spread across two continents, and it’s a lot harder to find groups for higher-level dungeons. I always seem to hit a brick wall when this happens and the highest I’ve recently gotten a character to in the Vanilla experience is Level 40. After that, it just becomes a drag and I start to lose interest. 
---
Is there a universally agreed upon “best way” to do 40-60? Or is the slow grind and time-consuming questing inevitable in that level range? I play Alliance, by the way.
---
Nearly zero. All information points to no change from 1.12 or best effort anyway.
---
10-20 silver off the AH, more in the leveling zones for convenience reasons. People are extremely quick to get enchanting and start making them.
---
This 100%. The problem with using a smite build is you will have to drink often which isnt time efficient nor that economical. Granted, if you have a mage friend the 2nd issue becomes moot but the time issue still is there. The best thing about this build is you can still loot while having SW:P hurt the next mob saving time when you have to gather so many boar livers for instance. 
---
Once you get Shadowform, that is when you can start to consider going full shadow to finish leveling though I never did. There are quite a few good dungeons post lvl 40 and healers are almost always in demand. Not to say you cant heal as shadow but it's definitely easier to do when you have something towards healing
---
Sounds good to me. There's no reason to bring kluges for 2005-era problems into a 2019 deployment. It was very susceptible to abuse; there was a point where instant cast spells could be interrupted with scripts and add-ons.
---
Knowing the intricacies of server processing shouldn't be a prerequisite to excel in any game.
---
Weird flex but ok.  I personally wont resub til classic but to think Blizz isnt capable of collecting data like that is ignorant.  The real complaint should be what actions are taken with that data in mind.
---
If not including loot trading is not an option, Devs should make it impossible for people who press 'need' to trade items. 
---
Haha, and my brother works for Activision as head timeliner and he also said July! You heard it here first folks.
---
Exactly, there's are website where you can look up if an item exists in that particular patch.  It will also show you what stats the item had at that patch.  
---
Any news on sharding/phasing/loot sharing? 
---
Yeah obviously stuff is subject to change, but i'm 99% sure their target date is July
---
Yeah, it's easy for me to demand these things to be implemented when I don't have to deal with the headaches involved with finding/implementing them.   
---
I hope you know it was /s lol.
---
It’s not a problem though. It’s how the game worked. Spell batching was also present in TBC and WotLK and was a huge part of the meta.
---
Scripts are an entirely different issue. Being able to Gouge a Mage’s Blink is a pretty simple gameplay mechanic, has nothing to do with knowing anything about server processes.
---
I have 400+ days /played of Vanilla and I’ve never heard of being able to interrupt instant casts, but obviously it would be a massive problem if that were possible. /shrug
---
That's 6 hours to eat/sleep/masturbate/stretch legs/ maybe go to the store/ masturbate etc .
---
18 hours gaming in one day is fucking massive 
---
lots of useful information, thanks!
---
Classics coming out on my birthday! Woot!
---
Great update, but still not a single word on the old school epic mounts in any of the updates so far... I'm starting to get worried.
---
Can't even voice my concerns on the b.net forums because I don't have a level 10 character in US realms :(
---
Core game systems?
---
YES. With that said I personally I often pass on really nice upgrades for a mage/lock when Im healing lowlvl dungeons as enh shaman. I dont need the gear for quest and I will get all the healgear I need from quests and drops they dont need and its really not a big deal in lowlvl dungeons.
---
Weird, remembered it wrong, it was Elitist Jerks 10 man onyxia which was a world first. Quickly resulted in people doing 5,4, then 3 mans.
---
The 10 man was a big deal, i remember everyone commenting on the shaman who filmed it having a weird stutter step method of cancelling unnecessary heals.
---
[Here it is](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=1jvYD0AwNR4)
---
To be fair, I almost resubbed early to play around until classic hits. And I HATE retail wow.
---
You are bound to me, demon!
---
Most likely the math for fighting was pulled from the new client, I think the base dodge party etc got changed near the end of BC maybe??
---
Is the gear an upgrade for what youre currently doing? Then roll need.
---
Drama queen...
---
Thanks for adding the bit about looting, which definitely will save a lot of time in the long run. One of the most important aspects of a leveling build is trying to save those seconds, and fractions of a second, in little things; looting being a great example. It all adds up and, after a week or two of /played, it makes a big difference.
---
#WHAT IS UP MY DUDES IT'S YA BOI BACK AGAIN WITH SOME *CRAZY* NEW FACTS ABOUT CLASSIC WOW! I CANT WAIT TO SHARE THE NEW INFO WITH YOU GUYS SO PLEASE HIT THAT BELL, SUBSCRIBE ON MY INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT AND SWIPE ME LEFT ON TINDER. 
---
I highly doubt we are going to get progressive itemization. Either path you go down there's gonna be points where raid gear is lacking compared to blues.
---
Reaching content complete doesn't need beta in an emulation. No content is being built from scratch. What is likely needed is a stress test, and this only needs to be a short test or 2 to gather the performance metrics.
---
This is just so good
---
If not including loot trading is not an option, Devs should make it impossible for people who press 'need' to trade items.
---
There are still employees that work for Blizzard?!
---
No point answering trolls, but just wanted to point out that dwarf also has desperate prayer, AND they can immune a fear.. :))
---
Oh, that's negotiable 
---
Badge, earthstrike, carrot, jumper cables, slayers crest, gnomish cloaking device, pvp trinket, dm trinket, blackhands, mark of the champion, and seal of the dawn. That's 11 and just off the top of my head trinkets that I use every week, probably have a few more engi trinkets lying around. Plus I need to fit raid consumes and a resist set for aq or naxx
---
A tank has like 5 sets, but they will share at least some pieces, a dps warrior might carry 3 with 2 of them sharing quite a few pieces (world buffed vs unbuffed dps and an off-tank set)
---
it's not if you're nostalgic about Lunar Festival, and other mail-sending quests.
---
About multiple attachments - well, it's one of the QoL that don't really matter. Some may be nostalgic about the UI appearance, but nobody will want to be forced to send each stack in separate mail. 
---
totally agree with this
---
I’d love to think so but do you really feel that they get a say in whether or nog information is released? I would think they get zero input into how the game is dealt with from a PR/Marketing aspect.
---
Human memory is fucking garbage on its own. Add 10 years of available pservers who might or might not get some things wrong and you're setup for disaster. There will be hundreds of people swearing to their lifes they clearly remember something some way with reality being different.
---
I'm curious if that might be the case. I'm not 100% familiar with how loot trading works on live, but some people have mentioned that only greed rolled items are tradable. If that is the case then loot trading would not give rise to the abuse we are worried about. That being said, it's inclusion is still an oddity, particularly in light of the most recent blue post that said there are already various "bugs" in Classic that differ from vanilla but aren't worth fixing like multiple mails, but here we have them doing extra work to implement a system nobody wants.
---
How about I tank you heal through 5-mans ‘till 60 and I walk the puppy on non-raid nights?
---
early WoD, as I remember. Could be 6.1 or 6.2.
---
I want to let my expectations run amok
---
Done deal. The perfect way to grow old
---
Some neat tips in there!  It will be interesting to see how these things shake out when everyone's trying to do all the same things at once, though.
---
I'm just going to sit back and enjoy my guaranteed income from vendoring leather though.
---
You can't make a classic meme with retail models and void elves.
---
Your post makes the strongest argument for why it should not be allowed: "Not because they are DICKS, but because THEY CAN".
---
My belief in whether people are good or bad is irrelevant to the argument that the option to allow people to trade loot should not be included in the game.
---
Just because you claim ActiBlizz wants the mechanic included in no way provides evidence of whether the mechanic is fair or not.
---
There will always be people who roll need on items that they can't use, that has been around since Vanilla and will continue to be around. Implementing a system of allowing loot to be traded doesn't solve this problem because the people ninja looting items they can't use will not trade them back to someone more deserving who can use the item. 
---
The need/greed mechanic allows for people to roll on items for the exact purpose of selling them, however the system relies on the integrity of the participating members to uphold its value. If people ninja loot items, the community as a whole will eventually blacklist that player and will force that behavior to the fringes of the wow community. 
---
Using the argument you provided in your post, the loot trading system opens the door for people to collude on loot drop rolls, and therefore the system should not be included in Vanilla. Pretty simple stuff.
---
Having at least 1 disc priest in a raid is great. PI, your HUGE mana pool and Improved Spirit buff are all huge pluses. They are also great in dungeon runs
---
Ah, you're right.  Should have used the original distracted boyfriend meme. I have failed the community!
---
I might be wrong, but I thought melee group shamans are supposed to have enough in enhance to grab the enhancing totem talent? That's 12 points in enhancement right there. I don't really think that talent makes a huge difference but if you are gonna put a shaman in the melee group I would think you might choose one with those talents.
---
Let me know if I'm totally wrong on this please lol.
---
Hi Kaivax! please show the guys [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aoakvx/progressive_itemization_study/) and [this](https://itemization.github.io/).
---
I don't know dude, I wasn't the one who first said it.
---
FUCKING ACTIVISION
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
It's a big thing if somebody needs specific item asap and forces you to travel across the lands delivering it.  
---
So the issue is big enough to be noted. However other issues might be more complex and they cat put off mail delivery for a while.
---
&gt;Sounds like yes, and while June is most likely not the release month, July might be.
---
if it's mid-July, it definitely won't be the case
---
SLAY THEM ALL
---
It affects how the AH is used, which is pretty big.  Affects second accounts and other things as well.
---
Patch progression wasn't just "adding items" in Vanilla. Things were added, removed and changed. As said, Blizzard only have the 1.12 data, no earlier. Classic will have content released in chunks (which obviously include items) but nothing will change it's value.
---
Sry I just love cataclysm Elwyn Wood song 
---
I wish human panda females were real...
---
Done, done and done!
---
The greatest piece of non information ever. They truly are becoming the kings of repackaging and rewording things we already knew. 
---
Downvote me all you like, it’s nice you’re all excited whenever you see blue text, but this was an extremely padded summary of other blue posts and interviews we’d seen this year already. This was just done because they can see people are starting to get pissy again.
---
Time to cancel and get your money back.  Use it to buy hot pockets and mountain dew.  
---
Anthem is already being discounted in Europe. Apex Legends is kicking the shit out of it because it was released as an actually completed game. 
---
Also cause premed is just a pretty shit talent. Combo points aren't exactly hard to come by as a sub rogue.
---
It's because a ton of people are basing their feedback on private servers, not the original Vanilla servers so they're bound to get things wrong. As long as people go "Oh, okay I guess that's right" it's fine, I just have to laugh at the people who insist the private server's got it right and Blizzard's own official, authentic 1.12 servers are wrong.
---
All the shows will be watched on the seconds monitor while I level. I can’t wait
---
Hell yeah dude
---
Excellent. PM the address and let me know which server &lt;3
---
Probably they mean these:
---
1. [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) login instead of typing WOW account name and password
---
2. Wrong "Connecting-&gt;Authenticating-&gt;Handshaking-&gt;Success" sequence
---
3. Launcher
---
Chill out man
---
Incorrect. You obviously never raided in Classic.
---
Too late. I already did, lol.
---
I'm just leveling up and transmogging until the day comes. Gotta love virtual Barbie.
---
It's pretty uncommon for Blizz to launch things without betas, so I'd be pretty surprised if we didn't get one.
---
You could also just buy it. Equiping a BoE is saving you gold. Saving 50g or making 50g is the same thing. The fact that your class can equip the item doesn't change that.
---
Nintendo needs more commendations. They don't always put out a winner (they can't *all* be) but it feels like they still have devs who love gaming and creating whereas Blizzard has decayed from a For Gamers My Gamers company to Activision wearing a Blizzard mask. 
---
&gt;Raiding is the only time the game sucks.
---
Fixed.
---
I hope you’ve put some consideration into what ‘face’ and ‘skin color’ you will be using on your fifth alt. 
---
The assumptions in this comment and the opinion that "it should be done because the data is out there" have no basis in the reality of software engineering.
---
uh huh, so who do u think needs more bag space? guy who needs 5 sets or hunter with some trinkets? yeah I thought so
---
If only there were new wow classic content creators trying to break through!
---
He might not finding very fun when he spends hours aiming for this playstyle, and end up dying to 3 mobs anyways and realise he has to waste money to respec. Sometimes listening to advices is also a good way to have fun.
---
As I said. I got them confused. Anthem was made by BIO-WARE a company that was amazing but frankly had it's hay day. Not looking forward to anything they make and haven't for a while.
---
oh yeah duh my bad lol.  Well in that case you could try to reset the fight as many times as needed until he's dead.
---
Only on the internet do people bitch and moan about links they don't have to click on
---
&gt; have already resub’d for Classic 
---
how is that even possible? Are they subbing to waste like 60$ for nothing?
---
Didn't realize it was a competition? I was just pointing out that hunters do in fact have space issues
---
What's the gear requirements for dm farm??
---
&gt;pre-order shit
---
but that doesn't mean buying something that you don't want. And, when people sub for retail, it's not classic.
---
The one part I'm not looking for is how slow you move until you can afford your first mount. I love the quests but some of the turn ins can be painful. One of the reasons I like playing warlock is the mount.
---
Yeah I mean it means you'll have a bit easier time sending materials around. But it doesn't strike me as something that's going to have anything more than a negligible impact on the community/experience. While I'm totally for not making changes, this one is pretty minor. 95% of the time you won't even notice it, I'd guess.
---
Have you listened to blue please lately? the first season is a lot of him saying, "erm umm i have 3 hours to fill, uhh what do i say"
---
Dont get me wrong, I love me some blue please but the first season is eh
---
Fearmongering will poison the community even quicker
---
Quests 
---
I always looked at healing as if I was playing a pet class and all the other people I heal are my minions. Classic wow was one of my favorite times to play a healer. Like another commenter said, PVP healing was fucking awesome because you could have a subpar group but your heals can Bridge that gap and bring the group to victory since so few people played healers in pvp.
---
But sharding IS more of less confirmed
---
well the question was "is bag space a problem for HUNTERS" so the answer is compared to other classes its not, if the question was "is bag space a problem?" then yes sure everyone could technically use more bag space 
---
Argh, such a short post! A little frustrating not gonna lie, was hoping for a *little* more info than that.
---
Now we're going to have to wait another 2-3 months for another update, which will most likely be the beta announcement. Blizzard! y u do dis? ;_;
---
Good point, pala will have 3 gear sets 
---
if frost reflectors work on AoE spells when classic launches, i'm gonna shit a brick.
---
they currently *do* work on AoE spells on most private servers, and it makes that shit SO OP.
---
So classic made be entirely different from private servers.... which would might be an issue to people who have put in tons of hours learning the wrong version of the game!
---
Nice little tips for beginner but the ear raping music at the beginning and the end sets me off.
---
Yes, but I finally decided on warlock (I think). Its like a cross between mage and hunter so I feel like it will be a good starting toon.
---
As a player that has not logged since about 1.3 could someone tell me what loot trading is ?
---
Yup that’s true, it will leave you less quickly if it’s fully levelled, but it will frequently go to yellow ( less dps) and u have to feed it high level food 
---
I do not believe the content being made by these people helps the community, especially since vanilla's social dynamic existed perfectly well without them.      
---
         
---
Classic's social community can succeed on its own merits; it doesn't need their monetized help.
---
Hahahaha You've some serious fucking autismo action going on man, chill out and stop REEEEEing. 
---
&gt; Classic will have MULTIPLE items / mail, but the 1 hour delay from Vanilla will be in Classic.
---
But part of the vanilla experience was having to stand there and wait while you clicked to open each item as a separate delivery, even if it was sent using the multi-mail addon. XD
---
There is ~~no~~ one spot in raids for a shadow priest I'm afraid.
---
I think its the difference in values. Sure all businesses care about money, but a lot of western developers lately have a hard time objectively looking at the quality of their game as long as they're making money. If FF14 or Nintendo's constant delays for quality are any indication, there's a certain pride thats attached to that work. Maybe I didn't word this the best, but there does seem to be a difference in how they value their games. 
---
Druid is best class, don't be hatin'.
---
But I am rolling Warlock.
---
I think it works. You see how it is in retail and the dude is looking back to an old model. 
---
Be nice if they're address the concern of spell batching, regardless of people's stance on the matter, it'd be nice to know what Blizzard are thinking. 
---
Number 14
---
I have played WoW for yrs but never listended to the music. definitly plan on listening to hit this time through
---
&gt;Is it the greatest gaming soundtrack of all time?
---
Its good music, but I would hardly call it the best video game music ever made in the history of video games.
---
So, I have this idea for a great movie. It's about two gnomes who find a bracelet of power, and they have to take it to the Burning Steppes and cast it into the Cauldron. They form the Brotherhood of the Bracelet. Along the way they're trailed by a murloc named Gottom, who's obsessed with the bracelet, and nine bracelet bogeymen. It could be a three-parter, called 'Ruler of the Bracelet'. The first part would be called 'The Brotherhood of the Bracelet', followed by 'A Couple of Towers', with the climactic ending called 'Hey, the King's Back!'"
---
Yes, most gaming subreddits have a chokehold on developer's nuts and can bitch and moan until action is taken. 
---
You honestly think there's a better vanilla PvP class than shadow priest?  I'd love to hear what you think is the best.
---
Yea the thing is though Spriest fear sucks ass lolol.
---
Alchemy will always be most demanded. All that fire resistance potions, flasks, etc.
---
Yes, because it helps my role.
---
I have the easiest solution ever. If the master looter miss-loots an item to a player, *tough shit.* No tickets accepted for looting mistakes. No loot trading. It's your fault if you miss-loot a piece of gear.
---
Mind telling me why?
---
Nope, you can get brought along like you say as a chain healer and buff bot. That being said, I found raiding as such a spec pretty miserable and was much happier raiding full resto. I did miss blowing up people in BGs but learned to adapt. Mana Tide actually finds some occasional pvp usage for sustained fights when spamming LHW is blowing away your mana.
---
ty.
---
Won't be any news about this because it's the big surprise from Blizzard after you resub. "Forgot to tell you there will be sharding in full effect. P.S. everything is cross realm as well and server communities mean nothing to our shareholders."
---
Classic* summer child. 
---
Oh great, so as a holy paladin Im going to have to hope that Mages, Warlocks, and Priests aren't play-- oh wait they are some of the most played classes in the game, well I certainly hope I can heal with gear with no int on it. Will be tough, but when the group wipes Its not my fault.
---
Eh, humans kind of have a history of trying to marginalize the rights of other groups of people, even when those rights don't even directly impact them.
---
It's also kind of an odd list of things to mention imo. Like, some of those were definitely hot topics after the demo but there are bigger fish to fry than warlock pets disappearing for instance. 
---
I welcome any communication I just feel like if that's the entire list they came up with updates for after like 3 months of no communication it's a bit of a weak one.
---
At this point, I am under the impression that they are finishing up a very large list of consistency checks. After they finish that list, I expect a beta will not be far behind as another look over.  
---
So it took them like 5 months to tell us that they're going to fix some of the super obvious bugs that we saw in the demo?
---
And in the next ~5 months the game will be finished, fixing the million issues still at hand?
---
Same. My uncle is a gnome inside of classic, he confirmed july. 
---
Same for me, lock or Druid I’ll guess we’ll see when the time comes lol
---
I mean, if loot trading is in the game my guild and group of friends will definitely abuse it. That said, loot trading should NOT be in the game. If you fuck up loot or someone ninjas an item, tough shit. All loot is final.
---
They wouldn't address any real issues like spell batching, loot trading or sharding. 
---
They're just giving us the PR bullshit saying "look how great we are, we fixed these mega obvious bugs from the demo!".
---
All weapons work like that dog
---
Take this for example https://classicdb.ch/?item=2825#dropped-by:100-2-8+1
---
You'll see it drops off a single lvl 38 mobs, a handful of 39 and 40 but mostly its 41-47 mobs on the loot table. 
---
It's still a dope ass bow but you would be better off selling that if you got it at 43+. The few extra dps it gives you for a couple more lvls isn't worth the loss of 200g 
---
Certainly gives me hope still on track for summer.
---
Hopefully they keep going in the right direction and no big issues crop up.
---
AQ is a breakpoint for vanilla WoW to me. All content before AQ can be cleared in a casual guild without too much headache. AQ demands a lot more. 
---
"update" is a bit of an overstatement
---
best tri spec build? between shadow weaving/ve/inspiration for dispel protection, improved smite/holy fire damage, reduced instant cast cost and improved renew I'm unsure what the best build would be.
---
Has anyone tried weaving autoattacks between wand attacks while leveling? I tried it and it seems to be significantly faster, but I haven't seen any hard numbers on it.
---
Epic social commentary 
---
I would not say "entirely", but definitely different. Did some people really think private servers would be an exact replication that could be used to "learn" the game? It's close but it's not perfect.
---
On the other hand - what critical thing is there to learn in WoW that private servers have gotten entirely wrong? I don't think that for example the summoning-behaviour of warlock's demons is a thing that will bother the people who learned it wrong. 
---
Vanilla wow was the alternate reality to a sinking economy.  Those of us who needed it still cherish it because it was there, like a warm hug from a stranger comforting you that all will be ok.  Much the same way we idolize the 90s for being last best memories we had as children before being dumped into said sinking economy.  Vanilla wow was more than a game back then, it was everything
---
Slow down there Satan!
---
Oh the first season is pretty low quality, I mean TB was just a barely functional, always-hungover college student at the time. But the content is what matters. If you were wanting to know what actual vanilla players were thinking about or curious about, then that's it. Epic is a lot better in terms of production quality and organization.
---
Dude the average player in vanilla was a 13 year little shit. 
---
I've played on pservers the last 3 years, no doubt are there some toxic people there just like in any other large group but the average player is much more mature. It's mostly people in there 20s and 30s.
---
He very specifically asks what he should do with the advantage of being ahead of the game level wise and uses stockpiling black lotuses for gold later as an example. It's clear he's not necessarily referring to only what sells early to other players but what to in general farm. And in a new market the best thing to do is farm shit that vendors well anyway, not fight for competition with everyone else farming copper and mithril. Those start off a good price relative to how much gold everyone else had, but because people in general don't have a lot of gold you are selling them rather cheap early.   Farming vendor trash (and instance blues) will generally net you more gold per hour.
---
I'll believe it when I see it.
---
I said you should discuss with them.  Not that you should never roll on gear.  Most of them will be happy to let you roll on it as a thank you for healing the run, and with the understanding that the gear wasn't designed with holy paladins in mind.  It is a matter of courtesy to the group so there aren't cries of "NINJA" when you take things.
---
And even if they would prefer you to not roll on the gear, you can:
---
* Roll on gear they "greed" or "pass" on (which there will be plenty)
---
* Roll on intellect leather, mail, and plate gear (which they cannot, and the reason you should be courteous)
---
* Roll on +healing gear that is not as good for them
---
* Ninja loot.  Seriously, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do, because it's been 7 fricken runs and the robes have dropped twice and they always went to a mage
---
This is a multiplayer game and you're going to have to deal with other players.  If you discuss these things ahead of time, it generally goes over better than if you just take.
---
Dont run with pugs? problem solved
---
"Crit cap" is a soft crit cap on white hits
---
my daddy owns blizzard and says it comes out in July and I get free mounts. You heard it here first
---
Blizz never stated it would ONLY be at launch. Some people don't want any sharding at all (no changes). Some people are ok with sharding at launch only but never again. A smaller group are fine with a bit of sharding here and there when it is necessary for performance and playability.
---
This. Just hide thread and move on. 
---
An irrelevant post but a Classic post nonetheless 
---
Android? I use the default keyboard and if I go into symbols there is a ™ there. 
---
None and the game never got "balanced" in anything outside pve raid dmg to try to tune wannabe esport PVE that hardly anyone does and 3 v 3 arena which is a completely dying community. The side effect and sacrifice for that illusion of balance was smaller raids where a lot of nice and fun people to hang out with lost their raid spot,  1 on 1 actually became worse due to loss of interesting trinkets and consumables and BG's became pointless and a big heal fest with unkillable healers due to having to surpass rogue/mage CC chains which were given to every class, while every class also got a swift ability and a swifty defensive.
---
That is the entire game now. PvP has never been worse than in modern WoW.  The cat and mouse game of kiting is dead and everyone stands on top of each other, you have infinite mobility on melee and pressing a big damage cooldown and reacting with a big damage defensive. It sucks. *You are free to like it and play it on modern WoW though.*
---
IF they kept content going past Naxx and added new raids they would have to nerf gear past AQ for pvp reasons or add versatility or something. Everything kind of falls apart in Naxx for PvP because of stat inflation. It's why it's probably a bad idea to begin with. They should instead see how successful Classic is to the modern game and decide if they want to do a soft reboot of modern WoW or abandon it altogether because it's too far gone and do something new. I'm in the latter camp. Trying to fix the modern game is like trying to turn Justine Bieber, Nikki Minaj and Little Wayne into a metal band. Trying to fix or rework Classic is like having them remake Dark Side of the Moon. No thanks.
---
You can still critique entertainment even if you don't have to watch it...
---
Except that if you sort by dps it’s a bunch of 48+ required bows above it. So sure maybe a few levels but definitely not a couple and you’ll probably be using it til 50. 7 levels out of that. Which is close to a day /played for the average person. Done in 2-3 sessions is 8 days with it.
---
That’s also assuming you get it at 43, where you could get it earlier like say 40 or so if you get into an Ulda run earlier than most. If you did get it at 40 that’s 10 levels out of it.
---
Aoe spells don't benefit a crazy amount from gear so with sacrifice a warlock, can start pretty early (like mostly greens early). Honestly it's solid gold per hour for the life of the game if they don't nerf it at the start and dm is in at the start. It's also 0 competition so it's safe vs investing in skinning and later finding out like 20 people on your server had the same idea. Basically while it's not the only way to make money, I personally always try to stay away from the inconsistent and/or heavily competitive markets. I like my gold to be steady and predictable. 
---
I sent in my 2 weeks notice before I even read this blue post, thats how dedicated I am.
---
an addon to send instant mail, thats server side tho?
---
Thank fucking god, so glad they are doing multiple
---
Honestly what I'm saying is in almost every thread on this sub... 
---
How lucky are we that we basically all unload in our boxers every time a blue posts. What a time to be alive.
---
It's funny how you think your the nice guy here but really your an entitled asshole who just expects 4 other random people to give you items worth hundreds of gold for free lol
---
People are getting pissy, so Blizz gave us an update. They’re providing factual info on specific feedback points they’ve addressed. 
---
Not clear how that is non-information, or a bad thing. 
---
I kicked my expectations out the door and told them to go run amok.
---
I just wen't over this the other day.
---
Warriors	8	2 Protection, 1 Fury Prot (Imp Demo), 4 dps Fury
---
Rogues	5	all combat sword, Maybe 1 Hemo?	
---
Mages	6	1 into Into winters chill	
---
Priests	5	4 holy, 1 Shadow
---
Warlocks	5	4 SM/Ruin, 1 Improved Imp and health stone	
---
Hunters	3	1 Wearing Nightfall
---
Druids	3	2 Resto, 1 Feral Offtank/Healer/DPS depending on fight
---
Paladins	5	1 Into Sanc
---
Not sure, we are gonna find out tho! 
---
Kinda
---
I did because I always felt I should pay a sub while playing private servers. They have metrics and will know what you are playing come classic. This company lost half it's value in the last year and too many people have already lost jobs. You can call me a shill or whatever, but I keep my sub going without playing and when Classic comes out I'll be on every day. That metric is worth more than anything and having old Blizzard employees around instead of Activision yes men is important to me.
---
I don't know, this thread is pretty optimistic at least. 
---
Can't wait for this sub to explode with bullshit posts of "X is wrong" after Classic comes out because people "know" it different from private servers, retail or simply forgot how it really worked back then.
---
&gt; we are gonna find out tho!
---
That we will indeed!
---
Mumfo was referring to the multiple items per mail via addon. 
---
Yeah spell batching  could potentially be a very difficult fix, and something that maybe 100 people total will actually notice. 
---
So a super casual, play whatever spec kinda guild?
---
You won't be winning any records for speed, but I bet you all will have fun, good on you!
---
Who the hell are you arguing with?  You're literally agreeing with me at this point. 
---
 Jesus christ this sub has some dumbass people in it when it comes to thinking logically.
---
Srsly, though. Just make a list of things you want to achieve in the game and ask the community which class would fit the best.
---
You can still change your mind. But it's always worth getting a second opinion.
---
A: average was definitely not 13 or even close. In fact the Vanilla community was pretty well behaved for an online community. You had just as many players in their 30s and older in Vanilla as it was a legitimate product pulling in players of all ages and walks of life. Not to say that pservers don't but it's a totally different beast than an official product which has a much broader playerbase. 
---
B: it's a generational thing. If you grew up actually being outside socialising or playing games on servers where you had a reputation, instead of matchmaking mechanics, you have a different view on how to behave in groups and how what you want isn't always what you get.
---
Vanilla was far less toxic than pservers in general because people actually behaved better as the community was smaller and tighter than on most pservers. I doubt that will come back with Classic though as players today are too entitled and aggressive.
---
Blizzard has said straight up that the 1.12 data is being used and they will not change it. So any changes to classes, loot tables, abilities, spawn rates, etc. are not going to change. 
---
Fortunately, I'm one of those freaks who levels the same class over and over again without ever getting tired of it, so I think I have a pretty good idea of what I'm going to roll this time.... *&lt;drumroll&gt;* And it's.... &gt;!🎉Yet another fuckin Warrior!🎉!&lt;
---
If they have one, it will just be a weekend where you can create geared 60s and run around testing game systems. 
---
Something something endless resources
---
My point is we’ve heard it before, factual information is great, but recycled factual information hasn’t progressed what we know about this project.
---
OH MOMMA TEMPTATION HAS SEIZED ME AGAIN
---
I'm sure they don't really have info on servers yet. They need to either have a beta or do some serious speculation to see how many servers they actually need. 
---
Always a very late project decision. 
---
Patience Padawan.
---
Can't upvote this enough!
---
kat
---
Then everyone, y'know, stops subscribing. In order for Blizzard to keep making money, they need to cater to the interest of the users. 
---
Update, but not really.
---
They are already confirmed 
---
Yes, very viable. Just don't do it while you're progression raiding.
---
And IF it only affects the launch period, it's vastly superior to dynamic spawn rates that impacts the game all the way to 60, including raiding. Dynamic spawn rates is one of the biggest "No Change" sins ever put on private servers, that only existed because of the archaic server hosting tech they used.
---
Lol the system you just described would be the easiest system of all time to get gear in, like it wouldn't even really be fun. You would just run a few instances each day in which you would win a few of the many BOE items and you would sell them for their worth. Then with that money you bu yourself upgrades.
---
No more running baron 30 times trying to get the cloak because of bad luck, you would just need to farm enough gear to sell to buy it off someone. 
---
Addressing those things would just make the community freak out again. There is literally no benefit to them sharing that information. They told us sharding and loot trading will be in, so they won't mention that again. They haven't mentioned spell batching, so that won't be in. 
---
By never mentioning these topics again, they're preventing mass pools of outrage on forums. Its a smart decision. 
---
I'm married so can't unsubscribe to that, *BUT*, I already sat her down and explained every detail to her.. I may be dead in my chair, I may become ghastly pale, there even may be piss bottles in my office can, I'll probably lose 20-30 pounds.... She just laughed and said " your so weird." Little does she know I'm telling the truth 😂
---
Classic is not 1.1. Classic is 1.12. Tier 1 and 2 yes it's perfectly viable, especially after all the nerfs as it currently stands. This could all change though. Blizzard could do right itemization, Blizzard could take tier 1 and 2 back to 8 debuffs from 16, Blizzard could delay Dire Maul. With all those nerfs though? No you don't need mana tide until AQ. MP5/Spirit gear alone in instances like Dire Maul make it not needed. 
---
Here is the spec btw. It does not work well for healing 5 mans due to no increase on Healing Wave time. Go resto until you get all your BIS gear.  You don't cast Healing Wave in raids in a melee group. You cast chainheal and drop totems.

---
She might say yes up front but this game is gonna start shit. At leas you can say “I told you so” but it won’t help you 
---
When you for example command your pet to attack it takes a little while for it to start moving towards the target
---
Watching his video now.. it's 14:28, so probably not padded just to get to 10 minutes.
---
Contact a GM about what? There is no official game rule that prevents people from needing on an item and vendoring it if they want. 
---
Globbisen.  I made [this just now to represent about 88% of the people in this sub](https://imgflip.com/i/2uzl9j).  I think it's pretty accurate don't you? :)
---
Let me side step the question by saying this: It's going to happen, so debating about it right now really doesn't mean anything.  
---
Agreed.
---
Most likely in my mind is one or more stress tests and little more.
---
Content only needs to be tested internally. This isn't a freshly designed game. How their servers handle loads, in preparation of choosing their server release choices, is always the most important metrics for release after content completion. 
---
Maybe a couple stress test weekends? I'll be happily surprised if we see anything more.
---
hath he really?
---
I'm surprised people didn't remember that one. Pretty sure several enemies ran away at a speed in between walking/running speed. I used to try and remember to hamstring them right before they hit that HP threshold. 
---
Warrior matters a lot more than Warlock or Mage. The only really bad choice on either of those Human. For PvP Troll, Night Elf and Human are all bad for PVP on a warrior. Undead is not horrible, but not ideal as you already have a fear break. 
---
Min Max for warrior is Gnome for all 3, which is also the best PVE choice making on the casters making that a no brainer choice. Humans are the best warriors in PVE.
---
Min Max on Horde is Orc for lock (pve race doesn't matter), undead for mage (troll is better in PVE), and Orc for warrior.
---
Perfectly fine if you play the end game like a group oriented game like EQ or Pantheon.
---
Classic is still a very solo friendly game however so many like to optimize the solo grind and especially for leveling and solo pvp, but it's not required.
---
Yes!!
---
HELL YES  
---
You will be underperforming compared to other shamans with deep resto, and it will be easy to put blame on the low performer when wipes happen and people start getting frustrated. Healing raids as that spec puts a target on your back that directs blame towards you.
---
30/0/21 for farming, why not respec between raids? Chances are you will respec once or twice to/at 60 and then have several respecs in the bank before the 50g cap kicks in. Exploit that to farm more than is needed for 2 respecs early on and save up money to keep for when the respec cost grows.
---
All in all, it's impossible to really say until it's live. You might be the best shaman in the guild and your worse talents are made up for in your superior skill, and nobody can tell you don't have mana tide if you're in a warrior/rogue group. You might find a guild raiding back to back days, giving you 5 solid days of farming/pvping, which changes your mind about going 31/0/20 for raids. You might find yourself still be measured up against other shamans (maybe by your class leader) and get straight up told to respec in a fairly casual guild.
---
More or less. Do you really need 11 healers for MC though?
---
100% agreed. Let people know to be cautious with loot and that no GM effort will be used to resolve loot issues, with maybe some exceptionally rare exceptions.
---
Yeah I feel that’s the case, but look at how much info they received from the demo that might’ve been overlooked. More eyes to bring up more issues would be nice, even if it’s already designed doesn’t mean their numbers are 100%. Which could effect more.
---
But the other girl is new model also

You should probably read this: notable excerpts below:
---
* *When others try to encourage you to bad behavior...realize that you are an independent agent, and that you have a personal responsibility to behave morally.*
---
* *Step back and ask yourself, would I normally consider this action to be wrong?*
---
* *Does my language hide what is really going on?*
---
* *Who am I comparing myself to and am I making this comparison to excuse my behavior?*
---
* *Am I excusing the harm I am doing by blaming others?*
---
* *Am I blaming the victim to excuse my harmful actions?*
---
You probably won't read it, you'll probably ignore it, downvote me and insult my grandmother to boot.  But the point is:  just because you're online, with guildmates or not, does not excuse the behavior.  Justifying bad actions with the mentality "others will do it so I'll do it" is how a LOT of extremely bad things have gone down in history.  This isn't some government, or atrocity in the real world of course; but it generally shows your fortitude of character and integrity as a human being.
---
You are a human being.  The 4 other people in your group are human beings.  I can't believe I'm actually saying this, but just because the internet is a caustic and toxic vessel which breeds negativity doesn't mean you can't step back and realize that you are better than the dregs of society who abuse systems (whether those systems are in real life or in a virtual game environment.)
---
I quoted your comment? You said you dont know any place that does payments post-release; me neither, but a credit car allows you to do that. 
---
Unless you are ranking in pvp and you have communicated this with your guild you shouldn't expect then to tolerate pvp specs that skip one of the best pve talents in game.
---
Disagree. Once your pet is past level 1 loyalty, food management is easier and you can just keep 2 stacks of meat/fish/whatever around to feed it every now and then. Just refresh your food stacks when you visit town and you'll be good to go.
---
The one fewer bags situation sucks, but you make up for it by not needing auxiliary gear in your bags except for a few resist pieces for some raids, unless you're hardcore into PvE and world PvP and minmax your gear for each situation. For BGs you can just hit up the bank.
---
For leveling though, it's a pain. But as the other guy said, you're the fastest leveler by a mile, it's not that bad.
---
False, you said it's generally not a good idea to farm something someone doesn't need in that moment and i 100% disagree with that and think that's a great thing to farm. Just lotuses in particular are too rare to be reliable. You also state elsewhere that copper and mithril are good to farm early which i also disagree with. Everyone will be farming those for the same reason you are and to level professions them selves. That market starts off far too competitive to pay off consistently early and is far better to farm later when people get lazy.  But go ahead, block me like a child because I share a different opinion. I can't believe you actually got this upset that you felt the need to pm someone because they disagree. Blocking me doesn't make you right. 
---
Tips didn't even play Classic. He just pretends he is some sort of Vanilla expert.
---
accidentally arranged tinder dates with a bunch of strange dudes named TipsOut and Staysafe. 
---
except, we HAVEN'T heard those specific updates before.....
---
He hitched his shitty content to a popular topic. Smart move for him, but when the hype dies down in a year and a half he'll fade away super quick, so that's the trade off. 
---
He has an opinion and is stating it. He's doing exactly what you're defending. 
---
You need to do ubrs and get the skinning knife for devilsaur leather.
---
People will do anything for pre-bis gear. It’s often times much better than MC and even BWL gear. You have no idea how far people will go for items like Cadaverous Armor. 
---
Burn Activision! 
---
Big cringe 
---
&gt; In order for Blizzard to keep making money, they need to cater to the interest of the users. 
---
Has anyone told this to Blizzard? They seem to have forgotten this part.
---
Tbh most of them can be considered as minor bugs.: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ubyr6/wow\_classic\_demo\_feedback\_bugs\_and\_legion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9ubyr6/wow_classic_demo_feedback_bugs_and_legion/)  
---
With that logic they can completely ignore everything and just leave it the way demo was - no good. If they promised to make it classic-like and were boasting about every shadow to be exactly the same - they should deliver.
---
Aside from his unwatchable content, the fact that he calls himself TipsOutBaby is the most cringeworthy shit I've ever seen. Basically he changed a 't' to a 'p' in a weirdly creepy phrase and decided to centre his entire brand around that? 
---
I pray this is true
---
I was hoping it was confirmed to be gone so we could get an actual Classic Vanilla server.
---
No, arrows are very useful for Hunters.
---
As much as I would enjoy having Classic here faster I still wouldn’t want a ninja drop. It was fine with Apex Legends because it wasn’t something most people were expecting or waiting on. People are going to want a release date ahead of time so they can take off work or build a schedule around when it’s releasing. 
---
You keep saying regen...do you mean renew? And instant cast spells put you inside the five second rule, no different from spells with a cast time.
---
Sounds like graysfordays.   
---
Enjoy the gold
---
Not that I'm aware
---
Yeah, renew, sorry been playing too much FF. 
---
The reason I talk so much about renew is that it heals you while you are fighting, i.e. you can keep wanding while you're healing yourself. Which results in less down time.
---
Or a bracket was missed in one of those components and broke a different one. Or a typo that broke something was made and missed because reasons and the game still ran with said typo ([Like in Aliens: Colonial Marines](https://www.polygon.com/2018/7/15/17574248/aliens-colonial-marines-fixing-code-typo-ai-xenomorphs))  
---
Yeah. Coding is hella messy.
---
Actually, it is exactly the same on your finances.
---
Yeah but by not giving anyone notice, it will create  a scramble and will slightly slow down the content march by the min maxers.
---
Tips Out (Wrath) Baby
---
Damn it, now “soon” doesn’t even look like a real word.
---

---
not only did they confirm summer but it also sounds like it might be actually early summer. great news.
---
&gt;Rushed
---
&gt;Good
---
pick one
---
Seems blizzlike to not have quest addons from the getgo ;)
---
Summer starts June 21st. Summer is 13 weeks long. July 16 is 3 weeks into summer, so mid-July is early summer and thus MOST of summer would be classic. 
---
Would people playing in beta get to keep those characters when the full game comes out? Or do you restart? Not really sure how that usually works
---
Ah, I understand. Thanks.
---
How do you not see what they would gain from the beta after this specific post stating that the demo helped Blizzard identify a mistake that the players found by demoing the game?
---
They seriously are correcting the complainers on saying "hey this was broken and this was broken" and smacking them down with "umm, no we know for sure it was this way. Kobolds DID run faster than you, welcome to vanilla, BITCH!" Fucking LOVE it!
---
Mandala effect
---
Beta would allow for additional eyes to give ‘em one more chance to fine tune anything they missed, hence why a short 2 - 3 week beta may be considered.
---
Here ya go.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aw77g1/classic_update_blue_post/ehktebj/
---
I didn’t say they would gain nothing. I said that relative to the drawbacks of having a beta, the benefits are relatively minor. 
---
quality meme
---
$60 out of one paycheck versus $10 out of one paycheck isn't really the same though.
---
I still think Blizzard will required a stress test or 2, which would require at least some advanced notice.
---
I don't think they need to hype this game much. They have their core audience for it already. Any new players can easily be attracted by word of mouth after release.
---
They won't spend a huge amount on marketing anyway. The team is too small and this is a side project. Marketing is a SERIOUS cost. Blizzard is shockingly treating this project more like an indie project. I feel Blizzard is sitting back and wondering how this will go and are in a "wait and see" stance.
---
The long term benefit of this would be the possibility that a major developer once again has interest in supporting niche market gaming, parallel to their front end, large market share products. Currently Classic Wow only exists in order for Blizzard to regain the audience lost to private servers and control of the actual Wow IP.
---
The only way Classic impacts future, front line production, is if it is successful enough for them to think, "Hey! We may have something here!" ... and Activision can take a micro-moment to remove their heads from the asses of venture capitalists to see it too.
---
Not really dude the people that no life it are still going to no life it. It would only really hurt the people who are working and wouldn’t be able to adjust right away. You’re a fool to think anything is going to slow those people down other than the servers being down or full. 
---
Stress test and maybe a few hundred people to see if they missed anything when retuning the game to Vanilla.
---
Confused on the downvoting of my comment. Those are things that matter, not stupid number tweaks from a demo 3 months ago which would of obviously not have went unnoticed. 
---
Not going to lie, as bad as I'd love to play like *now,* I would be pretty darn disappointed with a stealth drop.  I have a huge group of friends I'll need to talk to and organize so we can all try to play on the same server.  If they don't announce server names and a firm launch date well ahead of time, they're going to have a lot of friend groups really mad at them.
---
In my day we walked uphill both ways in driving snow
---
#*AND WE LIKED IT
---
What we were told:
---
* We read your feedback re: the demo and went through your extensive list of issues (Old News)
---
* We know health regen + spell crit was off in the demo, we're working on it (Old News)
---
* We know demon summoning didn't work as intended in the demo (Old News)
---
* There are 'bugs'/changes we intend to leave in such as mail (Old News)
---
* We knew rogue energy was off in the demo, we've worked on it (Old News, unless you say them actually noting that they fixed it already is the groundbreaking part)
---
* "We’re prioritizing: core game systems, combat, and content. We’ve spent time on other things such as user interface and making sure graphics “feel” like they used to, but our primary focus is on gameplay." (Old News - AKA We're working on THE GAME and trying bring you as close to an authentic Classic experience as possible).
---
If you think any of this is wrong, let me know.  But which parts did you feel where brand spanking new, illuminating points?
---
I have gone into more detail explaining why I choose imp renew in other comments. Basically, it saves time by allowing you to heal while fighting and uses a lot less Mana than pw:s. The imp renew talent gives you more hps without increasing Mana useage. It's all about minimizing down time and Mana usage.
---
As for martyrdom vs imp pw:f, that is more of a personal choice. I prefer pw:f as I tend to do a good amount of dungeons while leveling, and the extra stm is nice for that. I really don't do much pvp while leveling other than the occasionally gank. So I don't see the benefit of martyrdom for my play style.
---
"The warlock summoning system from vanilla World of Warcraft was absolutely critical to the original philosophy of the game. Losing your voidwalker because of a misclick and having to farm a soul shard to summon one again will without a doubt destroy the social aspect that made vanilla great, and it's up to us, the Classic World of Warcraft community, to be vocal and fight for this"
---
&gt; Announcing a vanilla-faithful size would piss off the private server communit
---
I don't think so. At least not me. Private servers also have players from all time zones.
---
No, it won't, no matter how much we hyperventilate over it.
---
2 - 3 weeks should be fine enough, so probably mid-late June if they do it.
---
You're welcome, and thanks for the correction on the Regen/renew. Lol
---
A ninja drop of Classic WoW would be at the complete advantage of the no-life community.  
---
What do you think the no life community is doing right now? They're no lifing.  
---
If Classic dropped 13 minutes from now, unannounced, they'd have to do nothing more than click a few windows, be the first to download, launch the game, pick their realm and character, and they'd be playing.  
---
What group of people is most harmed by an unannounced release? People with jobs and other responsibilities. They're at work when it drops, or taking care of other obligations. They have to set aside time for such a thing as Classic.  
---
So if you are suggesting that the game be released without announcement as a way to benefit people who lack education, employment or training and can stay home and play WoW 18 hours per day, then I say that your idea is bad.  
---
A scheduled release of the game levels the launch playing field for all players of all socioeconomic statuses.  
---
&gt; You have no idea how far people will go for items like Cadaverous Armor.
---
ok, so when it drops you roll NEED. Then no matter the hijinks by the other players you still have a 1 in 5 chance of getting it.
---
Depending on how much work they’ve done on other zones and stuff, it’s entirely possible.
---
It's more to kill others who are bothering me. 2 pts for 100% no knockback and 20% resist is pretty awesome.
---
Most guilds won't take 8 shaman because they will struggle to find more than four(I bet). But yeah shaman totems for every group is ideal.
---
Another issue players reported was that Warlock demon summoning was broken – lots of players said that you shouldn’t lose your current demon until the new one appears. We double-checked and in the original 1.12 WoW, and there, as soon as you started summoning a new demon, your existing demon disappeared. So the demo actually matched how the game played originally. There were a few other reports – such as “rare mobs do way less damage” and “Kobolds at Jangolode Mine run faster than walking speed when running away” – where we were able to confirm that the gameplay was the same in the demo as in the original 1.12 WoW.
---
Vanilla wow veterans btw that played the alpha. 
---
My dad, who's famous for his work at nintendo and spreading the news on how to catch a Charizard in red/blue, is now a blizzdev and says July fosho' - given no problems arise obviously
---
Forgot the Summer point too - again something that was reiterated recently as well.
---
I don't care about what is the best business decision, if they won't talk about these big issues, they probably won't be changed. I want the most genuine version of the game for myself and other consumers, not the safest bet for Blizz.
---
&gt;  I think it’s laughable you think people won’t be dicks
---
There is an entire thread devoted to how it's perfectly ok to ninja-need on items you don't need because they are BOE. This will be a far bigger issue. How do you propose we solve that problem?
---
No Beta would be a bit concerning, it seems like they pretty much got the world right by now, as in everything is placed correctly.
---
However, just like they say in this Bluepost, they need to fix some of the underlying systems such as regen/defense skill (dodge, parry, miss).
---
Now, they might have fixed most of the stuff that was reported during the small preview months ago, but I'd bet my ass there is a whole lot more to fix where those came from.
---
What worries me is that the devs don't necessarily know where these issues could hide, what hidden interactions there are that make vanilla feel like vanilla.
---
It would be a shame if the first few months after release would be riddled with such inaccuracies. 
---
Thus I really hope they do provide some way for the players to test this stuff and report any potential issues.
---
This is a cool site. Nearly perfect. I think being able to control the talents of each slot would be cool! I have nothing else to do, so playing around with 40 specs seems fun to me
---
In my 20s as a arms warrior, I'd prayed for a dodge so I that I wouldn't die from just missing the mob 3 times in a row.
---
For sure, dynamic respawns is just as bad, if not worse.
---
The thing is, as long as they keep server population caps the same as in vanilla, none of these things are needed.
---
However, if they want to go for 2-4x bigger ones, there will be so many new issues, and is a massive change.
---
&gt;Blizz never stated it would ONLY be at launch
---
They've said that they don't want sharding in places where people are fighting for resources (including higher tier profession nodes and world bosses) which pretty much rules out everywhere important.
---
You can be cynical and believe they'll shard cities or whatever but I just don't see it happening
---
Well you literally said that you don't see what they would gain...
---
But anyway, you really think a beta is going to kill hype for this game? Every game has a beta, where is there any evidence that beta kills hype?
---
A buggy game in the first two weeks will kill more hype than a beta ever will. It's not like once people click subscribe, that they'll be hooked in for the life of Classic. People will click subscribe regardless of the beta. Whether or not they get fed up or jaded from the legitimacy or state of the remake will determine how long they stay for.
---
We're 4-6 months away from the launch of the game, with no word of a beta. So beta should be in the next 2-4 months or so, and at most a couple months from the release of the game. You think hype for the return of a game that's been building up for more than a decade will die down in a couple of months between beta an launch? People will be spending months and even years playing this game.
---
In America, any excuse to screw your credit up with a credit card is considered to be a *very* good excuse.

God I hate what amounts to youtube bloggers blabbing about classic wow.  So annoying.
---
What else did you expect they would be doing?
---
Did you ever work for a multi-billion dollar technology giant company? I sure didn't, but I do know how procrastinating companies can be, how undocumented everything can be, and how bugs and glitches can be swept under 'TODO's, how many workarounds and hacks are 'bugfixes', and how half-assed solutions are often accepted due to budget and time constraints.  
---
If the company gains nothing valuable out of an analytics to see how many people plays both classic and retail. I'm sure that the number of subs would be a much more valuable statistic to them than just the overall number of players on classic. If someone's already subbed to WoW, and happens to jump on classic or not, that won't change their income, so...why bother with spending effort on trackins such a stat?  
---
I do see your point, sure, but I honestly believe that the bigger the company, the bigger the chaos, miscommunication, disorganization. The more stats you need to track, the more people information goes through....it doesn't get easier and simpler, it gets more complex.  
---
At least, that's my viewpoint on the industry, as a fellow software dev.....I may be wrong about ActiBlizz, I'm not sure how much experience and insider info you have, but if you do, I apologize for opposing you, and I'm sure you can tell me why I'm wrong about this. I'm young and inexperienced, and willing to learn from someone more experienced.
---
Counter argument would be: But if you don't give it to the person with the driver's license, nobody would arrive at the destination. Which is silly, because the person already has a car, just a slightly less nice one.
---
It only really applies to subscription based games. 
---
I personally like competing with 250 other people at every spawn point for every quest from 0-60 while simultaneously being ganked by what seems like dozens of organized 60s in every zone and every quest choke point.
---
I'm not sure that they will. They will know an approximate, especially since some people sub to retail while waiting for Classic, and might pop into retail still when they play Classic, or might not. But I'm not so sure that's a statistic they really are interested, especially not in the first few months. I'm more sure that they want to know the income increase related to classic subscriptions.
---
You know, i've always been a bit hazy about vanilla population numbers, and find myself misquoting my own intentions quite often.  
---
Thanks for clearing that up, even though it wasn't that big of a math problem. Somehow I keep screwing up the situation when I talk about it.  
---
Agreed. Loot is final.

The only time a GM should get involved in loot is if there is an issue SERVER SIDE, like a crash during loot that causes a rollback or something. They should not involve themselves in normal day-to-day player stuff like this. #NoChanges
---
Please cite where they’ve stated all of these things before. 
---
If you need to cite more then 4-5 different sources then this was a useful post. 
---
I think by week 4 we were able to 1 tank all adds without the tank dying.  I know we tried week 3, but I feel like we ended up kiting all the adds away again.  Maybe bad healers that week.
---
How hard could it be to just release a game that has already been released? Why is this being dragged out? Don't they have an original copy of the game sitting around anywhere?  
---
I would definitely say you're in the minority there, at least going off of the sentiments in private server discussion boards. In general, they very much seem to want something closer to 10k rather than the "estimated" 2.5k of vanilla. 
---
I think I am with you. The times where someone said something like "I didn't mean to roll need" has to be far more often than the possibility of a group of people rolling for a friend. 
---
At least with loot trading it will hold people accountable by showing their true colors. 
---
&gt; kings of repackaging and rewording things we already knew.
---
How ironic. 
---
Shadow priests were 100% brought to raids lol wtf?  Only one per raid normally but they were still brought.
---
I know right? I'm trying to get mine paid off. Don't need to use them for fluff if I can avoid it.
---
&gt; We knew.....
---
We didn’t know they were fixing them until today.
---
Dear lord man. 
---
An BoE item is also not something players have a right to. No player has a right to anything. You establish rules beforehand and the most sensible rule imho is to go Need on items of extraordinary value and Greed on items of lower value unless you want it as upgrade. 
---
Using words as fucking people over and cheating disqualifies you as honest in this discussion.  Because it's not. You know what's fucking people over? Forcing people to N/G so you can have that lvl 19 twink item which is worth hundreds of gold and you will only use for 2 levels. THAT is fucking people over. It's a social game. Social people would go 'WOW! LOTTERY TIME! GRATZ TO ALL!', not GRATZ TO ONE.
---
Honestly?  Not that much that would benefit you if you ONLY plan on pve healing.  Literally any other profession in your wheel house would be better.
---
All those rules do not count when it involves extremely value items. Yes, we will give the lock that 15g blue BoE. No, we won't give him the 150g BoE. I'd rather give that to someone who wants to buy a mount. 
---
Hey, I don't mean to pry, but could we please get any info at all about old school epic mounts (the ones originally removed from mount vendors in patch 1.4 when the redesigned ones were introduced) at some point? It would be really cool to see that in Classic too, and maybe have them removed automatically with the introduction of one of the content phases.
---
That will get a couple thousands views while the video with Asmon watching it will have 200K views.
---
Definitely haha.
---
Another good extension of this analogy is -- if it were not just winning any old random car, but winning a special edition classic vintage restored 1967 Shelby Cobra signed and driven by the President of bla bla bla.. you get the picture.
---
 the point of the car award isnt to use it to get from point A to point B, its how special and rare it is lol just like edgemasters is NOT the same as the other green gloves they have. totally different purpose for a different audience entirely. And anyone who uses that car that valuable as a daily driver for their teenager is insane lol
---
Newcomers also must like his simple platform. you can't hate the guy to keep on trying. Hell he even pulls hundreds of upvotes on here even for the zul'gurub video. He appeals to a decent sized crowd and relates well with people who are fresh to the game.
---
Haha I had this exact experience yesterday! We were getting camped so hard at Nesingwary’s that I just spawned, ran into the camp, and pally-bubbled right as I was about to die with just enough time to turn in my quests, accept the new ones, and die on the way out :D
---
Before I take the time out of my day to chase down the links, I just want to know if you're suggesting that 1) I'm full of shit (which is fine, I won't be offended) or 2) The suggestion means nothing without evidence/links? Because if you personally agree with me, then I won't chase down the links for the three people that will read this, but if you genuinely want to know if this stuff really has been said before then I can come back later on and find the points that i say we've heard it before. It's just going to take time that I don't particularly want to spend on it if I'm trying to prove a moot point.
---
The thing is that only a handful of vanilla server were actually full. Those servers were healthy. However, the vast majority were low or medium pop, and those kinda sucked to play on at times. People remember this and just want higher pop servers to hedge the risk of ended up on a dead-ish server.
---
You're paying it off? That's un-American. The American thing to do is to find another credit card with no transfer fee and put all your debt on that card, and then continue juggling the debt around in your life eternally until you have to cash out your 401k to pay your bills.  
---
And that's just your late 30s.  
---
Not to suggest links as evidence are a bad thing - I agree that they should be there, but again, I won't bother if we're kind of on the same page.
---
Are you including the garbage loot from MC in that? Or T2 from MC? Or shaman/pally drops, and less epics dropping per boss? Or things that were obviously fixed for balance like Choker of Enlightenment (as much as I love that item and Spirit of Aquementas and want it to be included)?
---
Music 100%. I did whole albums vs Pandora though. Now anytime I hear the Deftones I think of all the time spent in wow. I listened to way to much Deftones then... but that's not a bad thing. 
---
That would justify arguing for maybe a 3 or 3.5k pop, not 5k-10k. 
---
Don't forget to delete the gym
---
It saddens me how few will understand this
---
Damn you’re really channeling some negativity here directed at me. I take it you didn’t even read my post. Let me reiterate...i realistically expect an announced launch of July 16th, I think that would be best. However I wouldn’t cry if they stealth launched earlier, just as you say, the no-lifers and p-server community are already ready to go, so what difference would it make
---
The sub is bundled with Retail. That means there'll be a whole lot of tourists checking by the first couple weeks. 
---
Chances are, server caps will be at max at the start and then reduced as the tourists leave. Setting yourself up for mergers by putting up excess servers with artificially low cap just to accommodate a few weeks isn't exactly a decision the higher ups would support. 
---
Solution: make loot-trading only for raids, or only toggle for options letting the group know that it's toggled.   
---
Otherwise I'd rather not have it at all
---
I really want those old school epic mounts in, but how is that priority information at this stage? And realistically what difference does it make whether you find out 4 months before release or when you first run to Sen'jin Village when the game releases?
---
I think something that may work is giving the party the ability to "consent" to the item being flagged as tradable.
---
There were always 2 peak periods on private servers, the big one was at 10AM CST and the servers could barely support it (8 yard NPC phase ranges for example) and it was honestly hell.  
---
The second peak was a North American peak, and it peaked at around 4,000 players and I think that population peak was the healthiest time on the whole server.  
---
I used that experience to formulate my opinion that whatever population cap is necessary to create a prime time population peak of 4,000 players, is the population cap I want.  
---
No, it won't. 
---
People abusing loot trading like that can easily be identified, called out and eventually blacklisted. Just like the original ninja looting, it's going to be extremely rare. 
---
8.0 yards ≈ 7.3 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---
&gt; If Activision doesn't want to pay for GMs, that's fine, just tell people loot is final and move on.
---
Loot wasn't final back then. 
---
&gt; Loot is final.
---
Wasn't in vanilla. 
---
I don't think the average player is able to know how one number would feel vs. another number. I know I couldn't, as they never gave actual numbers, just low, med, high.
---
The gist of it all is just that normal G/N does not comply with item values that Blizzard did not expect to exist. And you can argue purely out of emotion, but keeping n/g for insta-mount items is just silly and nonsensical.
---
&gt; The World used to have some sense of consequence attached to things — the trademark of Vanilla’s greatness.
---
But loot wasn't final in vanilla. 
---
Grinding/leveling is the only time bag space is an issue, and you can just leave your extra sets in the bank. Hunter can't leave arrows.
---
https://youtu.be/5drjr9PmTMA?t=89
---
Go on.
---
We can just agree to disagree then because I had close to 100 days played in Vanilla and I recall it being like the wild wild west. There was a lot more toxicity due to just pure ignorance that you don't see anymore. For example people in vanilla might freak out and spam chat about a dps warrior who 'ninjad' truestrike shoulders. or people freaking out on the healer after a wipe even though the dps were running around breaking cc and the tank didn't do anything about the 2 mobs wailing on the healer.. Either way though it all can be avoided by just joining a guild, that's were you get your community on a pserver. We help each other out and if anyone is shady they get kicked.
---
Find the links. I know they don’t exist as they haven’t acknowledged these specific changes until today, but please find them if they exist. Prove me wrong.
---
They need to be Blizz acknowledging that they’re fixing these problems btw. Not posts here with people stating that, say, energy regen. As any sane person would have to admit that those are two drastically different things. 
---
If it takes more than 5 or 6 links to illustrate all of the statements they’ve made today, then you might need to accept that this is useful information. Since a post aggregating info provided in 5+ sources is likely useful to people. 
---
Way more useful than a podcast that reads wowhead comments for sure. 
---
And adult diapers for hardcore players
---
&gt; and only if there is a group of friends who are going out of their way to be as terrible as possible
---
I think you vastly underestimate the amount of terrible people who exist
---
I agree man, and if a casual loses out on the initial launch week of classic would they really even care in the long run, or just be happy to play when they can? I’m not going to speak for anyone, but no-lifers will no life and you can pretend you’re a no lifer until reality sets in and you realize when you type /who 60 when youre level 32 that you may as well just enjoy the game
---
Good points. and yeah especially when you factor in that blizzard-official tooltip that describes what they meant the system to be for. I forget the exact words but someone else up top posted it. Basically the tooltip says "Roll Need if you want the Item, and Greed if you are indifferent to taking it"
---
That also even covers our bases here for people "wanting" it - even if blizzard didnt predict the value to the community and all that. 
---
As long as you gear 11 by AQ, you’re fine 
---
So you would be in favor of maybe a 20% increase to the original "cap" in order to create a safety net to keep pops from going too low? 
---
I think that's totally reasonable (in fact I think a 12k cap is reasonable) I just don't think that's what most pserver folks want. 
---
You're misreading my tone as hate, when instead it's just firmness. I hold no ill will to you, and I did read your post.  
---
Tone is a difficult thing in text, and perhaps my message misdirected the emotion and it came across as harsh. That wasn't my intention but it was my mistake.  
---
I understand some elements of my message seemed to be imposing, such as asking a question to formulate my point. I am a fan of the Socratic method to achieve that goal, and it can seem condescending even though that's not my hope.  
---
The intended tone I read back my message in was more inquiring, declarative and then informative, rather than insulting.  
---
Anyway, apologies for the unintended effect.  
---
Likely with similar methods they did back then. Loot sharing is a new thing with new consequences. 
---
My body is ready
---
Hahaha oh the salt
---
Ahhh Nessie’s, the place we all love to hate. Haha
---
In a hardcore guild every mana tide totem is equally valuable, doesn't matter if the shaman is in the melee group.
---
Shaman can be swapped into a different group mid-fight. Windfury totem places a buff on allies weapon that lasts 10 seconds (not 100% sure about the exact duration of the buff). So a shaman in the melee group can be swapped to the healer group to drop mana tide totem and then swapped back after it ends with minimal DPS loss for his melee group.
---
But shaman are in enough demand that you can probably get away with running 30/0/21 even in Naxx, even though its not optimal.
---
You da real MVP
---
How did I hurt you? You're getting oddly personal when I haven't done anything to rub you the wrong way other than disagree with you.  That's an ugly look.
---
Also, qualifying exactly how many Blizz links I need to provide to you to back it up is a very strange thing to say, if I give one and it's from Blizz and it says it, then that's enough, that's generally how referecing works.  I realise they need to come from Blizz and not the community, that goes without saying.
---
Should I bother putting the time in to chase this down when you've gone in such a weird direction in your reply? You're flexing in your responses and I really can't work out why.
---
It's because they said they couldn't for years, it was like one of their primary excuses for why Vanilla wasn't possible (J Allen Brack aside). People actually started to believe them I guess. 
---
You were flexing in your first reply. 
---
Playing the victim affer that is a bad look.
---
Are you going to find those links or keep wasting time?
---
&gt; if you ever get in a 1v1 situation in the world, there's not much you can do but run. 
---
not if you're a Druid. And, you don't have to run in advance, as you are very good at running.
---
Sure hold farming will happen but the eco systems are separate. Gold bots would have to go undetected for gold sellers to be able to make the gold to sell it.
---
If its not, I'll eat a piece of bread.
---
You know they're not completely retarded right? They don't need to see a spike in subscriptions to see how many people are playing on classic servers vs modern...
---
Point out the part where you say I was flexing, this is news to me.  You're an oddly aggressive responder, I'll get your links, can I record my useless podcast first or does your demand come with a time limit that invalidates my response if I don't get back to you by then?
---
So it is. Didn’t really pay attention since it was blurry. Missed opportunity there OP
---
Got it. You can’t find the links. So you’re changing the subject. 
---
Not surprised. 
---
I think the old high should be a min, and just bump up the max. I have no idea what those numbers should be, nor do I think does anyone else really. Hence the randomly high numbers
---
Not all private servers ran 10k. Those playing on 10k servers have no opinion.
---
They can't support "Bliz-like" and rely on dynamic respawn tech, which alters the game from the moment you log in to every stage of Raiding. It impacts the economy of leveling, raiding and markets and this is NOT Bliz-like
---
Classic is being created because of private servers ... but, for the most part, F@CK private server demands outside of "No Change".
---
They just got used to something that ONLY exists within the highly mutated concept of 10k+ servers.
---
Ehh doesn't seem worth it to go for those talents in my opinion. The betterment of the raid for like ~50 agi to the raid wasting 7-12 points in enhance, meh.   
---
I don't have a whole bunch of vanilla raid exp but I would assume healers and tank grp first. That's 2-3 shamans.   
---
Then the melee for WF, that should be 3 shamans or so.  
---
Very last would be mages &amp; warlocks I assume.   
---
I'd rather just have one full enhance in the tank group if you happen to carry a enh shaman at all.
---
It's the way the profanity was used, if you say "Oh shit I gotta go" vs "You shit head" one is just swearing the other is harassing someone else and it's reportable, it's about context.
---
Lol, oh I'll be getting back to you.  Have a bit of patience, I'm doing IRL things.  Don't worry, I'll be back.  And you know what, you may even get a bit of a win, we'll have to wait and see! Will I get any kind of kudos when I do come back and engage? Probably not.
---
Noone's changing the subject.  Relax fella.
---
They're trying to make it compatible with their modern architecture. Thus they are recreating the entire game from scratch essentially. That's why. 
---
Precisely why I want to roll shaman, so much damn utility. However I will choose to have Mana tide anyways as I will fish and forage herbs for gold
---
That's a requirement?
---
^
---
Sorry for posting facts.
---
Dont have a problem with youtube classic contentmakers the only thing is that almost no1 is making something unique they are all making the same freaking videos.
---
Why would anyone resub before classic? That  makes no sense.
---
I don't disagree with that at all. But to me the potential negative effects of loot trading are miniscule compared to the cost savings it will give Blizzard by reducing GM tickets. And we don't ever want Activision to see Classic WoW as something that costs a lot to maintain... that leads to a cash shop.
---
We are not taking twink items tough. We are talking about the general view on Need before Greed. 
---
And yes, if you need because of greed you are fucking people over, both and WoW and in real life. Nothing disqualifying about that.
---
Twinks aren't a think until fairly late on in the realm lifecycle and won't be until your actually have a market to sell the item for an inflated price in order to cater to that demand. Many things come into play when dealing with those items.
---
&gt; You're paying it off? That's un-American. 
---
What can I say, I'm a rebel.
---
&gt; If FF14 or Nintendo's constant delays for quality are any indication, ...FF14 and quality in the same sentence?
---
Yeah? Name those 5 sets that every warrior has to carry around. 
---
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar. I on the other hand will be chucking lighting from my mighty cow paws! Going to be Resto/Ele hybrid until my guild has enough content on farm to main spec Ele. It's actually not that bad a spec once people start getting savage gear. Yea you go oom quick but Bosses die so fast you become playable lol.
---
I will have a win. As you’ve already stated in another comment, the majority of the things that were discussed today, were discussed here. But were never mentioned by blizzard.
---
We knew they were problems, but until today blizzard hadn’t acknowledged them, nor did they state how they broken, and that they had fixed them.
---
Which is why this is news.
---
I’d suggest the person that posted an upset OP about this being a lack of news, when it clearly isn’t, is the one being overly emotional. Might help to think on that. 
---
At this stage 0
---
I always thought tips out meant like... the tip of your dick.
---
That or he was begging for money.
---
Yup. Skinning is the ONLY profession that provides BOTH direct XP and Loot for coin without increasing distance of travel.
---
To craft something and sell via AH, is a time commitment away from xp gain.
---
You also increase the chance of rare loot drop by maximizing loot opportunities. 
---
dude that's my birthday, if its the 16th, I'm so hyped on this
---
It's actually my duo hero. So long as my friend actually plays his warrior to 60 with me healing him, I will eventually raid. Just hope he keeps playing
---
No any more than the original need or greed system would. 
---
All I see are two dead men walking... For the horde.
---
No it's not. Just got home and checked, I was thinking of skinning The Beast in UBRS. Devilsaur should only take 270-280 skinning.
---
I'm not disagreeing that you can find that on pservers as well. I've played on a fair share with some great people and had more fun than in Vanilla in different ways. 
---
But that was because I played with people who had played and loved Vanilla. So everyone kind of tried to recreate that with the good stuff. All I'm saying is that there's a difference in player mentality which isn't beneficial to social structures in most gaming communities these days which Vanilla was pretty much built upon. Like you said guilds are the best way to try and recreate that tough. 
---
What are the chances you think your friend makes it? Also when you say Duo character. Do you mean it will be your second character you only level when your friend is around?
---
What the models are those?
---
Two yellow humanoids hearthing frantically
---
I assume you're referring to Ion's comments at BlizzCon. He didn't explicitly say they won't shard places with contested resources, only that if they did shard them it would cause an issue regarding the server economy. Hypothetically there is a grey area in the middle where there is a sharding solution that helps performance without ruining/deflating the economy.
---
\*I'm not arguing either side\*, just mentioning that there are people on both sides of the issue and that \*Blizzard has not said much explicitly about sharding outside of the launch period\*.
---
Yes, I am cynical, however I also have a lot of faith in Ion as head of the project and recently \*renewed faith\* in the Classic Wow team following Sakaar's (formerly Classic CM Ythisens) recent comments on Esfand's stream and on ClassiCast.
---
I think your being sarcastic but I genuinely agree with this. World of WARcraft for me. I love pve but the wars gotta be raging. My hope is they do announce server size and they make both sizes. I'm not sure what the technical difficulties for that is though.
---
Not which year, though!
---
On an unrelated note, I put on 50 tinfoil hats on the Auction House. 15g each.
---
While I'm not a fan of the game myself, I respect that they viewed a product as being poor, and completely redid it with an apology saying they could do better. Meanwhile Blizzard over here is saying "Well while some people don't like being on fire, some do, so its hard to say who's right and wether we should not set people on fire or not"
---
not to mention frost reflecting a hunter trap
---
Hes definitely not in the minority lol you want to play a bootlegged version of the game created by some Bulgarian teenagers then go ahead, most of us want the REAL classic experience and that would be with a population of 2.5k-3k. Don't try to push your own agenda by saying that the majority of the players want a 10k population because it's not true.
---
I'm a member of a lost tribe in the Amazon rainforest working on classic, confirming July.
---
Why is this so accurate?  
---
She doesn't understand....yet
---
Plus, 10k pop servers are not the most enjoyable experience, at least while leveling.
---
That entirely depends on your guild. Many guilds will be ecstatic if you simply show up regularly for raids. They couldn't care less what your spec is or what gear you have. Sure, such guilds probably won't get further than BWL and ZG, but they'll also be entirely satisfied with that. I remember watching a mate of mine get a Rag kill for the first time and his guild went bananas. They felt like kings of the world. 
---
I mean blizzard made classic because they think it can make good money. I doubt they would have otherwise so it would probably be a better idea money wise to ensure it is as close to the original as possible. Messing with fundamental aspects won’t help in that regard. We wouldn’t accept sharding to reduce server costs or something. I wanna get away from that retail bs in classic and having loot sharing is just a step in the wrong direction. 
---
Nope, it's the people making a fuss about someone needing a purple BoE to get himself a mount who are fucking others over for making the game toxic environment. Period. 
---
Since FFXIV is currently eating WoW's lunch, they might be pushing to preempt 5.0 coming out on 7/2.
---
I disagree I was being overly emotional - I'm just stating that this isn't news, I'm not sure if that's being read in crying voice but I wouldn't know why that would be the case.  You said 'flexing' now it's 'emotional', I would suggest they're two different things and a slight moving of the goal posts on that point.
---
Also, you're saying they hadn't acknowledged the majority of those issues 'or even if they had' - seems to be setting up for a difference there but I hear what you're saying.  Again, I'll get your links, and I'm not hammering home the 'fixed' point, I've acknowledged that they didn't say it's fixed yet, but I've said they've noted they know about it and are working on, changing to fixed doesn't rock the boat for me.
---
Don't worry, I'll be thinking on it, and will hopefully be back with your links in a few hours ;)
---
"Classic is being created because of private servers ... but, for the most part, F@CK private server demands outside of No Change".  
---
It would be a mistake for blizzard to completely alienate the core of the people who got this going in the first place. The enthusiasm of these players is what will drive wow to a success or failure. I think it would be a crucial mistake not to have the option to play on servers at least the size of 6k-7k. Even if you have to offer two server sizes to do it. 
---
Well, they may still consider it a bug. Like I said, it wouldn't surprise me if they end up classifying it as an unintended technical limitation of the time.
---
INNNNNSSPECTTTTTTIIIIIIOOOOONNNN - LOTR orc
---
It saddens me that you are right and their isnt a damn thing I can do about it. Their puny god will always grant them the power to flee. 
---
Better watch MadSeasonShow and get excited with nolstagia series.
---
Disagree. Dungeon running is a huge deal and even into deep raiding you sometimes come back to them for items you couldn't get. It would happen post 60, pre-60 and even during raids.
---
Joinging a Semi guild run would instantly be less desirable. I've seen it in post WOTLK numerous times, and the guildmates always increase their mates odds. I know I wouldn't join anything unless I know the people.
---
Then there is UBRS, ZG, and AQ20 that frequently get pugged. It would and will happen. 
---
In vanilla it was much more easily noticed and as such people did not do it. With loot trading you are making it much easier, much less noticeable, and it would definitely ruin my experience if a really rare pre raid bis item that has --- 2% to drop and it finally does but I lose out because the two clothies are in bed together. 
---
Well he loves wow and is stoked but when we played in legion he fell out and stopped playing. This also could have been due to new gf and the shit play from legion. Personally I think he'll be happy to play an actual rpg. His gf also plays for 12 hours a day on PS4 so we should be good.   
---
I just hope I have time for priest too
---
Sadly true
---
To be fair there isn't THAT much to talk about that hasn't been done before.
---
And my Axe!
---
I guess you're right. But for all the "new" information about Classic (some) people here desire, they seem to have missed a lot of the information that has already been given. Several blue posts and dev water cooler posts explained that Blizzard actually has vanilla running internally, yet people still claim to "know" that Blizzard "can't" because they "lost all the data" (lol). This is what confuses me.
---
You are a min maxxer and Gnomes are the best caster race on the Alliance. Thats why.
---
Now that's just self-centred. 
---
You can't need on something in order to sell it, that's greeding. It's the very reason why coins were the symbol for a Greed roll!
---
Perhaps single player games are more suitable for that player then.

Hey man, I ain't ganna kinkshame.
---
Some people like getting run over in STV while questing, too.
---
Who am I to withhold their wishes?
---
&gt; Blizz never stated it would ONLY be at launch.
---
All they've ever said is that they may have sharding in the starter leveling zones to control launch day overpopulation and that they're still looking into any further use of the technology.
---
Yeah, martyrdom is a great talent. If you think it will be more beneficial for your play style, than I definitely recommend it. 
---
As for knock back, I don't ever really have an issue with it. If a mob is hitting me, I'm not casting but using my wand and letting renew heal me. The only time I really cast anything with this build is the opening mind blast and the occasional flash heal in emergencies. In those instances, I just use pw:s and never have any knock back.
---
In pvp martyrdom is undoubtedly better than imp pw:f. I just don't have any real issues with knock back with my play style. Whichever makes more sense for your play style.
---
Yes! I hated the post Cata quests because they were so gimmicky and the pop culture references, while maybe being amusing the first time around, got old real fast. Maybe the vanilla quests were repetitive to some but they were way more immersive than the later ones imo.
---
Oh no imagine drag and dropping /s

That's one of the most major reasons I have dislike for being adamant about playing a sub optimal class/spec. You don't give a shit about anyone around you or your guild, you're here for you, for your enjoyment, not here to be a team player.
---
&gt;Helping
---
Thats a stretch and a half
---
Yeah lol.
---
"We cannot let this issue die."
---
"...knave..."
---
Who the fuck says knave?
---
Are you the guy that posted this a week ago? I was gonna say back then it was a nice find, but should've had the map view of Ngorongoro included because people didn't agree with the resemblance.
---
I've been thinking about re subbing to grind gold for Classic sub but that is it. Dunno if I can be bothered though.
---
The obvious solution is to bring more friends so they can't runaway.
---
Odd that they didn't take the time to rest our concerns over loot trading and that they have removed it.
---
Notice how im talking as if they have decided it to not be implemented, as it shouldnt be implemented, PLEASE DO NOT IMPLEMENT IT
---
I think of it as insurance, I'd rather not have it!
---
I resubbed to start making money for wow yokes to buy year of sub time with gold
---
So DM farming first you'd recommend? Are satyrs better?
---
So is that the perception you have of me if I play a gnome dps warrior?  
---
#God I wish human females were real
---
Loot is final.
---
There you go no need for money on GM's and no problems caused, **do not implement loot trading**
---
I very much appreciate the input! I'm starting to lean towards giving BFA a try. It seems like it has perfect content for a casual player right now just waiting for Classic's release. 
---
So what you're saying is Gnomes are willing to nuke and genocide anything on a whim?
---
Man, killing every gnome I see on sight is just making me feel even more fuzzy and warm on the inside.
---
Makes sense it's a shame priest isn't your duo. Priest+Warrior is the gruesome twosome.
---
You clearly miss my point.
---
Do you want "No Change" or not?
---
Blizzard has ONLY stated we are getting "No Change" at launch. Until we hear otherwise, WHY are you thinking 10k servers will be a reality. They DO NOT REFLECT the original game.
---
They only exist on private servers. This clearly does not mean all private server feedback should be ignored, especially when the very reason why Classic exists is because of private servers.
---
So ya, Blizzard should NOT care about those crying for a MAJOR change like 10k+ populations that deviates largely from "No Change".
---
I'm trying to wrap my head around your twisted logic.
---
If it's "No Change" ... it doesn't mean "No Change, except for these things that I want!"
---
Since it's been brought up...
---
For a full **Enhancement** **raid** talented shaman (read: not optimized for PvP necessarily) I'd go with [this build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZVV0diMuLEoez00o).
---
You aren't going to get stormstrike because even though it does improve DPS, generally the debuff slots are full.  Even with 16 slots I'd argue you probably won't see your raid leader letting you spec into it, but who knows how things will pan out.
---
For a Full **Resto raid** talented shaman I'd go with [this build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxZEcxtieqo). Alternatively [this build](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-shaman-guide/) is also good for helping mitigate random damage on you from nearly every raid mechanic (fire=MC/BWL, frost=Naxx, nature=Naxx/AQ) if you aren't main healing the tank, you don't need ancestral healing. (or more accurately you don't need more than one shaman with the talent since it doesn't stack with other shaman)
---
For a **PvP focused Hybrid Resto/Elemental** talented shaman that can still contribute in raids [this build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEozE0MqZZVbe00xo) is generally the go-to "No-respec cost build".  You can swap the talent point between Nature's Swiftness or Elemental Mastery.  Whatever flavor suits you.
---
Noted! I'm still considering BFA slightly just to say I at least gave it a shot, however I'm not expecting to be impressed, as all I care about atm is Classic. Thanks for your input!
---
It would be ok for me even if i played a caster dps.
---
It would however be decent of them to ask first if it was ok before the run starts.
---
sus
---
Yeah, if you want bugs and hacking galore. Think of it like this:
---
Ancient operating system VS modern virus. Who do you think would win? The modern virus of course. Blizzard doesn't want that to happen with Classic.
---
Yeah, if they release it with no advance notice I probably won't even play.
---
Just give us a date so we can take the holidays from work 
---
My hype for Classic is definitely not waning, in fact, it's doing the opposite. I miss WoW so much that I might just play retail until Classic comes out. Then I will most likely ditch retail for good, assuming any future expansion doesn't interest me as much as Classic does.
---
Incoming environmentalist campaign:
---
\#NoChanges to the rainforest!
---
Really? Shaman market sounds too tantalizing. Also WF totem, aoe fire totems for mob grinding, herbing while ghostwolf. I still may go priest because the playstyle is more natural for me. I keep meandering between 60-40, 40-60 for the classes.  
---
The hardest things against each other is:   
---
Mind control &amp; levitate vs 8sham per raid &amp; ghostwolf
---
Based on what you said, I think shamans would be the best for you. They're the BEST support class on the Horde side, they can regen their own mana as well as others with mana spring totem (and mana tide if resto). They have a really cool pvp build where they go half ele half resto as a hybrid, so they can heal teammates but still 1 shot people with huge lightning bolt + chain lightning crit combos. You will be loved in dungeons/raids due to windfury totem, and will be accepted into any party. They also dont have a pet you have to worry about. They also have a 2nd hearthstone as well as a self rez on a large cooldown, as well as spirit wolf which can make your gameplay much more enjoyable and allow for much less downtime while leveling.
---
The one downside that I can think of however is managing your totems, but a simple addon can track all of that easily for you, so you'll know when you need to re-drop the totem, so its not too bad. At least your totems can't run around all over the place pulling unnecessary mobs :P
---
#*BUBBLEHEARTH INTENSIFIES*
---
Damn, that's rough. Yeah I'm still up in the air on if I am going to give it a try or not. My mind leans towards trying it, then I read other comments like yours and I hesitate again lol. I may just stick it out and try to outlast the painful wait of Classic's release..
---
Ulduar is the best raid because that's when ammo stack size increased. Anyone who says ammo isn't a bitch to manage didn't play hunter 
---
One could argue that the demo was the beta.
---
Yes, I posted it last week, but it was removed by Rule 1. Didn't contain any Vanilla stuff, so I had to tweek the post a little. And I understood some people didn't see the resemblance as you mentioned so I added the comparable map overviews. 
---
&gt;Unlike the seemingly popular opinion on this sub; most people don't become dicks purely because they can.
---
Did you see the general consensus about the funeral crashers on this forum?
---
I hate to break it to you, but most people who play MMOs don't have very good social skills.
---
If you keep that idea when we find aliens then you will be racist 
---
White Pony and Adrenaline were great for listening to whole albums. I liked listening to Toxicity - System of a Down full album a lot too.
---
Gotta convince them somehow! 
---
Classic on mobile
---
Well firstly I am not now or ever have I been #nochanges. I got a lot of stuff I would like axed or changed. My only support for #nochanges is that I think it can keep it kind of honest.
---
Major freaking changes I would make.
---
1. No more r14 gear. It's stupid and makes the game worse.
---
2. I would Rework all gear in the game and change how they intro new gear. Instead of raid tiers giving way better gear each time. Which by the time naxx drops ruins the game. I would make gear for different specs and diversify spell damage and Attack damage. Making it more granular. So you would get Frost power not Spell power. Or Axe Atk instead of just attack. I would use the raid tiers to drop new specs and styles of play instead of just a linear progression of strength.
---
3. All of the raids would be tuned to a much harder setting then they were in 1.12.1
---
4. I would increase stamina on all the gear.
---
5. I would double the world size (If possible, I am not a programer.) By this I mean I would just scale all the distances to be larger so the game looks mega gigantic. For me size and scale&gt;graphics.
---
I would change a lot. I am in no way shape or form #nochanges. I think classic wow is an amazing game but I also think it could have been improved to a massive degree. I want classic wow with some kind of (constitution) governing how changes are made. Not a snowglobe that never changes.
---
Yes that enhancement build is on point.   
---
Im torn between these two specs for early raids/dungeons - 19/0/32.  
---
 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxbuVcZZxfzzAeRo 
---
This is if I wanna do some minor PvP, but personally not into shaman pvp so I'll go this for gathering/early dungeons - 0/7/44 https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZx0bZxfxtAeqo 
---
Imp ghostwolf for herbing 🐕
---
Spot on mate. Made raiding tricky on the weekends after a few cans but otherwise yeah, FH and cancel. The mana issues were there though. 
---
We had some very good tanks in the guild though (Druss and Dielgore - shoutout to you guys!) and our other healers were all on point. 
---
Multiboxing has been allowed on retail since 2004. Assuming the TOS for Classic will be fairly similar to retail (they're on the same subscription) Blizzard will probably continue to allow it.
---
Regarding the client you're going to get the same multiboxing functionality that the current retail client has. It won't let you do stuff like write a complicated DPS rotation in LUA script the way you can in the vanilla client.
---
The way the game fosters community is great. The people themselves are not, generally speaking.
---
Take a look at all the doucebag behaviour that's totally normalised on private servers, like reserving basically every valuable item on any kind of run imaginable...
---
Well I wouldn't mind finding my server but you're right, most of the french won't speak english very well :-P
---
You're just leaving dps on the table, and not a small trivial amount of dps. It mostly depends on the group of people you want to play with. The level of effort and attention to detail you put in will be directly proportional to the kind of group that will allow you to play with them. If you choose gnome warrior, expect to be wiping in MC for hours (at least that's a more likely outcome).
---
Of course this is all from my perspective and how I intend to play and have been playing. I am not playing for shits and giggles. I'm playing to do something special and beyond what the average player would even imagine possible. I get my enjoyment out of pushing the boundaries with a group of others all pushing as well. You're only as strong as your weakest link, and my weakest link will not be a gnome warrior.
---
Saving 50g is better in my eyes than having to buy something that you should have gotten to begin with. Why do I want to pay 50g for something that should have been mine since it was an upgrade to begin with?
---
BoE items are fair game for everyone in the party, because gold is needed by everyone. If a BoE item worth dozens of gold drops in a levelling dungeon, who has the right to tell people they're not allowed that gold because they want a minor upgrade for a few levels?
---
&gt;In Classic, you approached NPCs based on their movement patterns and which pulls were not linked together.
---
Then you get that sinking feeling when 1-2 extra mobs pull you weren't expecting thinking "Welp, no amount of running will get me out of this. Guess I'll die."
---
it really does suck balls when you have 200 items in your mail, the mail doesn't auto delete either after you take items out
---
Most people agree high pop servers prolly maxed at between 3-5k active players.  Go play on a private server with 15k and tell me if you like WARcraft.  
---
Druid already has taunt bro.
---
Bruh its all about a wiley little boi named (dispel magic.)
---
I hate to break it to you, but most people are assholes. They just pretend they aren't.
---
You think witch burnings used to draw huge crowds because people felt bad about the poor people being horribly tortured to death?
---
anyone got a mirror or wowhead link? stuck on a secure network for 24 hours

TIL

Minimal? So he should maximize the effect on community with each video? Or maybe he should do what he likes? He really has had an effect on me, and you on the other hand seem to have a negative effect.
---
Tryhards gonna try. Hard
---
I don't have experience with satyrs but they are elite they might be harder in early gear. 
---
Hire additional game masters for all the ninja-loot tickets. The wages are only like $15 hourly.
---
I'm going too play dwarf ret paladin. I've done my tryhard years so I'm playing a meme spec.
---
Hopefully the updates are gonna be a bit more frequent
---
You dont have to be fresh to the game to enjoy his content. 14 years is enough time to need a reminder.
---
But then you have to be strategic about where you die, so you can actually rez without immediately dying again.
---
I'ma be honest, you attack his character first. Then he attacks your character, and then you call him autistic for doing it. Seems like the pot calling the kettle black to me. 
---
I play Horde since 2006 , but why would I attack a dwarf?????
---
/r/GamingCirclejerk
---
This is awesome and makes such a lame zone way more excited!
---
I never cared for the zone and actually liked Silithus more. (Odd I know)
---
On patch 1.1, the talents in 1.12 were NOT IN THE GAME or in different trees/worked differently. To act like classic couldn't be vanilla if they patched and tweaked things the same way that they did in their *twelve* major content patches is ridiculous. I read your posts, you're an obstinate professor of #nochanges. 
---
You don't have a valid argument is why you are hard to take seriously. It would be different if Blizzard was following a patch and development cycle that matched original release. I could see your argument against patches outside of that, even though they couldn't follow the same path due to exploits and bugs. The fact that they are starting in 1.12.1 means that nothing will change in terms of gameplay for the entire content cycle.
---
That is simply NOT vanilla. You can't capture an experience like vanilla with a still photograph, stagnant patch.  Why do you all want the exact same thing as a private server? They absolutely should tweak numbers and add deep spec utility to shit specs. Ret used to have Blessing of Kings as it's 31 talent. They used to get brought to things.
---
It's genuine, wide known fact that most specs are stupidly undertuned. Isn't this an RPG? Isn't one of the main issues with modern wow that there is basically no talent tree? That's a big complaint I have seen. Well in 1.12 every class has roughly one exact spec that separates them from viable and "holy fuck you're actually a tard". Aside from some very minor exceptions, that patch has no wiggle room. So what's the fucking difference, ultimately? It's not like adding different spec utility leads to homogenization, that's literally the opposite of what would happen. So what is your problem? You don't play a "museum piece".
---
Tbh hand of rag is a pally weapon
---
Helped me at least. I could believe some others too. But I guess some people dont count. One should be a expert to enjoy Vanilla guides.
---
A lot of classes I'm interested in in years and servers down the line, but I have to reroll my original Orc Hunter with the same name I used in 2005. Anything else would just feel wrong.
---
&gt; if a casual loses out on the initial launch week of classic would they really even care in the long run?
---
I'd care insofar as it may effect me grabbing the names for my characters that I'd want.
---
Many guides and videos helped me already. I think many others as well. Do you honestly think they harm the community? Or why are you against the content creators?
---
/cower was one of my favorite animations but it's not in vanilla. D:
---
&gt; It literally only affects PUGs pre-60
---
Yeah, because it's totally never going to be abused to gain high value BiS items from Dire Maul, Strath, Scholo, LBRS, UBRS...
---
This is 100% how it worked  in Vanilla. My alt was a warlock and I remember having the exact same moment of frustration as you.  
---
”That content is waste of time, but check out this better other content that I enjoy”
---
This is why private server people should stop talking like they know what/how classic is and should be. This won't be the last thing they claim isn't like the original.
---
TLDR: Private servers are blizzlike in appearance only.
---
I'd say single player games is more for players that can't handle seeing a virtual item go to someone else who can use it better. Like upgrading your entire outfit or buying a mount. I don't see any difference in one type being more social than the other. The only thing I see is people angrily shouting the illogical mantra of 1000g items are for the one person that uses it for 2 levels and not for the person who can buy an epic mount of it, lasting his entire WoW career.
---
I watch his stuff from time to time, I think it's important to look at content creators objectively from video to video. Now compare him to madseason, frost or melderon and you have way more depth you dealing with than the typical tips videos.  
---
I am not gonna say his videos are objectively bad. I do like everyone's input on classicast. 
---
Well we can agree to disagree as I see we have vastly different opinions, however blizzard has already said they won't be tweaking any data so it's kind of a moot point to argue about it.
---
Honestly, it is good. It's about the same, or maybe just a little slower than ret, but, you don't take nearly as much damage, so you have less downtime between fights. Also, you can take more mobs on at a time than you can with ret. Like I said, it might be the slightest bit slower, but I find it more fun.
---
I don't really dig seal of command at all because of how random it is, I prefer consistent damage that I can rely on.
---
Creative minds at Blizzard back in the days! 
---
I would be willing to preorder a collectors edition or regular one but im not subscribing until the day before release. I hope they have something that denotes I am only subscribing for classic.
---
Stretching out a 3-5 min video for 10+ mins and watering down content to maximize profit is sketchy and lame.   Not saying I don’t enjoy his videos or other content creators but it’s a noticeable trend in their content. 
---
/w hi, since you and that other rogue want ironfoe/hoj I hereby offer my need roll for just 5g so you can double your chances. 
---
Good times ahead.
---
Except that some people aren't stupid and will notice the absence of those issues being in this blue post. Proof is this thread itself. Those people will say that the lack of information regarding those issues means that Blizzard doesn't want to address them because they have no intention of changing them. Then you get the outrage anyway... Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
Don't forget this part too:
---
"this was an extremely padded summary"
---
Not true, DM has more than just "a few" useful pieces, most classes have a few considerable upgrades in it but more importantly if ruins the gold economy as hunters and mages will solo farm it for stupid amounts of gold an hour.
---
Well I mean I bet he invests a reasonable amount of time to his videos, so he should get at least something for the trouble. If the content is bad, people dont watch it. Its the same as saying ”modern music is shit and only monetized, and people should look for REAL music”
---
Daily reset limits need to die. I'd rather they nerf the loot instead.
---
Not really, it's a discussion on what we believe should happen. Nobody said everything discussed in this thread was on the classic team's agenda. At least I have taken the time to express my opinion and provide anecdotal reasoning, attempting to outline the logic behind my decision. If you didn't want to take the time to explain yourself better than "because it's how it was!!" then why even bother? This thread was never for you in the first place. 
---
They even tossed in that Classic Summer line for you inconsolable babies 
---
Atm yes, its a relaxed "lets be done with this shit" kind of atmosphere... ever since ToS Mythic in Legion. Classic is a nostalgia trip for most of us, not really in the mood for pushing any kind of ranking
---
3:00pm is also not soon^TM
---
Is there a mafia running the skin Game? 
---
I’d like to add that my uncle who works at Nintendo said the Switch version is launching in September with the exclusive Night Elf Mohawk class
---
When i played vanilla in 2006, i fell down in tanaris into ungoro. I thought i was the first one to discover this zone. And dinosaurs
---
&gt; who has the right to tell people they're not allowed that gold because they want a minor upgrade for a few levels?
---
Who has the right to tell me I can't roll on an item for the purpose of giving it to my friend?
---
I...never said it was for me? The OP asked for opinions and I gave my opinion, we even came to an agreement on some things. 
---
I have also explained why I don't like the idea of changing classes, as those changes could take the fun away from people who already enjoy those specs (my example was ele shaman).
---
 you just chose to ignore what I said because you disagree with me.
---
Pffft. Just put a desk in front of your toilet. 
---
Future dwarf paladin here.  25/26 dungeonbro spec

#NotAllHumanPaladins
---
My first guild leader was that human paladin. They were a great early wow guild; the first rag kill on our server (over Drama too, that went on to get some world firsts). Anyway, he was also the first on our server (and claimed world first) to get hand of rag, thanks to the efforts of our entire guild.
---
I will always remember you, Jinbei of Skyfang. 
---
Never forget.
---
I try to think of it through some other hobby's lens.
---
It's sort of like playing on a work softball league and insisting that you want to play shortstop even though you suck.
---
Now, if it's just a fun game, there's no reason to keep you from playing some shortstop. Have at it. Lisa from HR will play SS next and be just as terrible as you, but since we're not really trying it doesn't matter.
---
BUT if we're keeping score and everyone else is competing and trying to win? Then sit your ass in right field and bat 9th and be glad we let you play.
---
Noice!
---
True. Dwarves are the only race on alliance I don't kill much because I know they are bros. They are the Taurens of the Alliance. Undeads are the humans of the Horde.
---
The game is like 15 years old in case you forgot. There’s no “pushing boundaries” left lol.
---
I have I got banned for no reason from nost like a week before they shut it down. Loved the server. Unless their is a technical reason they can not why not have both server sizes? Callem PVPXL servers.
---
I got downvoted for hoping they address spell batching. Any people who think that not replicating the client/latency interaction of abilities in PvP will not have a major impact on how Classic PvP flows(and match ups between classes), is delusional. The people who said they care only about gameplay being replicated should by definition care about spell batching being emulated in Classic.
---
gear from leveling dungeons doesn't matter at all. Casters and hunters can level naked, melee can get weapons from quest rewards. The real problem will be BiS items from UBRS, DM etc 
---
Yes if u dont have pocket tank to run 5 mans with you, a lot of endgame in vanilla is about gold making u need gold for prebis boe, u need gold for repairs, gold for epic mount and farming stuff alone as healer is just pain, even herbing is kinda shitty becouse when u take the time to kill mob someone can snatch the herb right before you.
---
&gt;zul'gurub
---
Are you talking about his zool guroob video?
---
Battle chicken which buffs the melee attack speed of your party
---
Mark my words: Classic is gonna release around the 2nd July. Either on that exact date, a week earlier or a week after.
---
Either that or 8.2(maybe even 8.2.5?).
---
Why? Because each time a FFXIV expansion launched Blizzard released a major content update (6.2 and 7.2.5 respectively). And it is known that they generally line up patches or other releases with the releases of other rival games.
---
Nah, go with the poopsock
---
It’s 2019. We live in a more eco-friendly time. Shit in a pail and then put it into a compost heap in your closet.
---
Except it shouldn't be a 1 in 5 chance of getting it because the healer and the clothies (and maybe the tank) shouldn't roll on it to give it to their rogue/hunter/fury  dps friend. In true vanilla with good group composition and without loot trading, its 1 in 2 or 3 chance of getting it.
---
What opinion? All he yaks on about is his lack of opinion and asks the viewers what they think. 
---
It would make more sense for Blizzard to re-release TBC on new servers in 3 years, allowing people to copy their vanilla character across if they want to.
---
Yup lol. I’ve been pretty sure I want to play healer, bc that’s the most fun I remember having in vanilla, as priest. But two of my best friends are already prob rolling priest. I was really set on druid for a while, as I had fun with my druid alt back in the day...  but I rolled a hunter on pserver recently and found it a lot of fun. Also my original main was mage, so that’s at least a consideration. Etc etc. 
---
There’s a pretty good case for every class. Ultimately though I have to admit I end up wanting to optimize for best chance to get a raid spot. Because I pretty much experienced everything in vanilla except raiding, and I don’t wanna miss out this time.
---
No, you gave a weak ass example of Mana regen being their issue and how fixing that would mean they had to nerf their burst which would take the fun away. Just because you are incapable of thinking of a more creative solution to make a class group play viable does not mean it is impossible and should not be attempted. Nobody playing an offspec hybrid, survival hunter, enh shaman is happy with their class.
---
Instead of flat mana regen, ele shamans could get a talent similar to holy paladin that refunds (probably a portion instead of 100%) the spell cost on critical hits from lightning. Or, considering the entire thesis was adding UTILITY deep in poorly performing specs, add a spell crit totem DEEP in their tree.
---
10 seconds of thought. You can act like I'm just ignoring you, but you're really just not even considering anything that isn't part of your museum piece for no reason aside from stubbornness
---
I'm hard set on horde atm, but if I was forced to play alliance healing as a pally would be my first pick, and I love the female dwarf model
---
Can anyone give advice on which horde race to pick for Druid? Asking for a friend.
---
What do you mean by "kite adds" in this context? The only way I've seen it is the noob or weak gear way (banish) or the geared way (OT tanks them in the corner).
---
But in the "geared" or "pro" way, the OT needs big heals and great threat generation.
---
How does this "just kite" work?
---
ROFL. The video was really basic
---
The point of loot trading ninja is that you can't identify it because you don't know that half of the person who rolled need on an item they seem to need actually have a better item in their bag and just want to give it to another guildie/friend.
---
It might be fine for MC/onyxia if its a casual guild but your guild will be annoyed if you don't have a mana tide, and you won't feel good about being the worst shaman in the raid assuming everyone else is full resto. 
---
You're not taking into account the very valid reason of rolling gnome warrior for pvp purposes. Human racials are hot garbage for pvp except for those fringe duel-vs-rogue or warlock-with-felhunter-who-just-happens-to-know-a-rogue-is-around-somewhere cases. And let's not pretend vanilla PvE is so damn hard that you rolling a gnome would cause wipes. A guild of gnomes and night elfs could easily clear Naxx if all the other parameters for success are there. Does it leave quite a bit of extra dps on the table? In the case of warrior dps, it indeed does. Will you not be able to beat Patchwerk enrage timer because you rolled a gnome? Unlikely. Is gnome warrior optimal? No. But neither is human warrior optimal if you do any pvp (and gnome/dwarf very much is).
---
To tie this back to the topic at hand: while the difference is not huge, dwarfs make slightly better paladins than humans because of their racials unless you're the type of person who avoids any pvp like the plague and cares about that couple of intellect points difference. Anyone else will say thank god when they don't have to waste gcd's on cleansing rogue poisons or have to bubble out of a blind because they can just pop stone form.
---
For what it's worth, I will be rolling a human paladin in classic because I prefer them over dwarfs aesthetically.
---
Yea, high pop vanilla servers were ideal. That’s what you want. I haven’t played on any pservers, so I can’t comment on 10-15k, but low pop official servers are bad.
---
Because they red faraleth because they are red and we are green.
---
Just made an edit to the wiki for the crater, adding this as a cultural reference.
---
So TBC was less terrible than WotLK in terms of making huge amounts of the World of Warcraft obsolete and pointless. True enough.
---
Flying mounts, extra levels... 
---
Just like private servers, I'm ok with people playing on whatever expansion they want, but I really hope the real classic Vanilla WoW is kept alive as servers as long as possible.
---
Don't want to lose Vanilla a second time.
---
You can get some pre bis as soon as zul farrak, and this isnt a level 60 dungeon but a level 40 one.
---
Let loot be final.

Spell batching was the way latency was handled in the game until at least Cataclysm. Stop acting like its a small bug or inconvenience. It is a large factor in how the classes interact in a PvP environment. If you want Classic WoW to be faithful to the gameplay experience, like Blizzard has claimed, you should be for the latency interactions being replicated. 
---
“Knowing the intricacies of server processing shouldn’t be a prerequisite to excel in ant game” 
---
That is how many people become competitive in games, maybe you are averse to becoming knowledgable about the intricacies of a game but don’t act like its a good argument.
---
I’ve thought July all along, but an unannounced drop is not happening.
---
Can't wait to cave horde skulls in with a warhammer.
---
What are your thoughts on Night Elf Starshards holy/disc priest for levelling? It has decent DPM. I will be making a troll shadow priest but also want to do something unique that I haven’t done before. 
---
So much this. Dont like guides and videos? Dont watch them, and let people enjoy things. I hate when people tell others what should not be liked, especially if someone happens to make barely some pocket cash from it.
---
Adding more warlocks to your raid, especially less geared ones, will actually *decrease* your raid-wide damage, because you'll have low spellpower locks eating up improved shadow bolt stacks, decreasing overall damage.
---
This all changes post ZG when locks start doing better damage, so you can bring a few more to a raid and benefit or at least not hurt the raid so much.
---
Especially stage 1 though (MC/Ony) you should see them as support classes. They're there for the 3 curses.
---
High end guilds will still only bring 3 locks even in the later raids.
---
That's one hell of a comparison.         
---
The thing about the witch burnings, if you spoke up against it or expressed concern for "witches" you'd be the one burning tomorrow.       
---
I might just be extremely lucky or just selectively blind but i've met more nice than shitty people in wow.         
---
I get that humans will generally choose the easiest route to get what they want, even if they know it'd make them shitty people.      
---
But they don't like being seen as shitty people by others, and therefore will often think twice before doing something bad when they can get caught.        
---
Haven't been around the forums for a while while I wait for Classic news. So I'm back today with the blue sticky and I see the sub is still discussing the same topics to death. Guess I'll be back during the next update in a few months to probably see the same things being discussed :)
---
You need to go outside more.
---
That articulates my point so much better than me, thank you. I should have been more clear. What drives me to play this game and basically never play any other game is because I'm here to be the best and continue pushing to be better. If your attitude does not align with that, I'm not an asshole or kicking you or not accepting you.
---
And we're right back to being properly American.
---
God I love this schizophrenic country.
---
PERFECT PLACE FOR ME TO MAKE THIS POINT.  
---
In vanilla WoW, you DO NOT level up to 60 by doing dungeons alone. Therefore, regardless of your "role" in a dungeon, you still need the stats that help you kill enemies. People do dungeons while leveling, to get stronger gear for their questing and adventures. Druids, Shamans, and Paladins use different stats depending on the spec they've chosen to level up as.  
---
Paladins, even if they are healing the dungeon, HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ROLL ON STRENGTH, STAM, AGI, INTELLECT AND SPIRIT, because those stats help them while leveling. Although SINCE THEY CAN WEAR MAIL, it would be considered a DICK MOVE in my book to roll on Stam/Int Cloth against Warlocks, Mages, or Priests, due to the large loss in armor rating from Mail to Cloth. Leather with any stats is perfectly acceptable for Paladins to roll on.
---
Druids, even if they are healing the dungeon, HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ROLL ON STAM, INT, STRENTH, AGI, AND SPIRIT, because those stats help them while leveling. Since they can only use Cloth and Leather, it is perfectly acceptable for a healing Druid to roll on both DPS Leather, and Caster Cloth in a dungeon regardless of group composition, or the role they are performing at the time. If Robes of Arugal drops in SFK while I'm Tanking on my Druid, I am rolling Need because as a Druid, I desperately need STAM and INT to be able to shape-shift more than once. The Robes of Arugal has AGI on it. Clearly a Caster only item... NOT. I dont care if there is a Mage, Priest, And Warlock in the group and I'm Feral Tank. My Chest piece sucks and has only 2 Stam on it, I NEED THOSE ROBES AS MUCH AS YOU. What I dont need, is slightly more AGI or STRENGTH because Druids scale slowly and are weak no matter how much STRENGTH you stack at lvl 35.
---
Shamans, even if they are healing the dungeon, HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO ROLL ON STAM, INT, STRENGTH, AGI, AND SPIRIT, because those stats help them while leveling. Shamans need Leather with DPS stats. Shamans need Cloth and Leather with Intellect because they need more mana than base levels.
---
You dont level to 60 by healing dungeons. THIS IS NOT LFG AUTO QUEUE WHERE YOU ARE PLACED IN GROUPS BASED ON A ROLE YOU SELECTED. EVERYONE USES THE SAME STATS WHILE LEVELING, AND IF YOU ROLL A CLOTH WEARER, THAT IS A DETRIMENT YOU HAVE CHOSEN TO OVERCOME. If clothies could wear plate how fucking strong would they be? Hybrids need all the gear they can find to keep up with cloth wearers solely in cloth.
---
I was just advising him on how to not be quite as big of a spastic. 
---
I would have it no other way. I hate you but without you I would have nothing. I would be nothing. You complete me, you gross pink skinned S.O.B.
---
Wait people play this game for their own enjoyment? FUCK THOSE DUDES! Why I oughta....  /s
---
Again this disagreement comes from us having different views on what classic should be, which is fine. 
---
I have considered how blizzard could fix classes, in fact they could basically copy paste TBC talents and it would fix a bunch of issues, true.
---
I see that there is no point continuing this as we both feel strongly about our perspective opinions.
---
Elwynn Forest music hands down
---
After hitting 60 i'd spend most of my time in Goldshire waiting for things to happen and guild groups to form, Being just a short ride away from the Stormwind Flight Path
---
Well... the game is $50, and you are prolly going to want at least 3 months of sub to get leveled up, some gear, and start doing relevant content. So you are looking at $100 minimum investment, and $100 for 3 months of entertainment isn't bad if this xpac actually grabs you, but first I'd ask do you have any other games on your radar that you could use that $100 for? If so, I think that would be a wiser choice to keep you occupied the next 3-4 months.
---
I don't know what genre of games you are into?
---
If you like FPS games (and have a good PC) check out Planetside 2 - its free to play, is an amazing spectacle to see the big battles, and can be a blast if you get a group of friends on comms. (Be prepared to get wrecked for awhile though, the game has a serious learning curve).
---
I havent tried it but everyone says Apex Legends is great.
---
For MMO's I'd check out Guild Wars 2 - The original campaign is very good and totally free with no sub and no P2W, and due to the games level / gearing system - it allows you to be pvp competitive and still do lots of relevant PvE content without the xpacs.  (Both are $30, both good, "HoT" I liked better)
---
Otherwise I'd look for low cost / high replay-ability games like Rocket League or Killing Floor 2 - or older single player games you have may have missed out on like Red Dead, or the Witcher.
---
Just my 2 cents, GL HF.
---
Bring me back some Devilsaur leather. I still need the chest.
---
So annoying because we’re forced to watch them. Go I hate it because I have to click and watch them all. 
---
And then you all die on the way to BRM, because you rolled carebear races like human and nightelf without OP PvP racials helping you in a lot of PvP encounters.
---
I second that, but ya know, I've never been unhappy when a name is already taken and I finally settle for something else and end up with that. Just like the old characters you started with, you play with the new one under whatever name and begin to love that new character for who they are.
---
It fucks up the flow of PvP because the person with the best reaction time isn't necessarily rewarded. 
---
Honestly How much better would the zone have been if it had no real entrance. If you had to wall hack in through a series of caves. Just a straight up lost world zone for players to discover.
---
After the first read through of your rant, I assumed this was a shit post. After reading over it again, I am convinced that it is a shit post.
---
Loot-Trading, while not a "vanilla" feature still doesn't change the fact that ninja looting will be a thing. I  can distinctly remember running several UBRS runs and having my close friend (mage) losing the need roll on [Spellweaver's Turban](https://classicdb.ch/?item=22267) to healers, despite not needing the +hit chance. Assholes will be assholes, but the beauty of that is, those individuals can be blackballed in the community.
---
Yes, the potential for friends to roll on gear just to give to somebody in their party is a crying shame, but that can easily be negated by running with your own group of friends/guild. Vanilla WoW's biggest positive aspect, to me, was the sense of community and necessity to be social and make friendships/bonds. PUG runs do help to find new friends and perhaps a guild to join, but I'd say the arduous grinding and questing while leveling up will do a better job of helping to create those friendships and opportunities.
---
I'd LOVE to have a #NoChanges Classic, but honestly, since it can never and will never be the same experience as it was at release (been theorycrafted to hell, people having rose tinted glasses about some aspects, playing on PServers that are distorted, etc.), we cannot logically expect to play the game in the same fashion. 
---
What IS important is the fact that we're getting to play the version of WoW that I assume we're all wanting to play. 
---
Most Healing cloth are useless for dps clothie anyway (+healing and +mp5 isnt gonna be useful for any dps).
---
Didnt know that, but really makes sense 
---
Replying to this to save it, also because I don't think you'll find the links 
---
Loot is final - that's it.  The community will deal with Ninja Looters, just like in vanilla.
---
Please Google speed running. Then come back to me.
---
I'm not talking about whether or not you can clear the content. I'm talking about the difference between clearing MC in 20 minutes and 5 hours.
---
Any 2h is a pala weapon because they’re all trash.
---
What do you mean "other than that"? That aspect was awesome. Having a server community that could outcast people who were plain assholes made everyone more mindful of their behaviour. Steal enchant mats? That's the last person who's coming to you for an enchant.
---
Completely agree. IMO if you want to min/max PVE as a sole focus - sure don't go gnome. But, theres so many situations where PVP is bound to happen or if I'm going to invest time into my character I know that any PVP racial will make way more of a difference overall then some dps in a raid, which will probably be on farm by that point.  
---
Buy or make tons. 
---
Mail a crap ton of stacks to yourself via a mule (or leave in mule's mail, to quickly return to yourself).
---
You can pick ammo up at any mail box, anywhere you head.
---
Make getting the largest bags possible a priority. Not a major issue at that point.
---
I didn't realize it was a universal experience until now.  It's crazy how certain personality types seem to gravitate towards race/class combos.
---
I don't want this to be a 100% faithful rendition. I want spellbatching gone because it didn't reward reflexes or quick thinking. It rewarded people who are able to game the technicalities of server processing. Can you think of any other game that does this? No, because it was an obtuse mechanic that was not implemented in any other big online game of the time. There was no reason to assume that it was a design *intention* rather than just lag. I thought it was lag for a long time, as did every I know. 
---
It will be rare in some people’s eyes, because it is almost entirely *undetectable*. And if it happens so often, you can’t even complain to trade chat. Unlike an old-school ninja-ing, it’s so easy to do and so hard to be called out on it, that everybody will just be suspicious of each other. It takes away a lot of innocence of the game. 
---
Keep in mind, Loot is much harder to obtain and has a much larger impact, especially in leveling dungeons. I know many people *personally* who would abuse this tool to the best of their ability.
---

form of retail loot trading

Does their status as best overall healers make up for decades of child sexual abuse?

[And you'd be wrong.](https://youtu.be/VX7RuUcd-3Q?t=8m25s)
---
It shouldn't work on AoE spells though. Frost Reflector didn't help you at all vs CoC/FN, not even immune.
---
Shattered Hand? I remember there being a Skyfang on the alliance side(I played Horde). I remember the name been Jubei though. His picture was the first image on Thottbot for the Hand of Rag. 
---
In your example, you could have had 3-4 people rolling against you for Cadaverous Armor instead of the 1-2 that likely did, if loot trading was a thing.
---
Yes, yes and yes.
---
It was Jubei. This speaks so much to the community aspect of vanilla. The fact that you could remember all of that about Jubei and you weren't even alliance.
---
Well it’s your right to try to scam people... which is why we’re arguing against it being in the game?
---
Orc can get up to 40% (talents+racial) and +base stun resist which i think is 4.5%. Making it 44.5% stun resist.

Tauren.

I wondered as I typed it, but considering a good chunk of this sub’s users I figured it was for them.
---
- premade bg comps and tactics.
---
-city raid tactics.
---
-a guide which tells you when its more profitable to farm than to quest
---
-how to play your class against every other class in the game.
---
Just a couple of ideas i came up with on a whim. There is alot of content not cowered just lacks creativity to make them.
---
Should be a good bit of research then, I’ll do the digging and see what I come up with. Reference points for later if anything. I’m keen to hear the wording again too.
---
Ok so you want to change Vanilla PvP. Just be honest. You understand it is a large change in how Vanilla behaved. I want the game to behave like Vanilla, and you do not like that aspect. Just be honest. 
---
I really hope this game needs the same 256 mb of RAM as vanilla. I just want to play on my laptop like with servers.
---
And do you think that race choice will make the difference between 20 minutes and 5 hours? On a popular private server right now there is an alliance guild that mostly consists of gnomes and dwarfs for pvp reasons, yet they have the 4th fastest MC logged on LegacyPlayers at 28 minutes. I suppose they could have been 2 minutes fasters if they all went human.
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand and agree with your general point that a good degree of minmaxing is important for smooth and successful raiding. But there's many other factors than what race you choose that have a bigger impact on your clear times.
---
Personally I would avoid inviting a pala tank to our group. As you said yourself, lack of taunt = wipefests
---
I agree, was just talking about my opinion on the filter. 
---
Getting smashed by SoC with Hand of Rag will do that to you. :) Cheers mate.

Many things including the debuff limit may not of been a design intention but a technical limitation. The fact that they were a design limitation is beyond relevant for the discussion of Classic wow, because it's design philosophy is to emulate Vanilla wow. The game should play and feel like Vanilla wow, as the devs have iterated over and over. You wanting to update the game to your standards it not relevant to the game behaving similar to the original client.
---
Please read what I said again before further embarrassing yourself. Private server forums are filled with people who want private server level player caps.

Better get a paladin tank that do a slower run if you can than wait for 1 or 2 hour for a warrior/druid tank to show up (if one ever show up at all, i saw a group looking for a tank for 5 hour straight 2 days ago before they even managed to find one).
---
We're so fucked. This was not reassuring. Ugh, pservers are going to be closer to blizzlike than Blizz.

I like how you guys have determined that the GM tickets are a "non-problem" despite Blizzard, the creators of the game, saying otherwise. 
---
25/26? Can you link it up? You got me curious!
---
Absolutely. This shouldn’t be an issue.  If it’s an upgrade then roll need.  Why would anyone be pissed about that?  Just because a clothie can’t use mail doesn’t mean a mail wearer can’t use cloth. If it’s better then need it. End

If the xeno scum were so cool they'd have found us already.
---
Rock and stone, brothers!

low from exploring.. extremely low.
---
but none from nodes

Anybody know of an archive for all old shows? Blue Plz! + Total Biscuit's other work is available but I'm looking for the podcasts of the smaller shows.
---
Are you planning on tanking? Why not go 20/31 for Holy Shield?
---
But with madseason at least he compares the patch notes to vanilla and he did played it back then.. I really like MadSeason
---
The eternal conundrum: gnomes are awful, but without them we'd have nothing to punt.
---
They post it on March 1st and refer the Winter as past tense. June 1st release confirmed?
---
Affecting pre-raid PUGS negatively is a lot bigger of an impact than helping to fix looting mistakes.
---
If you're knowledgeable about your class then you can tank dungeons as a paladin without many problems. Full stop.
---
Bleh even worse =\
---
Classicast vrs countdown to classic
---
This conversation put a huge grin on my face. The amazing journey of chasing notoriety &amp; glory on your realm, and the thrill of encountering your server’s legends out in the world. Nothing like it.
---
&gt; Because I am thinking about doing a non-combat progression character if that is possible.
---
Not possible in classic.
---
When I first started in 2005 I played hunters. Plural. You'll catch yourself mid-dungeon going "lol sorry gotta hearth for arrows brb" a few times and then it'll stick lol.
---
You can carry enough arrows to get you through whatever you're doing, though, so don't worry, just remember to restock in between dungeons.
---
I swear Gnomes are the greediest MFs I have ever played with during all my years of WOW.  "You guys mind if I need on this? I'm gonna need anyway.  I know I can't use it but I can sell it for silver and I'm kinda poor right now" ....GRRAHHHHHH!!!
---
It might be a pessimistic view, but one could argue yours is a naive view.  There are lots of casual players that aren't part of the 'server community' that could be abused without any recourse if it happens to them in the one dungeon run they do a week
---
U really hate yourself huh?   Kidding but dang. Cow warrior?  Brutal
---
Once you get Consecration you can tank. Tanking as a paladin requires that the group knows how to play with a pally tank. They should watch their threat a bit more and your healer should understand that your mitigation is worse than a warrior's.
---
&gt;I get that humans will generally choose the easiest route to get what they want, even if they know it'd make them shitty people.  
---
&gt;But they don't like being seen as shitty people by others, and therefore will often think twice before doing something bad when they can get caught.
---
That's what I just said :/
---
Everybody gets wrecked eventually. I thought I was hot shit back in the day. There is ALWAYS a better player.  Always. 
---
At this point I wish blizzard would take a stance on this just so you people will shut the fuck up about it.
---
If you are desperate, yes. I've even done scholo with t3 rogue tank which was fun. But generally for tanking, and assuming equal level of gear and knowledge of class, warrior&gt;&gt;druid&gt;pala.
---
If you have plenty of mobs to round up and tank, it's the quickest way to level.
---
At launch, zones will be crowded, and this method won't be as quick. After a few months it'll work well. Either way it can be done, and the benefit of going 1h+shield is you can totally tank dungeons (get consecration)
---
I’m on vacation mid June to July 9th. Pray for me boys.
---
Pally or Shaman weapon normally.  Warriors usually grab a 2h from BWL or in my case the awesome Obsidian Edged Blade from Garr.

Ponder this a moment....  there will be a TON of newbs that will want to try out a bunch of profs right?  Maybe stacks of low level mats will be a good time/gold investment early?  Obviously that’s not the BEST idea but who would come here and give out their actual best ideas anyway?  I’m sure the early economy will be full of folks that don’t know they are wasting their mount money on leveling tailoring. 
---
No need to waste your time with links if you can’t prove they already acknowledged these, stated why they were broken, and that they were fixed. 
---
Which was the news. 
---
tank set, dps set, FR set, NR set, PVP set + consumes etc xd
---
Hahahaha, he actually had a heavy southern accent and would yell out his crits in premade bgs. It was quite the experience.
---
The hero we need
---
"Grinding/leveling is the ONLY time bag space is an issue", ummm im just gonna stop you right there mr. ive never set foot in a raid before
---
If you enter a battleground without being orc for stun resist or undead for WOTF you need to delete your character /s
---
Well while undead druids are considered pretty overpowered and Orc Druids are PvP masters with stun resist, realistically the only race to play as a Druid is a Tauren because of the OP +herblism racial and cool /moo emote.
---
Orc rogue. Easy peasy 
---
There are gonna be so many “I thought I knew my husband—what’s happening to him?” posts on r/marriage this summer
---
You were a weirdo with no guild then. I had certain guilds I wouldn't group with, but being in a respectable good size guild more or less kills this issue....
---
HEY hands off MadSeason!
---
&gt; Hire additional game masters for all the ninja-loot tickets.
---
Ninja loot was final in vanilla wow.
---
I didn't entirely hate Malderon's video, as it was only long enough for him to read the post and add a bit of useless commentary after. Still completely unnecessary, of course, but what can you do?
---
Granted, I'm biased; Defcamp seems like just about the only Classic-oriented CC who actually takes fantasy and flavor into account in his "which X should you choose" videos, which I appreciate. None of it's new, but it's at least more interesting than yet another dry mechanical breakdown of the various racial abilities.
---
I would absolutely love to play paladin (ret) if they just had a single melee attacking ability that wasn’t auto attack lol
