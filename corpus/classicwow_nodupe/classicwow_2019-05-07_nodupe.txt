The only thing you need for grand marshal is time. And the main thing you need to be a top raider is to be able to play at the same time as 39 other people who want to be top raiders. 
---

---
Neither of these are things that are worthy of praise. 
---
While you're waiting around for 39 other people to get organised or for the BG queue to pop because you're on the over populated faction I'll be off with my small group of real life friends short manning leveling dungeons and actually having fun.
---
---
---
Keep kidding yourself you are slowing down anything, yeah you are slowing down THE WHOLE FACTION, it will help!!!! THEY GET LESS GEAR because of that!!!! woohoo. /s
---
try to do it and see how well it works, and how much it slowed them. you are such a "common sense"  bra. so "self-evident" haha. this is some hilarious reasoning. 
---
Im all for pvp servers, and completely fine with ganking and a broadscope pvp action, but what you saying is some far-fetched nonsense. and postfactum reasoning. You can jsut kill other faction you dont need to justify it. Thats not how it works, and also it wont lead to the result you are proposing. or tell me you gank ppl left and right and as result month later other faction has more gear? right? lmfao. you live in some illusory world if you think so.
---
Why do ppl kill other players? Unless its fighting for a farming area or mobs you need to kill, ppl are killing other ppl to show who is the boss, and assert their dominance, thats it. basically for fun, faction pride and revenge, and so they wont kill them.
---
June 29th, that's the day after my hire date and the day after I can use my vacation days and they do not roll over. And my company opted for a slow accrument of vacation days instead of getting all 4 weeks at once. 
---
So it will be released when I only have 1 or so hours of vacation time available even though I've stock piled my two weeks until now hoping it's released before June 29th...

Please stop. My mom reads this thread and if she finds out I‚Äôm not the internet boss I‚Äôve told her I am she‚Äôs gonna start charging me rent and I just can‚Äôt deal with that currently. Didn‚Äôt bother reading your angry book, apologies weirdo.
---
I think it comes down to an overall rating of pvp rather than just healing or dps. With UD you get WotF which can be stronger than troll racials for specific pvp healing to counter some CC. Trolls have berserking for when they are pressured and hex of weakness which both can be used constantly rather than situational. Trolls definitely excel in shadow pvp with Shadowguard, hex of weakness, and berserking. Devouring plague is quite mana expensive for UD shadow but great for 1v1. We can go on for days with all the pro's and con's in every situation, but as I said earlier...at the end of the day play what you want, it doesn't matter
---
Except that vanilla wow basically has next to zero faction based pvp bonuses and 90% of endgame content is behind an instance (including BGs)...and server 'domination' just means your BG queues will be awful.
---
Playing tbc server while I wait. That way it isn't a waste of time imo
---
I would say Arcane Intellect and Polymorph (if doing dungeons) are also important.
---
Comon pokey!
---
Yoink üòí
---
Also the arctic wolf and red wolf. They look like lvl 40 mounts but they are special colors that were only in the game for a few months. I‚Äôve only seen two people in retail with them (both wolves I mentioned)
---
omfg i still have all mine too
---
Just as a point, the tokens don't actually generate any gold... well they have the ability to generate a small amount if the market price shifts down after you list it... but that's not super relevant most of the time.
---
Since it's not actually adding gold to the game, would it really be that bad? They would be valued significantly lower in Classic, because the general availability of gold is much lower. Instead of being 140k or whatever, they'd be like 5-10k instead I reckon absolute tops. 
---
&amp; if it gave people that are only playing classic a way to play without paying real $? I'm all for that. Not everyone will be able to afford the $$$ and making people play retail to be able to buy game time to play Classic is a feelsbadman moment.
---
Yea i'm aware bro
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Just telling you stoneskin isn't that great relative to what it starts out as
---
Like need rolling because they need the money.
---
It's ok. You don't have to be so negative towards things. People don't care to hear it when they're excited about something. You can just keep your opinion to yourself. The world could use more of that.
---
This \^, I've had my current rig for 4+ years now and salvaging parts and such just isn't worth it. Needs change over time and what you need from your computer will change. Personally, I'm going more towards small form factor so that's 100% all different parts xD.
---
So the argument would be about which part of the game takes more emphasis. The pre-game farming or the actual game.
---
No but if there's an open beta I guarantee you'll have some select addons at launch
---
Yes those are essential. I forgot about them.
---
Of course there will be, reasons there isn't one now are because the game isn't out yet, and your not supposed to stream pservers, wasn't there a twitch post saying they could ban people for doing it?
---
lol desperate prayer?
---
  
---
no

Fearward is one of the most broken spells in teh game and trivializes many fights for alliance

Classic will run on modern infrastructure which has way tougher anti-bot systems
---
Never played classic (or much of WoW in general).   However, I‚Äôve played MMOs where the best content the game offers is ONLY in PvP zones.  I love it, even ‚Äúmindless‚Äù tasks like gathering can put you on edge when you can get ganked and lose all your loot at a moment‚Äôs notice.  
---
What really turns me OFF about PvP servers in WoW (from my understanding, again, never really played) is that one faction ends up fucking dominating the other.  Seems like a shit deal either way.  You‚Äôre either outnumbered 10:1 and can‚Äôt get anything done, or you‚Äôre a little bitch who joins the dominating faction to get a free pass.  Hyperbole in both cases, but you get my point.
---
That‚Äôs my *speculation* from the outside.  Is it off base?  I‚Äôd really like to hear the perspective of those who experienced PvP realms back in the day.
---
Seems like you're basing your point around rewards, which is no surprise considering retail is entirely reward driven.  
---
With that said, the appeal of Classic PVP was not the rewards. You need to look more inward at the classes themselves to see what was so interesting about it. In retail, every class can do everything because they've all been beaten into the same mold. Healing, stuns, spell silences, CC, AOE; every class is the same in retail.  
---
In Classic, each class performed so uniquely from each other, and simply playing a class in PVP because you chose that class for its playstyle was enough satisfaction.  
---
Do I want to be a stealthy class who can kill and dash? I'll play a rogue. Do I want to be a wrecking ball? Warrior. Caster with high control? Mage. You thought about what you could *do* in Classic PVP before you thought about what you could *win*
---

Ready Player One, Matrix and Memento? o.O
---
The whole point of vanilla is it's an immersive world
---
The amount of people who are ready to full consume ever time they log on will be few and far between.
---
The ones who log off to retail to go play a lobby game probably don't understand vanilla.....The whole point is building up your bank/bags so your choices outside PvP/PvE matter. 
---
Consumables and buffs are a very significant % of your stats in vanilla. You have to come a bag full of consumes to win real pvp matches. 
---
This aint' retail bud that's the point
---
&gt; the rewards back then were
---
The rewards back then were: *having fun*. That was the reward. I know the modern game is about *physical* (virtual) rewards now, but back then the fun was what you were after.
---
Mankrik's wife gets the elixir.
---
If you enjoy ganking and the ability to gank is worth getting ganked and corpse camped far beyond what you consider fun then roll pvp. If you are insecure and think you might be considered a carebear, roll on pvp and hate your life.
---
I know that they don't generate gold.

I get this feeling. As a kid, my desk was right next to my windows that I'd keep open during the warm summer nights. I'd sit playing WoW until the early hours and I'd love the smell and feel of those summer night breezes that would occasionally come in through the open window as I sat at my PC exploring Azeroth.
---
I miss the days of being able to stay up all night without feeling tired :(
---
No shit.
---
90% of gear you get is from quest rewards though... So realistically there will only be competition in dungeons.  This allows you to choose quests that will give really good targeted rewards for both if you.  For example, both getting big dps increases by doing a quest with a good wand reward.
---
Ok, that is actually funny.
---
And i am saying that as someone who is in favour of sharding at launch.
---
I don't see any need to justify or explain it.
---
It's fun killing the other faction.
---
Don't get me wrong...it's also fun to occasionally help someone on the other faction as well.  Knowing that you're teaming up and assisting someone with whom you can't really communicate at all.
---
That also makes it even more fun when they invite their friends over and you murder all of them, while leaving the original person alive...
---
Grave robbers in duskwood?
---
Is there a way to generate links you can send to others with the talents? save button only seems to save it for myself.
---
I don't know if *you* know that ridicule isn't sufficient to dismantle a proposed argument.
---
Which of my four steps would you like to dissect and take a shot *explaining* to me *how* I'm wrong, rather than simply *asserting* that I am?
---
How does killing opposite faction members *not* slow their average exp per hour, for instance? Every corpse run is lost efficiency.  You can't get kill experience when you're dead. Are you literally questioning that killing people affects their productivity? That's a new one, for sure.
---
Each of my premises follows the last, as best I can tell, until someone does a detailed dismantling of why it wouldn't follow that killing people in the field whenever you see them ultimately impacts how quickly they get to 60 and therefore how quickly they get geared up.
---
You've taken a really interesting devil's advocate position on this, and I'd be intrigued to see it get more detailed than "I got more angry over a Warcraft sub-Reddit post than anyone had any idea that i could".
---
Dunno, tonk exploit made it to tbc. Why would another interaction not go unnoticed?
---
We will be getting classic pvp. People like it. It's fine
---
There is a ton of questions not answered. How will sharding work? What are the servers and battle groups
---
Ended up hearing two!

You're not alone.
---
I thought that he had put in all his vacation towards the release of classic, but then ends it with 'I took one for the team'.

But I think he's already locked in his vacations, not for classic, and only have 3 days left to use for whenever classic gets released.

**[NA][Alliance - Warrior][PVE with a dash of PVP]**
---
**Semi-hardcore player looking for a guild**
---
**Other/misc details:** 
---
* Warrior (DPS preferred)
---
* 30 years old, work a 9-5 job, can raid in the evenings
---
* Eastern (EST) specifically
---
* Primarily a PVE player however I do love PVP as well. I made it to rank 10 in the original rank 14 grind.
---
* Was a hardcore raider from the very beginning days of Molten Core and cleared everything to Sapphiron in Naxx.
---
For now, I can really only commit to semi-hardcore dedication. I would absolutely love to go hardcore but sadly I am no longer in highschool and have other obligations. While playtime may have suffered a bit I have maintained my hardcore mindset over the years and it has never waned to this day. I still raid even now. Full heroic BoD and CoS cleared for current content (Mythic doesn't interest me much due to the current state of the game), and I have raided in other games such as Final Fantasy XIV.
---
I can be reached here on reddit or via discord @ Arte#4321
---
Thank you.
---
The first thing that came to my mind when they introduced Mythic+ was Diablo III's Greater Rifts.  Way to differentiate your gameplay, Blizz.
---
You can train immolate at level 1 as well, you just have to sell your gear and water for 10 copper
---
Nah, you just didn't get the joke and are somehow blaming everyone else.
---
The points he made were valid. You can't trust the new developers. You cant trust the community. If you can't deal with nothing come out after Naxx dont play. The only changes should be if there has not be changes should be minor class balancing.
---
maybe their wrist got deformed during reanimation....
---
It‚Äôs because they aren‚Äôt saying what we want. Once the release date is announced this sub and the official forums will drop in activity from all the people who are only here everyday to check if the release date was announced.
---
Riiiiight the beta was at 2018 blizzcon and the teaser was 2017... How time flies while I'm sitting here in the fetal position waiting to summon demons to do my bidding.
---
Pservers have completely removed world buffs for the 1st ~month of any content drop, so none of those day 1 clears had any wbuffs at all.
---
Ah, ok. I knew about Shadowguard as an spriest due to blackout procs but hadn't really heard much about them on the healing side and pretty much every priest I knew had always said UD was the only choice on horde side.
---
I still remember when i got my Lionheart Helm in 2005
---
So jealous. They aren't coming anywhere near me this tour :-/
---
Undead priests are the best!
---
I haven't known what most of my items are called for the last several expansion, except for maybe my weapons and my trinkets.
---
Great content, start a yt channel
---
I remember a year or two ago, I saw my classmate boot up a game on his computer I hadn't seen in a while. It was WoW. He clicked a button that I vaguely remember from when I quit in wotlk, and joined LFR, and proceeded to clear whatever the raid was. 
---
In class, using his laptop's mousepad, while halfway paying attention to the lecture.
---
Needless to say I was somewhat confused.
---
It's like not even hearing about game of thrones until season 5. That was a good weekend of bingeing.
---
Dual wield as Warrior I'd add. 
---
Expose armour on rogue. Also gouge and kick past r1.
---
The memes are getting worse
---
it's super gatekeeping. rp is a mentality and you can apply it to wow just fine.
---
Hyenas? Or giraffes in barrens have no quests for them that I know of
---
Blind removal and an instant big heal are huge deals.  Fear Ward is good but not nearly as good as you think.  Content is already easy enough.  And one fear block every 30 seconds is nice but it's only one Target and you cannot use it while feared like stoneform blind removal.
---
Not showing the phat lewt, instant downvoterino.
---
Shit doesn't burn very well.
---
Yeah, what I choose to skip depends on if I Am Number 1 leveling professions, and number two if I am trying to get my Mount at level 40.
---
Man, I cannot stand reading about BfA after all this Classic WoW hype. LFR, Dungeon Finder, Mission tables, World Quests, War Fronts. These are all the things that made me quit WoW.
---
It's not a big heal ever, that's the problem
---
In context next to a shield and renew it's nothing
---
Paladin would be helped by desperate prayer much more than a priest because of lack of instants. There you really do struggle to keep yoruself up if you don't want to stop moving
---
Yea so I was thinking. Using dual wield to build rage and proc overpower. Get overpower proc, sweeping strikes, weapon swap to 2h, overpower, deep wounds on two targets. May be a good way to level from 30-40 till mortal strike.
---
I LOVED how lower level characters could still be moderately competitive against max level toons. Even to the point of breaking away to safety, or teaming up and dropping one.
---
After BC, that all began to go away. Lvl 67 vs lvl 70 and you stood no chance. Might as well sit there and die, because you aren‚Äôt getting away either.
---
Yeah I was really looking forward to balance pvp aswell look really fun. Druid will probably be the way I go.
---
The only reason they're doing classic wow is because the fan base nagged them so fucking much they gave in. Initially blizzard were insistent that they would never do classic servers.
---
Yeah...  this is pretty asinine. 
---
Look, PVP servers are a blast. Sometimes it‚Äôs real shitty and sometimes it‚Äôs real fun. But ‚Äúserver dominance‚Äù is cringe as hell. No one gives a shit about ‚Äúdenying the opposing faction experience to slow down their end game.‚Äù That‚Äôs not a thing when end game is all instances and raids. 
---
PVP is fun, that‚Äôs all you need to say. Doesn‚Äôt need some kind of try-hard justification.
---
I mean Blackrock had its motto for a reason.
---
It sounds like PvE is for you. There's nothing wrong with that, as it will probably allow you to experience the lore firsthand by downing more bosses than you reliably could if you're losing your world buffs and getting killed over skins/herbs/ore.
---
But...for the rest of us, the "contested zones" exist for a reason, and they are to be contested with skirmishes across the land. When one of my faction is farming herbs, I want them to feel relatively safe in doing so, and they'll feel safe if we harrow every red-name to the point where they're afraid to set foot in those zones. 
---
Obviously, results may vary, and we could end up the losing side...but part of the fun for myself and many others is finding out who collectively "wins" in that regard. I suppose victory is many things to many people, but on a PvP server, the opposite faction members and their quest givers, flight masters, etc. are
---
Im almost certain I can get something without having to heal.
---
Lmao
---
I‚Äôd disagree, I was just at TB at 1am and it was not nearly like this
---
cool your jets dude by posting here you make us all look like whiny assholes.

May 17th Announcement.

July 15th as release date.
---
See you then lads.

Spirit gains a massive boost in desirability once the Darkmoon Faire becomes available. The Beasts deck builds into [this](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19288) iconic trinket.

Yo, check this out:

https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview
---
Sometimes it's fun to help them. Be nice and /wave /happy. Then gank them.
---
Or a druid ganks your alt while you are at 20% with no cooldowns. So hop on your main to camp them for 30mins.
---
Absolutely right.   
---
I played BfA upon launch to try and reignite the flame but after a few weeks, the only thing to really chase was finishing the pathfinder achievement and grinding rep and dailies. I had pretty decent gear and ran mythincs up to 7-8 which was pretty tough at the time. In any case, it got boring.
---
I took a few months off and not long ago I bought some more game time ,only because a rare BoE drop had given me enough gold to pay for the month in gold and still have plenty left. I logged in and did the Darkshore campaign thing, a small un-coordinated 20 (+?) man event. As a reward, I was given some legs that exceeded my current item tremendously. A higher ilvl, in fact, than any of my other gear, some of which I had to work to get. All for simply engaging with an event where I could have been afk for, or not damaged a single mob. 
---
If that is the threshold for getting gear and gaining power then what on earth is the point. There was no sense of achievement, no sense of pride or character progression. Simply blizzard giving me a free high-level epic for engaging with the current content... I played for 1 hour and have not logged in again. I just dont see the point...
---
Anyway, rant over. Cant wait for classic!

This is why I go on reddit at work

&lt;Dominatus&gt; \[OCEANIC\] \[HORDE\] \[PVP\]
---
Time Zone: GMT+10
---
Raid times: Starting from 10:00pm GMT+10 (# of days per week TBA)
---
Goals: PvE (Semi-hardcore raid progression)
---
Loot: EPGP (Details TBA)
---
Contact: [https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX](https://discord.gg/Hcy87MX)
---
Guild info: Dominatus is a late-night, semi-hardcore guild. Raiding will start at 10:00pm GMT+10 time so this would suit WA players or East Coast nightowls. We will not be rushing for server firsts but intend to develop into a high quality raiding guild for like-minded players. We have Vanilla raiding experience up to the first couple of encounters in AQ40.
---
Applicants: Anyone can apply, the levelling journey as a guild will be focusing on general recruitment and working out raid roles. Vanilla raiding experience is highly preferred but not mandatory. It is expected that players will have a moderate-to-advanced knowledge of their class as well as a committed ethos to raiding (familiarising yourself with mechanics, farming consumables, acquiring BiS gear etc).

Great post and lays out the reality of PvP servers. The only thing you forgot to mention is when a faction has an overwhelmingly dominant position on a server. Then it's not even worth logging on as the opposing faction. Rare but it does happen. 
---
I normally roll on a PvE server. Never liked playing on a PvP server at all but the choice is there for those who want it. The weird thing is when people roll on a PvP server or game that's PvP oriented and bitch about it. If you roll on a PvP server, PvP happens in all it's various forms. You chose it, it wasnt forced on you. Either live with it or leave
---
...and then they saw the success of OSRS, and stopped being fucking stupid.
---
So you're problem is that someone leveled faster to 60 than you and decided to kill lowbies....
---
I really just can't with a lot of people in this sub
---
Dual wielding isn't bad at all if you have decent 1h weapons.
---
most of them are actually very informative and give us interesting and helpful insights. "10 chars per realm" isn't new, useful, interesting, or exciting news.
---
Yeah for sure, OSRS is a good example of how its not always nostalgia that makes a game good, but the fact that its a much better game than the current.
---
Nothing better than not killing someone and then they kill you when you're low. 
---
Then the anger of running back and disrespect makes you camp them for 3 deaths.
---
And every single time you see them again
---
Yes,  I make a list and I check it twice
---
People in this subreddit don't care about retail though. There is no need to try to defend  Diablocraft here.
---
No one else started reading this in a Russian accent after OP apologized for their English? No issue reading it either..no need to apologize compared to many others.
---
Yah but majorly of players like current retail aspect so majorly of votes would be from shit dicks
---
Yeah I appreciate that the creator kept the toonish art style (most ‚ÄúWoW in Unreal‚Äù discard it all too readily), but it seems a bit *too* toony.
---
I think it‚Äôd help a lot to ramp down the saturation and what looks to be subsurface scattering or SSAO a bit. Could also use some roughness for the sand/stone.
---
Release date will be July 30th. The announcement will be late May/early June. The actual timing of which will be determined by when they need some positive news. Pure speculation. ATVI's quarterly earnings report being in early August is what is driving my guess.
---
I played Alliance in Vanilla. I kind of wanted to go Alliance for that nostalgic feel again but my group of friends seem to all be leaning towards Horde so it looks like I'll be going Horde this time. I did level some Horde toons in Vanilla so it's not completely a new experience but I never hit max level on it. 
---
I just hope the servers are pretty balanced. I really do not want to pick a server and have it completely one-sided.
---
Have you noticed that world pvp died after those things came into existence? Turns out most people like fair pvp...
---
If you don‚Äôt think Mulgore isn‚Äôt the tightest fucking zone to start out in you can get the hell out of my sight.
---
You can say it's all instances/raids, until you want to farm Black Lotuses for flasks and keep getting fucked on 3v1 as your frustrated self runs back and forth between herb nodes. The world is inextricably linked, and anything you can do IN a PvP battleground or PvE dungeon would be done even better with consumables and other items found in the open world that one faction or another will largely control.
---
I didn't say all zones.
---
Exactly this. I hate to say it but if you want to dps as a shaman, you're "better" off going enhancement...yeah. Even without considering the nature resistant mobs and bosses mana issues are EXTREMELY severe for ele shammys. It's a toss up who has it worse, them or Lazorchickens
---
No. Streaming is not vanilla.
---
Honestly I cannot recommend playing both Priest and Warlock enough. I personally have every intention on making my priest my main and my warlock my alt. That said, they're both night and day in what they can accomplish. As a healing priest, you'll be incredibly reliant on grouping in order complete tasks. As a warlock, you'll be able to farm a slough of gold, reagents, and consumables to funnel your main healing priest. 
---
Per your question, you typically won't be providing much DPS support if you're either Holy or Disc; if a group has a Holy/Disc priest, 99 times out of 100 it's to have them heal. With the exception of Holy Fire, SW:P and Mind Flay, priest damage spells are very mana intensive; most of a healing priest's damage will come from wanding. 
---
There *is* a healing/utility priest spec that dips into shadow for shadow weaving, but that's only for raiding guilds who are not interested in having a shadow priest.
---
The population of those servers make It be nothing like a blizzlike vanilla experience. I played a lot in private servers and the experience was completly different.
---
Hey man I was trying to browse this subreddit with my massive hard on from all the nostalgia and you have to come by and mention sharding? Thanks now I'm all flaccid thanks you you.
---
god damn I love that shield
---
Its almost always due to a faction imbalance. Have fun establishing dominance when you outnumber the other faction 60-40, or you‚Äôre the outnumbered one.
---
While combat isn't as great as the dedicated pvp specs, it's still pretty good, shorter cool down. It has a lot of advantages, like consistent damage. I can confirm the combat daggers build does solid damage, I don't know if it's better, but it's at least competitive, and in the later phases daggers gets a lot of dagger skill items.
---
What is hard to understand?
---
World PvP against equal opponents and bullies ganking lowbies are all part of the PvP server package deal. You can't get one without the other, because the only two options you are given are free-for-all PvP or a PvE server. There's no "limited PvP" server where people ten levels below you can't be attacked, or where you can't be corpse camped.
---
But that doesn't mean people who *like* world PvP against equal opponents have to *like* bullies ganking lowbies, or *like* corpse camping. Any more than people who play PvE servers have to like it when someone lower level on the opposite faction ninjas a herb they had their eye on and they can't nuke them for it. Either way you take a package deal which suits you better overall but that doesn't mean you always like every part of the package deal.
---
I hope we get a fresh batch of content like this. 
---
Yeah this was awful but there's something nostalgic about a video just showing people playing the game rather than listening to a YouTuber apologize about being 30 minutes late on releasing the video, talking about his patreon supporters, and talking about whatever other random ass shit they talk about before getting to the point of the video.
---
I'm planning on tailoring as well so I had a "oh shit what am i missing about SM?" moment that's why I asked ha
---
Better put your guessing in soon as I can confirm right now that we will receive the confirmation of this information this Wednesday at 10AM PST. See you there friends.
---
Thanks. I was not aware of this!
---
I think the person you were responding to was trying to suggest that priests' have no emergency cooldowns, which is 100% true. Anyone who has played a priest + literally any other class, will probably be surprised how few "oh shit" buttons a priest has. But, as you correctly mentioned, priests have the widest variety of tools to address a variety of problems.
---
Yeah, I rolled Alliance on Cho'gall back in vanilla. I should have known to avoid a server with a Horde-y name, but it sounded cool. 
---
It was at least a year old server when I joined Warcraft, and we were outnumbered 7-1 or so. I chose to ride the struggle bus out of sheer determination instead of quitting, and eventually, months later, they offered the first ever server transfers, free of charge for one time only.
---
Guess which side had more people leave? Now we were like 18:1 outnumbered. 
---
Thanks for nothing, Cho'gall Alliance. Haha.
---
Live to win
---
Nice so you were a failure guild leader who wanted to be a casual and not do content for the fact you thought you were gonna get better gear from an expansion.
---
Every guide ive read for shaman says use rockbiter
---
The harder pve content doesn't have fears so I look mainly from a pvp standpoint.  Fear ward is amazing if it can stop a psychic scream but any other fear can just be dispelled.    A 1500 instant heal that scales with +healing and talents is huge.
---
You can make 15g/hr in classic wow?  Thought it was more like 15s/hr.
---
Griefing lowbies in STV isn‚Äôt gonna stop raiding guilds from reaching 60 and farming their mats. 
---
PVP is fun. PVP servers are fun. This ‚Äújustification‚Äù game is idiotic. No one is getting locked out of raiding consumables because they‚Äôre were ganked too much in Redridge.
---
Where does it say they‚Äôre revealing a release date tomorrow?
---
People make macros with strategies for random bg groups. Even when 20 people fuck off, the rest usually listen and leads to quick games.
---
Well now I feel like I‚Äôm addicted to drugs after reading those symptoms
---
At low levels, yes. Mostly since it's literally all you have. Flametongue is better, and Windfury is much better.
---
Dried cow shit does.
---
The more I hear about BFA the happier I am I did't blow the money on another expansion.  I stopped shortly into Pandaria, just not the same WoW.  Classic, BC, and Wotlk all good memories, not much after that.
---
So you are saying we are going to get some news this week. Or we are going to get no news this week.
---
I agree with you. But I'm downvoting.
---
It's amazing how many people complain about fights being "unfair" on pservers currently. The other day a 34 hunter was camping the bridge near rebel camp. I ride up and swot him with a 45 Pally. Get pm'd about the fight being unfair.
---
There's nothing fair about WPVP, if you want fair fights go duel outside IF.
---
If you want consensual PVP, play a PVE server and flag yourself when you want to fight.
---
The amount of posts/complains already about potential ganking on PVP servers is just ludicrous. I thought initially my concept was just skewed a little as an EVE player, so I'm glad OP made this post to tell people to HTFU.
---
Every guide says use rockbiter its better than wf
---
Man... it was almost a high in itself to stay up so late the sun would start rising, the fresh morning air comes in and I'm just completely immersed in a beautiful world looking out onto verdant fields in a solemn moment of inner peace.
---
The release date would come faster if you had a hobby. Just saying.
---
&gt;Tracking spells, they're not really all that helpful 99% of the time. You can get Track Humanoids for PvP purposes, but the others are fairly useless
---
I might add Track Hidden on PvP servers.  Might help reveal a rogue or druid before they can gank you.
---
Love all of these, incredible.
---
No. It would be a zerg fest. You are seriously over estimating how hard the npcs were and how much just knowing you can rush gets you. You don't have to take out a single tower to zerg down the boss.
---
You are acting like the strategy is hard. Zerg base is a much easier strategy than the original of collecting various things etc. That is a reason why avs went so long. Not because they were hard but because people were dumb and trying to coordinate and actual strategy was cancer.
---
You sound like yet another person on this sub reddit who didn't actually play in Vanilla or at least to any extent that mattered.
---
It's harder to decide what to play since not only are classes somewhat pigeon holed (holy pally or gtfo apparently), but the time commitment to level up. I'm not looking to reroll. Whatever I start with is what I'm playing. That said, I can't make up my damn mind on what to actually play. Just when I think I have it figured out, something puts doubt in my mind.
---
Link. Show me these "every guides" that apparently say rockbiter is better than windfury (lol??)
---
Lol "people here don't care about retail" the whole reason I started posting in this thread is someone was comparing retail to vanilla. Fuck outta here, you doofus.
---
beast mastery - beastial wrath becomes available 5 points before it should
---
Ayy 27 gang where you at
---
You're not old. You're just a higher level character in real life.
---
Try being a Tool fan at the same time.
---
You are not prepared!
---
Go jerk off or do something productive if it's getting on your nerves so much.
---
I know for a fact we are getting a pretty big announcement this week I don‚Äôt know what it will be though.
---
We are going to get a big announcement this week I feel.
---
PvE servers are that way -----&gt;
---
I thought the Riverpaw Gnolls dropped armbands for https://classicdb.ch/?quest=11
---
sounds great, thank you for this contribution :)
---
lol as unfun as that must of been for the alliance it was probably 100x more unfun for the horde especially pre-battlegroup bg's. I always play on a pvp server, but I also try not to drive off the pvp community by making their play time horrible.  
---
Nothing worse than having no one to fight at all because they all jumped ship.
---
i mean, it's very much that still when you raid mythic IMO... But since it's the same content but harder, it doesn't feel as valuable. Plus you get so much gear in a single raid clear.
---
You will find alliance tanks who do way more threat who can't properly tank swap on a fear because fear ward is so good
---
That's how strong it is lol
---
And when you spam it on a fight like Ony or Magmadar over time you're going to GREATLY reduce your time spent in those instances.
---
Fear ward is amazing
---
He means geared guilds will clear raids for randoms for a price.
---
The last Tool album released roughly a month after I started playing WoW...
---
Then it's a good thing that I never claimed that it would "stop" them. I said, in every step of my reasoning, that it would "slow" them, which is true. A person on a PvP server will eventually get their consumables and get into end-game content, but they'll do so some amount of time \*after\* the PvE crowd has already beaten them to it.  
---
Yes, even repeatedly killing someone in Redridge is going to stop them from getting a raid consumable by X# of corpse runs multiplied by X# of minutes per corpse run, even if that is a matter of minutes to hours. Delay is delay.
---
Played priest through all of vanilla (ally side), extensive raiding, then got Glad s1 in 2v2 and 3v3 of BC.  Quit wow soon after that because college.  Love priest, can't wait to be back.  
---
Dwarf is best (stoneform is insanely OP, Fear Ward too), but Nelf is most fun (drink/meld, meld/MC - &gt; throw them off of a ledge, flips while jumping).
---
you aren't saying dishonourable kills will be in the game are you?
---
Seriously, I knew I wanted to play classic, but it hit me hard last week. I need it NOW. I just finished a semester for christ' sake.
---
Now, I just need to figure out if i level a warrior or a druid. I'll tank 5mans with both, will mostly just level, but probably won't raid anyway. I always loved feral leveling, and stealth might be handy when my baby calls me.
---
Also feels like warrior is some kind of god class in classic: top dps, pretty much the only real tank, when i look at private servers there are so many warriors...
---
I don‚Äôt believe I complained about PvP at all. I love my fair share of griefing lowbies in STV. 
---
I just think this try-hard ‚Äújustification‚Äù of it is ridiculous. 
---
It‚Äôs fun. That‚Äôs all that needs to be said.
---
I choose to believe what i want to believe
---
My first glimpse of created content is kind of shit friend.
---
Exactly
---
I'm not sure what retail server you played on, but I played exclusively on PvP servers from Vanilla through Wrath, and still played mainly PvP (or RP-PvP) servers in Cata and MoP. I can definitely say that WPvP did not die when "fair PvP" (instanced BGs and Arenas) launched.
---
I can't tell you how many times I was witness to raids on the Crossroads that would last for quite a while. 
---
I also remember near weekly raids on Orgrimmar where the Alliance would just take over the Auction House and bank in the Valley of Strength for as long as they could possibly hold them.
---
And let's not forget the glory days of the REAL Tarren Mill vs Southshore battles out in the open world.
---
While the TM vs SS battles eventually DID die down, there were still a great many instances of "unfair" WPvP (as you imply it to be) that took place in the open world after the introduction of instanced BGs and Arenas.
---
The fact still remains, the whole point of a PvP server is for people who want the thrill and dagger of knowing that they could be engaged in PvP at any moment, whether with someone if equal level, or someone of a much higher level. Whether that WPvP encounter is a one-on-one battle, or you are the target/victim of a roving gank squad. Because the fact is, there is a war going on between the Horde and Alliance. You are aware of what type of server you are choosing to play on when you select your server, and you are given all of the information to make that choice from the very beginning before you even create your first character on that server.
---
Complaining about WPvP of any type when you made the choice of your own free will to roll on a PvP server just becomes entitled whining. And you'll probably never convince supporters of PvP servers that you are right, because they looked at what a PvP server was, and they made an informed decision to play on that server, just as they expect you should have done but obviously chose NOT to do.  Honestly, at this point, complaining about PvP happening on a server specifically dedicated to PvP is kind of like moving to Italy and then complaining because nobody speaks Korean.
---
Why don't more people chill at TB instead of Org
---
Played back in the day, factions were pretty balanced, neither side had domination. It was just whoever brought the most friends at the time/had the best wpvpers.
---
Uhhgg, this was such a shitty thing about the old Undead Female model :(
---
I'm glad they fixed it in the WoD model, I just wish they'd go back and fix that on the old model. I'm refusing to recreate my old Undead Female rogue in Classic for this reason.
---
Never blamed anyone. Imo it was an assholish thing to do. If you don't like that, tough squat.
---
Except that you're forgetting that most players picked servers before the pvp system even existed so your entire premise that people are whining about something they picked is wrong.
---
garrote for rogue. Sinister strike does more damage. 
---
Deadly poison &amp; wound poison can be skipped. Instant &amp; crip is all you need.
---
storytelling is better? Lmao what an insult to Warcraft 1-3.
---
3/5 Shadow Focus is sufficient for dungeons and PvP. This is assuming the enemy has minimal to no shadow resistance gear or buffs.
---
5/5 is if you're raiding as shadow.
---
For your own sake I hope your future content is higher quality than this post.
---
lol you're out of your mind.
---
"I'm pretty sure these guys who have been downloading the game through obscure third parties, and playing a different version of the game on each server, are definitely going to quit when it's different a bit YET AGAIN.
---
I‚Äôd rather not have the community split
---
Miss the game stop line outside on release nights. Great convos and excitement
---
I would recommend just speccing into a relatively standard PVE combat spec, the bread and butter of Rogue is always going to be controlling people with Cheap Shot, Kidney Shot, Gouge, Crippling Poison, Blind, etc. So, you won't lose much of your PVP potential by staying PVE combat spec and your guild will be much happier with you. Or you can always just farm and respec back and forth.
---
Except that PvP servers have been a thing and have been flagged as such since the launch of WoW. So no, my entire premise isn't wrong. They freely chose a PvP server knowing it was a PvP server. Then decided to whine because they cost a PvP server
---
Every step of your reasoning is cringy man, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to tell you. 
---
Exactly zero guilds are going to be stopped or delayed or stressed about getting their materials and consumables because they got ganked a few times while they were leveling. 
---
Sure, maybe some determined to get world first guild will be mildly upset they weren‚Äôt the first cause they were griefed while leveling might care, but 100% those guilds will roll on PVE servers.
---
Is your mom hot?
---
and if you're a person with a normal working schedule you'll have plenty of time to fuck around. you weren't getting server first mc anyways, might as well play the auction house while levelling. T1 content will be around for months before next release, you have time as long as you're not trying to get rag on farm or something.
---
Definitely a possibility, but the chances of users knowing item ids are pretty slim so it was never really considered. I‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs simple enough to add in.
---
hey warrior here , joining the thread for informations, was thinking of getting skin/leatherworking just to get the early 6 slots bags since I have 0 intention of using a single copper on the AH, then switch later   
---
But as a warrior that will most likely going to tank at 60 I have no idea what could be great.   
---
I started at BC and liked engenering because of a rocket I could use to pull packs. I think it was a riffle with active I dont remember verry well.  
---
Is there anything interesting for tank warrrior in engenering ? Or else any other proffesion you would recommand ?
---
Whatever justification you need for ganking lowbies, dude.
---
Dispel Magic. 
---
Heals.
---
Mind Control.
---
It will be possible, even if you get hit the exact same number of times.  This is a mechanic, you hamstring the mob, strafe away while waiting for your auto-attack to reset and move back in for another hit and then strafe away again.  Even if you get hit 100% of the time while doing this, it will still be possible to perform.  It's walking while using an ability, all melee can do that.
---
Like a female dwarf from the depths of BRD
---
Garrote is good against high-armor mobs (beasts), does more damage per energy than SS.
---
Dishonourable kills have already been confirmed by Blizzard with the implementation of the PvP rank system
---
Also, just in case you choose to disbelieve me about when PvP servers were created, here's a link for you.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Timeline_of_the_creation_of_US_realms
---
Imagine thinking that sharding on two or three zones for the first week will ruin classic release.
---
&gt; Please tell me how WoW is in any way comparable to dark souls?
---
It's an example of a game that put everyone on the same level, and you get out if it what you put in. It wasn't difficult, it was fair. You can put in some effort and beat the challenges, or you can not play it. They weren't afraid to let players miss content because they were lazy. 
---
&gt;  Nothing is being handed away, you still have to try in LFR and if people are clueless, you will wipe several times. You ever had to set foot in LFR kill jaeden? My guess is no.
---
This is hilarious to me. No one is trying in LFR, that's why you wipe on KJ. It's the first boss where an actual mechanic happens where you can't afk. But, hey, apparently 5 wipes is considered a challenge to you, so maybe LFR is your Dark Souls lol. 
---
&gt; Oh and btw, lfr is as hard as vanilla raids.
---
Oh totally, because those LFR groups took [159 days to kill the final boss when it first released.](https://www.method.gg/raid-history) Oh yeah, I mean, only [59 guilds](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8kcgtt/the_real_list_of_59_useu_guilds_that_cleared_naxx/) in the world were ever able to kill Kel'Thuzad pre TBC, but because Naxx had fewer mechanics it was *totally* easier. I mean, the quickest kill of a final boss was at 69 days with Onyxia, but since you had to wipe a couple times on KJ LFR then you're right, LFR is for sure just as hard.
---
Yes a thing called a pvp server existed. The entire lived experience of what it meant and what incentives existed in the game were all filled in later...but keep assuming that everyone who disagrees with you is a whiner lol.
---
Played pvp servers exclusively through bc and wotlk (no vanilla) but factions were always fairly balanced in my experience.
---
You just don't know what you're doing
---
Exposed armor is amazing.....as is the bleed.....
---
Dude. Nice.
---
At this point you are choosing to be obtuse simply because you refuse to admit you could be wrong. So continue existing in your stubborn refusal to embrace facts. I believe that I am done debating with you at this point, as it'd be far more productive to just throw myself against a wall repeatedly and experience blunt force trauma then keep trying to debate with someone that can't be bothered to admit when they might be wrong.
---
Friends and Fam beta.
---
Agreed.
---
OG Vanilla had 100,000 people at PEAK launch day.
---
Classic will easily have 10x that. Loads of people thinking 2-3 million isn't unfeasable.
---
So what is it? 900-2000 servers to replicate the original vanilla experiecnce, then 1500 servers with 8 people on them?
---
Or artificially inflate the same ~90 servers' pop with sharding so they eventually even out to OG pop?
---
Back in vanilla i played on pvp server. right on some days you cant win or rich your target.
---
but the extra kick and adrenaline on pvp server is worth it. always combat ready. 
---
i will play on pvp server again in classic.
---
nobody wants your shitty stream
---
Yikes
---
They drop ichor for a quest there and are assigned to be killed.
---
Pretty much lol. I like everything about PvP servers except for the 60's being involved in lower level zones. I dislike it so much, that I just roll on PvE servers despite how much I like PvP servers once you have all main and alts to level 60.
---
Bop shouldn't remove psychic scream in classic.  And I agree dwarf is master priest, just for different reasons.  End of the day play what you want nelfs are best tank until thunderfury but you don't see anyone making a deal about it.
---
I played on a PVP server for all of vanilla that was dominated in battlegrounds and world PvP by horde and most contested areas had more horde almost always.  Not only was my guild never hindered by this but 4 of the 5 top pve guilds on our server were alliance.
---
This dude is trying to justify levels 60's camping redridge because it helps his faction in some twisted way.  It doesn't.  That's the kind of "PvP" people complains about.
---
Anyone complaining about getting killed a couple times by a dude a few levels higher than you in a questing area doesn't have a leg to stand on. 
---
Hell, even getting ganked by someone level 60 1-3 times is whatever but tbh I almost never see complaints like that.  The only complaints I see are about level 60's camping really low level zones for like 8-12 hours a day (which does happen on private servers.  Hell, some people take shifts and lock down a zone for days at a time.).
---
Just be honest, if you want to join a PvP server to "PvP" vs players that are 30 levels lower than you for 8 hours a day then you aren't doing it to "help your faction" you are doing it to make people mad.  Stop trying to tell me that doesn't make you a dick and that's what PvP servers are supposed to be for.
---
woo this summer I get to be the exact mean
---
I'd like to see a "content without progress" system where they add things to do but no character power progression for rewards (ie.g., cosmetics like titles and mounts or gear with the same stats as naxx). This could be dungeons and raids, epic quests, dynamic open world events, maybe even "procedurally generated" instances... I'd avoid new zones (don't spread too thin) and definitely never add more levels.
---
In other words, innovate on things to do but with the vanilla design philosophy... And without making great repeatedly obsolete.
---
&gt; Exposed armor is amazing
---
It really isn't.
---
By the time you even get 3 or 4 combo points, the mob is almost dead anyway.
---
I reject your reality and substitute my own!
---
Here you go

You wanna be a dickhead and gank people. And that‚Äôs totally OKAY. I like to be a dickhead and gank people myself. 
---
You don‚Äôt need to church it up.

Nah, but we messing up Redridge on Day 3, don't come questing bro, you been warned.

One guide =/= "every guide"
---
Also, that doesn't say "rockbiter is better than windfury", it says it's better for super-slow weapons when used with earthbind kiting.
---
Well I should say after Blizzcon 2018. Before then I thought it could still be several years.
---
2H fury is pretty dope for leveling. Piercing howl+cleave can be amazing for pulls that you simply have to multi-pull. Piercing howl in general can save yer ass when you ass-pull or over pull in general, which is a huge deal on warrior while leveling. Blood craze lowers your downtime quite a bit between pulls out in the world, and prevents crits from really being a factor while leveling.
---
If /sitting to trigger enrage is a thing...then 2h fury is even more viable, but its honestly not necessary. Arms starts really kickin ass around 40 when you have both sweeping strikes and mortal strike.
---
You didn't even watch the video. You literally responded instantly lol. Its literally the most popular Shaman leveling guide with tons of data to support its claim.
---
grab skining/mining for leveling.
---
vendor your skins and bank your ore.
---
At 60, farm your devilsaur, then drop skinning.
---
Pickup engi and use your banked ore for skill ups.
---
2h with Rockbiter is the optimal leveling setup
---
Only warlock fears are magic
---
The others are phsyical
---
Blessing of protection removes just about all physical effects
---
And again bro you have no idea what you're talking about lol
---
In your opinion. I feel like they did a good job of allowing people to choose the depth and difficulty with which they play the game. For example, Mythic raiders this expansion had to leverage pretty much every profession extensively, however LFR players probably didn‚Äôt even need to learn one.
---
OK sorry I am too obtuse to understand your sophisticated thesis of 'anyone who complains about pvp on a pvp server is a whiner' - I'm sure it's my lack of mental faculty that's the problem here.
---
I like tbc more. I like how more specs are viable, better balance
---
Windfury is obviously world's better but some people just hate the RNG factor.  I personally like rockbiter weapon for levelling.
---
Those imps at the entrance to burning steppes/redridge
---
Mortal strike and sweeping strikes is just really good while leveling though, 40+. If you get help and get your whirlwind weapon at 35-40, then all the better. Plus if you pick the axe you can go 2h crit talent, axe crit talent, and fury crit talent (by 45), giving you +15% crit from talents, which is insane. 
---
Fury is nice but there really aren't good 1h out there while leveling that you can reliably get, and for little money.
---
Hi, /u/Gorf__
---
"Exactly zero guilds are going to be...delayed...because they got ganked."  
---
Factually, mathematically incorrect, for reasons I've already stated, and so it's the last time I'll address that particular point.
---
It's for stoneform.  You watch too many streams and read too much Reddit, you need to go play.  I have played on most and on raided both factions.  I killed cthun on retail classic as well.  Keep it up with that shitty try hard tude and blame everyone else when you keep wiping in classic.

I never said dual wielding is better than 2h, just that it "isn't bad".
---
Also there's plenty of blue 1h weapons you can get from dungeons and dungeon quests.
---
You‚Äôve spent only 4 days? How did you do quests ? I got 120 shaman and spent about 2 weeks to finish quests in Zuldazar and almost quests in Kultiras. I played in Wtlk and Cata, as for me BFA has the same lvl as Wtlk. Do all quests , don‚Äôt push and my suggestion go to heroic or myth raids, it‚Äôs big difference:)
---
Played through about 1/2 naxx in vanilla as holy and shadow PvP and 5-10 mans on the weekend. 
---
Besides raids the only struggle I had was with warriors with pocket heals (that's everyone), WSG sucked without engineering, and druids always outlasted you.  If you gear and spec correctly you are just fine for ab/av and 5-10 mans.  
---
In early PvP you have to drink a lot and should roam with friends so you can multidot and burst people when heals get low.
---
In early Pve you can drop shadow form for shackle undead or emergency heal in dungeons, I remember doing this in scholo and strat a lot. 
---
In later patches you are pretty weak as shadow for both without insane gear and need to rely on your party more and more.

Hola, I'm Mab.
---
I've  been playing WoW on and off since the Summer of '05. It's been a hugely  important facet of my life every step of the way and would really like  to focus exclusively on Classic when it re-arrives to get a dose of that  good ol' community I was so fond of back then. I've been a warrior  since day 1 of my career and MT'd everything up to and including some  Naxx as well as most of TBC. I've furied for at least 75% of my total  career so I'm versed in DPS. I've also resto shamaned for two WHOLE LFRs  in MoP and cat durided in the latter half of Legion (4 fite!). I  achieved 30/36 Legion Mage Tower appearances and some of those fights  can be really difficult at recommended ilvl (read: Kruul) so I can learn  anything well enough to be effective. I plan to hit Classic pretty hard  and stay at it consistently until I finish unsettled business in Naxx  but that's not to say I'm not comfortable teaching or bringing along  less-experienced folks - as such, I'm primarily looking for a medium-ish  guild (not casual but not hardcore (I'd like to get it done after  all)).
---
**Intended Region:** NA or EU (makes no difference to me but English is my only language)
---
**Intended Server Type:** Normal/PVE (hard NO to PVP)
---
**Intended Faction:** Prefer \[A\] but \[H\] is fine - I just want to find a fitting community
---
**Intended raid/play times:** 6PM - 12 PM any night(s) except Friday (GMT-4 (Eastern U.S.))
---
**Priorities:** Raiding; PVP; strong community; tall order but I'd like to MT (Warr) unless \[H\] in which case I might Sham instead of Warr

**Rules:** Don't message me unless Classic will be the primary focus of the leadership of your guild

Can someone explain why a hunter would get a gathering profession?
---
If the hunter's best gold per hour is farming, a gathering profession would be a waste of time and money. Farming gold efficiently and buying the mats would take less time than farming the mats yourself.
---
Am I missing something? Would wouldnt a hunter go engineering and alch or something?
---
There's certainly some in Azshara, being an unfinished zone by the time of classic.
---
Yes... of course I‚Äôll drop activity once we get a release date.. yes, of course I will.
---
It's actually referred to as abandonware.  Some of us would gladly have been paying a subscription, but it simply was not an option.
---
You will have tons of opportunities for bg que... those won't be out for a long time
---
Playing Warlock right now on \[redacted\] and I got my first wand. It's like night and day, I swear. I have so much mana now.
---
Paladin:
---
Seal of Comman Rank 1 is free @ 20. Don't train any more than that.
---
Train Seal of Might for more damage, you don't need wisdom with rank 1 command.
---
Keep up Holy light whenever you're in town. If you miss a couple levels its fine.
---
Keep up retribution aura, and get improved ret aura. It's free damage.
---
That's it. One or two skills every 6-8 levels and you're good.
---
It was sarcasm
---
It made me sad to find out the video was actually a re-make of an "event". Albeit It sounded a little staged to begin with, but I still had a sliver of hope it was real lol
---
I agree mate ganking and getting ganked is one of the best parts of wow
---
I don't care to camp Redridge, because camping a lowbie zone when you could be progressing toward end-game or helping others toward end-game is not an efficient way to win the server. Campers aren't gaining exp/gear.  I think that swatting people you come across \*organically\* without going out of your way is probably most efficient. I'd never advocate it as a way to be helpful toward your faction.  
---
BUT, when someone says something goofy like, "People who get camped in Redridge aren't being delayed from reaching the end-game", I can't resist letting them know that what they've said doesn't make any sense, because dying in any capacity delays you reaching end-game, if we're splitting hairs. That is it, that is all.
---
The drop off in players over the first few weeks when they realise classic isn‚Äôt for them is going to be HUGE, probably like 2/3 of the player base. There absolutely has to be some form of sharding in the starting zones.
---
People gotta remember this is effectively a free game for people with retail. A lot of them will try it out and never come back after say level 10. With no sharding it‚Äôs either be 1. Be unplayable for first few weeks or 2. Have 10x the amount of servers needed and they will all be barren wastelands in week 4.
---
Yeah I learned that the hard way too.  My views are based off experience as well.  Stoneform and prayer saved me more times then I can count but I also play with shadow reflector so that might make me more biased.
---
I think the imbalancing happened over time. After years, servers developed reputations for being X-favored and players on the disfavored faction stopped joining. Also allowing server transfers greatly sped up the imbalancing.
---
It never became an issue during vanilla, but I think it will be an issue for classic. Players are already wary of joining unfavorable servers and they will look into that information before they roll and become invested. Data on faction balance will be available and players will make that decision from day 1.
---
All these subreddit posts make me not even want to play wow. Bunch of sissy Mary's
---
Private servers have issues like creators/admins creating rank 14 characters and selling them to the Chinese, or running off with thousands in donations. Or being hit with a shutdown notice by Blizzard. Ping issues with location as a lot of them are hosted in Europe(?).
---
Who wants to risk a private server like that once official servers are out? Lmao.
---
YOU CAN CAST FEARWARD ON 10 PEOPLE CONSTANTLY
---
WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING/ lol
---
That‚Äôs similar to what I had in mind. Add new dungeons, raids, world bosses to fight over, and some PvP stuff here and there. But no new levels or talents
---
The community is allready split with Classic and retail.
---
Why not frontload damage instead of making the next 3-4 strikes hit harder?
---
All of his complaints started way before legion. In fact the ilvl watching was started by the community not blizzard a decade ago. You could do normal raids just by looking at a gear score since half way through wotlk.
---
Dead link?
---
Hi, /u/PM_ME_HUGE_CRITS
---
IIRC, a long time ago Blizzard posted stats about PVP &amp; PVE leveling speed, and it was something like 20% faster to level on a PVE server. That is a lot of game time (3-2 days played, probably), but that lvl 60 payoff is totally worth it IMO.  
---
I have so many memories of group skirmishes in STV, feeling nervous leaving Gadgetzan, our BWL raid running into an opposing raid and engaging in a 40 v 40 slaughter-fest in black rock mountain... Moment like that are entirely organic, and more fun than any battleground.  
---
Conversely, when an enemy reveals themselves and decides not to kill you in a vulnerable moment, the adrenaline can be even stronger. Mercy can be equally profound.
---
If you're tanking at all, go to Booty Bay and visit Zarena Cromwind for [Staff of Protection](http://classicdb.ch/?item=12252).
---
It's just good formatting it is.
---
With my weebcon coming up and a move in summer I've burned through all my days anyways.
---
Okay. 
---
So rather than trying to defend this cringy try hard manifesto. 
---
Just explain to me what ‚Äúwinning‚Äù looks like. It‚Äôs a few months down the line. The hardcore raiders have mostly geared out and waiting for the next phase to drop. There you are, waist deep in level 35 corpses on the way to booty bay....  
---
Am I close? Is the futility of theoretically ‚Äúdelaying‚Äù some upstart guild what ‚Äúwinning‚Äù on a server is?
---
Y'all taking the sharded starting zones too seriously lol
---
LFG wasn't that bad and so wasn't TBC. Some additions in TBC were bad, like flying mounts and summoning stones, but a lot of them were good like arena and the not-so-brainless raids.
---
also available as a red version with cool animations for 25$ in the cash shop
---
The thing that bugs me most about TBC was the horrible storylines. Like major plots just never finished. Personally, I would want arenas eventually added to classic and LFG only for PvP content. On live servers at the start of BFA, it was so rewarding to progress with a guild on my server in raids
---
At least your not a closet BFA player
---
#nochanges
---
I'm currently raiding AQ on a Warrior, and leveling another Warrior.
---
You are just one of those people who will take whatever shit Blizzard shovels their way and just eat up and defend it every nook and cranny of the internet.
---
I don't understand why you are here having to defend retail in this sub? 
---
No one gives two shits about your experiences in retail. 
---
Your jack ass comments and white knighting isn't going to convince anyone here that retail is worth playing. So GTFO you retail pleb!
---
I woke up at 6 AM with a group of friends to get in line at Best Buy for that.  
---
Amazing experience.
---
Wholesome
---
Goodnight cow jumping over the moon
---
Gather them all up so we can all sort through and hopefully find some secret hidden message about the release date that hasn't been caught yet. Bet that will be the MO
---
On a personal level. Cyan is my favorite color and you have an amazing screen name
---
Glorious.
---
MC and BWL probably. From my vanilla and pserver experience, I've only ever seen 1 feral druid progress to AQ 40/Naxx and he was a powershifting god. Still only did about 1/2 the dps of fury warriors and frost mages, however watching those puffs of magic when he shifted every .1 secs (exaggeration) gave the raid something awesome to watch.
---
You'll mainly be a decurse/innervate legend if you progress that far.
---
Gnomes... j/k I guess they are ok
---
One way to improve your rage is to allow an auto attack early without using another attack.
---
Could you elaborate on how rogue plays to beat those classes?
---
You seem to think you know a lot more than you do.
---

---
&gt;Rupture is kinda garbage while leveling
---
No its not.
---
That would be some national treasure shit haha. But I want this because I don‚Äôt have a lot time to constantly check for blue posts (or go back for them) so it‚Äôd make it easier to make my ‚Äúplan‚Äù for classic. Also, if any new people come to this sub it will be right there so we don‚Äôt have  any reposts.
---
This

A dungeon journal type addon could be nice, especially if there was some easy way to keep track of which dungeons has the most items you need (kind of a ‚Äúwish list‚Äù), like dungeon A has 3 items you want, dungeon B has 2, and so on
---
Maybe in the dungeon journal, you click on the items you want added to the ‚Äúwish list‚Äù, with option to make different specs in the ‚Äúwish list‚Äù
---
I don't care about the lore too much. And don't know much of BfA, but isn't it too rewarding? And with that I mean that it is (to?) easy to obtain new and/or better gear? They lost me somewhere on the road, in early MoP.
---
Dude these are fucking sweet! Mad props
---
I'm 99% sure I'll be playing a feral druid at this point. But I'm not planning on raiding so optimal raid specs are not factoring into my decision.
---
&gt;I feel like they did a good job of allowing people to choose the depth and difficulty with which they play the game.
---
So you think the entry level content being an utter face roll is good for the game? Or the fact that LFR is probably the worst representation of MMO raiding ever conceived.  The sad fact is the bulk of the player base never even tries to run  end game content on a difficulty that would be fitting for an experienced gamer.
---
I'm fine with catering to casual players, but not on this level.  Trying to cater to people who really don't like socializing and most of the aspects of a MMO = boring game.
---
Our twins are scheduled to be born end of September. So Classic Wow release date will be end of September.
---
Classic wow has been in the statue of Lincoln all this time!
---
I see your reality and raise you my own.
---
It's definitely a preference. Similarly for rogues, while leveling some people will pop a slice n dice at the beginning of the fight, and others stack the cp's for evisc immediately. In most scenarios the timing is damn near identical, so it's a preference.   
---
Also, just because the crowd says one way is best, doesn't make it so. I'm not considering rockbiter vs WF because obviously at some point down the line WF is superior. But as far as talent trees, don't be afraid to make your own unique build. This game is designed to make a unique character, not be one of the hundreds using the same cookie cutter.
---
Z U G Z U G
---
Reversed as in the opposite of what this guy was saying... I even listed the prices
---
The trick with warrior is patience. Let those white hits get you some rage. Always make sure you have enough rage for MS.
---
Track hidden is really mandatory for a PvP server. Also one of those mortal kombat addons until you get sick of it after a day or two.
---
If we're talking modern times, LFR is just as hard :). You're not going into a vanilla raid without youtube and easy to google answers.
---
Again, 1 guide =/= "every guide"
---
Also, killing 20 mobs is a pretty small sample size. Even so, the difference between rockbiter and windfury is pretty small; to claim that one is definitively better than the other is kinda wrong.
---
I gotcha but I was saying a bunch of us will be hunting down national treasure shit lol
---
Well yeah of course, by 'possible' I mean the damage reduction aspect which is the entire reason for doing it at all.
---
\`I really just can't with a lot of people in this sub\`
---
I know. I hope to God they don't go the OSRS route because it's obvious that even the people on this sub who are excited for classic would vote for the exact same shit that ruined retail WoW all over again.
---
You edited your comment lol
---
You posted immediately, as in under a minute saying the video must be wrong.
---
Everything after "ALSO" is the edit of your post. Either way you're wrong.
---
The submissions on this sub reach better qualities every day
---
This is fantastic OP.
---
Someone send this to Classic devs!!!!
---
Except thats what you're doing by telling people to skip Rockbiter (the faster leveling weapon buff) and instead buy Windfury lol
---
If you level alone there are a few quests that have mobs with really high armor. It is niche to use it, but 90% of mobs it really isn't worth it.   
---
If you do use it, I recommend opening with cheap shot, throw down expose armor, then do your rotation. But like I said, rare circumstances and always solo play.
---
For the alliance!
---
As I said to the other fellow, "camping" is not an efficient way to serve one's faction, only killing people one organically passes would be. 
---
If I'm outside Booty Bay as a level 55 waiting to kill questing level 36s who emerge from the gates, I'm gaining next to no EXP per hour, I'm not farming raid pre-BiS, and I'm not setting myself up for end-game success. 
---
The golden ratio of this sort of thing would be how to inconvenience the other faction the most while causing the least inconvenience to myself with regard to EXP/gear, which I'd argue is just swatting any red-name you happen to come across as you naturally go about your business.
---
As I describe "winning" as a vague tug of war, one faction may be in the lead (with their level 60s outnumbering and out-gearing the other factions), but this power balance can tilt the other way at any time and for any number of reasons. 
---
I joined Warcraft a year into vanilla, chose Cho'gall server as Alliance, and was on average outnumbered a dozen to one. It was hellish to accomplish anything. Anyone who didn't feel like Horde owned Cho'gall wouldn't be speaking sense. It was morale breaking for many, who fled in waves during the first free server transfer.
---
Again, I do not believe that smacking around red-names is going to outright stop people from crawling their way up to the top and eventually getting their hands on epic loot which will one day find its way in your back, but a bump in the road is a bump in the road.
---
higher ranked Command is still good for the judgement damage in a pinch. (pvp, catching fleeing mob, etc)
---
Wisdom is used for when you're healing.
---
Feel free to use your fingers and google some other guides
---
Shitty ripoff repost: https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbpmxk/it_cant_possibly_be_it_for_the_week_right/
---
Yes it is.
---
YouTube didn't exist until 4 months after release.
---
It wasn't a real thing until near the end of vanilla.
---
High-armor mobs you should be using Garrote, not expose armor.
---
Well, I would pick my faction based on whom I was going to play with. But yes, Orc is certainly the best for horde, and probably the best overall. I was alliance though and I loved world PVP so I enjoyed playing a Night Elf because Shadowmeld = best for world PVP on alliance. For dueling on alliance, Dwarf is best.  
---
Picking horde to avoid warlocks is pretty smart though, lmao. And while resisting blackout will certainly help I still think a good spriest will be favored.
---
Lok'tar ogar!
---
https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof
---
It makes absolute sense to do this, but I'm not sure Blizzard wants that. For instance, I don't think we're ever going to know exactly how many people play WoW Classic. If Blizzard gives census data again its just going to be active WoW subscriptions to provide an illusion that BfA is doing well.
---
Not sure if Blizzard has enough clout over at Twitch to stop them anyway, but yeah it makes sense to have a WoW Classic category
---
Yeah the tap and hold isn‚Äôt working for me on safari and iPhone
---
Oh... oh. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking of FFXI or something.
---
I hope so
---
I agree, if you can get in with a guild early on and declare your interest in being a crafter, you can definitely find yourself a spot.
---
Alternatively, level with skinning and mining. Bank all you gather on bank alts and level both engineering and LW. With your recipe crafts from LW you can fund your engineering needs.
---
Then I proceed to call some of my guildmates over to help protect me. Then you proceed to call some of your friends over to fight my friends. I log into my main and come over. Then more and more show up, pretty soon you have a huge battle going on with guilds from all across the realm. Then we have a battle that will last a couple of hours. Those were the most fun memories in WoW.
---
I can't wait to relive those memories again.
---
Yeah actually I am an UX designer so one day my boss and I was sitting and he told that he will give blue colour to a part of the product and I countered him as Dark BG does not pronounce blue that much but cyan can and he was like both are same lol.
---
From that day I took the name to tell people Cyan ain't blue even though they are from same family and side on the colour wheel.
---
And that kind of thing does usually involve making friends with multiple people and a lot of socialization, something which you know, some people skills have probably gotten Rusty in
---
Not on ft. Meade :)
---
Get outa here you 3 letter man.
---
I see your point, but naw. I don't roll that way. Garrote is for enemy rogues and enemy rogues alone.
---
With 1 or 100% HP, red is dead. And I hope ppl do the same to me
---
Lucky those people have a guise as an MMO character. I believe in you. :)
---
I see it now. You want to work out your demons from being locked in to an imbalanced server. 
---
Faction imbalance on a pvp server sucks, but that‚Äôs something entirely different than what you‚Äôre trying to pass off here and in my opinion not something that pvp‚Äôers should be advocating for. Unless you really are just wanting to be a dick on the overpopulated faction griefing lowbies in STV. 
---
Which again, is totally cool. Just doesn‚Äôt require all this justification.
---
Gear is super easy to get in the retail game, but the high end content is extremely difficult to progress in. I‚Äôd prefer a balance between the 2
---
PvP is fun. It's part of the game. It's intended gampelay, it's fostered by Blizzard who even implemented a system and framework to further facilitate and encourage it. There is no need to rationalize or justify it beyond "a lot of us just find it fun." The competition, the added risk, the threat of danger, at the end of the day it's all just *fun*.
---
I noticed on the official forums most people who whined about "unfair PvP" didn't even play on PvP realms. Some did at one time, but transferred when they realized they hated it. Yet there they were, calling the thousands of people on PvP realms, ganking lowbies, killing questgivers, etc as "sociopaths" because they read some shitty clickbait article that attempts to blanket diagnose all internet trolls as narcissists and sociopaths.
---
That's the kind of logic you're trying to defend PvP, ganking, griefing, etc to. The people who get that not everybody plays the game the same way don't need to be convinced that some people just find PvP fun and even immersive. The people who just don't get it, advocate huge sweeping changes to the entire system on a server type they typically don't even play on? You can't convince them, they aren't interested in what you want, only what they want.
---
As a paladin player who doesn't play war but has played with very very good ones.
---
Mighty rage potions are definitely consumed the most, easily the most often replaced consume mentioned. Always fiending for more gromslbood 
---
I would see LIP/FAP/LAP being used as a healer. Very rare, and as an hpala rare for a warrior to use a fap in my presence unless I ask him to. 
---
Harder to notice the rage potions but the amount of times they're mentioned to me says they're being burned everywhere. Granted I'm pretty sure they spam em in PvE too so it's hard to get a good gauge as a non warrior.
---
I dunno, I found leveling on a private server to be good practice for retail. I get to see what classes I would like to level as, and Vanilla has plenty of zones. I went Horde and leveled through Kalimdor, knowing that I can experience the Eastern Kingdoms next time around. On top of that, the first release of classic will be Beta. I basically see it as that.
---
:)
---
Excellently put by OP
---
Anger management is supposedly also bugged on pservers. As far as I heard it doesn‚Äôt do the rage generation in classic
---
Then the sun starts coming up and you're like "what have I done..."
---
The horde classic pvp armor sets are still my favorite sets in the game. So awesome.
---
Hey look at this.
---
We have differing opinions.
---
Congrats on the twins!
---
A lot of times it's because their friends play there. Instead of telling their friends "welp, I'm not into this PvP thing, I'll be on this other server instead", they complain that they are "forced" to "endure" a server they dislike until they finally transfer out of frustration.
---
With bnet and cross-realm being what it is these days there is absolutely zero excuse for this bullshit now.
---
Kind of like the blue posts
---
Skip Holy Fire as a priest? are you mad? it is the most mana-effective spell for a priest, much more effective than mind flay
---
But was the release date announced yet??
---
All I get from this post is "Look at my epeen, it's so big. I'm the hardest!!!!" -xXxSlayersxXx
---
You come off as trying to prove yourself WAY to much, on a topic that isn't really all that relevant.
---
You'd think they would, and most I think do. But there is a vocal subset of players who roll on PvP servers knowing they can be attacked and killed by other players who then complain about being attacked and killed by other players.
---
Have you read any of my comments? I have plenty of problems with retails and BFA is an awful expansion. Literally the only thing I've defended is the the raid mechanics in retail are way more complex and hard than in vanilla.
---
You just want to circlejerk in here about how everything Blizzard does is bad and vanilla is perfect.
---
//...in my opinion not something that pvp'ers should be advocating..."
---
What is? Is it that I advocate killing any lesser to equal red-name that you happen to cross paths with on your PvP server that you find disdainful? Because, other than my myriad rationalizations for doing so, this, in and of itself, really is the only thing I can recall having outright endorsed.
---
As a priest you should be using SWP+Wand as your main damage source, not Holy Fire.
---
I drove to downtown LA for the TBC release and got my collectors edition. Then was playing and leveling about 2 hours later when I got back home. Still have the box with all the junk inside that I never opened but used the key.
---
Got to rank 8 on my warrior before burning out so I was never able to finish the set. Dunno if I'll try for it again but I always regretted not getting the other pieces.
---
As a priest you shoul open on a mob with Holy Fire, since it benefits from a 5 second rule.
---
Then you put swp+mb and only then wand a mob to death
---
My favorite zone and capital ever!
---
You don't need seal of justice ever in vanilla as paladin. Makes no sense to be judging it, waste of mana. Doesn't prevent enemy player move speed from going over 100% as tool tip sorta implies. Just a hail mary stun proc really. A few scenarios wehre sum1 is running away and you have no cc up so you just try to close gap and pray for bash proc but again so rare and so unlikely to work. Just keep it unbound so you're not tempted to waste teh mana
---
You could probably get away with rank 1 turn undead (if there are multiple ranks)
---
NEVER GET THE CLASS SPECIFIC ELITE MOUNT, MANA MOUNTS ARE TERRIBLE. DON'T DO IT. Probably won't be out until a few months after release and you're 60 but still. Never spend any resources on mana mounts. Only the 60% you get for basically free is worth.
---
Hmmmmm what else is there. I think that's it for paladin. Pretty much everything else is worth buying and will be useful.
---
I love Mulgore. I mean I hate questing there. But I love the zone. It's so beautiful.
---
Need to include fire blast, especially if on pvp server.
---
&gt;opening spell
---
&gt;5 second rule
---
What
---
Also Mind Blast is still a better opener due to shadow talents; less chance to be resisted, shadow weaving, increased shadow damage, etc.
---
Holy Fire becomes useless real fast, no point in training it
---
Say you're in P.E. class, and you've all been told to go outside to play soccer...
---
You see one of your classmates running figure eights from one end of the field to the other. When you ask what they're doing, they say, "I'm using this time to focus on working my cardio!"
---
Even if you cannot stop them, are you or are you not frustrated that they're choosing not to focus on the ball within the context of a game whose win condition involves the use of the ball?
---
Polymorph also for running away from the horde, or resheeping a mob that some butthole tagged while you were casting something at it
---
Okay this made me chuckle.
---
I sooner I don't have to sift through 30 method channels to find a good one the better.
---
I'll be 41 by classic release. According to the graph I'm an outlier.
---
God I remember the day TBC came out vividly. God blessed us with a snow day, and I mean a MAJOR snow day, none of me or my friends parents would drive, so we walked/sledded a round trip of 8 miles to toys r us and back to get it, seriously great memory that this reminded me of.
---
8 miles is 12.87 km
---
It isn't about how long they are, it's about the content that we won't get to experience.
---
Like I said, I tend to buy alot more spells because of wPvP. Fire Blast would be one of them.
---
Back in vanilla it was hunters for me. Just hunter after hunter after hunter. Forever.
---
Or an hour
---
Why would I run away from the horde?  Lok'tar Ogar!
---
The point of a PvP server is to have a dangerous world. To feel the adrenaline of seeing a red named player when you‚Äôre out and about, leveling or otherwise. 
---
And then you kill them, you gank them, you grief them. Whatever man, there‚Äôs no point to any of it. It‚Äôs fun. 
---
I‚Äôm not at all belittling you for wanting to gank and grief people on a PvP server. It‚Äôs all in good fun. I‚Äôm saying that your comedic attempt to justify it as some kind of high strategy and war effort is cringe inducing try-hard BS.
---
Jeez, OP. Do you agree with anyone other than yourself ?
---
Yes. My /pet macro was on point for all druids not in caster form
---
*russian gamers awaiting the release of classic so they can go back to improved vanilla servers after analyzing classic
---
Say that again when you get to STV
---
Technically I have done that. But to a lvl 60 that refused to leave the contested farming area.
---
Try it again
---
Mind blast in not the better opener. You should cast the slowest cast to open to continue your regen for as long as possible while casting, then cast mb, and end with instant which is SWP. To fully benefit from the 5-second rule.
---
All Horde grow up killing lions in the Barrens, killing them in STV is no different.
---
What rank must one get to attain the full matching set?
---
If I'm to be frank: I disagree with half of these and your guide seems incomplete. As a priest main I'd add Mind Vision, Mind Control, Mind Soothe, Prayer of Healing on your list. If lvling as spirit priest I'd skip Mind Blast. Holy Fire and Smite are great for that build but you could skip those if going shadow. I wouldnt get both cure and abolish disease, if any of them. Levitate can be skipped as well. One could argue for Mana Burn. It has some use but you would prolly survive without it. Then there is the racials and this post is getting too long already.
---
10 gets you the whole blue set
---
Nice, ty!
---
My friend is using one to figure out which class hes going to enjoy at 60 in classic, and I'm sure it fills some urge
---
So true and so studdly
---
Aimed shot into multi shot can pretty easily 2 shot clothies with a crit or two.
---
Coyotes in Westfall. The only thing they are for is xp and meat.
---
Thank you! :)
---
If we are going by strait up mana saving/leveling speed while saving gold, and not worrying about dungeon dps or whatever, dont bother getting any rank of Seal of the Crusader, Seal of Command, redemption, Judgement, or Consecration. Just spam max rank Seal of Command and dont judge it.
---
It was patched out before 1.12.....
---
The blue pvp gear is kind of noobish
---
Yea bro P servers don't generally grow past AQ, it's almost always a decline after AQ's release
---
And there people can clear content
---
They will def require you to get things like skull for pvp tho. It's 2019 there is no excuse for not having such a useful item that's so easy to acquire....Same with engineering
---
If you could kill baby Hitler wouldn't you?
---
That part you put in quotes wasn't part of what I said at all.  I said people getting camped repetitively in low level zones are the ones complaining and that's mostly it.  Although I do feel the delay you are talking about is much more insignificant and less impactful than probably you do.  Wow, my /played to 60 was 106 hours instead of 102, guess my guild is going to have to wait until tomorrow to try our first MC run.  Oh no, black lotus is 70g for horde but only 60g for alliance.  Well I guess we can farm Maurdon for another 15 minutes.

I'm not saying PvP is bad.  I like PvP a lot!  But trying to justify PvP "by any means necessary" because it's this big boon to your faction in regards to PvE is I think largely overstating it's relevance and a weak justification for what is regularly called griefing (which you say you don't do and that's fine.  Just this kind of argument usually comes from that crowd.)
---
You talk about "continuing regen" while....opening on a mob?
---
This only makes sense if you're immediately casting on the next mob as soon as your current target dies, which is pretty rare, and won't actually let you regen all that much, maybe 1 extra tick at most, all for a damage spell that is only marginally more mana-efficient...while having 6-10% extra chance to be resisted, doesn't add shadow weaving stacks, and makes you drop shadowform.
---
&gt; you didnt point out anywhere that we were talking about shadow priest. 
---
This entire post is about leveling.
---
Reckoning stacking up infinitely was patched out.
---
Sit-critting was not. Shoo with your ellipses.
---
Sick repost
---
yeah IK but I don't want o waste my time o purple it is too much of a grind. I have other things to do in life than just play one game.
---
You are spouting nonsense. 
---
You don't hamstring kite when you have a quick weapon speed.
---
You hamstring kite when you are running away from a mob for 4 seconds because you have a slow weapon. Even if you get hit twice on the way out the first time, every other time you go in you will only let a mob hit you for a small fraction of their speed while still getting full DPS...

Does anyone know if itll be like this on the classic wow engine? i dont know if other private servers all have the same weather affect level like this?
---
I can't even entertain the idea of retail. I give up a few levels in because it's core philosophy is so different than what it used to be. I'm with you. The only reason I even occasionally log in, is to enjoy the artwork of the world. I enjoy it's design. Otherwise, it feels so massively boring.

**Ghouls Gone Wild** | AUS | PVP | HORDE
---
Hey everyone. Once Classic hits, we will be recruiting under the pretenses of a brand new guild for mature and respectful individuals. We wish to be social and inclusive throughout the whole vanilla experience.
---
The guild organisers are very familiar with all content, so class and mechanical help will be provided if needed.
---
**Intended play times**
---
As we are still a few months away from launch, raid times are not yet finalised. However, we wish to partake in progression for one evening and one day per week. It would look something like this:
---
  **Thursday** - 7.30pm - 11.30pm
---
  **Saturday**  - 9.00am - 1.00pm
---
This is just a mock up of what our times would look like. We all have jobs/lives of which we must balance, so whatever works best for the raid team we will go with.
---
**Priority**
---
We will primarily be a social/leveling guild until we have a base for MC progression. PvP will also be organised either through world content or instanced  BG's. We ultimately want to smash Naxx as our main objective.
---
**Contact**
---
Please feel free to DM me on Reddit. Or alternatively, join our guild discord for further information.

What's funny is that you spell out in your post exactly why some people might have a problem with PvP servers.  Dominance does eventually go to one faction, we've seen that in old wow.  Each PvP server eventually became completely dominated by one faction, to the point where the non-dominant faction pretty much stopped playing, because it's no fun to be repeatedly camped by level 60's in a level 40 zone, or being forced to constantly wait for your quest givers to respawn because some douche is killing all the NPC's in the Barrens.  
---
As your opening crop of 60's level out, and stop playing, new players will have a harder and harder time, meaning they'll reroll on other servers, or on the dominant faction.  Eventually, pvp then dies on these servers.  Fortunately, at 1.12, they do have crossrealm PVP, which hopefully will mean BG's will still work, but don't count on to much world PVP unless your idea of it is ganking noobs in starting zones.
---
pvp servers' rules are way too loose imo, especially with today's internet culture. sad people will abuse every possibility to make people feel as miserable as they are. that's my experience from currently leveling a priest (lv49 now). i've basically only played arena in wotlk and it's the only esport i loved aside from dota, and even though vanilla pvp is 10x simpler mechanically, it's still fun. but the absurdity of a lv 60 being able to attack a lv 20 whenever he wants to, a lv 30 having no chance vs a lv 35 because of miss chance/resists applying to pvp, getting attacked mid-fight, getting corpse ganked 4v1. all these scenarios give you ZERO opportunity to defend or retaliate, you're just a slave for sad people's urge to feel superior/ in control. and i can't, in any way, understand why pvp servers have been so much more popular. i don't know what i'm not seeing that everyone else does, but anyway, i will not even consider rolling pvp on classic servers.
---
Link? I've got no problem printing and binding something on my own if it's well made.

Leveling balance sounds terrible.
---
When I read your post I was hoping you were a Blizzard employee dropping hints. Then I saw your screen name. That would be some crazy double agent stuff if you were though!
---
dont ever say that again ); u never know what monstrosity u may get #nochanges
---
Exactly. There was a post the other day that asked if you help someone if you see them in a 1v1 wpvp "duel" and my jaw just like dropped a little. Like, if you have to ask if you should jump in and kill that fucker you don't belong on a PvP server. People on a PVP server jump in and then after they kill him split the distance on each side of the corpse camp and kill his ass if he dares to revive.
---
Organically killing someone once will delay them 10 mins Max, congratulations. Camping them delays yourself as well with your logic of not getting gear/exp. Controlling a zone implies you never leave it after you finish your task. The PVP will be a hell of alot of fun but unless you decide to coordinate keeping guards at all times or the server population is heavily skewed, dominance doesn't make sense. Would love to see this level of coordination tho

I just recently tried DW arms, too. Sluggishly leveled 1-30 with 2h fury and it sucked. Hamstring kiting and all. I tried DW fury 30-34 and reset talents to DW arms at 34. Fury felt better with sit proc and death wish, but assuming sit proc isn‚Äôt a thing, and generally pre-enrage, DW arms seems better.  Also let‚Äôs you adjust to a 2h pretty easily and is good for tanking dungeons and PvP, thanks to stance dancing. I heard anger management is supposed to not generate rage on classic as it does on private servers, but not sure about that.
---
I think I am an arms convert for leveling. It can be specced versatile regarding weapons (at least until later in the tree), DW doesn‚Äôt require kiting, allows for changing stances in and out of dungeons and those sweet overpower crits. Also it‚Äôs not all waiting around for the next auto hit. The auto attack damage with DW is better than 2h, the miss chance being a big deal is a myth.
---
What I noticed about DW is the huge difference weapon skill makes. Attacking lower levels (2-3 below yours) you have pretty intense amount of white damage and barely any overpower, even level and higher you have a high overpower up time. I think leveling as DW you can benefit a lot from weapon skill racials, but maybe you‚Äôd want to wear a dagger offhand to trigger overpower more reliably? Just guessing here
---
My TRUTH &gt; Your reality
---
I think you lose the overpower proc. When I was trying it was either this or it took to long
---
I replied to this but on the thread and not on this comment... I got bamboozled by reddit notification
---
I got this on my tauren and he looked pretty boss back in the day!

You really don't want to use Slam in PvP, the swing timer reset really kills your rage gain, especially with slow two-handers.

There's a "What we know so far" link in the sidebar that may be what you are looking for. They're limited to 2 stickied posts, which are used for discussions and recent news. There probably won't be a permanent sticky.

Absolutely I‚Äôm here to see if there is the release date. I also have never been involved in any type of community before this and why I may be able to rest easier knowing I have my week off secured when we know the release date I will still check this sub to still get to discuss what the plans are for character progression
---
What makes you think they wont? Twitch used to have a section for every expansion. The only reason they removed them was because of Blizzard getting mad about people streaming pservers.
---
Wtf??

Who would‚Äôve thought to keep one of those unused

I think that spending time figuring out how to strategically scrape the ice off of a surface in order for a stone puck to slide and then stop in a precise spot is personally a waste of time, and yet curling is somehow an Olympic sport.  /shrug  
---
Anything which can be done for fun or not at all by one person can be taken seriously by another, but I knowingly used some very charged language in my O.P. and painted with a broad brush at that, and so ought to have expected some emotional backlash from people. When I include statements such as "PvP may not be for you", and "You may not have what it takes", "May be the weakest link", etc., I'm mostly thinking of people who complain about "unfair PvP" when they get killed by someone higher level, when they get killed while they're eating, or when killed during combat with a MoB. I see dozens of posts bitching about this since I joined this sub-Reddit.   
---
But then people like you come along, and you may not be the exact sort of person I describe above, but you also don't vibe with my meta-interpretation of what I feel are the "laws of the jungle" out there. Yet here I am directing this sort of language vaguely your way with my O.P. It is then human nature to get offended at what must feel like digs at your character.   
---
Lastly, and I hope this can draw our conversation closer to an end, there is a difference between me saying, "Like it or not, X is a fact", and "Like it or not, YOU MUST do X".   
---
Example: Like it or not, a grizzly bear will try to kill you.  
---
I like to think we'd both agree, here. I am stating what I feel is one of those "laws of the jungle".   
---
However, if you do not value your life, and wish to commit suicide, I am not telling you, "Like it or not, you must avoid grizzly bears". If your idea of a glorious death is at the hands of a bear instead of your own bed at home, I can't tell you what you must value, and you're free to approach the nearest bear you can find. I'm just saying that it's dangerous out there, and that there are recognizable patterns to that danger.

Not to be snide here, but if you aren't going for speed, then why are you asking us what to use? Just use whatever the fuck you want to use if min/maxing is irrelevant to you.
---
Don't do drama bullshit. Be friendly with everyone and don't play favorites. I was in a guild where loot was allocated to people's SO's rather than the rest of the raiders. I quit that guild shortly thereafter. Had another guild where the GM traded nudes for loot. Don't be shady, be fair.
---
Err, alright.
---
Sounds like you need an RP-PvP server.
---
You can't see buffs on enemy players.
---
But thanks for the condescending rage. Blocked.
---
Lul, for a month at least. Every hyped game sits at 1 or close to it on release and a little after it if its good (which it will be). But after the hype settles, it'll be below modern. Not because it'll fail, but because it has a niche audience. However, I see so many people talking about it in places I don't expect to see it so I would say the hype is very real and it'll be bigger than I had previously thought. I just don't think it's gonna be as popular as modern.
---
I mean we very much did get better gear from BC, people whined that all their raid gear became irrelevant through questing when it launched.
---
It wasn't just my guild that was affected by people quitting, it was plenty of others too. Like someone else in this thread said, some guilds started on Naxx but couldn't get far because people didn't see the point when a new lvl cap was around the corner and they went on hiatus. Convincing people to raid for only 4 months and prepare for 1 month of pre-patch with the promise that their gear would mean nothing once the expansion dropped isn't easy. AQ was nearly 8 months old by the time Naxx came out, which was double the amount of time Naxx would have gotten. You wouldn't have been able to enjoy your gear for very long before you were on your way to lvl 70 like you could with the other raids. Guilds fortunate enough to do Naxx happened to have people who didn't mind, but good luck getting most raiders to stick around for the raid with the shortest life cycle of vanilla.
---
I don't think it should be controversial to point out that Naxx came out so late in vanilla's life cycle that many people didn't care if they completed it or not. Content drought or not, people tend to quit near of xpacs. It just so happened that in this case, Blizzard launched content that few would get to spend enough time with to matter.

I remember when a hunter rolled on HoJ cause it had attack power.
---
I found a kid levelling in Darkshore. We had fairly the same school schedule, so we levelled all the way from 15~ to 50~ together, pretty much daily. We'd have alts, but every time we were both on I'd jump back on my Hunter and we'd go for it. Then my sub ran out and I had to do chores for another one, and I didn't see him again for years, until the battletag was introduced. We don't talk anymore, but he was a very good friend for almost a year.
---
Rolled on /r/slashdiablo and /r/d2resurgence to keep me sated

Expert sphere grid, abilities and bosses from the Japanese/International versions, turbocharging to speed the game up for grinding, various in-game cheats if you're into that, remastered music and graphics with more graphical options, Eternal Calm cinematic.

I think you see too much into it, most of the ganking will happen for the hell of it.

I have no good experience with Vanilla Balance Druid but I can recommend downloading a spell damage calculator addon such as Theorycraft or Dr. Damage. They show average DPS and DPM on the tooltip of the spell and you should be able to see which spells has the highest DPM currently.

But WotLK was the best expansion

15 bucks isn't shit, wasn't then and it's not now. I'd pay more if it would release earlier lol

He should publicly appologize for that. What a stupid fuck. I remember he said "do you remember having to go to a city and find a group there? Instead of just pressing 1 button and being teleported to a dungeon? Is that what you want?"

PVP  TM and SS, my friend and I undead rogues, kept getting owned by a ally rogue, but he would not kill us eeach time, he would almost teach us a lesson. He tried to talk but ofc you couldn't understand, so I created a ally realf fast and had a great convo with the dude on skills and such. Wish I could recall his name. He also let us kill some players without attacking us lol
---
My only goal is full Soulforge. Fuck raiding, i just want that one set.
---
Level balance with a warlock friend. Otherwise there is no advice.
---
makes sense
---
As much as id love to see him man up and give him a formal apology, I'm afraid it'll never happen.  Instead, he's going to be publicly humiliated ad nauseam after launch, most likely by people using analytics showing the playerbase of classic eclipsing retail.
---
He might try to forget it, but the internet doesnt forget.  Not only do they not forget, they keep all the receipts.
---
So why split it more with TBC and instead just add content after naxx based on community votes
---
Ruthless.
---
For the most part, if you want to slow a faction down, or 'get ahead' abstractly it makes more sense to attack higher level targets. Time at low levels is less valuable than time at 60. Disrupting 60's on the other side can be huge(picking off world buffs on the way to a raid, fighting for crafting mats), but ganking low level players really only wastes a little bit of their time, and annoys them a bit.
---
Mostly you're wasting your own time, that you could be preparing with, for real pvp, which is actually fun and challenging, not just making big numbers on the screen without resistance. At the end of the day you can pretend you're really slowing those lowbies down, but not really, and it just means they will gank your faction more when they get to 60. It's not like killing people half your levels needs any special gear, or skill.
---
This post is just an attempt to justify the time you'll waste making the server more toxic while you avoid any real resistance, or interesting game play. If a 20 something starts on you while you're leveling herbalism you know what to do, if you need to avenge an alt whatever, anything that gives honor is on the menu. But if you're sitting around killing lowbies, I hope you'll try playing the real game soon, because what you're doing is a shitty waste of time. It's a part of the game, I've had it happen to me, I've done it, and from personal experience it's the most immature, pointless aspect of this game.
---
You wana world pvp, you wana slow the other faction down? Organize a raid to fight a raid on thier way to MC. It can take a loooong time to corpse run 40 people from Thorium point to MC, and some groups will fall apart before getting there. Fight over important resources. Fight in important endgame zones. That's actually slowing the other faction down, not wasting an afternoon adding 5 minutes to a few lowbies leveling experience. People like that just cant handle real pvp, and everybody knows it, especially the person being ganked.
---
Downvote for not being Tauren porn as advertised üòÜ

Didn't even know this post was already made sorry :/
---
It‚Äôs better to have low expectations and have them be exceeded then to get your hopes up and be let down. I think people are just managing their expectations. Also it already been so long since it was announced, I think we‚Äôve just grown accustom to waiting at this point.
---
I guess in those cases it is best used against mobs that don‚Äôt have those abilities? In which case is it best just used in a selective grinding situation? I don‚Äôt know, I don‚Äôt really care about levelling speed as I usually get enough rested to not grind all that much. Although that could be based off of pservers using tbc quest reward xp values? Is that a thing? I heard that was a thing..

I‚Äôll be rolling a rogue as my main and I‚Äôve decided that when I go ganking I‚Äôll kill each lowbie once and then move on. Ganking doesn‚Äôt have to be griefing in order to be fun

Right? I was thinking about it and damn, they just made that item because it's hella cool
---
I'm playing a wotlk server rn. It's a good time sink. Don't get too burnt out on it and having fun running dungeons. 
---
Definitely makes me rethink pally tho. Auto attacking is so boring. Made a Hunter and am in love with it. Fuck the shit scaling thing, I pvp mostly so I think that's what I'm rolling now.
---
I agree. I personally always buy Track Beasts &amp; Track Humanoids since they help so much for questing for finding named roaming NPCs or low density mobs in populated areas plus you get them lower level so they don't set you back much in the long run.  
---
As OP said and as you've pointed out Track Hidden &amp; Track Humanoids can be useful on PvP servers.  
---
But agree that the other tracking spells (undead, dragonkin, elementals, etc) are only very situationally helpful so can definitely be skipped.
---
I still take serious issue with LFR as opposed to the previous expansions ideas. In Vanilla, you either killed a boss or you didn‚Äôt, there‚Äôs no ifs or ands. BC was the same, but 5-man content had two difficulties to make it relevant at max level, and not just for the one time you run it while leveling.
---
Then Wrath has a brilliant start. There was a split with 10 and 25, but they were very close in difficulty and gear. So instead of making separate raids like Kara and ZA for that audience, they simply allowed both sizes run the same content. Makes sense from a monetary standpoint, they don‚Äôt want to make 3 raids per xpac for most people to play and then 3 separate raids for the hardcore. They even had optional hard modes, with Sartharion and Ulduar.
---
This is my ideal state of WoW, from patch 3.0-3.1, they had it done so beautifully. More casual players could see most of the content. 10 mans were easy to form, easier to clear, but still gives challenge and requires attention. Clearing Naxx was easy, but 1+ Sarth, Malygos, and Ulduar were tough, but still geared for casuals in 10m mode. 
---
Then 3.2 came, and we had 4 versions of raids. Cata tried to fix that, but made it worse in 4.3 with LFR. That was the first time I quit WoW, since 2005. Maybe it was just a coincidence, and Dragon Soul did honestly suck donkey dick, but LFR has to contribute to a decreased lack of drive to raid. I still had to lfr for those sweet trinkets or a set piece. That was the first patch where raiding became actually trivialized. People who couldn‚Äôt kill one boss on 10m Naxx could easily clear a raid in 2 hours, and they were all strangers.
---
This is wrong.
---
oi! leave hatsune miku out of this
---
Paladin for sure
---
I don't get why so many hunters skip tracking. As a feral track humanoids is one of my favorite abilities. 
---
Seeing exactly what direction I need to go to find the mobs I need to kill is really helpful, especially when I need to locate 1 specific named mob as I can mouseover every dot on the map to read their names.
---
How is your assertion any different from theirs... I'll take a [formalized chart](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J8y9iJFT_tMU1bsPUNve7F1sNhW33LA-xe1hx0NAa_0/mobilepresent#slide=id.g456462cbc4_0_562) over some guy's "In my experience..." any day.

I always liked blue alliance set over the purple. The brass with blue trim looked better than gold with white.

How hard / long of a grind is it?
---
What's your gear like?
---
Does potting reset swing timer? If so you need to time them properly. 
---
If you charge into one person and HS you should be able to stick on them till they are dead. If multiple, intimidating shout and dance around targets and intercept to their healers or far away targets to spare your self some damage.
---
I quit during the first week of Cata. I'm stoked that I actually get to play the version of the game I like. I loved the game all the way through WotLK.
---
the spiders deep in the mine in Elwyn?  I can't remember the name but it's the 3rd mine you check.  The spiders are much further in than you need to go and you don't need to kill them at all.
---
Really cool and atmospheric though.
---
What rank do you get to before it'll diminish weekly again?
---
Do you honestly believe you will put in the effort to farm the mats for rage potions? So much mats that you pop 2 in every PvP engagement? Get real.

I‚Äôve played through LH and mangos core for thousands of hours. Same with playing through a core adjusted to vanilla values, thousands of hours. You get a feel for the differences. It‚Äôs not something you would notice in general gameplay, but when you speedrun min/max you become tuned enough to tell what makes for a tangible difference in levelling speed. 
---
1. Every spawn location available is spawned on LH and mangos cores. This is most noticeable in caves, where you can get twice the number of mobs as vanilla. Reduces travel time, higher density. 
---
2. LH and mangos can use dynamic respawn which substantially changes your xp/hr as it increases thanks to reducing travel time between mobs. 
---
3. Many mobs do not have all resistances implemented on LH and mangos and often things like interrupts are set on a timer and not AI. No fault of the pserver devs because the fact they get any of this to work is a feat in itself - but it‚Äôs not the same. Less resistance = faster kills = higher xp/hr
---
For comparing specs this work the OP did was fantastic. 
---
For levelling purposes just keep the above in mind for Classic
---
Yeah what he said.
---
But here's the TFL:DFR.
---
There are two designated types of servers
---
PvP &gt; Non-consential WPvP, primarily in contested zones. 
---
PvE &gt;  Consentual WPvP,  (opt in)
---
If you are not OK with getting your ass smacked into the spirit world just because. Then PvP servers are not what you are looking for. You are looking for the (Opt in) PvE servers.
---
* ^Excluded ^RP ^from ^this ^because ^that's ^a ^whole ^nother ^can ^of  ^worms ^of ^other ^worldly ^shit ^in ^and ^of ^itself. ^And ^everything ^there ^is ^consentual.(AMIRIGHT!?)
---
** RP! SERVER! WARNING!** If you roll RP. YOU CONSENTED! To whatever [**Cyber**] tf befalls you.
---
Just my personal opinion but I'd add a few more for Druid since they have a lot of skills you need to buy so you have to be a bit more ruthless to cut back:  
---
Wrath (assuming you level as Feral which majority do) - Obviously staple pre-10 but after I found it very rare to really \*need\* this.  
---
Hibernate - can be very useful in PvP but if you were playing on a PvE server I'd argue this could be skipped. Worth mentioning it does have some situational use in PvE though (some quests, can be helpful in Sunken Temple for extra CC, etc.)  
---
Entangling roots - I'd definitely buy the first couple of ranks for an extra useful CC but beyond that the extra damage isn't probably what you're using it for and you can get around the extra time on the CC by recasting it a bit more frequently if needed.  
---
Hurricane (again assuming Feral) - too situational so I don't think it hurts much to skip.
---
De intanet neva give up! We neva forget! We neva die. Dis is OUR game. You wanna.. be gamedesigna , you design here foreva. We gonna bury you here.
---
Depends on how much honor everyone else is grinding. Past like rank 3 or 4 you'll start losing a rank weekly if I recall
---
People used warcraftmovies in tbc too
---
/r/whooosh
---
Invite link has expired or doesnt work
---
&gt; No saying you get ten characters and one faction per PvP server wasn't an update. 
---
It certainly was, as you said it just wasn't one most were hoping for because it's something we all expected. Normally they don't do weekly updates like this for any other game, I'd be happy we're getting any instead of getting everything shoveled to us in one massive blog with the release date.
---
&gt; Either alpha isn't progressing well and that is why we haven't heard much or they are going to make a big announcement this week. 
---
There's a reason the saying no news means good news exists. If things weren't going well, we'd be informed. I agree, there should be a big announcement soon since we're getting close to the rough timeframe they planned to be finished by. That doesn't automatically mean it'll be this week. As long as they're not cutting into their timeframe there's no rush and there's 6 more weeks until then.
---
&gt; Yes I know I sound entitled and spoiled for wanting to know what is going on. I don't care. 
---
Annnd you expect people to care about your post..I mean, lol...
---
&gt; the community should be kept up to date. 
---
Tell me which game Blizzard has ever given their playerbase week by week updates on. Most of the industry doesn't even do that. I wasn't expected them to ever give us a week by week, I was expecting like 1 update every month or two. This is a reason I think they typically don't do it this way because every update people get all excited, but its never the updates they really want, lots of small ones that could very well not be very useful. Is what it is, I'm excited too, quit pissing your pants. The only thing they really owe us is a summer release and unless they say otherwise I would expect it and be patient until then.
---
&gt; They were doing a pretty good job recently until this past week. 
---
Would you rather they finish the game or give us a minute by minute? Clearly if nothing is being said something is in the works.
---
I wouldn't skip Nature's Grasp to get into the better balance talents a little faster, certainly not worth it.
---
Improved Entangling Roots can be very nice if you pull two mobs, would consider picking that up if you're a solo player, skip if you're grouping a lot.
---
Furor in the Restoration tree is a great quality of life pick up.  Being able to shift into Bear form and stun then shift back out and nuke/root/escape whatever.  This may save your life more than once in PvP or indoor areas where you're unable to root.
---
Have fun, leveling Balance is a lot of fun.  If Asmongold's mom can do it, then so can you.
---
What becomes viable in TBC that wasn‚Äôt? What becomes OP?
---
Out of the loop - what's this?
---
That's all fine and dandy, but let's keep it down yes?
---
I suggest procuring some non-bunching panties, you puss.
---
Clearly someone who is use to spoon fed information like enemy cast bars and bluffs.
---
Watch him Turn Red and get a Big Red Angry Face like he is really mad...
---
I‚Äôd pay 60/month
---
Damn that is so awesome!! Always thought he was the funniest guy on the podcast. Super over the top, kind of condescending humor in the best way possible.
---
Doesn‚Äôt warrior suck in PvP unless you are getting dispels &amp; heals anyway?
---
I am so glad someone else shares my exact goals. I only want to raid to get gear for PVP.
---
It's gonna be a respectable amount of work but it shouldn't be anything crazy. The ranks passed 10 is when it gets ridiculous
---
You're the most downvoted person in the entire sub right now!  Gratz!
---
a lot if you never activated the serial, shit if it's used.
---
Honestly barrens needs to be sharded
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem with it. Just because WoW is accessible to people who aren‚Äôt interested in the social aspects of an MMO, doesn‚Äôt hurt the community aspects. Mythic Raids are in their prime and there‚Äôs a strong community around competitive PVE right now. An extra few million playing the solo campaign mode isn‚Äôt gonna change that, but it is gonna fund our next raid
---
His announcement of classic was pretty much his apology. "I personally like chocolate but some people like... Vanilla"
---
I personally take this as a 'I still think retail is the best wow but I understand that there is definitely a fan base and player base for a classic server.'
---
Gear, gear, gear, and more gear. More AP means more damage means more rag. More crit means double damage means double rage. Early geared warriors are rage starved, its just what it is. Charge &gt; hamstring and keep MS up on your target so your team can take it down. Hamstring everything. If it moves, hamstring it. If it's dead, hamstring it anyway. Staying in melee is vital. If you have to choose between using MS or hammy falling off then save rage for hammy. Never use slam in pvp. ever.
---
I was thinking this recently trying to find Classic/Vanilla streams. Right now you have to search and the results pop up in a drop down in the search bar. Not very easy to view. I'd even settle for a Filter for "Classic WoW" or "Classic" vs "Retail" so I can filter all World of Warcraft streams by what version of the game I want to view.
---
Wha...no, scchhhh!!!
---
crashfest, finally worked after players started going to bed lol
---
This is a direct quote taken from Lead Producer J. Allen Brack after fielding a question from a fan at Blizzcon who asked "Do you ever think you will release servers for previous expansions as they were then?"
---
His was response was a cold "No.", along with some other bullshit, including the part above which became the most notorious.  It's pretty much become a meme in the classic community, and one that he will regret saying forever.  Go to YouTube and search for "J Allen brack you think you do but you don't" and try your best to contain your rage.
---
Leveling as balance is really, really bad idea. You are turning one of the most efficient levelers to one of the worst. But if you really want to be a Balance Druid for some RP reasons, the spec doesn't really matter. Get 5/5 Improved Wrath and then spec into Restoration for Insect Swarm and Reflection like [this](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0xZZxVco). At this point you have like 90% of what the balance tree has to offer for leveling. Some of the talents deeper into Balance might seem really nice, and they would be, but then you realize that you have something like 5% spell crit until you start to gear up at max level.
---
Low population luckily only 3 Server crashes that night lol. Fraps FTW :)
---
Once more, the original claim was "every guide says rockbiter is better than windfury"
---
so far, all you've done is keep linking the same guide with the same contrived data over and over
---
I honestly think this time around it‚Äôll be easier. We all have jobs, kids, wives, etc.
---
There will definitely be no-lifers, but with an older population, more of us will have responsibilities that won‚Äôt allow us to bring for PvP rank.
---
PvE scrubs will dis Vanilla rotation, PvP guys will get it.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm just a Horde for life. I think the armor looks sick. But honestly shadowmeld as a hunter is so broken. What‚Äôs your favorite pet for pvp btw? I think Brokentooth would be my favorite for consistency. Plus fuck Frost mages LOL
---
‚ÄúHe called the shit poop‚Äù love that movie
---
120/month wouldn't be too bad
---
Would probably recommend 1440p 144hz then, I love mine
---
Yeah if Blizzard kept up with inflation, the monthly fee should be like 20 bucks
---
Done. WHAT NEXT
---
Nope. One sub for one battle.net id.
---
Sorry, but the ‚Äûthere are just hardcore and LFR people‚Äú part is just not true. There are more than enough casual guilds on retail WoW which raid for fun and don‚Äôt give a fuck about numbers.
---
People like you don't get it. I don't even know why you are here arguing these points in this sub? r/wow is that way ----&gt; 
---
Making all the end content accessible on a level that my cat could literally roll it's face across my keyboard and complete it, is not my idea of a compelling MMO. 
---
It's one thing to make a game accessible to average gamers, but systems like LFR and most of the non instanced part of the game isn't targeting MMO players anymore. 
---
I have never seen the game this dumb down. The only challenge is in this boring scaling system that they created to extend the life of a very small amount of group content. 
---
Most players were drawn to MMOs because of the novelty of playing with others. This idea that has permeated the internet that MMOs aren't about socializing, but rather just being part of a online world is so over blown.
---
WoW was built on guild raiding and the social interactions that people formed because of the design of the older versions of the game.
---
And Diablo 4 will almost certainly be more like D3 than D2. D2 and vanilla WoW...the best work and highest quality games Blizzard has ever produced.
---
Def get nature's grasp, imp entangled roots and  natural shapeshifter actually. The more Mana for spells while going in and out of forms is always a plus. I leveled as balance back in the day and while it was a bit slower, I actually really enjoyed the rotation and abilities.
---
No, just need it to purchase it. So if u get to rank 14, buy all u need.
---
No, the requirement is just to buy the items. Once you have them you no longer need the rank.
---
IIRC Blizzard stated that the average age of players during vanilla retail was somewhere in the mid/late 20s. So people were old and had gross ass jobs back then, too!
---
You‚Äôd just need to get a new account / sub.
---
Plus D3 has much more meaningful and diverse stats on their Items. WoW has basically 4 stats left of which two are good and two are bad for most specs. That‚Äôs it.
---
The main reason I burned out originally is because by the time I 6 or 7 ranks in 1.12 was out and I was tired of constantly facing naxx geared premades.
---
play fury
---
Because a fraction of wows audience makes up entire populations of some mmos. 
---
Wow can afford to run retail classic bc and bring in more subs than they would running only one and have a population of each as large as the next two mmos combined
---
It depends On your servere, when i played on a p-serverv with 8000 online.  It took around 2-3 hours pr Day when You hit rank 10
---
I wanna be a Paladin bro, too. I wanna roll Human, but the general stereotype for Palabros is Dwarves, and they‚Äôre pretty cool too. I can‚Äôt decide.
---
I remember my guildie asking us to loan him gold after hitting rank 14 so that he can finally get some sleep.. Good times..
---
Don‚Äôt join a raid group for fun killing an elite or whatever and then forget to leave it.  People always forget raid groups stop most quests from working and think their game is broken.  Allll the time.
---
Yes! Thank you blizzard for giving us what we want out of every game we want to play since we lost this
---
Druid is healer, other specs are pure garbage and shouldn't be encouraged. Warrior dps is fine.
---
It's much better to have a bad dps with you, than a bad tank.
---
...
---
Every step is logical. If you think someone caring about adding 5 minutes to the opposite faction's /played is cringy well, we're all entitled to our opinions. But the fact is PVP servers have a different variable that impacts the process starting at a low player level.
---
At the same time people have had the time with private servers to get really efficient with the time they will have
---
My two goals are full ten storms and Swift Zulian Tiger
---
I always thought i wanted a pvp server. I love pvp. And constant action appeals to me. But after trying out a PS i changed my mind by the end of stv. Between hillsbrad and stv it just wasnt worth it. But i also work 50+ hours a week so my time is precious and the less corpse runs from camping higher levels the better. 
---
Sometimes you think you want something but you dont. And thats ok. I just will do what i did when i played retail and play on a pve server qlways flagged. At least then if I get camped its a short wait to fix the situation.
---
You should go gathering till 60. Skinning will make you great food even just vendoring the crap leather till you are 60. 
---
You‚Äôll kill so many mobs on the way to 60 that skinning will pay for your mount.
---
Take mining too and just keep all your mats till 60 then power level engineering.
---
Hi, /u/Trubrewski91
---
15s/hr ?? I thought it was gonna be like 15c/hr.
---
Private servers are overtuned, classic dungeons and raids will be a joke compared to private servers.
---
Even dumb asses like you will be able to push end game raids with ease.
---
I agree - on melee chars like my rogues over the years i appreciate escape artist but with blink and iceblock I rarely reach for escape artist. I've been feared a lot more than snared on my mage.
---
Youtube? I think you mean warcraftmovies.
---
I'd pay my soul and first born son.
---
He's 9.
---
Getting ganked for like 4 hours straight in STV by a lvl60. It was not the best but the most memorable. I still remember the nickname of that son of a bitch, pirata, i love you now
---
Sure, ret. But did you just talk shit about holy pala with them healing comments there? Arguably the best pvp healer in the game?
---
But there‚Äôs a chest (and a rare) back there!
---
&gt; WoW isn't advertised as some hard core game only for the top 1%, not even vanilla
---
Just to jump in here - while WoW was never advertised as being "a hardcore game", it **was** advertised as an adventure game. There's a reason you had massive portions of the playerbase that never saw the inside of BWL past Razorgore. Same during BC - numerous people had to wait until WotLK/Cata before they could get into Black Temple.
---
yeah but that was introduced in 1.6
---
They‚Äôll find a way to fuck it up. They always do.
---
Once the shareholders get a sniff of how much money it‚Äôs making they‚Äôll want to know why the player base isn‚Äôt being force fed micro transactions and we‚Äôll be back to retail.
---
I never get the rationale of it being unfair to use hp / res pots or eng items etc in wpvp
---
Dude Bobby Kotick has emailed twitch personally to make sure everyone streaming wow is grouped into one channel, and what's more they have new so that automatically updated the streamed content to the new models and changes any mention of classic to "battle for azeroth".
---
Azmongold might want to stream "playing classic with ma homies" but what will appear to viewers is "playing WORLD OF WARCRAFT: BATTLE FOR AZEROTH‚Ñ¢ with ma homies".
---
You're just now realizing this? Better woke later than never I guess.
---
Oh go give your balls a tug.
---
The thing I don't understand is how a game like Dota has such a great in-game voice comm yet Blizzard is fucking baffled by how to make WoW's work.
---
Yeah and it‚Äôs based on patch 1.12.
---
I remember when I was farming herbs and ores in Blasted lands while scouting Kazzak for my guild. I would run into a fellow ally lvl 52 who was trying to level but kept getting ganked over and over again by 3 horde players 3-4 levels higher than him. I would always arrive a little late and see him release corpse. I stopped farming and began hunting these horde scum down and 1 hour and 30 minutes later I had pushed them out of Blasted Lands. That felt so good because I felt like I was helping myself because I too had been that lvl 52 dude trying to survive the dangers of leveling.
---
I also remember the first time I saw a high ranked player. It was a druid named Legazy. He did for us what I did for fellow lvl 52 ally. He came to Hillsbrad-Tarren Mill and changed the momentum and gave alliance space and time to quest and level. This was when you only had to look at a player to know okay lets fucking run because you knew you'd become Mankirks wife if you stayed :D and it was so awesome seeing this Druid at the front line with full rank 10 gear and jumping into cat form then stealth and the horde front line would back off like AW SHIT here we go again.
---
I got fed up during MoP. Played some classic servers recently and have been loving it. It's exactly what we all want in an MMO.
---
On a side note I wonder how many people are coming back just for classic. I know I am and many other people I've seen.
---
The game is based on 1.12. There's no way in hell blizzard will make you maintain rank to keep the gear equipped.
---
I wonder how many of those people are still alive.
---
Jesus, gatekeeping much?
---
Crab in westfall
---
The game is 1.12
---
I have a couple copies but both have been used..
---
 This box was never opened and I keep it closed.
---
Remember the black list addon that triggered an alert if the listed players were close by? Those were the times.
---

---
Like others have said, don't even bother with Slam. The best thing you can do for yourself is to befriend a pally or shaman. Geared Vanilla Warrior + Pocket Healer...doesn't get any better than that!
---
Oh yeah I was actually surprised that the blue shawl was a blue rarity.
---
Pretend this is as big as the biggest expansion (whichever one that was). They'd still be missing the initial $50 purchase at the beginning of the expansion from everyone. That's three months subbed. The only way this blows out of the park is if a huge number of subs stick around for a sustained period of time.
---
ok, but i don't think about the code, i have my named account, its about the box and not the key ;)
---
With good usage of consumables/engi/trinkets and clever use of game mechanics u can definitely pose a threat to most classes (see monkeynews pvp vids for an example of this)
---
They don't sell, nor have ever sold, gear in the item store.
---
But people have different opinions. (Might be a shock for you, I know)
---
U cant break TOS of a game and stream it I think is the rule.
---
so this was you first game purchase of wow and u never opened it, yet it got lost a few months after? Confusing story my dude
---
Never use slam?? You dont use it often, sure, but it has it's uses. After an intercept stun, for instance.
---
A lot of the BiS stuff wasn't often green, it was still Rare or Epic - but it wasn't forced to you from some next-tier raiding and was dependent on what gear you currently had.
---
For example, +3% Hit was a massive DPS increase if you were hovering around 5% even if you lost primary stats. However going from 13% to 16% wasn't nearly as impactful, so you could actually play around with your gear to tailor it more toward what you wanted.
---
I was like 7-8 when classic came out, only really got into WoW during BC with my dad.
---
I‚Äôm looking forward to being able to experience classic on my own terms since I was never really able too.
---
Every step is delusion. 
---
It‚Äôs a futile attempt to justify ganking as some sort of grand strategy. You see red names, you kill red names. Sometimes you get bored and kill lowbies. Sometimes you corpse camp. It‚Äôs dickish but it needs no justification. Sometimes being a dick is just fun. And that‚Äôs why pvp servers exist. 
---
That‚Äôs. It.
---
Can we at least agree it was not cata.
---
your involvement in this thread is way more cringey than the original post. Let him have his fun, who cares.
---
Personally I go Elemental Leatherworking for my Druid in the beginning, because it's super cheap and there is so amazing Resto Gear for Phase 1.
---
After that I will learn Alchemy.
---
You don't have to stick to Leatherworking for 2-3 years.
---
Please no..wait a minute... what is your haircolor?
---
We don't know about macros yet, but I can list some just to get an idea of the type of macros that can be useful. 
---
I use the side mouse buttons for pet attack and pet follow. I would suggest using shift+mouse wheel up and shift+mouse wheel down for camera zoom in and out. Mouse wheel down for rain of fire target glyph and mouse wheel up with mouse cursor over target for corruption. Middle mouse button for will of the forsaken. Instant dot mouse over macros for corruption and syphon life can be useful. 
---
A mouse over focus macro
---
Target swapping macro used with a focus that toggles to last target
---
Fel Hunter devour macro
---
A stop casting then Shadow burn macro
---
Drain soul macro to prevent soul shards from filling your inventory
---
fel domination void sac bubble macro
---
mouse over seduce macro
---
emergency button macro for healthstone, shadow ward, and defense cool downs
---
trinket slot on use ability macro
---
rare targeting macro that can be quickly edited 
---
macro used as a note pad for copy and pasting text in chat for looking for more players or rare mob names. Use ctrl c and ctrl v
---
These are just a few of the types of macros that can be helpful to warlocks. We don't know if these macros will even work yet though.
---
You want to use Slam after a white hit. A swing timer addon is essential to make sure you do not clip your white attacks.
---
noooo, this was a ordering. my box was and is lost.
---
Deff was :). Both the UC and the Grom'gol one.
---
Blizzard intentionally moving to higher ilvl = almost always strictly better is a fait bit newer. This is one of the things that makes gear feel similar.
---
Mooncloth bags are 16 slot, and the pattern only drops in BWL so you can actually make good money from tips since it'll be fairly rare at the start of classic if you're lucky enough to get it.
---
Some lucky player got a Teebu's Blazing Longsword from a mob that night.
---
Very cool, OP. I hope you and your brother make great memories this time around. Good luck on your adventures in Azeroth, together.
---
Yer that would be sweet
---
Leather working can't make bags... Are u thinking tailoring?
---
So lucky I still get to rock the hwl mog set on my Shaman. Probably my greatest gaming achievement.
---
And no f‚Äôin way I‚Äôm going for it again. Best of luck!!
---
1.12 came after 1.6?
---
in vanilla I got the full blue set by pvping 2-4hours/day on weekdays and perhaps 4-5 hours/day on weekends for maybe 1-2 months. I was a huge noob back then and certainly didnt really have a grasp on how ranking, rankpoints, brackets and standings worked. The only thing I knew was the more you pvped the higher the rank you get.
---
This was on al'akir-EU, one of the larger European PvP-servers.
---
They‚Äôve sold transmog helms in the item store. Yes they didn‚Äôt have stats, but still ‚Äògear was sold in the item store‚Äô. (^:
---
First week of June because hearthstone single player announcement is later today or this week at some point.
---
Would you agree that something is better, if more people believed it was better?
---
You do not want to use slam in pvp. It‚Äôs a shit rage dump that leaves you standing still. 
---
The only rotation that uses slams are reck bomb memes where the target is stunned for 5+ seconds. Stop with nonsense, stop giving advice on things you don‚Äôt know.
---
You get a rank decay even if you're rank2. The higher the rank the higher the decay. When you get past Rank11 the decay is quite steep and past 12-13 its insane. You'll need 200-300k honor just to break even from the decay at rank 12-13.
---
Ehh. When this kind of try-hard shit is posted as some sort of PSA then I feel I have a right to express how full of shit it is as a fellow exclusive patron of PvP servers. 
---
Try again.
---
He‚Äôs back!
---
Wrong.
---
I think your confusing 1.12 with 1.1.2
---
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12
---
Unless my elementary teacher lied to me, yes
---
1.12 is twelve, not an iteration to 1.1
---
I‚Äôll save you the time. Get a dell S2417DG.  It‚Äôs the 24 inch model which has better pixel density than the 27 inch.  1440p gsync 165hz tn panel.  No ghosting, blacklight bleed, etc.  No monitor lottery needed(to get a ‚Äúgood one‚Äù).  It‚Äôs awesome.  It won‚Äôt have the color accuracy or saturation of a high end ips panel I‚Äôm sure but unless you edit professional photos for a living that is not the priority.  I love mine on every game I have.
---
It says so in OP's post. Gosh, please pay attention.
---
Thanks human
---
My point is : you do not use it often, but it's still there, it's still an ability that has it's uses. If you never use it even when the situation calls for it, then you are not playing your class to it's highest potential. But apparently that's nonsense haha.
---
Meme's aside, there are alot of people who advocate Slam after a AA in an intercept stun? Is this now total nonsense?
---
I have the same bed texture.
---
In premade PvP, I'll have the consumes to be able to output my strongest openers when they needed. Yes.
---
I'm waiting for that 10 min YouTube video
---
What are the main things that reset swing timers?
---
Honestly it's good that someone laid it out like this. I remember when retail got rid of pvp servers, people were talking about how glad they were because they didnt know what they signed up for, or didnt understand, or only were there because there friends were.
---
And because people don't understand really basic shit and apparently cant think out the consequences of their actions I had to deal with pvp servers being taken away.
---
Yes I'm mad about it. I really hate when I get punished for other peoples fuck ups.
---
So read this dudes post and actually make sure you want to be there. There is no turning it off this time.
---
Damn, that‚Äôs hard to answer. I‚Äôd still say it‚Äôs just better for the majority of people but not better in general because there is no formula or scientific unit for measuring how good a game is.
---
When WOTLK was coming out, me and my wow friends were talking about attending midpoint releases. Asking where they were going, we found that we lived near each other. How near? My wow friend of 4 years lived literally the house behind mine. Haha that was funny. Still friends to this day. Caught up and had a beer talking about how cool vanilla will be :)
---
Omg. Please tell me your kidding.
---
Just go to a PvE server and leave the rest of us alone.
---
I think at this point being BFA is a bigger insult than any of those games.
---
This.
---
You only have to sub, there is no initial cost and since it's starting fresh you lose nothing on having a new account. Or you can hide your BNet presence or tell your friends to sod off while you play classic.
---
Engineering is pretty much mandatory as a Warrior both in PvE and PvP.
---
Sappers, Grenades, Trinkets, Tank shield etc.
---
Everyone heed this guys warning. Leveling is a big part of it so if you cant deal with getting ganked then dont play!

Tired of r/classicwow to tell you that you won't get into any raids as a spriest/non-resto shaman/feral etc?
---
Feel free to join us in our adventure to clear the entire of classics raiding challanges while still maintaining our identity!
---
We will raid 2-3 nights a week and won't require too many consumables.
---
Everyone is welcome so feel free to PM me for the discord link!
---
Because you skin the mobs you farm, increasing gold/h by a fair bunch.
---
I can't wait to get the shaman set for my Tauren in classic. Gonna be good times.
---
Man how are you this deep in the sub but haven‚Äôt heard that?
---
Why are you getting downvoted. 
---
Same deal with Blacksmithing. Useful to have 1 or 2 in each guild for all the recipes dropping in raid however it's otherwise pretty useless.
---
its my couch ;)
---
30/21 is extremely close to the best spec for healing if you're spamming Healing Touch. Those 30 points in Feral get you 20% extra intellect, while the standard healing build (24/0/27) has 9% reduced mana cost on your healing spells. 24/0/27 is more efficient against raid bosses, but not by enough for anyone to notice the difference.
---
You can also tank with that build as long as you take bear form talents instead of cat form talents with your 30 points in Feral. And yes, it's the best PvP build for sure.
---
Two very different classes. Druids heal and tank. Warlocks are utility DPS.
---
If you want to deal damage, roll Warlock. If you want to heal and/or tank, roll Druid.
---
It's super bullshit that it's purely time played for rank 14.  If it's supposed to reward the 1 percent,  performance should be more involved
---
If you want dmg go rogue hunter has a verry bad dps and brings dosn‚Äôt bring much to a raid. If you want to go into ‚Äúsirious‚Äù guilds as in min maxers there is a good chance they won‚Äôt accapt hunters rouges are the second best dps after hunters just a lot of people will play rouge so a lot of competition. If u want dmg and be able to compete on dmg meters go rogue. Both are a lot of fun tho and hunterd level verry easely and have verry good solo grind spots for gold later on.
---
That shit wet bruh
---
&gt; dungeon runs felt so empty and useless

In WotLK it wasn't quite like that, running dungeons was actually a good bit of fun, and the culture and community from vanilla was still mostly there, so people would talk in party chat and it wasn't so toxic. I enjoyed my time with it. But I am not sure if that would be the case if we got WotLK back these days.
---
The hilarious part is the people who keep giving those YouTubers Revenue clicks.
---
OSRS also has an all star support team. community-approved content updates, good dev communication, and lots more.
---
I hope they *continue* to look to osrs as a model.
---
I've also seen the argument that's it's not so much an MMORPG as a MOBA or Diablo II style game. I think there is something to that criticism as well.
---
200/month and my first born, that‚Äôs my final offer
---
SM's not bad, its out of the way a bit though. - the challenge with dungeons is just finding a group while you are in the nearby area, but we are in alterac mountains around level 36 and 39 so its possible.
---
A full Uldaman isn't that great because we run it around 40-42, and you need to be 44-45 to be able to handle the later half of that dungeon, otherwise you get destroyed, so you'd have to do it later in the guide a 2nd time or delay it completely, but at that point a lot of the quests and mobs become grey in the early half of the dungeon.
---
What about lock
---
You‚Äôre right.. I just drifted on still not being able to get my account back.. I know I just need to try harder to try and recover it but I didn‚Äôt mean anything serious about using the game codes themselves. Simply just that even if I don‚Äôt recover my original account I am still ready, willing and able to create a new one for the best experience in gaming I‚Äôve had in many many years prior to this.

---
Play both, see how they feel, see what your guild can use
---
I would recomend rogue. Its always a top dps conteder with one of its specs and pretty good at pvp.  The fact that you have vanish is extremly usefull.
---
Lock is the second easiest leveler. Verry good in pvp duo to mass cc and decent dmg.
---
Just a lesser dmg output then a mage but high utility duo to summoning portal/curses that make some fights easier.
---
Just keep in mind that every time before you go raid you need to farm about 40 soulshards and also you need to farm a lot of em for pvp.
---
everyone seems to be forgetting about E3. releasing a release date before then is just bad marketing.
---
No you only need the rank to purchase the gear. Only 1 person a week can be R14, no one is autistic enough to hold R14 for more than a week.  You need to be playing 12-14 hours a day/7 days a week 4 months straight to even get from rank 11 to 14.
---
That's like mee but except instead of your brother it's my Dad (or flipped, I guess), and the age difference is a bit greater.
---
Thanks, dude! It's awesome how everything worked out. Full Circle gaming \^.\^
---
Been in the game about a week, with fairly limited play time at first due to us having dial up. I'm a nelf rogue and I've just hit level 12 (I think) and someone in my guild says I should definitely go and train swords - just a short walk to SW!
---
I get totally lost just in Darnassus, since I can't work out how the portal works and ask for some help to find the boats. Then all of a sudden a guildie who happens to be in Darnassus comes over and shows me how to use the portal. But he turns around and says "I'll take you the whole way, maybe you can get through the Wetlands without dying!". Me having no idea what the Wetlands are or why I would die in them just kinda laughed and agreed. 
---
Half an hour later we're fighting our way through the wrong zone (we got the boat to Dustwallow instead...), only to realise our mistake and fight our way back out again. We get into the Wetlands, I die heaps, and finally into the tunnels leading out of the zone. But at this stage my mum needs to use the phone and I have to log out.
---
I come back two days later, all by myself in the tunnel. I go out the wrong side of it, and get killed immediately. I res in the tunnel, stealth, and hide behind a pillar asking for help in /guild. The same legend from the other day laughs and says "give me a few minutes I'll be right there". Not only does he walk me all the way to IF, then SW (with me running at about 0.01 FPS in the cities, took me half an hour to walk to/from the tram), he gives me a bunch of gold for the training and to buy some swords and guns off the AH. 
---
I must have taken up several hours of this guy's time, and he happily gave it up for absolutely no benefit to himself. First time I'd ever experienced something like that in a game, I was blown away.
---
Honnor system was introduced in patch 1.4 April 2005 and patch 1.6 was July 2005. No one had even hit rank 12 at that point.
---
So annoying that isn't it?
---
Youtubers are talking shit about Classic?
---
I might use Slam if I had someone else stun the target for me and I had 100 rage to dumb somewhere + I'd be wearing Might of Menethil. Then Slam is acceptable for the lulz. I tried improved slam with swordspec+HoJ+Windfury and it is not viable even in PvE. Or it was on a boss that was standing still and you could 100% focus on your rotation. But this is not the case in PvE. If you are a Horde warrior with WF and swordspec + PvP-gloves with hamstring -ragecost, then use hamstring to trigger extra attacks and focus on positioning and jumping around the enemy and confusing him. I really see no use for Slam unless you are killing players that are so much undergeared that you just want to troll them.
---
TM vs SS is something only casuals will do to have fun, if its even happens.
---
And jea rogues arent that good, cant wait for the rude wakeup of all the guys that thing rogue is extremly strong and easy like its portrayed back then in world of roguecraft.
---
Played a rogue for a long time from launch until now off and on. Solid choice, was great in PVP (picking the correct targets ofc)  Needed in groups. I have a troll hunter but he;s retail, they are more of a lone wolf class imho. They are a pain in the ass in pvp if you don't get the jump on them.
---
Hi, /u/jacobmcclinton

He pretty obviously didn't. He said if you try to heal folks in your Ret gear, you'll go OOM in no time.
---
Insane how Mage has its entire kit available at 28 in Vanilla.
---
MAGE MASTERCLASS
---
I barely even raided and I still stand behind the gatekeeping. I used LFR in Mists of Pandaria and it immediately killed my interest in the game because I thought "Why bother doing normal mode? I've already these raids and seen all the bosses".
---
Personally, I think having difficult content that seems unattainable makes the game so much more interesting. Sure, I never kill Kel'Thezzad, but I would've been very disappointed if I just LFR'd into Naxx and killed him in one night. If I'm going to kill him, I want to know that I'm worthy of it.
---
Nay
---
I honestly very much doubt they will fuck up classicnat this point.
---
Why do most people think announcement will be 14-16th of may? Why not this week or a later week?
---
nice try, 2/10
---
Really neat. Anyone got an overview of all the pvp rewards and/or pictures of each set?
---
okay, that makes sense.
---
Yeah, I appreciate Brack a lot because he was the one to announce it. You could tell he was nervous as hell.
---
jea 2k hp undergeared clothies \\o/, you dont need a class for that.
---
Ive never seen a Hunter oneshot a 5-6k Hp Shadowpriest or a SL warlock with the same Hp, and Mage has tools too never get hit by an Aimshot but even a Mage wir like 5k hp dosnt get oneshotted.
---
If you char isnt geared full pve no stamina you wont get oneshotted, thats how it is, you wont even oneshot a "normal" pvp geared char that hovers around 4k - 4,5k hp.
---
But thats the diffrence against a good hunter and just the normal hunter you kill without even trying, good hunters dont even try to kill you fast, cause they know its way to risky.
---
Graphics is pretty much the only thing I want changes on. Everything else is integral to the game... But not the graphics.
---
Aaaand that's the end of the scetch, everyone! Thank you all for watching, we'll be back next week, when someone posts about what kind of real life sacrifices they're willing to make, to have more time in wow...will it be dumping the missus, skipping the workout routine or once again selling their kids? Stay tuned and find out;)
---
That would be counterintuitive to their success knowing that the clientele for Classic are playing specifically because of the absence of such modern schemes.
---
&gt; "Why bother doing normal mode? I've already done these raids and seen all the bosses".
---
See the thing is, this is perfectly okay. Wow is still a role playing game and the stuff that happens inside the raids is part of it. I love the scenes and dialogue inside raids and I should still be able to see that side of the story in-game because I like and follow the story. For the majority of the players LFR is enough for them.
---
&gt; Personally, I think having difficult content that seems unattainable makes the game so much more interesting.
---
While it might not be exactly what you want, this is still the case with things like AOTC, mythic raiding, and mythic dungeons. The majority of the playerbase won't see AOTC or any mythic bosses. As well as being unable to complete high level mythic keys. 
---
I wouldn't agree with developing a raid and the story only to find out 10 people got to play and experience it.
---
For only 25 wow tokens and some silvers...
---
This happened with WoD already iirc
---
If you are the tank, it‚Äôs your job to know what to do.  You will have a lot of time to figure it out leveling up and doing the basic dungeons.  But later on, things get more complicated.  You have to know what gets crowd controlled, how much to pull and how fast, boss mechanics, where to stand, how to deal with bad dps and bad healers, bad situations like extra packs showing up, constantly repairing your gear, etc. The difference between a bad undergeared/unknowledgeable tank for the content and an aggressively good one is the difference between a mute and being added on a friends list.  That being said the content in classic was not like it was in later expansions where you have to read online for 30 minutes a boss and watch a bunch of videos etc.  You just have to want to learn some ahead of time and find any tips you can(which is SUPER easy now) In raids there are 39 other people counting on you and no serious guild is going to explain everything to you in a raid situation (but DO NOT wipe a raid because you need reminded of what to do!) 
---
Or you can roll a pally healer and push one button.
---
Music checks out, video verified.
---
It's cool. It's just that people who get involved and interested in things are usually much more fun than people who say: "thats cringey and try-hard! stop ittt!". Whatever though
---
What? Kill Jaina in Blackfathom Deeps, that's seems kind of rude, all she wanted to do was study.
---
&gt; He might try to forget it, but the internet doesnt forget.  Not only do they not forget, they keep all the receipts.
---
Yeah lets show him by giving him and the company he works for millions of dollars! That will teach him not to be so arrogant! Let's really teach him a lesson by making his first full year as CEO extremely successful compared to other years - he will really hate that!
---
You think he gives a fuck? Blizzard played the classic fan base until they themselves felt the need to drain you all for cash by taking away what you've had for free for 10 years and making you (happily) pay 15 dollars a month for it again. Blizzard made classic exactly when they wanted to, don't think any differently - they saw a revenue stream and decided to milk it for all its worth. 
---
You're really "keeping the receipts"there bud.
---
Strange...
---
I was grinding in 2006 to get a dwarf hunter up to 60. I must have been level 57-68 or something. Im outside Black Rock Stronghold in Burningsteppes. There is a chinese goldfarmer there (60 human  rogue) farming the inside and occasionally coming out to grab one of my mobs. 
---
I get stunlocked by a rogue outside and I think im fucked. But I can see a glimpse of that goldfarmer in the entrance. I shout out ‚ÄùHELP!‚Äù since he answered on of my attempts to contact with ‚Äùni hao‚Äù earlier.
---
He comes out and just stands there. I wonder what this sadistic motherfucker is doing. Do he get a kick of seeing one of his rogue brethren trounce me?
---
Then it happens. He starts to charge up his gnomish deathray! It crits and insta deletes all of the HP the rogue has left!
---
I proceed to thank him and we continue grinding.
---
My first interaction was when i started during tbc, i just hitted lvl 70 or something like that and i was really hyped about flying etc and even tho i couldnt afford it some person called Kevin came To raid with me some zg and he gaved me 5k gold To buy the flying what a nice guy eventually he stopped playing when wowtlk came out - this happend on EU server
---
Instead of mythic raids, I'd rather just have a completely different raid that is more difficult. I don't care about doing the exact same boss with a bit more difficulty, I want to leave and continue the story elsewhere.
---
The hilarious part is the daily hate on blizzard, activision,J Allen Brack and yet the absolute willingness to suddenly start paying a fee for something that they have had for free for 10 years to a company they have absolutely no respect for. 
---
"Hey dave, hows the new dentist"
---
"It's real bad man, he sedates me and fucks me in the ass after every visit"
---
"Shit man, you found a new one?"
---
"Nah, he gives me a lollypop afterwords so we're cool"
---
Nice counter argument, it's totally makes me see your point.
---
This is classic there is no dh
---
TBC dance video isnt a raise from leroy
---
I'm sure once it's actually supposed to be streamed on twitch they probably will. It's obvious why they haven't done it yet.
---
My very first wow char was a NE druid.. I pretty much leveled to mid 40s by wrath + entangling roots + wrath + auto attack down. I leveled sooo slow, but didnt realize it at the time.
---
It's usually because those YouTubers know that all the people who tune in to listen to them ditch about blizzard will also tune in to watch them play blizzard classic. That's some fantastic emotional and mental health going on there LOL
---
Collectors, obviously.
---
I kinda love these ‚Äúafter Naxx‚Äù posts. It‚Äôs kinda like folk think getting to Naxx and clearing it or even having it on Farm status so 40-50 raiders (what most guilds will need) get the gear they need, will be easy.
---
When tBC was released, less than 1-2% of vanilla players were raiding Naxx and downing bosses. 
---
Even 4yrs after classic is released, the number of guilds clearing Naxx will still be very low. üòÇüëç
---
People shouldn‚Äôt worry about what happens after naxx till the whole server is running about in full T3!
---
There is literally only one good use for slam, and that is as an opener on a stunned/cced target for your recklessness combo at 100 rage, so a meme basically. If you are using slam in pvp, you are doing something wrong.
---
You're glossing over the important point. People leave games in those situations *because being dominated isnt fun.* If it were fun, the faction balance would stay roughly equal - but the simple and clear fact that one faction eventually 'wins' the server and becomes 70 to 90% of the players is evidence that the losing faction is no fun to play on that server.
---
Skarm is a really good resource for tanking, also the warrior discord fight club has alot of knowledgable people who are really helpful.
---
Tipsout is the ‚Äòclassic content creator‚Äô equivalent of noxxic, you watch his videos and learn nothing or end up with less brain cells than when you started, his videos are factually inaccurate, boring and uninformative, I suggest you don‚Äôt waste your time watching them, he really is that bad.
---
On top of that we wont have the wonder and amazement of playing WoW for the first time to keep us occupied. Sure, we might be amazed that we're playing official classic, but a lot of us have explored the starting zones like twenty times, now. We just wanna get out. 
---
Back then, just running around was enough for most people because they never seen wow before.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800‚Äî2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow‚Äôs release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We‚Äôve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone‚Äôs time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don‚Äôt be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm ‚Äì 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let‚Äôs chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.  Our roster is already very healthy  but we welcome every recruit with the potential to excel in a team environment and those dedicated to enriching themselves and those around them.
---
**Current Activity**:  Currently a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We also have guild jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**
---
The less social can also fill out an application on our Website [http://epochofthought.shivtr.com](http://epochofthought.shivtr.com)  You can also jump on our discord at [https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT](https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT)

**Join us!**
---
&gt;Dont recommended newbies to not use abilities that SHOULD in fact be used in certain fringe cases. You are not helping them.
---
I disagree with this. Using slam in pvp is so situational that telling new players to use it will just confuse them. Let them know it exists sure, but let them get the basics down before they start timing slam down to the 100ms during stuns or whatever the fuck.
---
Thats so wholesome, you will probably enjoy the game way more now that you can play with your bro ! I used to watch my cousin getting through STV and its one of my best memories :)
---
Nah, you can belong on pvp server and not jump. Gatekeeping like this is dumb. Some people dont jump in because the respect the one on one battle.

Just to clarify you can see why engineering is best

It's like listening to partners of domestic abuse in here sometimes "They hit me, but I could possibly leave". 
---
I wonder if they will feel even the slightest tinge of irony on launch day when, after months of screaming nothing but shit about blizzard, they take out their credit card and slowly type in the number and hand over 15 usd a month for what, in large part, is worth that blizzard did 15 years ago and is now reselling them with s a shiny new bow (and the bow is actually stuff they hate like sharding, auto-reporting and loot trading)

Hi everyone! I've just made a discord server for our planned classic Oceanic PVP server guild. We currently have about 10 founding members and are looking for more to help create an awesome classic experience.  Raid times, loot and intended faction are still to be determined by the group.    
---
I'm an experienced ex-raid leader who ran a guild with 1k members in Wotlk, and have also cleared up to Molten Core on a classic private server. My vision is for a competent yet semi-casual guild, in which anyone can raid in any spec, including sub-optimal ones - putting fun, friendship and fully immersing ourselves in the game as priority, with efficient grinding min/maxing and lack of sleep being optional!  And before you ask - Yes, you can raid as Ret or Moonkin with us!    
---
Come introduce yourself!

Yeah that sucks, that's why you need a supportive guild :D.
---
Are you sure? I have two WoW Accounts assigned to my battle.net ID and I planned to  multibox. I guess you would only be able to login with one account when you only pay one sub. Pretty sure it should be one sub per WoW Account
---
This post pretty much sums it up for any delusional people out there thinking that Classic will be some WoW 2.0 remake and they will just double down on devs to make expansions for both versions of the game. Also most of the people talking about OSRS voting system, haven't even actually played the game, if you had, you wouldn't come praising the system here considering how flawed it is in OSRS.
---
I played Al'Akir EU for vanilla too. Was a great server for battlegrounds.
---
This may be an unpopular opinion but I can completely understand the reason why he made the comment. It's important to note that pretty much everything that's been put into WoW over the years, including all those quality of life changes like what Brack talked about, were all asked for by the playerbase. Even back in vanilla, I can remember threads of people asking for easier ways to get dungeon groups going, flying mounts, and easier to obtain epics. It's not like Blizzard put these things in and faced immediate and total backlash from the community. 
---
So from that perspective Brack's comment made perfect sense. He'd listened to years and years of feedback from players saying they wanted this stuff. To have players suddenly turn around and say "We don't want all that stuff" would seem bizarre. Consider as well the number of times on the retail forums that whenever Classic servers were brought up, the community itself would shout them down, including but not limited to the infamous Wall Of No. From Brack's perspective, he was simply voicing the community's thoughts. Nothing stupid about that. 
---
What he of course did mess up on was misunderstanding the appeal Classic had within the community. To be completely fair to the man however, judging support for that was a difficult job. Using private servers as a metric is fraught with issues, chiefly because private servers are free. Someone producing the game could very well dismiss everyone playing on them as a bunch of freeloading Blizzard-haters who wouldn't pay for Classic even if Blizzard made it available.

Its not twitch who was banning pservers streamers it was blizzard copy striking them
---
This is exactly why Vanilla is not for casuals that want to PVP.
---
Once the HC have T2+ raid gear it's game over for the casuals.

I'd usually go for natures grasp and then space all the rest of your points in feral.

---
It sure was. I recall when the implemented the xrealm BGs. Al'Akir premades was the scourge of the blackout battlegroup because Al'Akir premades would camp you at Graveyard.
---
Many good PvPers at that server. I wasnt one of them though.
---
&gt;With that said, the appeal of Classic PVP was not the rewards.
---
Right. So all the premades that were grinding R13/14 fro 16h a day and dodge queuing were absolutely not doing it for the rewards.
---
This is definitely my goal come classic too. Orc Warrior MasterRace.
---
I did the grind on a 8k pop server and i hope it will get a little bit easier on classic tbh
---
Rose colored glasses ? Having fun was the point before the honor system was implemented.
---
After that it became a grind to get the rewards.
---
I was PVPing casually but the system was fucked : HC premades that were rolling on pick-ups and dodge queuing if they encountered another premade.
---
Definitely this! It was hilarious watching dozens of players trying to climb the fountain for gold.

I'd completely forgotten about the AQ40 Warriors! I remember one particular draw in WSG where I killed this guy with a 98 damage Gouge just as he also Executes me for 3.1k. All that time spent breathing harshly between clenched teeth in my ZG gear, hah!
---
I did it back then with a full time job, as long as you focus on pvping for a while its somewhat easy to obtain.

Just remember to farm honor smart, hour longs AV matches are NOT good for honor as one would think as the kills will diminish.
---
Man that sounds interesting but one thing I dont get - considering theres not even a realm list yet, how would ppl know where to go? Or when the server names will show, who decides where to go? And for what reason? So many riddles...
---
I don‚Äôt understand how normal people will ever get into PvP when the tryhards will already be full raid geared and steamrolling BGs by the time they get to 60

---
It will certainly be a boost to their WoW results, however, it will be lesser than retail and despite this sub thinking otherwise, everything else would be fairly unreasonable. Only the hardcore fans will stick with classic longterm. Possibly a couple of people from retail will be carried over. But that's about it.
---
If old (non armored) mounts are available up until the recreation of patch 1.4, then yes it should be. If not well then we are out of luck.
---
It's funny how the first thing I see is \*-80 Intellect\*, since that's about the quality of this shitpost.
---
If you think it's going to be easier this time because you think everyone playing will be older I'm here to tell you that you are completely incorrect. Get ready to be stunned by people's commitment.
---
You should roll on a PVE Server.
---
This reads more like "I try to convince myself that PVP is better" then anything else.
---
Sadly my goal is to look like a clown because of BiS
---
Or if one of the dueler is an undead rogue. I believe the ally equivalent is night elf hunter.
---
my dream was to be a shaman with hand of rag but then i remembered that i could be a warrior with dark edge of insanity and i changed my tune real quick
---
They actually owe us everything. We are the people who made them
---
Found the pve dad gamer
---
this is the reason I may roll a paladin
---
You have way more gear options on warrior than warlock. 
---
Warlock is just limited to caster dps stuff like Mageblade and Staff of Shadow Flame.
---
Imo one of the best videos ever created by any classic wow content creator
---
&gt; What's funny is that you spell out in your post exactly why some people might have a problem with PvP servers.
---
100% my thoughts. Not so much for the logic of things but for the consequences. I don't want to end up on a realm where ultimately there'll be 10% alliance and 90% horde - or vice-versa. Everyone should play the game they enjoy it and that way it'll be good for everyone. No need for threads like this tbh.
---
Un‚ÄôGoro stone guardians and the elite giants at the gates of Uldum are two examples of elites that basically serve no purpose, no quest or drops are associated with them. I know Uldum was originally planned to be a dungeon or raid but I have no idea what those stone guardians are there for
---
Please let them be there! I really hope they are. Im going Troll Priest over UD so pls gib nice looking epic mount!
---
But being on a dominant faction where you cant rank is also no fun, and also makes people quit on the dominant faction too.
---
&gt; Its super fun at 60. World bosses, killing or getting killed on your way to raids, skrimishes, world defense, etc, it really binds a community together. But the frustration to get to that point just isn't for me.
---
Yep. World Bosses is the one and only thing that may change my decision to go and play PvE. I have no Idea how this is supposed to work. I believe back in the day whoever pulled first could take it. But on a wipe the second guild had "dibs". Debuffs of the world bosses kind of played into this but there were - as far as I can remember - no Debuffs on Kazzak and Azuregos, right?
---
My original realm in vanilla never became dominated by one faction despite the fierce wpvp. In fact is is still around 50-50% up to this day (ragnaros eu).
---
We want to be left alone but then comes along one of those PvP Server dudes and basically creates a justification threat for ganking low level players. Irony is on you dude...
---
Not to mention Shroud and others that have been sleeping on WoW for years, waiting for classic to return.
---
You're cute, you honestly believe there's going to be a Q3 release date? I wish I had this much faith...
---
On a more honest note though, considering we're not even in beta yet I honestly don't believe that a Q3 release is still on the table. If Blizzard is actually looking for feedback of all of the zones including endgame possibly including raids then a beta needs to be at least 3 months long.
---
This was pretty good. :)
---
Players are basically just sources of entropy feeding the mighty RNG.
---
His comment was accurate for most WoW players today. Most would not put up with vanilla mechanics and design. Classic will be wildly popular, but most of the player case won't play it. Quite a few might try it for a week, and go back to regular WoW.
---
But I do think Classic will change their future plans. I think it'll be such a great thing that they will honestly consider progression servers. So what Brack said, he was dumb to say it that way. But I know what he was thinking.
---
Why didn't he play at 9?
---
Took 5 years for OSRS and RS3 to split on Twitch. Hope this is done at launch for WoW/Classic
---
Yeah sounds about right. Got both rank 11 and 13 one time each and I remember after rank 10 is when you have to skip things irl to get further. So 10 should be possible while still having a life.
---
This made my penis move.
---
I subbed to BFA for a month shortly after launch. Managed to get from 100-120, do almost all of WoD (Tanaan) and Legion content, and do everything but mythic raiding in BFA.
---
Everything happened so fast. It felt like everything was just handed to me at all times. Nothing I ever did felt of any consequence. I didn't need to be more than a tiny bit decent at my class, I didn't need to farm anything, I didn't need to grind much. Everything was thrown at my face from start to finish.
---
The only things that took any amount of time were either bad RNG or really nasty time gates (azerite gear and world quests respectively). I never felt like I was moving forward. Even with higher raid difficulties, it was the same damn raid for the same damn gear, only this time, higher numbers.
---
***(literally shaking intensifies)*** **H*****e told me which game I wanted, h....how could he DO THAT?!?! I feel so violated, where is my Inn Space?***

Satire aside I think this is kind of unreasonable, he works in the videogame industry, gonna guess he makes a 6 figure income as well. His opinion on games isn't really the equivalent of Martha Stuart's opinion. It was obviously a critical 1 of a failure, but nevertheless no need to go pitchfork and torches.

Had the same set up and have the most fond memories in the game during those summer nights, doesn't get any better
---
MMOs have raised their monthly sub prices in a really long time. It's been 15 a month for years. That's with having to buy / rent more and more hardware, and hire bigger teams. If it was sent for all the other ways a game can make money, we would have seen monthly costs hit 20 or 25 probably.
---
I had to get between 1500 and 2000 HK's a day, week after week, to get rank 10 back in the day. It was ridiculous.
---
I guess it depends on the server.
---
Are you kidding? Retail hardly gets any viewers. Asmongold and soda will be way more than enough to outweigh retail alone. On top of that even people like shroud will play classic which he said he'll play a lot. Ton of other big streamers were former wow players. Even other big streamers who haven't played wow or vanilla will try it out cause of hype and all their peers are playing. It will absolutely crush retail for a long time.

Why would you do that
---
I still remember the time I went up against an ally premade in wsg who had a warrior wielding Might of Menethil. Some say he's still one shotting clothies in wsg to this day.
---
Just had the one account and one computer. He had alts, but my raiding guild dominated most of the playing time lol.
---
Well damn that almost makes me wanna roll a rogue. What gear/weapons are those?
---
Damn I forgot about that man. The good old days.
---
2000 HKs a day? What the fuuuuck

I've upvoted every single one of these. Great thread, OP.

**My only Goal in classic is to get the cyan pvp set**

Good news, Infra's [1.13 Classic Mage Leveling Spells Guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit?rm=minimal#gid=916278063) shits on all of these that have been coming out for the past few weeks and it does exactly what you're asking for. Red = skip, orange = optional.
---
The memes are getting worse and worse every single day.
---
I feel you. It was much easier before the mythic race shit.
---
I feel like they are really on the edge of something great, especially if they later do some form of progression servers. But it can definitely be mishandled.
---
I feel like EQ somewhat messed up in creating so many progression servers of varying timelines and rulesets. It makes merging them harder. They just keep starting new servers, depleting the populations of the previous ones. If Blizzard does progression servers, they should keep merging / server glut in mind. There's a way to do it properly.

Hey what's up? My name is Ryan aka **WiFiCannibal**. I've been a pretty hardcore gamer since 2003/2004 where I ranked **17 out of 10,000** players in a weekly ranking system for Gears of War. I've been playing MMORPG games **since 1998** when I first played Ultima Online. I instantly fell in love with the concept of the sheer scale of the game. I also first played Diablo with my brother around this time, I later went on to play Diablo 2 pretty seriously. I'm not sure if you're familiar with D2 ubers but I was able to solo all 4 Uber bosses **solo in 49 seconds** on my smiterdin.
---
I've lead numerous clans, some of the most fun I've had was leading an organized PvP squad in DayZ and ARMA. I've also lead a clan in ARK. My most accomplished clan was the guild I created in World of Warcraft during WotLK. The guild was name Trade Chat and our server was Smolderthorn. **I personally lead a 233 man raid on EK with just my guild mates.**
---
When Classic WoW releases my goal this time around is to join a guild with clear purpose and intent. I want to follow leadership that knows the raid content very well. I have always been a pretty hard core gamer and **I fully intend on going pretty hard in the paint**. Eventually, I'd like to be able to find myself in an officer/leadership position as leadership and communication are two things I thoroughly enjoy.
---
I love PvP and I love knowing that if I put in the time, effort, and dedication into raiding I can help my guild achieve greatness in world PvP and battlegrounds. **I want to join a guild that has experience ranking highly in PvP** as I'll be scheduling some time off work to grind as much as I can.
---
*To sum it up, I really love community based games and I'm really hyped for Classic WoW bringing that feeling back. I want to find leadership I can learn from and a pretty hardcore PvP mentor. By proving myself eventually I'd like to be able to lead my own PvP squad or have an officer position as I greatly enjoy those roles.*
---
My time zone is EST. My availability as of right now is **all day Monday and Tuesday for raiding** but I can change my days off if needed. On non-raid days I'll most likely be on about 4-5 hours per day either grinding consumables for my class type or grinding something else as I find the grind incredibly soothing. My understanding of the raid content is abysmal at best but as my boss once told me, **"Steps and instructions can be taught, a good personality and willingness to follow directions cannot be taught."**. So with good leadership, I believe I'll be a perfect match for any guild looking for someone like myself. 
---
**My class choices so far are;**
---
1) Mage
---
2) Rogue
---
3) Priest
---
***I'd be willing to pick a class out of these 3 based on what the guild needs but just keep in mind my ultimate end game goal is to destroy the enemy faction, so I want to be a part of heavily PvP focused guild and have a really good end game experience for PvP.***
---
If this sounds like your guild, message me back and we can chat some more. Anyways I hope everyone is hyped for Classic WoW just as much as I am! 
---
***For the Horde!***

I mean a druidic language isn't a thing in warcraft lore.
---
Didnt feel like ¬´starting over again¬ª after all the amount of hours i spent getting the gear I had at that point.
---
He's not coming up with anything he's just speculating/questioning.
---
half of my mind is screaming "You got this, go for Rank 14" and the other half of me is screaming "Your literally preparing yourself to waste the next few years of your life. Your 22, grow up"
---
I was considering streaming my R14 and 5 level 60 journey..
---
I'll just link it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bk0u4h/classic_wow_reconfirmed_summer_release/eme2qfx/
---
It's interesting to see that you view it as starting over again, I always viewed it as further progressing through new content.
---
I'm a feral Druid so none :(
---
The times when nobody cared that T2 Rouge shoulder pieces where not BiS at any point in time. Good'ol days.
---
I had full T0 as hunter when I joined my vanilla raiding guild. Good thing damage meters weren't a thing that time.
---
How do the druids speak to each other in the cenarion circle, then? Do the nelfs and tauren in Moonglade just make hand gestures at each other?
---
I had 120 days ingame time, I guess thats why! Got tired of the grind. Will return as a casual for classic.
---
Look up npcs on classic.db and sort the levels out and click on each npc and it will say if theiyre part of a quest objective or not. Off the top of my head, theres gnolls in south eastern westfall that are part of quest but most will probably finish the quest on lower level gnolls. Theres the wolves on the island in feralas. Bunch in aszhara cause like someone else mentioned its an unfinished zone. Theres coyotes in badkands. Highland mobs throughout wetlands and arathi. Some of these may be part of a quest but usually a decent amount to grind oj with not too much competition.
---
It makes sense, it does feel like starting over in terms of gear when you go from purples back to greens, I've just personally never looked at it that way so thought it was a neat viewpoint
---
I feel ya.. yada yada on the #no changes and for a majority I agree with the philosophy of the hashtag.... coming from someone whose main was a rogue and close 2nd alt(always max level as well as the rogue  after vanilla) I always longed to make a Druid because I loved the groups of people who played one.. back then I was alone and I played according to how I felt about others and wanted to either be alone or not be apart of things(hence rogue main).... This time around I want to have that stealth QOL but I‚Äôm not rolling a Druid to try and be a tank or a moonkin.. I want to be of as much use to my fellow horde soldiers as possible... I‚Äôll go HotW until BGs come in on phase 2 and I have my eng ready for it... I‚Äôm not someone who actually cares that much about doing PvE content because I‚Äôve been trying to fill the void that early PvP wow left for me... I can‚Äôt wait to master a class to the point where I‚Äôm next to unkillable while I‚Äôm helping out other around me in the process... IRL I am someone who is a utility worker to make other people‚Äôs jobs easier and better and I actually think it‚Äôs fun to be able to predict what people need before they know they need it.(obviously if you read this I work in the hospitality career.)
---
I don't believe my opinion is more important than others, but I have a feeling that letting the players decide what they want is how you end up with Modern WoW as it stands today.. leveling was too long and they shortened it, catch up mechanics were made to shorten the grind. Have you noticed every single class has the exact same abilities with a different name? Everyone has a stun, a silence, a charge (Dash, Fel Rush, Blink etc) it just goes on..
---
Not saying i'd make a better decision, I just agree that the playerbase really doesn't know what it wants, or at very least everyone wants things quite differently..
---
I'd be quite happy WoW Classic continuing until the endgame LK. If I could relive those years from start again i'll be happy with what Blizzard has done.
---
I'll be highly dissappointed if I never get to see TBC again though, as I was about 14 when it released and never got to raid properly.
---
If it was how it was in Vanilla, it'll be the same in Classic. They are using 1.12 data and I doubt they'll go in and fix things by hand. (Although they *might* if it is brought to their attention later, as it can be considered a bug. Or they might not, exactly because this is how it was in Vanilla and it's not game breaking.)
---
You can reference Infra's [Mage Leveling Spells List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uCXQni8Ndf0RuKfgNUlQ_jzfKIYmsCVuYXS_P3OaKUY/edit?rm=minimal#gid=916278063) since it does exactly what you're asking for. Red = skip. Orange = optional.
---
What he said!
---
BC certainly was the best time of the game as far as raiding content is concerned. Classic was the best state of the game itself, however. 
---
While I do believe that TBC would be quite a success, too, I feel that anything after that would see a significant decline in player numbers. 
---
We can not forget that we're all adults and as much as we'd like to go all out on WoW again, truth is: most of us won't be able to give as much time anymore (at least I would hope that it's this way). Furthermore, any Progression Server would be AT LEAST 2022 and who knows what the gaming market is gonna be like 3 years from now :D
---
&gt; I know we are definitely getting some  
---
How do you know ?
---
It seems whenever I'm a healer my team won't go near theirs, but they come straight for me. Every time!
---
I can't see into the future BUT I was making 10g per vendor run in my mid-40s skinning and vendoring Heavy Leather + grays. Goldthorn and Fadeleaf are also mid-lvl Herbs that are heavily used in Alchemy for certain potions. The server i'm on a single Fadeleaf is 1.5g and Goldthorn is 1.3g - my character is lvl 53 and I have 250g saved up after spending a lot too.
---
"played" vanilla and did AQ/BWL but couldnt figure out how to screen shot.
---
100% a private server.
---
I don't PvP but found Fire Blast is extra useful even for Frost, once you get Clearcasting I use it to insta-cast and get back to Frostbolting. Its more damage and works better then another 2s cast for the same or less damage.
---
I had loads of sceenshots, but all deleted from old computer. Can give you a screenshot from ingame with my /played later. I still have the account and this char as level 62.
---
A think the opposite. Quite a lot will try for a week, fall in love and stay.
---
OP was forced to decide vacation days after waiting as long as possible in hopes of getting a release date first.
---
Now that he locked in the vacation it would be highly ironic for him/her if the release date is announced tomorrow. Like how it rains the one day you didn't bring an umbrella.
---
Even if I'm only able to play rarely, like once a fortnight after the initial couple of months, I'll probably keep the sub for when I 'just feel like it'. It's not a big expense.
---
Lol I can‚Äôt wait until hordies can‚Äôt make a lv 1 ally character to throw salt at me after I shut down their epic gank twink 
---
Real classic pvp servers = no dual faction realm accounts :)
---
Pservers have nerfed farm spots. BRD and DM in particular. So I doubt it is easier to farm money there.
---
When TBC start all epic gears turns into a pumpkin, when all quest green was way better. This pissed me off.
---
The best feeling is when I turn the tables on a red-is-dead (I‚Äôm a neutral/protector), then kill him again, and he does a /sorry or /talk at me then I /nod and we have a mutual understanding. game recognize game.
---
I remember the day I hit high warlord like it was yesterday.  I logged off instantly after buying my weapon and didn‚Äôt play for nearly a month.  That grind is seriously something else.
---
So true
---
Shadow is a God in PvP but what about offensive Holy or Disc builds? Do they exist? Inner Deus Vult is rising and I love the ability to heal in PvE content but I'm all about killing every living soul in PvP.
---
I do agree with the spirit of your post and this is also the reason why I quit current WoW after a 3 year long gig with an amazing guild. I do want to do stuff that I remember. Especially for BfA, that just wasn't the case. We cleared uldir and honestly aside from MOTHER, nothing in there is memorable.
---
**BUT**
---
&gt; But I have absolutely no desire in doing so because I've seen the content. All I get is more item level.
---
The primary drive in raiding are the encounter mechanics. The jump from normal to heroic is decent and you do have to pull more tricks to complete the content there. It's actually not a bad model overall as you work your way up gradually to a difficulty level you have to expend your maximum skill at. For me personally it was mid-mythic. For others it was mythic clear. For others it was heroic clear.
---
It's satisfying surviving encounters that get increasingly difficult and learning more and more mechanics. In one of my previous posts I made a pretty apt comparison between raiding in Vanilla/Classic and raiding in current WoW:
---
* Vanila/Classic -&gt; Ballett
---
* Current WoW -&gt; Hip Hop Battle
---
Both require a different combination of team and individual skills. Both are similarly satisfying (to me). But for me personally, raiding is the **only** thing I like in current WoW. Everything else feels very lifeless. In Vanilla/Classic I do like that you feel more part of a world. It *feels* more alive. Items you aquire *feel* like a human sat down and thought about it. Quests *feel* like more organic and less "hub-based".
---
So my hat is pretty much in the Classic ring. And even though I thought I would clamor for Classic TBC, I slowly realize that it's probably not what I want after all for a few reasons.
---
I'm rambling.
---
tl;dr: Current WoW has good raiding and higher difficulities feel satisfying.
---
Current WoW has a pretty low skill floor. You can complete all content without even fully understanding what your class/spec should do. LFR and normal dungeons are very easy and still give you the full lore package.
---
If that's how you want to play, just do it! It's a game, so you should do whatever is fun for you.
---
You don't need good equip for leveling as a hunter, your pet does most of the work for you. I guess when you're getting a new gun every 10 lvls from the AH you should be fine :-)
---
To my knowledge it had something to do with the amount of people participating in PvP/Ranking.
---
Only a set amount of % players could gain a certain rank. rank 14 was like the top 1% or 0.5% of players, calculated by the amount of honour they got that week.
---
So the more people were PvP'ing, the harder it got to rank up.
---
Play al'akir shaman back then. Mostly duels outside OG. I remember seeing Lylz, server first r14 shaman. 
---
I even beat him in a duel with my cap blues. Outlasted him with my shield and rank 1 lightning shields I tricked him into purging. Took 5 minutes. This was back when r13-14 weapons and gear had poor stats. I was so proud. He was not pleased, but I denied him a reduel üòÇ
---
 I remember Klauz the rogue too and the warlock from the guild Karnival that made the enemy cast bar mod we've all been using on vanilla servers for all these years.
---
We‚Äôll see how bad it is when we get there...
---
Blizzard might be against this since it would lower the ranks of both channels instead of having one channel that is in the top 10 all the time.
---
No need to feed the trolls. I believe you, but some people just need to be grumpy every once in a while :)
---
Could this be used for a rogue, I wonder.
---
Hey its me ur boss, I need you to come in on WoW Classics release - I have a wedding planned for the following month. Sorry!
---
People really underestimate the PvP grind.  When I did r14 it was 16-18 hours every day for months.  If you miss a day you‚Äôre fucked.
---
Yeah but the fee is both for retail and classic so there will be people that will try both for the first time, or maybe they will play one full time and the other one some time. The smart move is to make the same for both, at least I think it is so
---
Runescape requires zero fast twitch reactions or situational awareness. The 30yo won't be that efficient or good in pvp in wow. Well they can be, but in lesser effect that in runescape.
---
Well I was basing it off how wildly popular the EverQuest progression servers have been, compared to their regular live servers. It's certainly an older crowd, with kids and jobs. But people also Glock to their free fast-XP server, for the trip down nostalgia lane. I assume and Blizzard progression servers would get the same casual tourists, not really interested in heavy raiding.
---
You are right in that some later expansions wouldn't attract as many. I feel like WoLTK would do good.
---
My step-father used to criticize me for playing WoW and then we found out he was heavily addicted to a Pay2Win Browser MMO-RPG... I remember mentioning "at least with WoW the person who puts in the most time gets the most out of it - when you try to top a leaderboard its just a tally of who spent the most money"
---
He dropped thousands of dollars trying to stay in the Top 10 which was hilarious when you realize how P2W the game was.
---
I embrace the descent into madness.
---
Pretty poor excuse for someone to not do a raid. Might aswell never raid ever because you know you'll get better gear as you level. Keep telling yourself thats the reason you didn't raid it.
---
Yeah, 1.12 is the last patch before TBC prepatch.
---
Maladath or Ravencrest's Legacy?
---
I don't understand this. Retail characters are for nothing too, especially Classic.
---
Man, that's just really unfortunate, I'm really sorry man... I'm sure people don't notice if you don't speak for more than a few minutes :)
---
On the contrary in my case - when I was a kid I didn't have free time at all. Strict parents made sure I wasn't spending time on "bullshit" and filled it with various "useful" extra activities. 
---
Now I am adult and master of my own time. Back then I could bite but a bit, now I can feast.
---
Maladath
---
Thats how most people view it, but relative to everyone else, he's starting over. He would have had much better gear than most of the server and once TBC launched anyone who stepped into the Dark Portal would've had much much better gear than that. I suppose he looked at it as all his hard work down the toilet.
---
I think thats kind of stupid , but I understand it.
---
Wotlk was dog shit
---
Rank 14 was actually 0.1%
---
I won't jump in, unless my side is losing :P
---
It's possible that your experience was bad because of too many players on the server. I don't know how many players there were on the server you tried, but some PS have 3 times the players compared to vanilla servers. 
---
Back in vanilla STV-pvp battles which I experienced were all lvl 30-40 players and usually there were only a few players from each faction. Only once I saw 10 from each side and that was super fun probably because it was so rare. And that pvp was fun because it lasts a while and then stops and you can continue doing other stuff.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Rank 13 Shaman set is better.
---
It's easy enough that you can do it without premading. I wouldn't recommend ranking at all without premading but rank 10 should be doable. 
---
Of course it also depends on how many players PvP on the server. There will probably be more people who understand the ranking system and therefore will play more. On the other hand many players will be older and might not have several hours every day to pursue a rank. On Nost I did rank 10 and it definitely required premading, but that's with 12k online and 250k unique logins every week. That's like 4-5 vanilla servers.
---
Ultimately just try it out. Go for rank 6 and see how that works with your playtime and if you can get into premades. Also think about if the PvP gear is even worth anything to you. For healers there's little to find in the ranking gear and more to find with the reputation factions, especially AV with the amazing offhand.
---
You are wrong in the regard to world bosses. Back then my server, lightning‚Äôs blade us. Ally controlled 90% of the world bosses, so yea, faction domination matters. 
---
And my raid group, controlled 90% of the 90% ally kills. Because we were a collection of guilds and raid groups which went up to 10ish i remember, each with around 60-80 players. I remember getting benched all the time caused i wasn‚Äôt in the inner circle of group1. Good times.
---
Just subbed to you on artstation. Man you have some lovely work, keep it up!
---
I hate to break this to you, but however much time you have to level each day and however good/fast you are at leveling.... there are so many many many players that are faster and have nothing else to do but play WoW 16 hours a day rushing to 60. 
---
Even if you rush it, you're gonna get camped by 60's by the time you hit STV.
---
Love it dude. Makes me think there‚Äôs a magic lamp after defeating C‚Äôthun

Subs have never been per battle.net account, it‚Äôs 1 per in-game account

They probably make way more money with retail WoW. People buy mounts and pets constantly.

Bro, you are severely underestimating the grind. I guarantee you have more fulfilling things to do outside the game than grind rank 14. Like the poster above said, rank 10 is attainable with "normal" amounts of playtime per week, but rank 14 is straight up an unhealthy amount of grind. outside of account sharing, there is no way to achieve rank 14 without seriously sacrificing other aspects of your life. It is seriously not a goal a *functioning* adult can achieve.
---
Every healing class is a hybrid because you have to have at least some form of dps spec. Ret for instance does great dps in PvP and dungeons, they just fall behind in raids because they have no mana. So Blizzard basically designed a few healers and slapped some dps/tanking specs on. 
---
The warrior is interesting because it's both the best tank and dps in the game, which makes them very overpowered imo.
---
I see with you are saying but tbh my understanding of hybrid tax is the class that can do all 3 roles. Not just 2. 
---
So its druid and paladin affected and not warrior, priest shaman. 
---
Which explains why the warrior remains strong and the priest the best healer.
---
I dslike whinging as much the next fellow, but I get where they're coming from. Once you're level 60, PvP realms are really great. Fighting over resource nods, World Bosses, ganking raiders on their way to MC, skirmishes, world defense, etc. Its all great stuff.
---
However the grind to that is frustrating. I totally understand why someone would want to bitch about having to log off, play on an alt, or hope that the other zone for their level range doesn't have a 60 Rogue NEET just murdering everyone with zero effort.
---
My team is warrior priest. When your priest knows his shit / did high-tank pvp before / is a dispelling champ you‚Äôre pretty much juggernaut mode 24/7 and can take on ppl 10 levels higher or win in 2v3 2v4 ganks
---
Yeah, because a multi billion company is making decisions based on people's NAGGING...not the potential financial income.
---
People like you are utterly dumb. Blizzard didn't gave a flying fuck on people's nagging, and every single time they said a big fat NO to Vanilla...until Nostalrius data proved that Vanilla had massive financial potential. After that, all those big fat NO's suddenly became a big fat YES. Not even a maybe...no, a solid YES.
---
Try using your brain man.
---
We don't get Vanilla because of people's nagging...we get it because it's a fucking money making machine for Blizzard.
---
its one of the things that wow changed and not rly thought about it, making tauren to be able to be druids is the first spacegoat change we ever had ;)
---
Atlas second edition is vanilla only. I have it right here.
---
Wasn‚Äôt there some guy on a RP server who held it for almost a year lol
---
Exactly, your first mistake was implying i‚Äôm a functioning adult! Your talking to a person who played something like 200 competitive OW games in 4 days, i‚Äôm self-employed and currently underemployed so I work about 3-4 half-days a week. The rest of my time is spent idle anyway!
---
The client is a modern client so the way it renders graphics has nothing to do with 1.12 data.
---
1.12 data are quests, items, NPC location, damages calculations etc.
---
See by yourself what hybrid classes were :  
---
http://web.archive.org/web/20061218073000/http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/classes/;jsessionid=09659C3602D70CE0F9F569461FCFC003.app01  
---
Basically, they could do "everything" : heal, physical/magic DPS, tank.  
---
Are shamans able to tank ? Well, they were supposed to, until Blizzard decide otherwize midway.
---
I think the idea here is diffrent, if a warri gos tank he cant rly dps and if he gos dps he cant rly tank (jea i know fury tank is a thing but i am talking about the idea here).
---
These typical hybrit class can heal as a DD specc and have good support, i think from a designe standpoint that where the idea came from, if they can still heal abit they cant do good dps because they could fit "two" roles at once heal abit and do DPS or DPS abit and Heal, ofc thats not how the game is played.
---
Defias leather all the way
---
I'm pretty sure that's nonsense. Complexity of combat is entirely unrelated to whether it's an RPG or not, you can have an RPG where you do nothing but auto attack ever or a complex system of wizardry where you create you own spells and they're both RPGs.
---
Yes and I also had a warrior alt with 5 x T2 and rest T1. So I had 2 high end chars that went from heros to zeros in one day:p
---
RP!
---
The YouTube channel you linked has a dozen videos and one that speaks specifically about locks ...
---
Nope. It has everything to do with 1.12 data. The Classic client and retail client share a codebase but they are not the same (obviously).
---
Data includes all the world geometry, models, animations, textures and yes, item attachment points on player models too.
---
i miss the Defias set :/
---
epic
---
I'd say a fury dps warrior can tank a lot better than a resto druid or holy paladin can. 
---
But yes classes like the druid, paladin and shaman are designed to be jack of all trades. I do think it's unbalanced if the hybrids can do more than one role. I think it's pretty cool how it is now where all the hybrids can heal while their other specs give them some very unique capabilities, just not the dps that a pure class would get.
---
As an alliance i have to admit that these sets were very intimidating to me since I am not that good in pvp. But hell i wanna see these again :)
---
I feel bad for raiding Alliance priests. You either have to be a stubby ugly Dwarf, or forever be sub-optimal in a way that isn't a small minute buff.
---
In leveling sure but there isn't any really good guns later in raids, mostly just crossbows n bows unfortunately
---
I've raided BWL near enough every week for 3 years on private servers and I've only seen one Maladath drop. I've seen more Thunderfuries being built than Maladaths dropped. It really does feel like the shit loot has a higher drop chance on those servers.
---
I had full Ten Storms in classic and honestly it was utter garbage compared to my other gear. But fuck it looked good.
---
Forgive me, I would hate to try and tell someone else how to enjoy the game. I think, however,  that you may find the rank 14 grind to be hollow and soul-crushing. There may be better activities to spend your time on, even within the World of Warcraft. That being said, there is something about being the top of the ladder. If that's your game, so be it.
---
Not really some naxx gear was better than Kara loot, and I remember a trinket for druids and tf being bis the whole bc.
---
I'm still torn on which healer I'm going to pick. Shaman seems like the prettiest girl at the ball. Priest seems like fast leveling versatile healer. Paladin seems like a glorified HoT for the tank, but I like that for some reason.
---
Druid seems more fun to go through the world as, but aren't really very good in PvE raids. Or at least not highly demanded.

---
Being good at pvp to the level you are talking about and being good at attaining ranks in vanilla are two different skillsets.  Also being 30, I resemale your statement
---
If you can come on time and be prepared then you should not join a casual guild where others are not expected to do the same.
---
Yes you lose progression.
---
Haha your all good my man, I think the intelligent side of my brain wants me to enrol for University next month - if I get in I will not be securing any ranks unfortunately! 
---
The question is, would I rather be R14 or become a rockstar :P 
---
Both equally acceptable.
---
So i should go enchanting first and then swap after I got the trinket
---
I get that, but you definitely won't be as efficient as someone who really knows his class and other classes and has amazing pvp skills and knowledge. He will kill fast and will get into premades easier and thus gaining ranks faster. In runescape this effect is less, because the skill ceiling is so much lower.
---
Yes it can, Kodo hide bags I believe they are called. Only availible from Camp Taurajo recipe, but thats the only bag that leatherworking can create.
---
All that Hybrid Tax is just a one big BS.
---
Usual argument is: ‚ÄúWho will play pure DPS if hybrids will do similar damage? Everyone will play hybrids!‚Äù
---
Then TBC and WotLK came, hybrids got their problems solved, but people still played pure DPS classes a lot.
---
Every expansion felt that way due to that reason. Everything was pretty null by the time next came.  Spent soo much time to have shit scaling ruin it all.
---
So what you are saying is, basically: I want to abuse power over others who can not fight back.
---
People who play pvp servers are very high on the non-agreeable and narcissm end of the personality model. Some psychologist should really do a study about that topic.
---
However. Most of the complaints come from private servers, where people who don¬¥t want to do open pvp just have to swallow the unfair shitfest that is open world pvp in 99% of the time.
---
I know exactly what you mean - I ground Alterac Valley for weeks to get my "Unstoppable Force" - it wasn't the "bis", but it was what I wanted, it had the name, and it looked cool as heck.  It meant something, and I may, in a year or so, do it all again.
---
Assuming he got vanilla when it first dropped (November 21, 2004), and quit the day before TBC dropped (Jan 16, 2007), he played roughly 4 hours a day for 26 months straight
---
What else is bis for rogue then, during MC and BWL?
---
Man ten storms is iconic to shaman and Orc religion. It is now used by Raeghar in HOTS. I love that set I have a shaman in retail with full set of that.
---
cyanaintblue man
---
Lol
---
Actually I'm not sure what happened to him but he was at least stuck there. He either jumped and died or had to HS
---
And wow tokens for gold now that they've made it harder to make gold in game.
---
Truestrike Shoulders? Not sure.
---
Don't know if it's the best, because that is a fairly ambiguous term. But if you want to make your own gear, you'll be running around in devilsaur leather for the better part of until AQ/Naxx. So if you can get your hands on some, then tribal leatherworking would be the way to go.
---
The BiS helmet is the one from a lvl 40 Druid quest which restores energy when shapeshifting.
---
I know that they are pre raid bis. But iirc, all bis lists I've seen said t1 and t2 shoulders become bis, of available.
---
hello ancient frostsaber ?
---
I sure blizz art sector literaly ran out of ideas.
---
T20 is the best:

---
I still have my retail boxes for Original, TBC and WoTLK - I'm going to dig out the original box, and place it under my monitor for launch.
---
Sad, but necessary.
---
 [http://wowclassicbis.com/](http://wowclassicbis.com/) 
---
here you can check what is BIS for all classes, specs and in which time frame.
---
I quit shortly after TBC launch for the same reasons.  Ended up playing guild wars for quite a long time.  I did come back here and there in the middle of TBC and Wrath, but things never did really measure up.
---
It‚Äôs only been 4 days?... damn...
---
There's no zeppelin to tb in vanilla. That's why I guess.
---
Ain't that from tribal leatherworking?
---
The actual crafting cost compared to material cost is negligible for devilsaur set
---
Thanks, I've been looking for this side, but couldn't find it right now. So t1 stays bis for quite some time.
---
Well 2% parry is not PvE. I don't know if True Strike or T1 was  better.
---
Another reply posted the website I was looking for, which compiles the bis for each phase ... T1 shoulders are bis for quite some time
---
I have determined the perfect build for you https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0drwGMMRbrZr
---
I'm of the opinion that Classic will do reasonably well. I honestly think it should be able to retain at least 200k subs past the initial 3 month "honeymoon" period. Is 500k+ completely out of the question? Not at all. I'm actually quite curious how this will all pan out. I find it ironic how much hate Classic gets from sites that report on it. It's like this weird form of an insult to certain people for some peculiar reason and it's not only coming from current retail players either. Not sure why so many people have such a negative opinion of it to be honest. As much as I love TBC, we're talking my favorite game ever and I've been gaming since Coleco and the Atari 2600, Classic is still a blast and definitely in my top 10
---
This was my dream when Classic was out. I used to tell my girlfriend ‚Äúone day I‚Äôll get a job at an unpopular hotel and just grind wow‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre literally living my 19yo self‚Äôs dream. You fucker.
---
If think T1 did. But T2 shoulders where pretty crappy compared to most of the set.
---
While leveling yes.  I used guns until I got Rhok'Delar in vanilla.  In large part due to being an engineer(and dwarf) and making my own bullets.
---
Yea I'm rolling a troll mage so I hope it woll be there.
---
Don't forget about Google Videos! I remember using that before Youtube
---
After getting level 40 on my first char in 2005/2006-ish, I decided to do a little experiment. As a guy, I created a female character and decided to... basically roleplay as a girl, since I did not actively see many girls at the time (note: I was 13 at the time). I started my level 1 human and I started to kill the wolves. I did not even hit level 2 and a level 60 came running towards me and started talking to me. Not even 10 seconds after he heard I was indeed a girl, he opened the trade window and I got 500g from him for free. For absolutely no reason. We talked a little more while I was hitting wolves and after a few minutes, he just left.
---
At first my child brain thought, "so this happens when girls play WoW", only to hear later that that was not the standard for women.
---
That f\*cking banana..lost it
---
Majority of the sub doesnt understand the problem, expect downvotes from all the retail sheep too. God's work man, youre doing God's work.
---
How in the world did you get to join a normal raid just 3 days into level 120?
---
Yeah, many titans of PvP on that server. Lylz was guildmaster of Darkstorm I believe. Also there was Grim, Zalgradis, Ahzgaz etc. Good times.
---
Why not just spend 6-10 years in college? Why graduate in 3 or 4. You spend the majority of your life working at your job anyway. That‚Äôs what matters most. Just enjoy college and stay there spending time and money for years. It‚Äôs what I think you should do because ultimately I want to tell you to slow down because I‚Äôm feeling a bit insecure and underprepared. 
---
Right?
---
Trying to level up with hundreds of people ready to steal you quest mob is far worse trust me
---
NINTENDO

Paladins can remove poison, magic and diseases. Hunters can still easily beat them if you‚Äôre allowed to kite though

Yup. Before WoW only Nelf males could be druids. No female Druids at all

I was that little brother watching my big bro play vanilla when I was 6 years old, man just watching that was magical and the nostalgia I get is huge from it.
---
We both know he didnt start on exactly day 1, and most likely had some days off aswell. So the hours/day avg is likely higher.
---
very cringy
---
Wasn't r14 just 1 guy on each side with the highest title?
---
Leveling on a fresh server you will not get fiery enchant. It‚Äôs a drop off a rarespwn in BRD, that I doubt people will farm heavily for when first hitting 60.
---
Hi, /u/Stillow
---
What class is that T16 even for? :-S
---
Try to go in with a positive mindset. When you precieve something as being toxic you start subconsciously looking for signs that validate your thinking. That‚Äôs human nature. If you think everything is toxic the few examples will stick out to you even more. Also it has to be kept in mind that text is only one part of social interaction that lacks things like tone of voice and body language. So something that is not meant negative can be understood as negative by people just because their first instinct tells them it is (or their mind tries to validate its opinions). 
---
It‚Äôs the same reason why in retail everybody is on edge and acts a lot like a cornered snake, while they are in fact never have been. 
---
Nobody is save from that, even if you get into the habit of questioning your own judgement of an interaction.
---
This is absolutely insane. I knew it was a huge grind but at this state it isn't even grind anymore, it's something else entirely.
---
Gg for your rank 14 though, now that's a fucking achievement. I hope it didn't cost you too much.
---
Someone ran a red light and t-boned my car which left me bedbound for 8 months so I had nothing else to do but grind BGs.  I would never, ever do that grind again though.  It legit starts fucking with your head after a while.
---
That was me and my brother too, except during TBC. I remember watching him run Kara and wanting so bad to get to do it, but only got to level 50. Now we‚Äôre planning out how we‚Äôre gonna play classic. We‚Äôre in different states and on different schedules but we‚Äôre gonna make sure it works out. :)
---
You can still get the transmog in retail! I use it all the time.
---
Yes its nice. Grinded for rank11 on my warrior back in the day. I spent a lot of time on it, but I was lucky to be in Grp with several ppl grinding for r14. We did not loose a lot, made the thing easier
---

---
I haven‚Äôt missed anything. Have you seen how they ruined 3 popular franchises with loyal fan bases in a decade? That takes skill to pull off.
---
The company is rotten to the core now. I want to believe they‚Äôve changed, but for now it‚Äôs only sounding positive because finance and marketing haven‚Äôt got involved.
---
Give it a year.
---
Yeah right cause the red from T2 is also very stealthy
---
 you're lucky. I don't think I can get my older brother to play it with me, even though he showed me wow to begin with
---
so much this! he is also right for most wow players. we(classic MMO fans) are a community within a community and i bet my ass a lot retail players will try out classic and chicken out after playing arround for a bit, because it takes to long etc. (not in a bad way, it's just a different game)
---
&gt; ilvl 80, untransmoggable rarity
---
Clearly this weapon is vendor trash. Sells for 6 lvl 110 boosts though, neat.
---
that head is BOE
---
100% agree, my only fear is to have a streamer and all his fanboy in the faction of the same serveur.
---
Horde warlocks will usually get no support. They might get tranquil air (reduce threat) if there are enough shaman, and maybe mana spring totem. Basically they might get a worse salvation and wisdom buffs, and nothing similar to kings. I guess if they have a shaman they‚Äôd also likely get tremor totem for fear based fights, although most can be outranked anyway
---
Good thing we're typing. Kek
---
Nice to know you woke up this morning thinking about me baby.
---
Transmig was the downfall of wow.  The game is no longer about raiding / pvping for the best gear to show off your commitment, but gathering old content gear to make yourself look pretty.
---
I'm personally all about those golden alliance shoulders. As for pets I just used whatever the newest OP shit was. I initially used BT. I actually spent a little time as Beast Master before the talent rework because Spirit Bond was bugged. The bug let you stack all 3 ranks of SB so with BT's attack speed you could basically out heal anyone in a 1v1. It was super fun shitting on everyone in duels but you were basically useless outside of that.
---
I still used BT a lot even as a MM hunter.
---
When people discovered the Bat with screeching howl I used that for a short time. I think it was from ZG and it may have even had the same attack speed as BT.
---
The only other pet I used was the AV wolf for Furious Howl.
---
Yo, did you listen to the podcast I did for Countdown to Classic?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRhXiL8XZKE
---
That rogue derives all his power from his urethra.
---
The trinket only requires the skill to make it, not to wear it, so you can make it, then drop enchanting and still use it,
---
I just hope all the major streamers are on one server, so we all can easily avoid them. ;)
---
Always double the time if it's a dumb elf, that's the rule.
---
Yes I agree, just saying if you miss the look it‚Äôs still attainable for anyone that still plays.
---
10 chars per realm wasn't really a blue post, not like the others. Someone asked a question and an employee gave some clarification. Nothing like the long-winded design philosophy posts.
---
If You want to play Horde (Tauren) then herbalism+alch will be a good choice since Taurens have +15 herbalism racial bonus. Also, You don't have to be a leatherworker to get the Wolfshead Helm since it's a BoE item. You will be able to buy it on the AH and it shouldn't cost much because the mats are not expensive.
---
Used Moonglade teleport probably
---
you are wrong. the classic models we will get are not the same ones from vanilla. Theyre using a different skeleton from wotlk+ because for a lot of people it's much smoother that way and i guess its hard to recreate the old models exactly as they were. (Models dont clip between spells, no moonwalking or other small glitches that were due to the real old models ''skeletons'')
---
Teleport UC and TB have switched level requirements on that list.
---
The problem is not the rank, is HOW TO GET TO THAT RANK. On Nostalrius there were all kind of shit going on to rank up. Arathi and WSG were 24/7 rank 12-13 premades. At the end premades were trading wins. I just gone afk for 2 months and when i came back i was rank 11, from there was impossible to go further, honor needed was more then 1 milion per week, i had millions of ally kills. There is a lot of MAFIA both in pvp and pve farming in vanilla. After few months from launch doing bgs as casual will be impossible.  As a casual, solo player, expect to stay at graveyards the whole time just to get you mark as quick as possible.
---
ü§° &lt;-- that's you
---
ye right, as if t2.5 for rogues looks stealthy af. 
---
Srsly, i feel like getting whatever shitpost with "bad retail" in it is easy karma on this subreddit and people simply abuse it.
---
*Yes, but we need to shit on anything not vanilla so facts don't matter.*
---
As a strictly Vanilla player, I think TBC ruined WoW more than Wrath. Everyone who says Wrath killed WoW must've started when TBC came out.
---
an expansion also takes a lot more man hours to develop, update, and maintain than classic wow
---
Your ONLY fear? If you from EU region you also should worry about ending up on a Non-English speaking community server.
---
From where do you get this? :D It's completely wrong. (They are not "recreating" anything.)

Iirc t2 shoulders became bis when you get the 8 pc bonus, at least thats how it was on Anathema at the time. Although that easily could have just been due to the proc being overtuned, I'm not rly sure.
---
I threw this together very quickly (only orcs), but figured some people might be interested in this.
---
You Didn‚Äôt play vanilla, I can tell you‚Äôre a pserver kid.

I listened to the games music, BUT a neat thing you can do is turn ambience all the way up and music off and you'll hear a lot of very cool things on your travels.
---
Retail raiding is porn while Classic raiding is courtship.  
---
    
---
In retail you get impossible demands, only the tightest rotations and positioning that demands everything. It's all spectacle.  
---
Classic raiding was a journey of being allowed entry, about carefully learning new things and admiring the sites. The final boss fights might felt very static and uneventful, but you had great interaction, you loved what you did and in the end you felt satisfied.
---
I dont mind buying a totally new account, i was thinking it might be a stand alone version that i could create a new battle net account

I did level as a balance druid multiple time because it's a lot of fun.
---
Being a druid caster doesn't mean you should go deep in the balance tree, at least not for the early level.
---
You should start by getting Insect Swarm in the resto tree, it's a dot and it's very nice.
---
Then you can chose to start spending your point in the balance three or go a bit more down in resto.
---
From experience Nature Swiftness in the resto tree is a wonderful spell and you should spend a few more point in resto to grab it but you can also go down the balance tree for more damage.
---
My ideal is :
---
to lvl 20  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZZVx0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZZVx0o) 
---
Lvl 20-29  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0hZZVx0o](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0t0hZZVx0o) 
---
Lvl 30 (respec)   [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZZVEcozo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZZVEcozo)  there you can change between Nature's Focus, Improved Rejuv and Tranquil Spirit, I chose Nature's Focus because I like to do a lot of WorldPvP while leveling but if it's not your case you'd be better with Tranquil Spirit.
---
Lvl 30-60  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tcx0MxsxZVEcozo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0tcx0MxsxZVEcozo)  I fill the balance tree like this, sometimes changing little thing and if I meet a lot of melee in WPvP I do another respec for the Feral Charge in the feral tree (but that's only for PvP).
---
You can easily fight two mobs at the same time, you dot both and root one while face tanking the other one.
---
Spirit is not very good for druid as you're not spending much time out of the 5sec rule but if you got some on gear take it, you're a caster after all.
---
I always try to aim for intel/stam gear (keep in mind I'm very PvP oriented), if you get enough good gear you can take more than 2 mobs at the time by doting 3-4 mobs -&gt; regrowth and rejuv -&gt; bear form and swipe with the help of torn.
---
If you want to be 100% caster, no problem, you can still fight 2 mobs as i said, more will start to be an issue since you don't have anti-pushback talent.
---
Nature Grasp doesn't use the same root as Entangling root so you can root 2 mobs at the same time.
---
Always carry drink in your bag, max-up first aid, it'll save you mana between pull.
---
Half your spell are nature, the other half are arcane, which is pretty shitty since you'll need +spell power to increase both and in the early level you'll mostly find +arcane damage or +nature damage so you should aim for intel/stam until lvl 35-40 when you start getting +spell power gear. If you want to do big number and don't care about having to drink after every single mob and risking to die to a simple wolf because you put all your stat in +damage gear, go ahead, +arcane and +nature are the cheapest of the +magic school gear in the AH since no one use them.
---
If you have question I can try to answer them :)
---
This picture makes me want to swap from mage to rogue.
---
That's how it works in fantasy land. Realistically, no 60 cares that you're being ganked. They have their own shit to do. Even if they do care, it's not at all realistic they'll go out of their way to rescue you. On top of that, gankers DO NOT WANT an even fight. That's the reason they're ganking in the first place. In all likelihood if they see another 60 they're going to piss they're pants and run away, not escalate.
---
I'm not worried in the slightest simply because I know it will happen. 
---
The last month I've resisted every waking hour of my free time going and "practicing" for Classic. 
---
My only solace is I can enjoy my time I have now before the rest of my year is consumed.
---
ü§Æ
---
what is this ?
---
What you mean original T1 ?  
---
Did they really intent to do this ? you have source for this, i'm interested !
---
Although I'm happy they redesigned them, I really like the Rogue set
---
Isn't it bind on pickup, which means you still have to level tailoring even if you drop it later? Not sure on this one.
---
I think early Wrath is peak wow. The downhill started with Trial of the Crusader.
---
and on top of that you actually have micro transactions in a game you have to pay to play for...
---
Well your not gonna skin much in maraudon or dm tribute.
---
Pally and shaman are in as much demand or more than priests.
---
Human spirit buff is quite nice in later tiers I think
---
Or, best case scenario, a few 60s go and help, murder the ganker once or twice, then the ganker goes afk for half an hour. The players leave to go back to doing 60 stuff and the ganker continues ganking.
---
This was placeholder art that was replaced in the first few patches of the game.
---
It won't be in WoW Classic.
---
Or just have a different opinion. I enjoyed bc alot and still consider it one of the best times in wow. Playing since early vanilla days.
---
I was out of college when WoW came out. So I'm a Methuselah.
---
There is no reason not to in precious versions either that is what I'm saying. There is no content. Almost everything that was in previous versions of av are still there in 1.12.
---
Why do you all think that they took away boss summons and stuff? They didn't.
---
But we realized after years that having one side cap a single graveyard and win was a bad mechanic and that you can simply rush bases no matter the patch of AV.
---
No matter what patch the meta would be zerg down the boss. AV is just a poorly designed battleground.
---
Mastery also comes with time.  Which also comes with age.  Playing a select few classes for thousands of hours means that scrub 30 y.o. that has been playing since he was 15 knows every trick in the book.  :)
---
Hybrid classes become more viable. Druid in particular. But also Shaman. Also the new talents were pretty sick
---
My rogue looks the same, nice gear man!
---
Sorry
---
Horde generally speaks in orcish but does understand common which is what the alliance tends to speak.
---
Do they still do in house servers though? I figured they'd use some outsourcing, which in a sense would be cheaper but the point stands anyway
---
Thats at least a hundred hours of pvp grinding
---
Rogue looks good I think they used the art for the leader crafted storm... , or somting like this set. Was my first set and was on my server called t0.3 :)
---
Only speaking for myself here but I don't play more than 5h a week, I take my time to level, explore the zone, read the quest, make dungeons,... by the time I got lvl 30 Phase 2 will already out and most enchanter will have the fiery enchant recipe in their book.
---
Plus I think you underestimate the hardcore leveler who will farm BRD like madman for their pre-BIS
---
&gt;‚Äôm self-employed and currently underemployed
---
=wealthfare?
---
I used to do this shit *all the time.*
---
I think they are one of the most fleshed out classes design wise
---
TBC is imo the best expansion, I agree that PVE wise (40mans) vanilla is somewhat better but, TBC allowed everyone to play the class/spec they wanted. 
---
I tried a few specs on vanilla and I'm not convinced anymore I'll play the game .... If they made a TBC server however ...
---
This is an abomination. Allah please forgive me for reading this.
---
Fair enough. People will definitely farm BRD for pre-BIS, but that usually doesn‚Äôt include checking if pyromancer what‚Äôs-his-face spawned.
---
Yes!  I didn't think anyone else felt this too. It seems super silly to think about, but I've had that exact feeling, and it was almost a spiritual experience. 
---
I don't know if you're talking about Mulgore specifically, but funnily enough, that's where I remember this too.
---
I value your post but this IS about comparing specs, not about leveling purposes.
---
Paladins &gt; Priests in healing.
---
If it's red. It's dead.
---
Also way slower AND you can heal as ret anyway. Speccing Holy is just a waste of time.
---
I have a couple of days saves up. But if it releases in july I'm all set.
---
Rogue. Ironically it's one of my favorite rogue sets though.
---
Nahh it‚Äôs given us ample time to think about what we want to play. I‚Äôm grateful. I‚Äôve done so much prep lol.

Hey elemesmedve, he's right about this. WoW classic is using the modern WoW API. The model animations we will have in WoW Classic will be built on the current interface, not the 1.12 interface. So unless Blizzard is spending resources on recreating bugged animations and models, then we will not be getting those in Classic.
---
What we do get from 1.12 data are things like damage, spec, and other values. But it's not like Blizzard decided to copy and paste the old WoW into a new server, it's that they're taking the numbers/data from the old WoW and input them into modern models/animations/graphics.
---
When the game first came out, this is how the setpieves looked like.
---
Helloes. Well lets see, it is a complicated matter - one that will require more info from you and more knowledge from me. Even so I shall happily try to give you some insights. That said your best bet for full answers is talking to a fully educated professional (still getting my bachelor in psychology myself).
---
Gaming compulsion disorder is best described as a behavioral addiction (as opposed to a substance addiction). The reason each person develops this is entirely unique, which makes it very hard to diagnose, but a few proven triggers are: genetics (a reminder that this doesn't mean your parents need to have them 2, it can lie dormant until you etc. I have a genetic muscle/skin disease myself that no one in my living family have), personality, and substance abuse (even after one stops with a substance, you can still develop a behavioral one). There are many others, but the notion that games themselves can act so strongly on the brain as to create this addiction in and of themselves, without an underlying cause being present, has been studied thoroughly and found not to be the case. If you'd like to know how precisely they studied this etc, please feel free to ask for links, but basically they had none gamers play various games with varying intensity, having control groups etc, and ultimately saw that people with addictive tendencies would develop issues, while those without did not.
---
What happens is basically that your brains reward center is triggered, and eventually a pattern forms to the point where it needs its fix. You happen to be particularly susceptible to this process, for whatever reason that may be (seek a professionals help if you wish a chance to know more specifically. Best if he or she specializes in it) This means that it is not important if you play 1 game or a hundred games, its about patterns forming, which can happen as easily in 1 as in a hundred. Probably more easily. It is not unlike a form of gambling addiction: you put money in, and you get your high by your bet (regardless of the outcome). It just happens to be virtual money, time or whatever have ya. It can be just about anything, the important thing is that it has taken overhands to the point where you cannot control it.
---
That is the issue in a nut shell. Are you certain it applies to you? It being as complicated a matter as it is, it is a lot like depression: there are many times more faulty misdiagnosis than correct ones. Some people shout out the term every time they find a new and engaging game, being overly self aware of the amount of hours they've put into it. Spending time, including a lot of time, in a hobby that you enjoy is not addiction. It becomes an addiction if and only if you are incapable of stopping, to the point where it causes you physical harm as well as harms your life in general.
---
I hope that is helpful to you m8! I am off to vacation for a lil while now, so might not be answering for a bit. Best of luck to you!
---
If you go all out on consumables, you could consider guns for a spell power specc. TRIGGER WARNING: this is not an optimal hunter raiding specc, min-maxers beware! The  somewhat fast weapon speed of most guns pairs up nicely with arcane shots to get the most out of improved aspect of the hawk (the more shots, the more chances to activate it). As a dwarf, it is more likely for you to be able to put on a +7 weapon scope instead of the +3% hit scope, which is especially useful on faster weapons. This specc is most likely not worth the hassle, but I will try it out coming classic just for fun (and to have an excuse to use guns, let's see if there will be any guild accepting me into their ranks) ;^)
---
99,9999% sure this is because they don't use any physical server anymore, but a distributed cloud architecture. This is nice to create server on demand and handle nicely usual load balancing, but those server are totally unable to handle large number of people on the same instance.
---
Blue balls
---
That doesn't explain shaman though.
---
I recently went back to a DaoC freeshard, and while everything was great nostalgiawise the elitism was wayyy stronger. We are talking wrong classes=no invite wrong spec=no invite. Why im comparing those games is cause they where released with a few years between and both games (daoc in particular) where the first "good looking real graphic mmo" since Ultima I would say. The real proper 3D game engines. The only thing I feel might save us from the worst tox is the average age of players. Hopefully we are talking average age of 30-35. Truth be told people wanna be the best they can, and now we know how to do that. So nothing stops us from farming the correct instances for the best in slot rather than farming crap in slot in another instance.
---
Depends on spec and race, mages are a bad matchup as hemo, being a gnome helps but its going to be an uphill battle. Imp sprint/prep is much better vs mages (decently worse vs rogues and heavier armor though)
---
Warlock is highly dependent on pet and spec, SM/Ruin you should win most of the time, Destro you are also favored (although moreso if you are UD to be immune to charm and continue your stunlock otherwise you have to time vanish perfectly). SL with felhunter you can win, SL with VW you might as well not even bother unless you extremely outgear them or have eng and they don't or they are just bad. 
---
Hunters is tough but doable, you really can't get greedy and you need to play it more like you are fighting a warrior, keep up CC's and slowly build up damage.
---
Spriest is very tough if they resist a stun you are pretty well fucked you also need some crits, otherwise be prepared to blow all of your CD's and reset the fight a bunch while trying not to get dotted.

//but if you're sitting around killing lowbies//
---
^^ If your definition of "sitting around" is running around loitering in an area killing the same lowbies repeatedly, then yes, that's a waste of time. As I said to someone else, smacking down any red-name you organically happen to come across on your way to important places is what I'm advocating, because it disrupts the other faction without significantly slowing you from reaching your own level 60, obtaining your own raid pre-BiS, etc. Being the level 55 rogue stealth'd outside of Booty Bay for an hour waiting to kill the level 36s who come outside to quest hampers one's own EXP per hour and gear acquisition. 
---
And it's *NOT* "part of the game" if you roll a PvE server, which I'm encouraging you to do, no condescension. I made this post to let people know that anything goes, all's fair in war, and if you aren't okay with taking turns with the other faction hampering one another at any potential turn, it might not be for you. 
---
"I always thought i wanted a pvp server. I love pvp. And constant action appeals to me. But after trying out a PS i changed my mind by the end of stv. Between hillsbrad and stv it just wasnt worth it. But i also work 50+ hours a week so my time is precious and the less corpse runs from camping higher levels the better. Sometimes, you think you want something, but you dont, and thats ok..."

Nah I don‚Äôt think sub numbers contribute much to Blizz‚Äôs profits. I think it‚Äôs all Hearthstone, WoW expansion releases, and in-game store services that bring in the cash, right?
---
&gt;The game was designed for 15-25 year olds
---
Maybe 15 year olds in 2004. 15 year olds in 2019? Definitely not! Its all about action and competition. They want fast-paced, high APM games. Unless Classic massively blows up and takes the world by storm, I don't see people that age grinding an hour for 12 bear asses or walking for 30 minutes just to deliver a message to some guy for 8% exp. They just didn't grow up with the games we did and it takes some age to appreciate all the nuances Classic had and will have.
---
Did you start out in much, MUCH later than rest of the server ? Maybe when ZG was out already ? Its very different thing at launch, while some people want to pvp, there is no L60's ganking. Because the first L60's will spend their time gathering high level materials before the masses get there.
---
Just try to convince your fiance to play with you

You missed out on The Burning Crusade.  How you would have loved that.

I believe sales would be the de facto measure.

now we're down to every patch being a gear reset in live :)

IMAGINE THE SMELL
---
I've played on PvP servers my entire life. I never been so much of a pussy to have to justify killing people 30 levels below me. I play on PvP servers to fight people at my level. 
---
I didn't see much of that sentiment in OPs post. But I guess I'm just not a real PvPer.
---
A pity he 'died' just as the best was arriving.  I hope you had a good run with your next character, if not, see you in Classic.
---
I won't while leveling, because their pets can solo me (am warrior.) You don't want to make ennemies when you play a warrior. After gearing up though, sure.
---
Well, there are loads of mithril nodes (sapper materials) AND herbs in maraudon. Mining might be preferred since you can get those early nodes at start of run and dont have to run around the instance for ghost mushrooms.

Ahh, the gold ol' 2 FPS serverwide fight for Wintersgrasp.  That's the first time I remember thinking maybe there's too many people in one area.  Lol
---
The hardest part about the grind was that you could not miss a week. If you did you would lose the ranking.
---
You think you do, but you don't. Except we do m8. The changes made to the game that caused us to reach BFA now were not the wishes of players. The reason it went this direction is because of corporate, algorithms, profit maximization. A true MMO-RPG is not ideal for their purposes, so they steadily made it into a city q-hub action game (BFA is very much this).  
---
When wow first came out, they monetized by retaining subs. They didn't do this with cheap repeatable content etc, they did it by making an engaging game. This meant it was a game designed to be player however much or however little you yourself decided to do. Nowadays, it is designed to be a regular thing. If you do not log on regularly, do not do your dailies, do not keep up with the flow, you will fall behind. You don't want that, so best log on, best stay subbed. It is called player retention, and they have it nailed down to a science, using algorithms and industry professionals. They believe this works, but the problem is that it largely cuts off any creative control from the actual devs, and that the people behind these 'player retention' methods are not players themselves. They look at numbers, and use them to manipulate people, rather than look at people, and work towards their desires. It is manipulative and malicious, and a design philosophy better served for a mobile game - which is where blizzard is headed as a company. With any luck it will yet take a decade, but we are well on the path to that reality.
---
But they look sick, I'd rock em all day!
---
Someone correct me but it's actually one of possible ways to quickly break stealth of enemy players, especially in melee range as it autotargets nearest enemy (when no target is selected) and immediately swings them, forcing them out of stealth, provided you detect them first and rogue is trash, of course. Some characters might not have instant abilities or not enough resource to spam something else. Worked for casters' melee weapons as well because wands have "windup" animation. I remember that I went into spasms when I heard that ominous sound of characters in stealth near me and spammed that autoattack like crazy while jumping and swiveling around like an idiot. Fun times...
---
The Stormshroud pieces look exactly like that.
---
Not showing the name etc (like the others did) kinda implies that this is taken from a pserver or transmogged.
---
Just saying..
---
That certainly helped, but i believe a large part of it is also this current trend of reselling us our past/childhoods. Just look at all the remasters in games and movies coming out.
---
tell your fiance your taking some "you time" for soul searching. then just play WoW
---
I wonder how attainable rank 10 would be in VR? (Don't think I'll even entertain the idea of beyond that rank at this stage)
---
Yes, that post is wrong about several things. Rank 14 is not limited to 1 per server either.
---
Watch monkeynews on YouTube and take notes lol
---
Thanks for pointing these out, I'll get them fixed!
---
That would be a long shot lol. Bought her a gaming computer last christmas and she just plays the sims on it.... Wishful thinking tho. I like it.
---
Paladin: me not that kind of orc!
---
Right, she has to work the whole month so I hope its not too bad. I know its going to be a month of working out for 1.5 hours upon wakeup and about 14 hours of wow until im raiding lol
---
Huh. I would have guessed hunter, but would have believed paladin. Odd stuff.
---
Troll Rogue + Druid of the Fang
---
Sorry, but you don't know what you are talking about. You are mixing up things. I'm a game developer and I've also looked into Vanilla's data formats for fun.
---
Here how things will work:
---
They take their current code (client and server) and modify it as needed so it supports Vanilla game mechanics. They do this by incorporating existing 1.12 code and modifying it as needed.
---
This Classic client will load existing 1.12 data. However, it'll not use the old 1.12 data formats and data handling code but the modern one. Because of this they had to convert their the 1.12 data to their modern format. Although this highlighted some shortcomings in the original data (like missing lights, mentioned in the Blizzcon panel) which they then needed to fix, basically it's an automatic and wholesale transfer. They'll not use modern data either from WoTLK or later. Especially not animations (which were also called out in the video as going back to the old ones were causing problems which needed to be fixed).
---
As I said Classic will be Vanilla through and through. Not just loot and quests, etc. but graphics too. It's not a remaster, it's a recreation.
---
I won't exclude the *possibility* of them including a toggle for modern models (although they never ever even hinted at doing this), after all I'm not Blizzard, I can only base my judgments on what they released. But I'd be quite surprised if they did this. It's uneccessary extra work and developing Classic already took a long time.
---
You'll see when Classic releases that everything will be just like in Vanilla. ;) (Except the *optional* modern shadows, water, increased ground clutter distance, etc. which come free with the modern client and have nothing to do with the models, animations, textures, etc.)
---

PROTIP: Buy Activision Blizzard Stocks right now ;-)
---
Common misinformation, shaman can't dispel shit and is definitely a downgrade from a priest. If you have to pick just one healer to duo with your warrior then it's a priest for horde, period. Shaman only comes in handy for extra burst as a second support, once your magic dispel is taken care of.
---
I started playing wow in open beta and got the full game on release date. So played from day 1.
---
Up to Sunken Temple everything is doable without tank spec.
---
Potions.
---
I knew nothing about wow when i first started, so my first character was a ret paladin. it sucked balls no matter what upgrade i got so i just parked him in cenarion hold.
---
when you use mind control cap there and use bubble, the guards attack the person that got controlled. i usually targeted main tanks as i thought it'd cost them more, though MT's are probably rich.    
---
must have been funny to see from the other faction too, a naked paladin with a funny hat that pops up from time to time causing havoc and hearthing away.
---
I remember having that set, and then replacing it later with bloodfang. I think its like the devilsaurs look or something. It is definitely obtainable somehow - why not, might as well use the models even if they made better ones for tier 2. Wish i knew more precisely where for ya.
---
Wise. I felt bad for someone recently who said they took off a bunch of time in mid-July.
---
Oh boy, trip down memory lane. When I was fresh level 60 dwarf hunter i was in a small guild who couldn't even manage a UBRS group alone. I was only 14 years old at the time and I figured the thing you'd do when you reached 60 was getting better gear. Had no idea what MC or a raid was.
---
So I started grinding my T0 set through pugs. Most of set was pretty easy. Even chest or shoulders where pretty easily farmed. On my journey through all these pugs I regularly met a nightelf hunter with the same goal. We became sort of rivals on the matter. Eventually we both only missed one piece, that legs from Baron. Turned out for both of us they where quite elusive, until the day they finally dropped. And we where both in the group at that time. So our sweet little rivalry was up to the rollof the dice.
---
And I won. I was really happy that I got my set completed and didn't have to grind for it anymore. My rival was fairly sporty and congratulated me. I told him I'd go into WSG to show the horse now the might of my awesome gear, he didn't want to come along and logged out.
---
In WSG it didn't turn out to be such good gear. But worse was that one shaman of the enemy team seemed to have special interest in me. Not only was he High Warlord, he was also the first High Warlord of the server and the Horde Contest  winner, by nature of that this Orc had a reputation on the server and was somewhat feared. And he was targeting me all the time. So I had my fill of pvp pretty quickly and opted to just stand bit on the bridge in Ironforge.
---
Then my rival came back online and was super smug when he asked how my WSG went. Turned out that the Orc shaman was his character and he his revenge on me. But he was a nice guy and later even invited me into his guild, they where doing this raiding thing and could need another good hunter. When BC came around we got to 8/15 NAXX, and lots of great stories where written.
---
you "could" use only guns, but if you plan to raid, then you'll be passing up on good upgrades as you wait purely for guns. The Blastershot Launcher in MC from Golemagg, DB handcannon in BWL from Ebonroc and the Toxin Injector in Naxx from Grobbulus are the only Guns I can think of from Raiding. Where are there are more bows &amp; Xbows.
---
Hahaha, I could have been on welfare the last few years but I was too lazy to deal with them. They assume unemployed means ‚Äúcan spend 3 hours on hold‚Äù per week just to get paid. 
---
Before I went on holiday I was labouring full-time, since then its winter and work is thin :)
---
I take what I can from the people I was working with before, but it was primarily turfing so its really a summer gig.
---
I did love that I chose when I worked, got paid on the day (and well) and got to excersice while working. I‚Äôll be back next summer, for now I am looking for other work.
---
$15 is literally nothing to me but I am not gonna pay such a price for 15 old game that they aren't even gonna maintain and support. If they can get rid of RMTers, constantly patch the game and have real support that warrants such payment, then sure. But if there is a static game not touched by developers with a clue and vision then at best I could pay some cents for the server electricity that I take.
---
&gt; The fact that a single private server got 150k regular players means there are many times that in people that will play Classic.
---
Bullshit, see above.
---
The main risk of faction imbalance, which a lot of people are worried about, is if Blizzard releases realm lists way before launch. It's fine if they do it a few days before launch. But if they would release them now there would be a significant risk of people flocking to certain factions where famous guilds/players/whatever are at, and other players not choosing the opposite faction on that server.
---
Yea unfortunately I wont have computer access all of July so if it does drop mid july im going to be boned.
---
Tbh screw min/maxing. Looks is everything.
---
Rank 10 grind with weekly guild raids can be a bit much.  By itself, not too bad
---
What do you mean by standalone? Something totally isolated from the rest of the world that only you can access (like standalone single-player games) ?
---
If yes, I don't think there's any chance Blizzard would do it, but you can have your own bubble by running an emulator locally on your PC.
---

---
Being ganked turns you into a real man.
---
Isn't the point of a classic server kind of voided if Blizz starts developing new features for it?
---
Depends how much you play. If you manage to cozy up to the top premade group and gain a steady top 10 standing by playing an insane amount then you can probably get it in 4-5 weeks.
---
But its also possible to get it by playing 1-2 hours per day for a longer time.
---
to get r10? no you did not.

More importantly do you have the connections to get it? Rank 14 is a community/team effort and if you‚Äôre not part of the community/group(s), you‚Äôre considered a bracket breaker and they‚Äôll try to fuck you over.
---
Alt! You're going to have an alt anyway, so just plan one from the beginning.
---
I thought the hybrid tax was for talent respecing
---
.12 is lower than .2-.9, though.
---
for some tryhard guilds the drop rate on shit like bonereavers edge magically goes above 100% on some private servers haha
---
I love your use of the word ferment here.
---
A+ and have my updoot
---
I love you both
---
OH MY GOD!
---
Holy shit, when running some old Content in mop, I found some random blue/yellowish boots and gloves. They actually looked quite nice and I searched the dungeon to find other matching pieces.
---
Nothing. I think it was AQ where they dropped, but cant remember excactly. After not finding anything there, I checked the database for all other items in classic. Nothing. Hmmm maybe TBC? Checked there again. OH I FORGOT DUNGEONS! -&gt; Checked all dungeon loot. Nothing. FFS WHERE IS IT ... world bosses, Special Events and what so ever, everything database and Atlas could offer. NOTHING.
---
I was depressed ... and now with the T2 post you mentioned ... I fucking know where that items come from. Judgment Paladin T2 old School like. Well couldnt get them anymore anyway.
---
Correct me if im wrong, but once you hit say r14 you will forever be able to buy r14 gear even if lose your rank - so like if you hit r14 with zero gold you dont have to worry about not being able to buy the gear if you go down in rank before you get enough gold.  
---
The only thing you'll lose from going down rank is your title, however your highest rank will forever be shown in the honor-tab.
---
i've been testing a build using 6-8 pieces t0 and i think i can actually make it better than pre-raid "BiS".  sure, you might have like 4% less crit but you can actually get much more attack power, more HP, and more importantly a lot more mana.
---
"BiS" hunters go oom super fast and then their dps vanishes... with 6 parts t0 you get the proc for 200 mana &lt;3
---
Nothing oozes Orc as much? I think this Orgrimmar set is pretty orcly:
---
 [https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/4/47/Orgrimmar\_Set.jpg](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/wowpedia/4/47/Orgrimmar_Set.jpg)
---
There is a quest that leads you there so I guess they are there as a threat to avoid.
---
Seeing toons like this hanging out in Gadget, Org, Kargath, etc, were one of the reasons I started raiding in Vanilla.  I never got my rogue to this point, but holy shit did I ever try.
---
With the way the 8.2 patch is expected to play out in guessing 2nd week of august.
---
don't you be talking shit bout bloodfang :(
---
Is it true that horde and alliance players choose servers according to the name?
---
Are servers with the name thrall or frost wolf horde player magnets?
---
I heard this suggestion now twice, since I never thought about this myself.
---
I just clicked on a random server in 2005.
---
I was planning on adding a feature in the future where you can view other peoples builds and rate them, but at the moment it's only saving it for yourself
---
I used to think it was super-weird for people to identifty specific raid items by sight - now, after playing on vanilla pservers for a few years, I understand.
---
Orc paladin I lol'ed.
---
Jokes aside ... I really wish for an August release. I have 3 weeks of vacation ready to go and got many hours in stock so I can leave work early in summer after vacation. Its also no Problem to sign the vacation like 3 weeks before.
---
But theres one short window where I simply cant take vacation as Im the only one on work then ... 10 july to 29 july. I just hope the 16th july isnt going to be true ...
---
Cheers buddy, thanks for raising those issues!
---
Also I highly doubt guilds back then we're handing maladaths to dps. People back then didn't realize how important weapon skill was
---
I can't stand the wait. I hate it. I want to get back into Azeroth today... yesterday if possible. \^\^
---
Yeah but there is no set in classic and this is good for Grunts at 60 my character won't be a grunt he will be a warrior of the horde and a famous adventurer.
---
Dude has been to UBRS and seen some shit, man.
---
That was such a lame way to introduce wow classic
---
They were giving out badges in BGs like candy towards the end of vanilla, I was able to get full HWL/WL weapons and gear in less than a week.
---
Let's hope so.
---
If 16 July is the release date then im gonna be like 20 days behind when i start. That my friend will drive me mad knowing i cannot get on my computer with classic being out.
---
That warrior set would have been just fine imo
---
Tanaris was gank and troll central back in the day.  Anyone remember when people were jumping on top of the inn in Gadget and bugging out the guards?    That was the first time I could remember Blizzard dropping the banhammer back in the day.  So many memories.
---
You jebaited that drood hard.  You can almost see him uninstalling.
---
love how in later sets they made rogue gear... the gear for the STEALTHY class... all glowy and metallica and impractical lol
---
imo nightslayer, apart from the shoulders, was the perfect rogue set.  stick BF shoulders on it and its flawless
---
If there's a bell curve of likely dates then anything in July is on that early part before the the slope gets steep. Based on their recent earnings report saying no earlier than July, their blue posts announcing fundamental design decisions this late in the game, Blizzard's "ready when it's ready", and no marketing yet.
---
Blue/lowing pieces improve the ability to blend in, in the dark.
---
Well to say everyone I know bought the expansion and quit after two months, they'd probably make more from Classic subs.
---
Sounds fun :) especially for the gold provided at the beginning. Do you remember where oen can find the video ?
---
I actually have more down votes than the OP has up votes which tells me two things. 
---
- Thousands have scrolled past this not caring a bit
---
- Leeroy has a very odd and niche cult following 
---
So, thanks!
---
I think sharding would actually help immersion. Where for immersion I mean living the rpg aspect of the game, pretending to be in a fantasy world.
---
Having 400 people and 1 fat kodo on top of the quest giver would ruin my "immersion in the game" much more.
---
Of course sharding damages community interactions.
---
Maybe he is stelthing through the radioactive swamp...
---
For rank 10, you have to play a fair amount of time each day to get a lot of honor. Above rank 10, you need to be among top3 people in your faction on the server with most honor farmed that week in order to jump 1 rank up. If you for example get to rank 11 and the next week you are not among the top 30 on the server with most honor, you will drop rank (as far as I remember how it was). So you will have to steadily be like top3 or top5 to not drop rank.
---
At least it's not glowing
---
I forgot how bad the Paladin set was. Oof.
---
...where's Mankrik's wife tho
---
I lost my talent of the counter argument towards mom jokes a very long time ago. I did what I could with the resources I had.
---

---
In TBC I used to farm on elemental plateau a lot, and there was always this Undead Shadow Priest there aswell, we would literally fight and gank eachother for hours every day for weeks.
---
You‚Äôre my boy blue. Stay classy
---
Almost had a heart attack, I ebayed my opened one with everything in tact for like $200 a while back.
---
Just leave it be. It‚Äôs come to my attention Leeroy has formed a super sensitive albeit loyal cult following. All we can do now is ask for a drop of the Mother‚Äôs mercy.
---
Full tier may not be best in slot, but it is very tempting to use anyway. If nothing else, it‚Äôd be cool to walk around town wearing it.
---
I think the Un'goro stone guardians are for the epic hunter quest.
---
I'm really glad images of these exist still. I remember very much seeing this in game. And telling my friends about it at some point and nobody believed me.  If I recall T2 had the same overhaul at some point.
---
I have a slightly different story. One of my best friends was a super casual player, never hit 60. He had foreign exchange student one year during vanilla and after a week or two i went to his house and saw him playing wow. He played a hunter with basic blue gear and i saw his guild asking him to join for the weekly ZG run and he kept telling them no. I asked him why and he just said ‚Äòi dont know what to do‚Äô. I told him to join and i will play his hunter. I knew the ZG bosses but not hunter. We ended up killing about 6 bosses and he got so many epics me and him were just screaming and hugging after every boss fight we got gear. Good times man.
---
As a caster I always try to group with hunters. As melee, it's a no, no! Especially if I am tanking.
---
Nice set! Keep asking Blizzard to revive your old accounts people! They‚Äôll cave with a release date soon enough!
---
What a convenient site.
---
I remember I absolutely hated how guns sounded untill the sound was reworked many expansions later. It sounds like a proper boomstick rather than gun alright but my god, my ears can only bleed so much, it's loud as fuck, sometimes I scared myself when it went off and I didn't expect it for some reason. I definitely preffered the soft "swoosh" sound of bows and xbows.
---
That being said it is possible, yes - but suboptimal both while leveling and raiding. At certain points, there are simply better counterparts to guns.
---
To me, those sets still look better than anything in Retail today...
---
You are dumb and should feel bad about missing the point by such a large margin.  I cannot believe this was the conclusion you reached.  Utterly baffling.
---
Have you played Albion Online? I think you would like it.
---
The rage gen was definitely a thing in classic.
---
Tier 2,5 ftw
---
That was TBC prepatch tbh
---
Casual won't check if he's there but those who will already be farming their pre-bis in the 3 first weeks will use a macro to target him so they don't lose time clearing useless mobs if he's not there but for sure will go kill him if he's spawned.
---
Me and my brother physically beat the shit out of each other to decide which got to play that day, luckily I'm built like a buffalo so it was an ez win.
---
Hopefully he'll be back too for classic :D
---
30 July
---
 &gt;It took me 4 days to level to 120.
---
&gt; It took me another 3 days to get my item level from 270 to 370.
---
&gt; It took me another day to finish normal version of BfD raid and kill Jaina.
---
&gt; All this without any help from my friends.
---
For comparison: while waiting for classic, I've been dipping my toes into FFXIV for the past 6-7 weeks or so. After about 10 days of /playtime, I'm barely 2/3rd of the way of _leveling_ experience there, and I got to explore all the story and endgame content of the previous expansions. I don't have any idea how difficult and/or time consuming it will be to beat the current endgame, but I suspect it will be somewhat longer than just one day.
---
So yeah, it's not that there is dichotomy between "MMO with lots of QoL" (FFXIV has all the bells and whistles), and "MMO with meaningful progress". Blizzard has just dropped the ball, and it's evidently possible to do much better.
---
Yeah but you said "nothing oozes Orc till date" which I assume you meant "to date".
---
this was a major point of controversy back then, ‚Äúepics replaced by greens‚Äù. Most raiders felt that all the time they invested in raiding and developing their characters was for nothing. A lot of pvp players felt the same with the end of the old honor system.
---
Edwin Van Cleef in the Deadmines still wears it.
---
Fk that loser
---
How would this work out if you wanted to tank/heal dungeons?
---
He mains warlocks, so he brings up relevant info in just about every vid. Plus it's got a link to his twitch and discord, where there's more info. He also did a interview with tips out, where he specifically debunks the 1-click rotation on competitive warlocks.
---
You don't need to be a tank or healing spec until 55+ dungeons as long as you keep a set of tanking / healing gear. It won't be as efficient, but you'll be fine.
---
It is not worth it brother. It isn't.
---
That's an easy decision.
---
Engineering is the best profession of the game, both pve and pvp wise.
---
Leatherworking sucks in general, and the really good items are BoE and can be bought.
---
The warrior set looks dope af
---
Player housing is not a good idea, we had a taste of what happens when you incentivise people to hide away in personal instances during WoD. We need players out and populating the world, that's what gives an MMORPG life.
---
T2.5 is a bunch of placeholders, same with ZG set. Would love to see them redo the visuals on those two sets, but doubt Blizz would invest the time.
---
Channels are divided by the zones, so no. You'd have to go to IF to have better chance of finding a group, as IF is more populated than SW usually
---
Endgame pvp, without very good weapons, you just sux as rogue.
---
Lets say a rank 11 rogue meet a rank 11...
---
Arms Warrior: 2 shot you, need all cooldowns, don't let em move.
---
Retri/Holy/Prot Paladins: lol forget it.
---
Frost Mages: They have all to beat you, you have all to beat them.
---
Demo Warlock: You can't kill them, they have massive damage reduction and dots that you can't remove.
---
Shadow Priest: Maybe...
---
Resto/Ele shamans: lol forget it, their totem remove stealth in a big range.
---
Hunter: Can 2 shot you, very hard to kill if they have free spaces around.
---
Druids: lol roots+faerie fire, no more stealth for you.
---
I mean, you could kill some of them, but rogues have no armor and you are going to use all your CDS to kill another good/geared player.
---
There is a reason if noone want rogues in endgame pvp premades. There is a good 5 minutes hole between a kill and another. You will have a lot of fun while levelling and in world pvp, but when people get weapons and gear... ROGUE SUX.
---
Second best
---
So justin bieber is better than mozart
---
People are much better mechanically now than they were in vanilla. The current raids that they‚Äôve been releasing are much, much more difficult than vanilla raids
---
Idc about any streamers/Youtubers, but for the love of god do not make me level a character in a server with a high population of French players. Anything but French.
---
Daggers have the highest attack speed of all weapons. This makes it so that the fire weapon enhancement buff (I forgot the name, flamtongue weapon?) deals the most possible damage.
---
I read the calculations somewhere, higher damage weapons also cause bigger damage procs from the buff but more frequent, lower damage procs will give you a higher DPS.
---
During leveling no, at 60 you will probably find a role for your character and the talents that go with that
---
I know people are salty at the game right now, but no. Just no. Those are hideous and nowhere near as good as what we got now.
---
Just before launch of Burning Crusade there were over 7 millions subscribers. What are you even talking about? WoW is now far behind that popularity . You don't need 2000 servers to replicate original experience. On the other hand you have sharding tech which guarantees you 100% NOT original experience. The choice is obvious to me.
---
Do you have any idea what impact sharding will have on the server economy? No? Don't worry, we'll find out soon enough.
---
Re-HE-He-healy??ü§îü§î
---
I like paladin, warrior, and rogue better
---
It's basically the foot of the waterfall to the right as you jump down the cliff. XR = Crossroads. 
---
The video was some sort of alternative to waiting for mob respawns during the megazerg server openings. He does it a bit differently though, with exploration to level 4 and also grabbing Camp T and TB flight paths.
---
Just milking karma at this point
---
It‚Äôs not quite progressing per say as everyone else who never actually cleared the content just skips everything you did and you all start at an equal footing. So while you‚Äôre moving onto new stuff, your progression was still technically wiped.
---
Does the same go for all the engineering trinkets/helmets/whatevers???
---
Yeah, this set feels like a true armed to the teeth Orc warrior.
---
That costume is the tits.
---
It‚Äôs not just a grind, it‚Äôs a competition against everyone else trying to get it, and you won‚Äôt easily compete with the people who do it in a group and take turns getting top honour.
---
The rogue set is amazing, Edwin vancleef.
---
I even prefer the druid recolour of it compared to the T1 in game now I think. I will be getting the AB shoulders just for that I think.
---
It's just a placeholder with random assorted pieces, it was never a desing.
---
Imagine wanting to gank so badly that you jump off a cliff lmao. Why did so many people fall for this?
---
How is 2.5 placeholders when they are all new unique models that are only used in that raid? I buy ZG though.
---
Just to avoid confusion it is probably best to give Classic servers unique names. Perhaps based on characters or places unique to Vanilla.
---
They don't even have tier now.  And anyway, winning Defias meant SO MUCH MORE.
---
Pretty sure there will be separate french (as well as german and russian) servers for classic, just like they exist for retail. There will be a lot of scandinavians on the english servers, but they pretty much all speak english as if it‚Äôs their first language. 
---
The only servers to look out for are servers with high eastern european or turkish communities I guess.
---
Agreed. There should be a decent amount of unused server names still.
---
Yeah really like the Warrior set.
---
I started playing Mordhau, succesfully replacing my addiction with another addiction! I hope it will last for a couple of months.
---
He mc'd him :/
---
I honestly just wish they'd release the exact same server names as there were before, but classic versions. That way we  could more easily meet up with our old guildies and such.
---
So far it's so wrong.
---
Golden good boi
---
I expect a collector's edition, somewhere, somehow...
---
He sort of did, but he didn't.
---
You got a link to the last post?
---
I'm dumb
---
Stupid fuks downvoting you for telling 100% truth. A multi billion dollar company most likely followed the private scene closely and to protect their IP forced some servers to shutdown. Then they start working on their own servers when they know there is business there. People are so stupid and think Blizzard is doing this like some damn favor to the gamers. Its all business and stakeholders.
---
This is another reason I love classic. You knew the names of items, where to get them and could instantly recognize what people had on just by looking at them. I remember seeing Pauldrons of Might on my warrior and instantly wanting them. It gave me the motivation to join an MC raiding guild and actually obtain them.
---
What makes someone a fuckwad for creating an add on?  I like a lot of different addons
---
It was called Shadowcraft, it was blue/grey tinge instead of the red
---
He was OUT of touch though, and poured scorn of the entire private server base and those who sympathized, who wanted nothing more than to give Blizz their loyalty back.  It was like when Jon Snow left Ghost last episode.
---
Only if they have a saber/pistol and a parrot.
---
When is vacation season in the USA? If they want to maximize players that is the time to release.
---
I'm the biggest care bear this side of the clouds and I would still foam at the mouth for wintergrasp to unlock content. If the PvP had meaning then people would still do it. All it is now is a grind for some alternative transmogs. 
---
PvP for the sake of PvP is fine but when it has an impact on content and gear balance then you will get more people invested.
---
Dastardly evil
---
Bullshit. Here's what a PVP server is about:
---
Relentlessly camping people 10+ levels below you which you can squash like an insect.
---
The popular faction on the server outnumbering the other faction 2 or 3 (or 9! on Smolderthorn back in the day) to 1 and ensuring that no one on the other faction gets to raid during popular times. Again, squash like insect since there's no way to have a fair fight when there's 9:1 ratios.
---
PVP servers are about victimizing people and getting off on them not being able to fight back.
---
Oh, I know that's not what they're \*supposed\* to be about. They're \*supposed\* to be about the kind of thing you describe. Encounter a roaming enemy and evade or fight for survival. But that's not what they \*ARE\*. What they are is not being able to play the new expansion for a week because you happen to be on the wrong side of a 5:1 ratio on your server and any attempt to leave the cities is an endless chain of corpse runs.
---
[Yes, it will be sold on Amazon starting in May.](https://twitter.com/JohnStaats_WIR/status/1119956572417986561)
---
Can you post that? would be interesting to see!
---
Nope, there are dozens just dedicated to it.
---
On the other hand you do have a bunch of no life neckbeard losers camping Redridge 24/7 lol. 
---
I swear there are lots of people that play horde just to hit 60 and then camp Redridge
---
With talents 0-30-21? Provided you maintain separate gear sets for Bear and Restoration, you can do 5-player dungeons just fine in either role. That is what I did in Vanilla, although healing more than tanking.
---
If I may offer a personal preference of mine? I like to get Enchanting on Druids, since it allows you to get the trinket "Smoking Heart of the Mountain", in addition to being a great profession overall. I believe this trinket is actually BiS for Bear tanking, or at least very near to it. Might be something for you to consider.
---
You never know. Sims is a gateway drug.
---
My non gamer wife started with the Sims. Then she thought that those exploration adventures in one of the expacs was fun but not interesting enough. 
---
I showed her some WoW stuff and started just so slow, let her make a connection with a character. At first there was a lot of assistance - reading the information on the screen, moving through 3D space with WASD, clicking hotkeys, all this stuff we take for granted.
---
She's leveled to 120 on retail now because she's "doing her adventures". She joins random groups, crafts, and farts around like a real WoW player.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Im really curious, what made you quit 1 day into bc? Yeh it had weird space stuff, but it was mechanically a lot like vanilla right?
---
Stormshroud was the armor that looked like the OP. Shadowcraft and the original tier 2 shared the same model though.
---
Oh yeah, sorry - someone linked t2 original. Stormshroud was the ZG set iirc
---
There is not internal cooldown on Hardiness, it just reduces the chance of any stun affecting you by a flat percentage.
---
I think we will get the release date very soon. Within a week or two.
---
I would deffo roll on EU-Leeroy Jenkins
---
Italian and greek too could be a problem too, pop not high enough for their own server and for sure they will not speak english in general chat.
---
On raid gear? Not much in tier 1, in  tier 2 and onwards they become very dependent. This is because level 55-60 green items "of Shadow Wrath" provide a stupid amount of shadow spell damage, which outperforms the poor stats of the raid gear available to warlocks in Molten Core.
---
Lol, it‚Äôs the US. As a country we have the least amount of vacation days. We don‚Äôt have a whole season like France.
---
Wtf? The game is still very much about raiding. Mythic progress is still the most prestigious thing in PvE.
---
They want everyone toons to start over regardless, they won‚Äôt let you use an old wow toon in classic. Effectively there‚Äôs no reason to revive an account from back then
---
Well school has a break right? Ans parents try to match that.
---
I'm partial to EU-Hogger myself.
---
&gt;Luckily, I don't give a rats ass about what you think, **my friend**
---
So what you're saying is... we're friends? &lt;3
---
[Here's a guide for how Honor worked in vanilla / will work in Classic](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html). TLDR: grind honor all day for several months if you want a high rank.
---
*cough* Bfa arathi set *cough*
---
Zug zug
---
True, that‚Äôs still the summer months, mainly June and July. My district goes back August 1st.
---
Ugly and outdated
---
There is nothing wrong with getting to 60 quickly.
---
First reasonable sub estimates I‚Äôve seen.  I‚Äôm really looking forward to classic, but to think it will have over a million consistent subs and potentially take over retail is delusional.
---
No they specificly hired someone like a year ago to RECREATE the old models for the new client and this why the skeleton was updated to the wotlk+ one because old one was considered ''glitchy''... On the classic demo it was confirmed because the models are so smooth like they were after wotlk and not like they were in vanilla/tbc.. 
---
most people don't notice it, i think it's really sad but whatever (there are several comparison vids on youtube if you want to see what i mean, you can write ''no moonwalk classic'' or something)
---
An add-on like that is horrible. It's cancer just like Gearscore was in Wrath.

Not me but my friend i introduced to the game, rolled on caster robes as a rogue. He was known and nicknamed Robes after that.
---
Did the same thing with my mage, naked i Gadgetzan but the MC helmet. Use mindcontrol and iceblock ??? profit
---
I always felt like the Hunter Sets never really got me in the feeling of being a Hunter. I would also prefer to use Leather instead of Mail.
---
You mean **your guild**.  
---
Every guild i know at the time gave maladath to dps.
---
No. Engineering is the one crafting profession that by and large requires the skill itself to use its items, or else everyone would buy rocket boots/thorium grenades/charge helmets without penalty. It's the persistent penalty you pay for having access to a bunch of nifty PvP items.
---
Is it hard to wait? Fuck yes it is. Patience is a skill and by far the most important people are lacking when wanting to achieve something in life.
---
Transmog doesn't have a place in classic, but it 1000% wasn't the downfall of wow, i consider it a completely positive game system personally.
---
Transmog breathed life into old content, which is something wow desperately needed.
---
I want server names to avoid ending up with streamers
---
hard disagree on that, played from the month after release and I loved tbc, the specs gained so much identity really made me enjoy the game so much more.
---
Being able to raid as what class you enjoyed instead of being pigeon holed into doing stuff you didn't like was a huge breath of fresh air after playing a druid.
---
I loved dispel protection talents for pvp, made playing an affliction lock actually feel like a dot class instead of just trading gcds with enemy dispellers
---
Spriests felt so good, no longer did you have to work twice as hard for meager dps, and mana wasn't such a huge roadblock 
---
Rogue felt GREAT, cloak of shadows was a game changer you no longer felt like a helpless baby every time anybody so much as laid eyes on you
---
Paladins actually got to play the game instead of using healbot and trying not to fall asleep
---
Shamans finally got the reworks that had been promised since like 1.6 
---
Ice lance felt phenomenal for mages
---
Tbc had flaws for sure, but most of the classes felt fantastic and powerful but they still felt very unique. And at the end of the day having a character that feels powerful,  unique and responsive was more important to me than the things we lost
---
The PvP titles were connected to your rank. [Here's a guide that explains it in detail](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html).
---
It's not too bad as long as you enjoy doing battleground. Put in a few hours a day and you will get there in some months.
---
Wow i need that.
---
Problem is that all servers are dominated by one faction on retail
---
Another repost
---
Yeah it definitely isn't 5-0-46 or whatever you'd consider full PvE Restoration. I think the major stuff you lose compared to being full Resto is Gift of Nature and Swiftmend. However, if 0-30-21 can do 80% of the healing a full Resto does, that isn't bad at all.
---
Work decided this year to make us take all our annual leave (vacation days). I had 7 weeks saved up, so I put in for a few different parts of the year, but I made sure I have from July 29th to August 26th off in hopes that it comes out in that period and I can nolife it a bit.
---
Well aware of that. I was referring to the spike in revived accounts would possibly help show them how anticipated Classic is.
---
Ohhh okay I misunderstood
---
A server with Brits and Scandinavians is my dream haha. Ofcourse other Western European country's are a great addition too (I am Dutch myself). Everyone has the same mentality and most if not everyone can speak English to a degree where you can communicate in a hardcore environment.
---
I totally forgot the French had their own servers, I have quit for a while now.
---
Gonna have a very different playerbase in vanilla on any given server compared to retail. Also that's pretty much inevitable, so it's a bit of a nonunique argument.
---
An unexpected funding of 600,000 dollars from an original request of 10,000 dollars I find it absolutely distasteful the book will cost 50 dollars. Unrealistic
---
Have you got an image with female characters perchance?
---
Yeah, it bothers me a lot too. Streamers and their personal armies are one thing that really grinds my gears.
---
So, who's up for cataloging streamers and realms after reveal then? :P
---
Every raid set in wows history has been flashy in one aspect or another.
---
Even your ideal set has big red stripes on it, an obviously impractical addition for stealth. Out of all the things that make current wow bad, flashy glowy armor isn't one of them imo.
---
Did you get the Scarab Lord or just finished the quest chain?
---
Is it new? No BiS for a lot of specs in there.
---
every night after school/work, with maybe some longer sessions on weekends.
---
you could even manage a normal life with that schedule. there certainly was a lot less competition ~2004 for your attention.
---
Records a duel but turns off the UI so you can't even see their HP.
---
This is truly top tier content.
---
"Fans of Warcraft...we hear you." 
---
That's an apology right there. 
---
As to whether he was wrong or not, that will be determined after Classic's launch. None of us, not even Blizzard themselves, know how successful Classic will be. It could be a hit. It could be a niche. No-one knows. Private server numbers are largely irrelevant because playing there costs nothing, whereas Classic will have a fee. Plenty of people will play something for free but baulk at spending money on it.
---
Why not tell them you don't want to play retail? Better yet, assert your dominance and tell them to play classic with you.
---
People cared, just not you.
---
HW and GM gear/weapons are some of the most iconic designs in the game - probably because of the grind
---
You're probably thinking of Gloves of the Swarm and Boots of the Desert Protector (AQ20 loot, looks the same as old paladin T2).
---
T2 shoulders are worse then T1, however with full set bonus of 8/8 T2 it should be better than T1 (depends on proc rate, but most likely).
---
people are lambasting you, but the reset WAS a big deal back then.
---
i flipped my main from my alliance hunter to a new belf paladin, specifically because it was like starting from zero. leveling from 1-60 was still a chore, but it was like a month to get to outland then another month to get to karazan from there.
---
Patches doesn‚Äôt follow that logic
---
lol "fair wpvp"
---
that's a good one.
---
I'm looking forward to seeing how the gamers of today handle the ganking. It will be glorious.
---
I think there should be a scenario for every raid that shows the lore perspective on how the raid works out that doesnt have any rewards at all. So the casual player get to see the story happen and be up to date, lfr on the other hand i really cant see a single reason for its existence to be justified
---
There's a bug that prevents you from undoing talents in certain scenarios. Not sure why or which scenario specifically, cba to investigate too much. I think it has something to do with going to far down the tree it stops allowing you to undo those talents if you try to reset 10 or more points.
---
I was tossing around points in the ret tree when it happened.
---
You should look at some Wotlk pserver, literally 40% paladin on some.
---
less than 1% of progression raiding guilds cleared naxx. *most* guilds were at best BWL / AQ40 geared.
---
I hope they pay homage to Nost and the other vanilla private servers that helped achieve this feat.
---
I don't think anymore than 8 weeks.
---
Around July 20 then i guess. The european "industrial" vacation is around that time.
---
Nice man. 
---
I think the BWL one could use a little work though. I don't think the blue lettering really goes with the theme. 
---
Everything else is spot on though.
---
Believe what you will. :)
---
Shhh, don't give them ideas.
---
I disagree.
---
That sounds pretty awesome honestly. Hopefully I can get that lucky lol.
---
It is not really shitting on non vanilla. Sure not 100% gear was useless, but over 95% for sure.
---
Eck, wowhead
---
Take that T16, remove the spikes on the shoulders, make the helm a little less extra, and you basically have a set of quest greens from any expansion.
---
Motorcycle cash shop here we go.
---
Let alone wolf's head helm.. a level 40 blue helm being insanely good still in BC for ferals, just because of the stupid energy gain on it.
---
[Major Version].[Minor Version]
---
cloak of shadows is the perfect example of why TBC class changes were a joke
---
rogues could already take most classes 1v1 esp if they got the jump. Now you give them a "remove all debuff" and *90% resist for 5 sec*? on a 2 min cd. please.
---
I appreciate devs tried to create more content but *nothing* tops vanilla's balance
---
Yeah that was why I could never get into the game when blizzard committed to bi-annual expansions. Like what‚Äôs the point if your progress is effectively erased 12 months from now.
---
It's because influential devs from EQ despised hybrids and intentionally gimped them halfway through the development process when they were brought onto the team. They wanted healers and healers alone, so they intentionally made sure that alt specs either wouldn't have integral role tools (sustain and threat reduction for damage specs, taunt for Prot Pallies) and would therefore fall behind on average. A *really* good hybrid player would be about as functional in a raid as a completely average DPS class.
---
Yeah, let‚Äôs just ignore experience of millions who played retail TBC and WotLK and talk about some specific pserver.
---
Lwer/skinner is great for early especially because shaking salt for cured rugged hides will be great money early on. Eventually if you are heavy into PvP/ at the aq40 stage you will want to pick up engineering for skinning. But i would always keep leatherworking shaking that salt can net you a constant 14 to all the way up to 50g per cured rugged hide ( this 50g price per is very early and at certain raid tiers as well as naxx early.) 
---
In short Leatherworking is great you can go one of three specs all are useful and will help you especially while raiding.
---
Tier 0 got replaced pretty quick. Tier 1 lasted until 63ish, tier 1 mid to late 60's, and tier 3 was good right up until end game with some pieces sticking around for quite a while.
---
This happened in Wrath, too. Sunwell gear lasted through tier 7 and into tier 8. Cataclysm put a stop to this trend pretty fast though, with blizzard for whatever reason wanting people to drop their epics as fast as possible. This is where last expansion's work really started to not matter anymore and why item levels jump so dramatically at the start of each expansion.
---
Very well summarized OP.
---
Because each armor type shares the same model and is just a recolor.
---
I'm up for a server list pre launch, give us something else to talk about.
---
If be up for new names too, all specific to something in the vanilla world, van cleef, blackfathom, Lakeshire, etc etc. I don't know why but I'd like the idea of stuff like illidan and alakir and magtheridon being left out. Give us a new flavour, sprinkle some more vanilla ontop of our vanilla ice cream.
---
Stone guardians drop guardian stones needed for these 10 items https://classicdb.ch/?item=12809#reagent-for definately not a worthless mob by the way.
---
Pretty sure they were always just placeholders and not the actual "original designs".
---
Tbc didn't really do much for spec balance. It certainly helped, but not by a lot. Some specs (looking at you in particular, Retribution) still weren't good for much of anything.
---
I believe mine is a bit more cynical than that but when I was leveling my first mage back in 2006 I was running VC with a PuG and would need on everything and just disenchant it infront of everyone because I thought that was the best move for some reason.... Young me was an asshole.
---
One one private server, they buffed all the value of boss (health and damage) by 30%, still got cleared day 1  by hardcore guilds (except KT who was bugged and had wotlk value but cleared as well as soon as it was fixed)
---
I used to play on Greekjuros (Genjuros). I was a kid back then, but i never experienced the Greeks to be of a negative influence directly. The only issue was that you can't communicate with them because they can't/won't speak English. Those who did were always friendly!
---
Wait, there are no pvp servers in retail?
---
Give him an armory link?
---
Take the information with a grain of salt. A lot of the information is BIS-adjacent or flat out worse. Mage, for instance, does not want Inventor's Focal Sword for pre-bis; there are like 5 better options (Frozen Wrath green dagger, Witchblade, Mindcarver etc).
---
When the PvP system first launched, it was hugely flawed and the only way to make progress at rank 11+ was to be ranked #1 on your server every week for a month, which meant 16+ hours per day, every single day. If you slipped to #2, you lost all of your progress. The grind was insanely unforgivable.
---
Then Blizzard realized the system was broken and made it more forgiving for ranks 6-14 in Patch 1.8. It was still a long grind, but not completely insane anymore.
---
Some of the baaad horror stories are from pre-patch 1.8.
---
OK :-)
---
**Looking for an  EU PVP server HORDE guild, that does raiding + PVP**  
---
* **Timezone:** GMT (england)
---
* **Raid Times:** 2-3 nights per week 6-7 pm gmt+0/+1 for 2-4 hours would be ideal
---
* **Server:** PvP server only
---
* **Faction:** Horde
---
I will be maining an Holy priest for the entire time of classic, I will only make only one alt and that will be for money making via hunter farming. Looking for a guild that has previous exprience in raiding, preferably in vanila, i my self only raided ZG a few times since i joined quite late into vanila, however I have experienced nearly every raid since ignoring the latest new released ones. , ( [https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/sylvanas/bootytoucher](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/sylvanas/bootytoucher) for my achievements ) my old warlock, did complete cutting edge guldan   (check achievments and date) but was constantly changing characters for roster needs) havent played wow in a while so i cant remember my other names, erh, lol. (ive grown up since, the name will not be bootytoucher LMFAO... thats what you get when you let other people name your characters)
---
26 years old if age is a concern
---
;)
---
Internal Alpha just recently started. Beta will soon follow. Nothing to worry about at all yet.
---
One of my favorite pieces of rogue gear was a blue you get from questing in sillithis. It was this headwrap that basically covered your entire face with bandages and somehow it was leather. Can't remember what it was called. Does anyone know what the hell I'm talking about or am I just insane?
---
Not real ninja-ing (I just took it when no-one needed it), but I had a full pet-heal equipment (and for in-combat weapons only with +healing).
---
Same for me, i am  Scandinavian. My fondest memory of people in wow had been crazy, loud, brits. You cant do anything but love them.
---
Wow, the shaman set is literally what I used as my transmog in Legion except the helmet. That's interesting.
---
Rogues that glow in the dark lol
---
We downvoting people that are liking retail and playing classic when it comes out?
---
Man, what are you even talking about. MC and Ony were in the first major content patch. WoW had 40-man raids almost immediately after release, and the 20-mans didn't come until later in Vanilla.
---
If you want to just do 5-mans, then just do 5-mans. I highly doubt you'll be incapable of achieving that goal. Leave raids for raiders if you dislike them.
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/b/b2/Nightslayer_Armor.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20100713204025
---
the red is pretty dark.  obviously you're going to have SOME colour and interesting stuff to look at so there has to be leeway, and red is a reasonable colour to have on something stealthy since it's only really going to be visible under white or red light.  its completely different to something that is emitting light rather than reflecting SOME
---
By your post it seems you were not a fan of classic honestly. Noone forces you to raid, just stick to the dungeons and pvp then you wont have to worry about 40 man raids. But toning down gear from a 40 man raid to be closer to 5 man loot would certainly kill the server. Adding heroics, new areas, and arenas? Just go play TBC.
---
I mean in retail WotLK Pala did hold a majority in all raids. They were the best tank, healer, and one of the top DPS. Blizz has been notoriously bad at balancing hybrid chars over the years.
---
They are intentionally keeping us on edge, it's a super dick move but keeps the hype up....
---
No, Blizzard always announce games or expansions around 2-4 months before release date. Major games a bit earlier (4 months approx) and minor releases closer. So if it's released mid to late june, expect them to announce it during May.
---
Sounds like you're asking for TBC...
---
I have the same goal. I'm unsure I'll have the consistency of available time to fit raid schedules but I reckon I can give 15-20 hours a week to the game, so my aim is R10 for the PvP set.
---
I remember a motherload of people having maladath on my server in vanilla   and I raided for over a year on feenix and never seen one drop.
---
I thought the same thing, but I‚Äôm assuming it was because certain specs weren‚Äôt viable like enhancement isn‚Äôt there, neither is arms though which was better than fury most of the time back then
---
Only saw one drop in vanilla and I killed Broodlord every reset from BWL was released. Sometimes RNG just fucks you.
---
This is probably the only quest IG that is a bit on the hard side yet accessible even to casuals, it just take time.
---
I wish there were many more quests like this.
---
Absolutely awful designs almost all of them. Like some kid did them.
---
Yupp this. Items are actually known and legendary, I feel transmog is the dumbest thing ever since it completely removed this aspect from the game.
---
Jeez what a mess
---
I was a human prot paladin running around in stranglethorn on a pvp server. I was mid-30's, and decided to head to booty bay to empty my bags.
---
A tauren a few levels higher than me started following me around town, and i ended up on top of a roof looking down at him trying to get up. Feelimg safe, i /danced with him and went to grab a drink.
---
When i got back, he had made it to the roof and was also dancing. Right in my face, actually. I cant remember if i took the screen shot because i thought it was funny, or because i felt lucky he didn't kill me while i was afk, but the timing ended up just perfect. I took it right as the tauren was in his little side to side shuffle, knees together, leaning over a bit. My human male was doing that kick part of his dance.
---
It looked like i had just kicked that tauren in the balls. I didn't stop finding that pictuew funny, ever. I wish i still had it.
---
LFG was global at some point in vanilla
---
Aaah, revenge-needing was the best part of vanilla.
---
I can't see this happening.
---
I liked it even though I'm not against sharding for the newbie zones.
---
How stupid do you think they are?
---
They'll end up losing revenue by introducing stuff like that to Classic, because all the people who only resubbed to WoW for Classic will just be gone again.
---
Unless something changes, I believe their intent is to host our toons forever regardless.
---
We have not even started summer season, yet you still loose hope. We know how Blizzard works if its not done, they wont tell us, when they are ready they will release, we will get word of it.   
---
We have been waiting over a decade to play vanilla again, we will still wait on it, even if it is delayed.
---
Don't give them ideas, I can see them do it xD.
---
My guild did. Also my guild cared and knew rogues t2 shoulders were worse than t1. People need to stop this "nobody cares about how you played so you can just roll a spellpower arcane shot hunter!"
---
All guilds weren't full of bad players without knowledge.
---
Not worried at all. It'll come eventually.
---
I doubt the buzz will die down.
---
I stacked reckoning and looked for people sitting down in booty bay afk.
---
Not that either.
---
Stormshroud is a crafted set, costs a shitton of mats and was amazeballs prior to 1.12 itemization. Recipes drop from the elemental invasions afaik.
---
Zandalar Madcap was the rogue ZG set.
---
&gt; The only issue was that you can't communicate with them because they can't/won't speak English. 
---
It seems kinda a issue to me, I didn't mean they are not friendly but it could be bad to be in a server where the main language in general chat/lfg is one you don't understand.
---
I also really hope you are wrong. And I don't think Blizz would do this.
---
I believe this is the case for Diablo 2 but I highly doubt it would happen for WoW and if it did it would probably be waaay down the line
---
I did the almost the same!  Raided as a dwarf paladin in vanilla.  Guild fell apart and rerolled horde with some friends as they really wanted a paladin.  Made it very easy to leave a full T2/2.5 character when the the gear you built up didn't matter.  I didn't raid much outside of 10 mans because of that.
---
T16 was a very wonky tier for everyone, probably to fit that "made by titans" shit.  
---
  It somewhat fits the classes but you have to make the connection, just take the weird mouth thing for a titan esque bandana plus the dagger looking shoulders and belt.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I remember the shaman T0 set, specifically the helm, use to look like the beast masters helm at some point til it got an update look. I mained shamy early in my wow days, and I remember coming to this realization at some point but it was updated before I ever got my coif of elements.
---
2.0 had so much good shit for classes...i sort of wish they would implement it in classic as it was supposed to bd
---
Our Retail toons, sure. What stops them from doing this for a free service they provide?
---
Naxx was a bit easier to do at 70 though. :)
---
Why? Most recent decisions of AB is revenue focused with 0 interest in fan satisfaction
---
priest and mage looks like green quest items
---
Diablo Immortal proves how stupid they are.
---
They look better than the current retail sets
---
If it really was anytime soon there would be a release date by now ZzZ. I‚Äôm betting on September as well lol
---
How about we just stick to making it vanilla. How about that?
---
I dont think Activition, has claim on Classic. They started to buy shares when Blizzard was in TBC.   
---
So vanilla still would be under Blizzards Copyright, not Activision/Blizzard ? Or is that not how it works ?
---
I really want to main a warrior but I refuse to play fury with leather. This BIS shit sucks.
---
Cleared it yes, but how many got stuck at 4h with the rest cleared? How many cleared 1 - 2 wings? Naxx isn't as hard as people think it is. Nor was it at the time either. Sure it was harder than AQ but it's not some insane skillcap on the place. Some bosses would be very hard at the time and some were even then moderate at best.
---
Ok thanks for the info if i can't find the video i'll try to reproduce this by myself.
---
Do you remember wher the chest was ? +/-
---
They have confirmed a classic summer in both the blue posts and most recently the earnings call which was just last week. Remember that they don't view classic as a frontrun release which is the reason for no advertisement and stuff like that. 
---
I'm sure there will be more updates soon after the internal alpha testing and they're sure the most basic stuff is working just fine.
---
Hmmm, actually thinking...
---
For years now everybody knew winter was coming, so summer had to end at some point right?
---
But now GOT will end, so winter will either never come, or it will be there for good, correct?
---
So for those who are not still not sleeping, it means summer will never end or it will never come.
---
Conclusion: Blizzard can either take all the time they want to release Classic, or even never release it!
---
Waut is killing me :'(
---
You could make a good argument that for swords a rogue wants 8/8 T2. The proc is verybstrgon for them with their extra chances at attacks. It would also be strong for dagger rogues, but they need to wear Aged Core Leather Gloves for +weapon skill and so the two other pieces of T2 which they drop are shoulders (for T1) and boots (for Boots od the Shadow Flame).
---
Out of curiosity, what mmos have pulled something like this in the past?
---
Do the math and get back to us. Right now your ‚Äútesting‚Äù is useless.
---
While herbalism is indeed good for druids, the tauren racial is not significant at all. I guess you can pick earthroot from the beginning which is kinda nice.
---
Don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works. They bought the franchise.
---
What are blue posts?
---
Speaking as someone who paid 72 dollars for it having it shipped to Europe I can tell you it is without a doubt worth 50 bucks. It is extremely well put together with a ton of high quality pictures and packed with information and trivia that you will love if you are a fan of Classic WoW. Without a doubt the best book I ever had.
---
Blizzard added Russian (and Spanish) servers with the launch of WotLK, and Italien and Portugies after Cata.
---
So. IDK about those ones.
---
Not worried but thirsty for more info.
---
I'd definitely agree with you here.  The creation of new content definitely requires a significantly higher amount of money compared to what it is taking to restore classic.  
---
As far as a pricing model goes for the work put in, I could see charging a ~15-20$ up front costs considering the work put in, but the outcry of paying for a game that was essentially already created would definitely significantly detract from any exposure.
---
Instead, they are attempting to regain subs with Classic, which makes a lot of sense.  There has been tons of drop off over the years simply because the appeal for retail is vastly different than for the appeal of earlier iterations.  With the minimal work that would be needed to maintain (there would be much less needed for bug fixing and the community doesn't want new features), it wouldn't take long to start generating profits. 
---
Additionally, if it takes off and subs don't plateau then the potential to iterate on classic again in the future, whether it be re-releasing other expansions or developing new content with the classic style game design, could definitely provide an avenue to branch out and create a separate revenue stream.
---
Replying just to save. What a phenomenal take on Vanilla-TBC balance. Thank you!
---
Ultima Online is one example. You keep only 1 toon if you move on a free account, but lose all belongings in bank / house / boat, as well as boat &amp; house itself.
---
ofc they wanna cash in, wait 6 months and it'll be 9.99 bucks.
---
This is your fear?  You need anxiety meds man, they benefit 0% by deleting toon databases.  Worry about real life
---
Wholesome a f.
---
Hope you are right.
---
I won Ironfoe on my paladin.
---
Worried that these posts will continue to pop up all day long
---
Please stop binding your WotLK pserver experience to the real game.
---
DKs were really strong for a major time period, but not so much to make everyone want to reroll DK.
---
Palas had no dominance in raids.
---
Prot-heal hybrid pala build was PITA in PVP, but not OP.
---
Why the fuck would they do that? If they start deleting characters that will just make sure that players will NEVER come back. It would be the  dumbest decision ever.
---
Beautiful! They must have seen this thread ;)
---
Excessive hunger and loss of appetite? Truly hell.
---
Never said I was afraid :) They also lose nothing. They only stand to benefit.
---
Sunwell gear certainly did not last into tier 8, it was immediately replaced by all Naxx gear and most ilevel 200 blues.
---
I only played the last 6mo of vanilla, reaching level 52(I think) before I re-rolled in TBC with a girl I was dating at the time and some friends.  Yes, Belves 'cause they're oh so pretty.
---
One of the most memorable interactions was when we were running Blood Furnace and picked up some random Boomkin to fill out our group.  As the years rolled by, that Boomkin became one of my best friends IRL and we ended up meeting our future wives through each other.
---
June of lucky
---
July Is ok
---
August : kill me
---
This was the answer I was looking for. yet again I will be wonder about what to play till classic then figure it out then. Thank you for every word you wrote thanks bunch
---
You say that, but I guarantee you that there will be people that will 100% commit to this. Sort of a safety net for Activision.
---
Also keep in mind that it's only BiS for cat dps. It's really terrible for tanking
---
Wow.  Cant believe you took the time to write all this
---
This is such a fucking stupid view. I like vanilla as much as the next person, but if you force hybrids to do shit DPS then the end result is that they don‚Äôt even get to come to raids as DPS. As you can clearly see from vanilla raiding.
---
I think this dropoff is assuming that people will baby rage out of the game, but I dont think that's true just a pessimistic stance.
---
I think the numbers will retain, but people will play it *real* casually.
---
Is that a horse? Sloth!
---
We need more demands all the time
---
Yea the pserver thing helped for a while, now I just want Classic obv
---
theres a dope gun in aq40
---
To give people new carrots to chase.
---
Isn't the Zandalari Madcap set pretty much this stuff?
---
DAE think Activision will threaten to send masked men to our homes if we drop our subscriptions?
---
That's why you put it in a paper bag and then ring their doorbell. The try to stomp out the paper bag ;)
---
Regardless of what they do after the initial clear of content, it seems as if they are committed to preserving the vanilla state of the game.  Additionally, once all the work goes into recreating vanilla, the amount it would take to maintain classic servers would ensure profit even with a smaller regular community.  
---
You talk about ruining popular franchises, but the idea for creating things like Diablo 3 is to create a game that keeps up with current gaming trends while attempting to maintain the feel of the previous games.  It's a completely different mindset from trying to recreate a previous state of a game.
---
Shhht, that‚Äôs Phase 3. We iron the details out later
---
yeah that‚Äôs how i remember it too
---
Wait till you cross the 40 threshold. This is the time when your body reminds you how much you mistreated it in the past. If you don't have to get surgery you probably did OK :o
---
I don't even think that T16 set looks all that bad there has definitely been worse.
---
A lot worse than Ashjre'Thul. But hey, means less competition.
---
Friend gets a green before you, suicide?
---
Please don't, those old monitors are extremely eye destroying...
---
The gloves still exist. Flameguard Gauntlets.
---
I'll have to make the trip down.. I've been avoiding tanking after my past few experiences with the elite PServer community. 
---
Warlocks that run forward and pull with Banish, Priests that throw a renew at 50% and keep wanding, Mages that nova mobs on top of the healer... it's been awful.
---
Here‚Äôs a counterpoint:  Blizzard customer service can and does restore wow characters going back as far as FOURTEEN YEARS ago.
---
I don't remember it that way, but it was a long time ago, maybe you are right :)
---
Hey we're both the same age. I don't feel so old now ! :-)
---
Not comparable to the WoW situation at all. 
---
And also not stupid from a business POV because what revenue are they losing because of the DI outrage? None. Ruining Classic on the other hand will cost them the additional subs they're going for in the first place.
---
I was in a guild and we had just downed onyxia, the Guild leader did a raid roll for the ony bag and I just happened to win the roll. He quickly removed me from the group and gave the bag to another member. Needless to say, I had more friends in the guild than the guild leader so everyone blasted him for doing that. He ended up giving guild leader to my friend and left the guild lol.
---
A priest needed Ironfoe and won it over my warrior
---
That is all I can remember because I start seeing red
---
I only leveled a druid to lvl 6, but I still want to keep going haha.
---
I didn‚Äôt quit live WoW due to the BfA content or anything - I just wasn‚Äôt having fun anymore as it has slowly evolved into a completely different game. Vanilla though brought me right back to the TBC style I loved, even if I know I‚Äôll never have the time/dedication I did back in college
---
Do yourself a favor and wait until they announce the release date.
---
Holy shit obviously money is their main concern, but it wasn't in their intention on looking into it until the community pushed it. Of course the deciding factor was based on the income it would generate. That doesn't mean classic was not influenced by the community at all.
---
Absolutely, worth every penny.
---
Cheaper option.. /Ignore your old guild mates, how will they know you ignored them if they don't see you online or use the offline feature as you will still be online for classic but offline for battlenet
---
People randomly returning to the game in droves after a new patch or content release is a big revenue maker whether you think so or not.  Deleting characters would hurt that spike.  So how again do they benefit?
---
July/August are popular vacation months here. The toxic work&gt;vacation/holiday culture here is another matter, but I find when I was a kid we always went on vacation right before going back to school, to get stress free before stressful days of acclimation.
---
Even permanently banned characters marked as DNR are not even deleted.
---
honestly, gettin a full t2/t2.5 set (close if not better than r14 gear), is way easier and less time consuming. So yeah , you rank for prestige or because u really hate pve.
---
What server did you play on? I‚Äôve never tried a private server ever in my life.. no idea how to do it either..
---
I‚Äôm from EU so if anyone could help me get on a private server that would be great.
---
So how do you explain the glowing codpiece?
---
Its like this sometimes. We had 8 DFTs in our guild on ND but only 1 rejuv gem until now and not a single mish.
---
What we could hope for is a more classic-inspired Retail.
---
Classic. There will be no new content release after the phases are done. Retail character will never be deleted, sure. No benefit there. Classic is how they‚Äôll keep their hardcore base. So that WoW will never be threatened to be lower than ~2mil subs
---
Honestly this is pretty much the only time grinding out rank 14 makes sense. If you're confined to a bed and can't physically move much. 
---
If you're moderately able-bodied and can support yourself this shit just isn't worth it.
---
Is the sidebar link kept up to date when new blue posts occur?
---
Not sure bro. I just looked through all the quest rewards from Silithis and all the leather helms around that level and saw nothing from Silithus. Maybe you got it somewhere else? Was it pre-60?
---
Light‚Äôs Hope. It‚Äôs easy - download the 1.12 client(I play on a Mac so it‚Äôs a bit trickier, but should be able to find this fairly easily via Google) and then edit the realmlist file with the server address for the private server
---
As I said, trying to fit the made by titan theme.  
---
  Not saying it's good.
---
As I stated, in RETAIL paladins were top tier across the board. I never touched P-servers and we had 25m heroic icecrown citadel on farm. Prot pallies put out 30k+ dps while being incredibly resilient. Prot pallies could 75% heal in one cast and were used with disc priests for easy clears. Ret pallies were in the upper tier of the dps meters always.
---
Sunwell gear with triple sockets and some trinkets absolutely made it into ulduar.
---
That genuinely isn't true
---
counter-counterpoint - that‚Äôs old blizzard. activision blizzard is money hungry. they care about profit, revenue, margins and shit like that. 
---
also, i am not saying this WILL happen. I am concerned it might happen. I am trying to see what the rest of the community thinks.
---
I waa checking the bis for Holy palad√≠n... All the gear Is cloth AND leather even in naxx.. i wont roll for bis in Classic i feel bad taking gear from Mages or priest
---
Do you mean mitigation?
---
Dont you all have phones?
---
Swede here, same boat as you. Brits and Dutch together with scandianavians are the true dream. Always a good vibe in groups together with these people.
---
Now you‚Äôre getting it!
---
the downvotes... trying to incite some sort of a discussion - i obviously don‚Äôt want for this to happen.
---
No. An announcement of a release date any time this month would be ample time and in keeping with their own usual timelines. There's still 4 weeks left in this month and there's usually *some sort* of bluepost every week, so I don't feel like we're running out of time yet.
---
This has been the case since WotLK, but I miss required cc in dungeons and threat.
---
Since we know that all dungeon items will be at their 1.10 versions for classic this site is very outdate especially for casters and healers
---
Classic will be just worse version of this.
---
What classic will be is Vanilla mobs, quests, zones etc. on retail client and servers with sharding, bugs, latency, terrible performance etc.
---
Exactly man, fuck getting paid and doing what you want in life.
---
People who think enhancement has any kind of mobility are thinking about TBC enhancement. Definitely not vanilla. 1 sec cast time on the worst iteration of Ghost Wolf ever. No inherent movement speed bonus. Enhancement is terrible.
---
I keep wondering about this.  I feel like the point at which a player starts classic(given that they've never played vanilla) then realizes "ok, this is actually badass" is when they get their first talent point and pop it in to their tree of choice.  Right then and there, theyre brain lights up.   
---
But on the other hand, i feel like when they start to get into the lvl 30 range and leveling is a huge time investment, they start to wonder how the fuck theyre going to find the time to lvl to 60!    I dont know!  But it can only go two ways... grind it out or stay a lowbie.  But god damn does it feel good hitting cap in vanilla.
---
I literally had to look up what DAoC was, is it worth trying out for shits a giggles? lol
---
I work in a secure building. So not on me during the day :(
---
Keyhole on the peehole
---
Every guild gave Maladaths to dps. CTS and Maladath was *the* BWL combo every rogue wanted. Most tanks just stuck with Quel because of how epic it was getting that sword.
---
This is correct
---
man classic will save me so much money. since i won't be looking at any other game for at least the 1st 6 months till i have a well established character and leveling an alt in the mid 40s. 15$ a month is nothing when you can play 40+ hours a week and not run out of things to do.
---
So for the 1st half year of classic instead of playing 2-3 games a month (so typically  3x 60$ a month, i will be paying 30$ a month for me and my little brother and playing together and enjoying every freaking second.
---
All indications that I‚Äôve seen is this could not be further from the truth. The development team seems dedicated to providing a true vanilla experience, and they‚Äôve earned our trust to this point IMO
---
It is. But its very niche with its hardcore fans. I dont recommend live servers. If you dont like large scale pvp avoid it. Its based on it.
---
Wow. These are real bad haha
---
I don't know, but you can find these stats on the current popular vanilla servers out there. I think that should give you a good indication of the ratios that's gonna be in wow classic
---
I can only speak for MC-BWL-ZG, but the content is really easy. It can easily be 30-manned and 15-manned respectively. If you got by that logic, you can easily afford to bring a ret.
---
Problem is that it slows the group down, compared to bringing a warrior.
---
Sorry, had to do it:
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj\_QD4a4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyOj_QD4a4)
---
Hehe yeah I definitely remember gawking at one of the first premades on Ely having like three BREs a month after server release.
---
Looks &gt; a few stats that won't matter.
---
If your goal is a smooth release, to allow tourists to have a good idea (in regard to the amount of friends/enemies in single area) of what classic will look like for the majority of existence - and stick around because of that - then sharding sounds appropriate.  That same person is likely not to stick around if they think the whole game is going to be waiting around for 10 minutes watching the vets tag the only mobs as soon as they spawn.  And that's assuming that the game is playable with all those people in one location.
---
Not everyone cares whether classic gets the attraction of players who havn't played it before, but that's the best way to show blizzard that using old-school design philosophies still works today.
---
I played nostalrius for a bit and I had a hella good time, I was even having a good time grinding rogue poison skillups. Can't wait for classic, bfa was just not doing it for me.
---
Shh let the commenters be outraged
---
You are ready right now, don't spoil yourself. ppl would pay to erase their memory/knowledge and reexperience it fresh again being total noobs.
---
I assume you are worried you mess up something, and that you need to know things ahead of time, "to be ready" but you really dont.  wow is very accessible straightforward game, but deep at the same time. Thats how it got so popular, right. being very easy to pick up and dive into. you don't really need anything. don't stress about it.
---
for lore you can watch/play warcraft 3 (and addons) campaign, rts game. Wow classic is the follow up to the events there. aswell as races and the main characters of the story so you get familiar with the world. 
---
if don't want to play, you can watch some palythrough or look up warcraft 3 lore summary on youtube.
---
As for classiclore you suppose to discover it as you play. At first its suppose to be mysterious and unknown, that you discover and figure out bit by bit as you move through the game.
---
Yupp. They were placeholders all along.
---
Well, priests got more armor through Inner Fire, so melee priest was obviously a thing! /s
---
I think you'll look back on your years and appreciate a fulfilled life.
---
No mish here either, doesn't matter now since AQ is out with T2.5 I guess. We've also only had one tear and one staff of the shadowflame. But we've had like 20 black ash robes...
---
\&gt; **If you are jack-of-all-trade class you should NOT be able to compete for top with all 3**.
---
You realize that most hybrid dps in TBC didn't compete with the pure dps as the expansion scaled right?  You also realize that having 3 dps specs give you the ability to adapt to different fight profiles?
---
I feel sorry for your brother.
---
Not sure what is worse. Sitting there as a 9-year-old, or now sitting there as a 20 something while you talk about him experiencing his 'first 60', 'first epic', etc. like he's some kind of padawan.
---
don't like it? don't play hybrid.
---
you feel entitled to be able to play a Pally or Druid, and be the BEST tank, BEST heals, **and** BEST DPS? Lol fuck off.
---
This is literally what the dev's intended. That's why pally tier sets are for healing.
---
You *should* be average or below at the other classes, and excel at only one class. Which is exactly what vanilla achieved.
---
If you want to raid as pally dps or tank as a shammy or some gay shit, go play retail. You'll fit right in with the other crybabies
---
fuk, never got that spiky fish sword
---
jelly
---
I know 4 HWL comming back to retail, but i also know they could never do it again. They have jobs and family now.   
---
When they got HWL they where young and had time to pvp 15h+/day 7days/week for months after months. If you dont have that kind of time, aim for a more realistic goal.
---
I played a druid in vanilla, they weren't competitive at shit until the big talent rework that came 3/4 of the way into vanilla, literally all you were brought for was motw, br and innervate. Even after the rework "competitive" was a stretch, nobody was farming crowd pummers and powershifting back then. Moonkin was still a joke, and again mcps weren't really a thing so bear tanks still werent exactly common
---
Can anyone quantify the difference (or else qualify) of having or not having engineering on each class, pve and pvp? I'd rather not have a profession slot taken up on each character I have and need help choosing which ones to not have the profession on.
---
Will be more popular than BFA because it is a objectively better game in literally every way possible.
---
His first Kickstarter for it was something like 200K to 400K. He paired it back for a relaunch... Which ended up beating his original Kickstarter's goal.
---
That site is not up to date. Healer shield for T3 Prot Warrior?
---
So we healers have the Mages to thank for that disgusting turquoise AQ robe, huh?
---
Druid  
---
Extremely underplayed class and you are sort after by groups, raids and guilds (if you are healer).
---
Very strong in pvp as any spec really.
---
Warlock
---
Free lvl 40 mount  
---
Scale into absolute monsters with t2 onwards.
---
He got Menethil mixed up I think, I remember waiting for a couple of boats haha. He was only a few weeks further into the game than me I think
---
I couldn't agree more. Other than community, I most excited about no gear treadmill. I hate how retail handles gear... does anyone really care about getting a new item anymore? I want to put in the time to get my character as geared as I can and then just have fun in the game! Progression for the sake of progression stops being interesting really, really fast.
---
Yeah IIRC the first two bosses in BWL are a bit of a test, but if you can clear those two, you pretty much cruise right to Chromaggus.
---
Last week in August/ first week in September
---
That's r/classicwow for the past 3+ months, zero effort rehashed memes (dude stv lol!!!!), retail circlejerks, putting every tiny piece of vanilla on an individual pedestal as the greatest design decision known to man. And all this trash is guaranteed hundreds of points, it's just embarrassing.
---
It's not "the original design". These are placeholders, which has been stated before.
---
&gt; you realize that most hybrid dps in TBC didn't compete with the pure dps 
---
pally's were absolute trucks in DPS at some points, and still topped in heals/tank as well.
---
from vanilla onward, focus classes like rogue or mage got gimped because hybrids allowed a hugely varied playstyle and still let you compete with top. It's why hybrid popularity shot up from TBC onward
---
I feel like we should use that for when people first wanted LFG and LFR. It was nice, but didn't realize it would kill one of the aspects that so many people liked from the early years
---
Bear is the best dungeon tank. And actually, rDruid is the last choice for a dungeon healer due to the lack of normal res. 
---
On the other side warrior dps outside raids or raid-likes (LBRS/UBRS) is rarely considered. Mainly because their lack of utility (which is basically slapping a shield and tank) and the fact the tank is likely to be another warrior (so, competition for the same items, usually denying an invite for it).
---
Rogue t2 8/8 bonus is nerfed on private servers bc of salty noobs
---
Oof
---
\#RELEASEIT :p
---
lol yes
---
I'd love to see a Warrior in the migration set :D
---
Skull of Impending Doom, AB boots with speed on them, Nifty Stopwatch etc.
---
That's my point. You aren't supposed to be amazing at all your specs in raiding. Your tier sets were for healing. In PvE you excel at a healer. This was an intended decision. 
---
You could still absolutely *crush* in PvP and WPvP as druid.
---
If your RetPaladin was in the upper tier of the DPS meters, your guild had too much players who watchted TV while raiding, sorry. Same goes for Shadow Priests in WotLK.
---
However, Paladin was in fact overplayed in WotLK-Retail, that is correct. And why? Because it was the FIRST Expansion where Paladin was good in any role. They were good healers even in Dungeons (No, Paladins were shitty healers in Dungeons in Vanilla and TBC, people forget that cause of "Muh efficiency" in raids), awesome tanks and finally viable DPS with AoE-Cleave.
---
If you wait five years for your favorite holy-warrior class fantasy to come through, ofc everyone and his mother plays ret.
---
https://aablain.github.io/wow-classic-survey/
---
There's one rank 14 person every week on every server, right? You only need to hit it once.
---
Let's be honest, if that T16 set had been part of vanilla it would be far from the worst tier set. Would probably even be among the pretty highly regarded.
---
But I guess it brings more upvotes to hate on retail and saying how the nostalgia sets are badass.
---
So, maybe not that simple of a question but it doesn't warrant a thread either. I never played Mists of Pandaria, I stopped in Cata, but I'm always extremely drawn to its soundtrack and the zones just look terrific. I always see MoP getting a bad rap though. What was so bad about this expansion that people don't like it? Especially compared to its precursor Cata, where I stopped myself?
---
Thank you man
---
I don't think there was more than 2-3 legitimate hunter glads in TBC across any spec.
---
Paladins in TBC did not top heals/tanking?  Your definition of top is basically as narrow as it gets.  Paladins were weaker than warriors and druids at tanking bosses, which is why they were always relegated to add duty.  They had the best aoe threat in the game by far, but that was their strength.  They had clear weaknesses.
---
The same can be said for holy paladins.  Extremely good single target healers with great mana sustain, but they were not good at keeping up a group through raid/party wide damage...  Priests, druids, and shamans were all a lot better at this.
---
Ret was not a top tier dps class in TBC.  I know for certain this is true in T6 and beyond, and may even be true for T5, I just don't remember.
---
Migrations are a touchy subject right now, you'd better concern yourself with mitigation sets !
---
It's not that big of a deal. 
---
Depending on what you can grab you progressively replace items until your healers say "stop you're taking too much damage" then you tell them they are pussies and you up the ante by going full DPS gear :D
---
you're welcome
---
You spelled DM wrong
---
I think some of the blame is on players here, right? Sure, you could argue that you have to design around human (read: gamer) behavior... but a 40m raid could succeed with "sub-optimal" specs... but the Internet came together and said, "NO. THIS IS THE OPTIMAL WAY TO PLAY THE GAME" and that was that... that kind of stuff really gets into people's heads. It's why hearthstone is nothing but lame netdecks and garbage and why physical MtG was so fun... when you stop giving a shit about "optimal" then the entire world opens up for you!!  
---
Let's face it. If we did this in the real world, most people would be fired... because I would guess about 90% of the population are "sub-optimal" at their jobs. We've got sub-optimal wives and husbands and moms and dads... sub-optimal people are everywhere!!!!! ;)
---
Yes, but to be a hardcore vanilla fan you need to hate *everything* modern WoW has that wasn't in vanilla, and it is *all* part of why retail sucks, because literally nothing past vanilla is a positive thing. Every change past vanilla is shit. /s
---
I think it's the 'mythic' color variant. The other colors were more rogue-like. And this is of course after Blizz decided to make belts fashion magnets for some reason.
---
To be fair, retail is fundamentally unfixable (in the eyes of the classic community). It would require so much overhaul that you'd have to cut or modify pretty much all content after vanilla.
---
The 1.13 crowd are people who recognize that vanilla *was* the better game. It has a continuous story and world; and progressive content. Those two things are IMO the core to why vanilla was good. Even at 60, you find yourself traveling through level 30 zones on foot. Some gear that you get in MC or craft yourself is BiS till naxx. Items/quests from leveling are still relevant at end game (STV arena/fishing event, engineering items, carrot on a stick, etc). *Players don't stop interacting with the world when they hit 60*.
---
At the same point, players want to see progression and changes to deal with content stagnation. "But private servers have been active for 10 years!" is a bad argument. What PServer has been continually active since then? They all grow stale and the community dies, because everyone hits 60 and either gets bored or clears naxx and gets fully geared. Then they move on to the next popular PServer that is going through progression again. The content is good enough to keep people interested for 10 years, but only so long as the rest of the community is active enough to keep them interested. People play MMOs for the *massive multiplayer* aspect, which retail has totally tried to move away from.
---
It's not difficult to see the possible alternate timeline where wow did expansions completely differently. Imagine they kept the level cap at 60, added outland, and it has a level 40 zone, a level 50 zone, and two level 60 zones; with no flying mounts. Imagine karazhan is added as a 10-man dungeon that is equivalent to LBRS with an expanded tier .5, and BT is added as a Naxx equivalent that doesn't invalidate all of Naxx content, but adds in a couple items of BiS and sets that make boomkin/ret/Spriest/feral *actually viable*. More events like the AQ war effort and the scourge invasion, and changes to the darkmoon faire.
---
I mean, does that theoretically make the game worse? Are you really saying that's so hard to picture, that it's impossible? You can make the "Blizztivizion is trash" argument, but they're just driven by money. Keeping their sub numbers up gets them more money than they do from microtransactions, and if classic is a success, they should see that there's a community of people who are exclusively interested in the type of content that vanilla offers.
---
I'm hopeful that they could, theoretically, use classic to create wow 2.0 or go OSRS with it. I think this can be done in parallel to both retail and OG classic servers. If they fuck it up, I'll stop playing it, but I'd prefer to see them try than just assume they can't.
---
The problem is that there is literally nothing to talk about on this sub until beta/release. We already know 98% of how Classic is going to work, and any topic left was beaten to death months ago.
---
Hahaha what? What did you smoke?
---
1. Vanilla mobs, with the correct health, dmg, scripts for spells and abilitys. And not like pservers that emulate it and have it wrong for most parts. Working LoS as well! Yay.
---
2. Quests, that actually work and work as they should do. Almost every "scripted" quest is working poorly, most mobs just stand at one place in pservers even if they're supposed to wander around.
---
3. Zones, only thing pservers have correct since it's taken from the client.
---
4. Sharding will help a smooth launch in the starting zones, after those zones it's all out on one server with no shards. After a few days (or few weeks) the starting zones won't have sharding either. If you're against a smooth launch you're an idiot.
---
5. There will be close to 0 bugs compared to both vanilla and pservers, since the new client is a lot more stabile and removed a lot of bugs that wasn't possible to fix before.
---
6. Latency will be a lot better. Latency problems today is because the server needs to handle a lot of players and mobs in the same zones even if they're not actually at the same place because of sharding and phasing. 
---
7. Performance of the demo was 100x  better than pservers even if everything wasn't completed yet. My ping was 8, on EU pservers I have 30~+ ping.
---
Nothing you said is correct.
---
I'm pretty sure you can manage at least 1g/hr grinding at lvl 60, if not a couple gold. But yeah, 15g/hr definitely seems too high.
---
I do Brazilian jiu jitsu (two-year white belt) where the belts are white, blue, purple, brown, and black. 
---
It is customary to bow when stepping on or off of the mat, to give a fist bump before initiating the "roll" (what they call the grappling sparring), because the fist bump indicates a readiness and consent by both parties. The moment someone physically taps or verbally says "Tap!", the person applying the submission immediately releases it, because respecting the tap is a healthful part of the honor and trust culture of a gym where we put our life and limb in the hands of others.
---
But this is not real life, nor are we teammates if you have a red name. This is a game, and a game of war. War doesn't have the honor associated with it that you think it does. Both sides do whatever it takes to win, within reason (not openly pissing off allies), which is still ultimately "doing what it takes to win". 
---
My point in all of that is that how I am in a virtual, fantasy setting is not how I am in real life. Would you, in the actual streets of your city, run people over with cars and throw grenades at them like you would in Grand Theft Auto? Probably not, right?
---
This hurts my soul
---
What do you mean with eye destroying?
---
A lot of people were put off by the theme, but the class design was amazing. Played feral druid the entire expansion and had a blast.
---
And that‚Äôs more than likely the result of factional imbalance rather than any sort of PvP skill dominance.
---
Agreed. 25 man raids, badges of justice, homogenization of classes, balancing the pvp in the attempt to make WoW an esport. All of this started with TBC.
---
TBC did some things right, but for every one thing that got better, two new systems were introduced that sent WoW towards where it is now.
---
Look at that warrior. Glorious.
---
wow more locks than rogues ?
---
They were good, but not exceptional. That was my whole point.
---
3.3.5 is not a whole WotLK. Add here TBC.
---
Why does leather matter?  You aren't tanking...
---
What stops them? The same thing that stops them from deleting retail toons. They have never done anything like this before with any game they host. Why would they start now? What is causing you to worry? Have you found something? Do you know something we don't? 
---
Right now your speculating on worst case scenarios. The best way to predict the future is remember how Blizzard handles these things in the past. There is no credible hint that something like this would come down the pipe. I think we can relax.
---
It's called Spirit regen set.
---
You use it to regen health while migrating from one mobs spawn to another
---
First why are warriors exempt from the "hybid tax"? Best dps, plate armor and best tank for 90% of the content.
---
Second that isn't at ALL what the devs intended, if you watch the recent dev interviews they clearly state that they wanted all the specs to be raid worthy and that due to time constraints they could only design so many sets and rework so many talent trees, and because of that they went with the most populated specs for sets and reworks and that it was sort of a self fulfilling prophecy in that only the more successful specs got played and thus got itemization. They have also said multple times that lots of changes they wanted to make got pushed back to tbc, again due to time constraints.
---
If you stare at it for hours for years you will eventually need glasses. That's how I got glasses... Had perfect eyesight as a kid before I got into gaming lol.
---
You can have multiple R14s per faction per week.
---
Did you really take 29 days off solely to focus on WoW with a fianc√© who will be working the whole month? Do you not plan time off together to do stuff? Is this all of your time off?
---
I love WoW just as much as the next person, but holy shit...
---
Hopefully they give us like a week notice. That way we won't have 500,000 people taking their vacation during launch.
---
A lot of them got it on private servers over the years.
---
So... is this website incorrect?  I get so confused with BiS websites and guides because there all so inflicting
---
Maybe, just maybe, they didn't want to reroll their char that was already lvl 70 ?
---
Hah that's when I quit too

You can only be really good at one of those things at once. That's what specs are for. Do you think a Resto Druid in full healing gear can just switch to cat form and out DPS everybody else in the raid? That's not how it works.
---
Nah, the same thing happens with literally every hyped game release. It'll start off with colossal amounts of people, lose probably half or more in the first month, then if people decide it's good it may slowly build back up from there. It's a pattern we've all seen time and time again.
---
I'm of the same mind as OP. If you raid, I have to raid or you will forever roll on me in PVP.
---
Raiding feels like a job : I have to be there at fix hours no matter what. I can't come IG and say : "hey let's go raiding now".
---
5 man content is much more intimate, you can get to know the other players in your group and if this evening I don't feel like dungeonning but just want to go fishing nobody cares.
---
I think the 2.5 plate set is designed around the theme of the instance and definitely does not look like a placeholder set. This makes me think that the other gear was not placeholders as well. While armor classes may have shared the same look there gear is much more unique than the placeholders for t1 and t2.
---
lol no, nobody just likes the answer. Stop playing or reroll fresh.
---
Hah, I loved meeting Scandies on WoW too! My favourite memory was a Swede boosting me through Sunken Temple (iirc) and realising about half way through that it was going to take longer than he expected and he shouldn't have taken his sleeping pill so soon...
---
Eventually I had to leave him there after he spent a good 10 minutes bouncing on a drum. I hope he slept alright.
---
I love all the stories people have about WoW, especially since Classic is actually happening! (I never thought it would)
---
I played EQ all through high school and WoW launched when I was in college -- and I had already stopped playing video games entirely (so I didn't fail out and get kicked off the baseball team lol) ... so I didn't start WoW until TBC after I graduated. Been playing off and on since, but I couldn't be more excited for Classic!
---
I have been waiting for a decent new old-school MMO for years... who knew it would be an old old-school MMO that would win my heart!
---
Hmm I'm like 80% it was blue and it was pretty 60 that I'm sure of. I will say I got it on my Belf but I didnt think they changed sillithis that much between bc and classic.
---
Yes! I share your gut.
---
To be fair, the rogue is also a flashy assassin class, so from an rpg stand point its not that weird.
---
&gt; It's basically the foot of the waterfall to the right as you jump down the cliff.
---
To my knowledge, this is accurate and more convenient when distributing loot. You prio the t2 pieces to sword rogues and aged core gloves/shadow flame to your dagger rogues. 
---
On a side note, 8/8 t2 bonus + dark moon healing trinket is awesome for PvP.
---
Just get PvP gear. It's not like BC+ Arena gear. You get it from grinding, not winning.
---
I LOVED shouting in cities "resto shaman lfg, pst" ... man, it was awesome. And the conversations you'd have with people when your Tank ditches or DCs in a dungeon and someone ports to a hub to find the replacement.
---
Man, I am hyping myself right now lol
---
&gt;all glowy and metallica and impractical lol
---
Vanilla gear was not practical either. The rogue PvP set has all sorts of glowing blue shit on every piece of the gear.
---
And Bloodfang, the most popular rogue set of vanilla, makes your eyes glow red. How stealthy, flashing eyes everyone can see in the dark.
---
Realistically speaking, Thunderfury is probably among the absolute worst weapons in the game. It is not even *sharp*. It is basically a terribly designed lance.
---
I don't think the downvotes mean they don't like you. Downvotes/Upvotes are part of the discussion; we're voting.
---
I took Alcor's Sunrazor as a warrior tank on the basis of "man I'll get a lot of heroic strikes with this" I was flamed to hell and back by the rogues for being a shit ass warrior tanking with a dagger instead of a great tank weapon like Quel'Serrar. Forums blew up and I was essentially blacklisted.
---
Who would've known I was ahead of my time
---
I just see it being over dramatized here. Like itll become a dead pserver side project in no time.
---
Jaina, obviously.
---
This is only a concern for high end raid tanks really. More hit/crit gear combined with fury prot allows for much higher TPS. Your main mitigation stat is defense, which increases all your mitigation options. 
---
It‚Äôs true that at a certain point, mitigation gear becomes detrimental to certain fights, where you limit the maximum dps output because the tank cannot possibly maintain high enough TPS. This is later in the raiding stages and it is also after the raids in question has been farmed enough for the dps to get the gear required to close out the threat gap.
---
TLDR; only necessary for speed runs.
---
Those 7 million subscribers didn't all start at once, they slowly built up over 2 years. WoW's release didn't have anywhere near the numbers that we're going to see when Classic comes out. There's really no possible comparison from any retail version of WoW but there *are* lessons to learn from private server launches. Ever been part of one? Do you have any idea what happens when 2500 people log on a new server all at once and try to start leveling? 300+ people per starting zone is not a pleasant experience whatsoever. You can't get anything done in a halfway reasonable amount of time. You don't get to play the game. You're really trying to claim that it's going to do damage to the server economy? Sorry, but that's bullshit. What happens in the starter zones is going to have damn near no impact on the server economy after a month and I'd much rather be able to play the game on day 1.
---
How do you know? 
---
If you play on Kazzak EU, which is a billion horde an three alliance, at least its more susceptible to imbalance than a new name.
---
And too few people leveled their alts during expansion? I don‚Äôt think so. Especially in later patches, when people directly went T6 from Karazhan.
---
Class fantasy and all that. Though a barbarian berserker going absolutely fuckin' ham on everything with two swords makes perfect sense to me.
---
Can't remember the exact details, but most fights didn't even last 2 minutes, and the hunters in my raid team was constantly ending those fights with 70+% mana, what's the "effective time to oom" on a hunter?
---
Do you not want to be able to play the game within the first week?
---
1. Mobs had wrong values for health, dmg, spells, abilities in demo
---
2. Quests were bugged incomplete in demo
---
3. ...
---
4. Sharding will be used everywhere unless there will be so few players that only one shard will exist, i am 100% sure about that
---
5. lol just look at demo
---
6. I had 60ms like on retail
---
7. Graphics performance on retail is terrible
---
I know there's a video of a disc priest running around with his pizza spade critting for thousands in BRM, it was a thing for a while.
---
Can't for the life of me remember the name, but the game client was french.
---
Gadgetzan flight path in Tanaris was a great pvp spot. A drood friend of mine and I would run around there killing anyone we could.
---
Im sure tons of people are actually lying. I pvp'd nonstop for weeks on end and I don't think I ever got passed Legionnaire. I certainly wasn't good but it was a lot of game hours regardless just to hit one of the lower ranks.
---
It‚Äôs bis with 8/8 and it‚Äôs perfectly fine for pvp where you don‚Äôt need as much hit rating.
---
Awww you had a Christmas tree.
---
Except it wasn't, people want to pretend like it was a decision to keep these specs suboptimal, but it wasn't. We have actual developer interviews saying that they intended on the specs being on par and that they had limited time to redesign tier sets/talents for the live game so they pushed it all to tbc.
---
Now imagine what those feel who quit years ago (especially those of us who quit way before the announcement even). The wait is unreal.
---
Preach!
---
To be fair, if you dump down the shoulders and head pieces on most tier sets throughout WoW you get something that looks like greens. Except maybe for Legion, since they went actually made all pieces look special in that xpac.
---
What do you mean by open world pve viability? But in general warlocks get better as raid tiers go on.
---
Not the game but the server.
---
Don't worry, you're probably lowest prio on cloth anyway, as you have alternatives and the clothies don't. With that said, hPalas are the best healer in the game, so if you play well you'll be wearing a lot of cloth for a long time.
---
To be honest, guys like you are the most fun to me while waiting for classic. The neediness some of you guys display is just absurdly insane xD I'm completely chilled and patiently waiting for classic. Thanks for making the wait more fun tho!
---
There's a bit on both.
---
BS has few high-level mail pieces and all of pre-40 stuff is mail-only. 
---
LW has some high level mail, mostly behind the dragonscale spec.
---
You sound so intelligent saying fucking every other word.
---
Just say you're too cheap to spend the 15 a month dude, I don't think anybody's buying this
---
Yea sorry but I don't think that's true. A CRT isn't more harmful to your eyes than any other kind of monitor.  In fact most CRT monitors provide with a 85hz refresh rate or more using the native resolution so it should actually be better than a normal 60hz LCD. Also they have no "blue light" problems. The thing that destroyed your eyes was spending too many hours staring at a screen.
---
Like the price of a WoW token?
---
I was an arms warrior in a raiding guild, so I had some less than kind guildies give me shit from time. I would join guild PvP events in Arathi and warsong where arms was more viable. The guild warlock was one of these abrasive hardliners who I didn't get along with. He was sarcastic and seemed condescending, but there was one interaction I had with him in Arathi that I'll never forget. I was going mines to scout, and reported horde were also scouting there. I found some kind of clothie there I thought I could take. I wasn't helpless. I carried the Halberd of Smiting that drops in ZG. It has a chance to "decapitate" the target for ridiculous damage bonus. The warlock responded to my call out and was approaching that ridge above the mines to see if I needed help. He watched me charge the enemy and then 2 shot it. Double decapitate proc and execute. The fight was over as immediately as the fight began and he was just astonished. It was a sort of subtle nod of acceptance, or at least it felt that way.
---
I heavily disagree. TBC follows up on Vanilla's spirit, you still had weird balance, items and non controlled world PvP, but itemization became better, hybrids had proper role to play and was desired, raids were just as cool and heroics made 5mans meaningful
---
No
---
It was nothing like vanilla.
---
Anonymity will lead to lying.
---
Same for me, cleared naxx on my hunter, got KT xbow and finally felt complete. Went into TBC with plans to continue but once I did that 1st raid in tbc it hit me that all my gear was worthless and I‚Äôd have to grind for years to get that complete feeling again. I quit right after the raid and barely touched the game since but hyped for classic.
---
Some guy in my guild found hand of eddward the odd. I wanted to buy it and some shaman also wanted to buy it but I convinced him to sell it to me. It was pretty useless to my undead priest 8)
---
Imo if you plan on playing casually while also being able to raid somewhat then choosing an ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù spec or class for a role would be better. In saying that druids have a better leveling experience and can also tank, mostly 5 mans but some raids too
---
However it all comes down to what you want out of the game and what you will enjoy most!
---
Full T2 is bis for rogues...
---
I was excited for transmit when it was first released. But now I feel exactly like you do.
---
Yes, but that is a terrible measurement. 2v2 had its best math ups, 3v3 had its main comp, 5v5 had its main comp. You cannot have balance where every spec has a chance to play in every bracket
---
Eg, try to play Enhance in 2s for glad rank, or feral druid in 5s.
---
Migration Pre-Bis

https://classic.wowhead.com/dressing-room#Rz0z0zJ8z9q8MjV808Mjk808Mjc808MjM87VMjz808Mjm808MT5808Mjo808Mj7o
---
Do you normally sort by new posts for things your not excited about?
---
So do you like being showered in loot? Do you want a raid spot? Play druid especially if you want to heal. Best thing you can do is tank dungeons at 60 to get all your gear from 5 man dungeons bear druids are awesome tanks and have really good threat in dungeons. And most people don't like druid healers in 5 mans mainly because they can't res the party on a wipe. But once you have all your 5 man gear you can get into the ubrs grind and people will generally like to take druid healers. But in short if you are a good and dedicated healer guilds will want restos and in honesty in all my time playing on private servers it is so hard to get resto druids because of how uncommon druids are in general. They are normally only 6-8% of a factions player base at 60. So you will for sure be able to find a raiding guild as resto. 
---
As for ease of leveling druids are insane they have movement ability at level 20/21 they can get the 15% move speed in cat form talents. Making them even faster at leveling. So in short i woulf highly suggest a druid over a priest espically because you can tank dungeons all the way up to and at 60. Hell even my hardcore raiding guild i am making with my good friends will be using a feral. 
---
Again just play druid you wont regret it for a second they are a very fun class while leveling as well as at max level.
---
If you have any questions about builds or gear hit me up and i will help you out.
---
While leveling sure. But end game there‚Äôs 0 good guns.
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Wot mate
---
John Staats spoke about this in a podcast I listened to. His first kickstarter didn't even get close to reaching his goal probably due to close to zero advertisement for it. After that he spoke with Mark Kern and he decided to try again. Mark advised him to set an extremely low goal (10k) so that it seems way more successful when you beat the goal by 60x. Obviously the strategy worked so thank god for Mark Kern pushing John to make it happen because it is one hell of a book.
---
Things like this are why I am excited about classic
---
We just had a blue post 4 days ago?
---
Should be a stickied thread. And it's certainly a reason I'll go to work release day.
---
&gt;1. Will Classic have the same graphics as current WoW, but just gameplay goes back to the old ways? 
---
Nobody knows 100% for sure but based on what we know id say it's probably old models.
---
&gt; 2. What is so special about the old gameplay vs new gameplay? 
---
Everyone has a different answer to this. Personally I enjoy it because I feel way more connected to my character, like more of an "avatar" than what abilities I want to play with, because of the long and not so streamlined process of leveling and the community feel of the server.
---
&gt; 3. Is Horde generally better or is that just BS opinions? Because, sure I dont mind making a Horde toon to play with friends, but I really would like to be on the Alliance. Dwarf or Human. 
---
It depends on who you ask. The general consensus is that for pve alliance is better because paladins/fear ward &gt; shamans/tremor totem. Pvp is a bit of a mixed bag because paladins are such a good support class in group pvp. but pvp mainly comes down to skill anyway so that's a wash.
---
&gt; 4. Are PVP servers the best way to go or is PVE alright too? Personally I've played PVP servers I dont hate it but I'm just not good at it. It can be fun. 
---
Wow doesn't feel like wow to me if I'm not getting griefed by a rogue.
---
&gt; 5. Is grouping mandatory in Classic or could you relatively play solo or at most with 2-3 friends? 
---
You can absolutely play solo all the way to 60. Most leveling guides will assume your solo the whole way and tell you to find a group at certain points if you can. Classic has a different culture with this though and you shouldn't worry about finding a group. You'll get casual group invites from people doing quests around you so you guys aren't competing for cerain mobs, and people will always be spamming general chat with "LFM for (group quest for your zone)" as most zones have at least 1 group quest.
---
&gt; 6. Does Classic plan to revisit the old expansions? Burning Crusade, Wrath etc. Or will this be ONLY Classic forever. 
---
No one has any idea and it's a highly debated topic whether we should go vertical content (bc -&gt; wrath-&gt; etc...) Or horizontal (1.13 -&gt; 1.14 &gt; etc...). Either way this is a topic for a couple years from now.
---
&gt; 7. Does the story in Classic follow the Warcraft 3 games at all or is it mainly in the lore as you go? I know in later expansions it became very story focused. I was a big fan of Warcraft 3/Frozen Throne and would love to continue learning more of the story going forward.
---
Yeah there is tie in with wc3 but most quests I'd say just kind of follow the zone story (quillboar are attacking etc...). I personally don't read quest text so idk.
---
&gt; 8. Any other tips, advice, knowledge would be greatly appreciated! 
---
If it's your first time leveling is suggest doing all the dungeons at least once, I think they're fun and if you get a good group the quest xp is worth it. If you wanna go fast though id pick up a guide and follow that, you'll still hit almost every quest in the game. Guides are really convenient too since most guides are broken up in chapters and you can say "im gonna finish chapter x today and y tommorow" so you don't burn yourself out.
---
Shadow levels extremely competently, safely and with next to no downtime, too. (Shield up, Mind Blast and SW:P into wand spam). You can probably tailor that rotation around your spirit, but the leveling speed difference is minor.
---
Lol you actually wrote all this
---
That‚Äôs also current blizzard.
---
There is like a .01% chance of them deleting characters.
---
This guy is so cool.
---
Rank 10 is pretty easy and can be achieved solo by just playing AV a couple hours a day. Rank 11 is already significantly harder but this is where you get the black war tiger.
---
1 No, the graphics will be like old times.  
---
2 Old gameplay is less refined, but classes feel unique compared to retail, there's a lot of flavor to the classes that got mixed up during the many expansions and a lot of classes have similar abilities, most classes have defining strenghts, but also weaknesses.  
---
3 Horde has better PvP racials (Orc stun resist, Tauren war stomp, Will of the Forsaken, Regeneration), and has alliance better PvE mainly due to blessing of Salvation.  
---
4 Depends on your playstyle, a lot of people find world pvp defining of the vanilla wow feeling, but I understand that it's not everyone's cup of tea to be wary at all times when playing, PvE servers are totally fine.  
---
5 Grouping for some quests is almost required due to the difficulty compared to retail, watch this video to see what I'm talking about https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0YWRgG7UZs  
---
6 There are no current plans to visit the expansions.  
---
7 The lore in classic is just after warcraft 3, as you find a lot of characters you met in WC3, but I'm not sure on the specifics.  
---
8 Be sure to constantly doubt what class/race you are going to pick, we're all doing it constantly.
---
A) I care a lot more about finding the old players than I care about faction imbalance. 
---
B) Faction imbalance is already going to exist worrying about it is stupid. It's a completely non unique argument. It has, will, and continues to happen, and it's gonna happen again. Except without the same names you won't know which servers to avoid.
---
Thank you for writing everything I wanted to say. :)
---
Yeah I mean it was fun for a few days but.. then I noticed it made me care less about the actual gear that I had which already was just boring stat upgrades.
---
that was awesome! lol!!
---
Reddit frontpage on a very, very slow day at work :D
---
R34 where you at I need that WoW femdom
---
He must be so chill and cool at parties
---
This is still a challenging goal.  Classic pvp ranks are almost entirely obtained through time spent grinding, personal ability doesn't contribute too much.  You have to dedicate a substantial portion of your life to even hit rank 10.
---
The furthest I got in college was rank 9 before I was able to progress any further.  I had a normal class load and worked maybe 10 hours/week.  Outside of that, my friends and I pvp'd with all of our free time. If I had to spend time at a family function or hung out at my girlfriend's, I brought a laptop to pvp.  I even botted those night-long AVs while I slept.
---
I think I went 2 or 3 weeks stuck at rank 9 before giving up.  I was spending WAY too much time playing WoW at this point and it wasn't even enough for rank 10.  It takes months of dedication.  Be prepared for what the journey consists of before embarking, it might be literally impossible for many folks to accomplish while still living life.
---
Yes, let's set the stage for a completely borked faction balance because it used to be that way during retail.
---
&gt; non unique argument.
---
What does this even mean? Just because poverty exist in society doesn't mean you should turn a blind eye to it.
---
so chill
---
Sorry but all my spare time is devoted to prepping for classic not designing comparisons for reddit. I hear you though :)
---
It's not just that. Pretend they open enough servers to accommodate everyone at release. What happens if ~70% of those people leave in 90 days? We have a bunch of dead servers. 
---
With sharding they can fit everyone in the starting areas at release, and then let them naturally disperse throughout the world as some level faster than others. You avoid spinning up extra servers that will turn into ghost towns after the tourists leave, which would result in mass server mergers.
---
Yeah t2 shoulders become bis if youre swords and have 8/8 with them, depending the servers proc rate. If lousy proc rate or not 8/8, t1 shoulders are better
---
Is that the tbc launch event tabard that lets you flex when you use it? I forgot about that thing
---
Thank you. I alredy testing a druid in pserver but lack of time i am only 30.  Also testing priest. Tbh both are massive at lvling maybe druid easyer have mire option.  But the fact maybe i go for druid cuz i played the whole tbc content with priest and eotlk with hpally. So i really into and dedicated to be on e again a good  healer but with less gametime, due to as most of us here grown up life priorty changedüòÄ but ij my short freetime where i can be kid again  i want to have fun and be a good player on my casual levelüòÄ
---
RIP barsArs, alas he was put down for dissent of the Russian regime
---
Theoretically original graphics, maybe with new textures. They haven't confirmed.
---
&gt;2. What is so special about the old gameplay vs new gameplay?
---
New gameplay is very hack-and-slashy with a homogenized rewards pipeline. Old gameplay is a lot more methodical and "crunchy" with sporadic but specific rewards acquired after a lot of grinding. Far less immediate satisfaction, but far more *satisfying* satisfaction.
---
&gt;3. Is Horde generally better or is that just BS opinions? Because, sure I dont mind making a Horde toon to play with friends, but I really would like to be on the Alliance. Dwarf or Human.
---
Better for *what*, exactly? Racials are very non-standardized in Vanilla, so Forsaken for instance have an astounding racial passive for PvP. But Alliance has Paladins, which make them superior for premades. But Shamans have some cool burst and group DPS potential that Paladins don't, both in PvE and PvP. But Alliance gets Fear Ward. Choose what you want to play, honestly.
---
&gt;4. Are PVP servers the best way to go or is PVE alright too? Personally I've played PVP servers I dont hate it but I'm just not good at it. It can be fun.
---
Again, it's your preference. If you're frustrated by PvP leveling or ganking or resource hogging, then play PvE.
---
&gt;5. Is grouping mandatory in Classic or could you relatively play solo or at most with 2-3 friends? 
---
You can get solo PvP gear with intense grinding, but most gear is gated behind groups and raids.
---
&gt;6. Does Classic plan to revisit the old expansions? Burning Crusade, Wrath etc. Or will this be ONLY Classic forever.
---
No clue. Probably not, but maybe they'll have shunting expansions for those who want to continue upward.
---
&gt;7. Does the story in Classic follow the Warcraft 3 games at all or is it mainly in the lore as you go? I know in later expansions it became very story focused. I was a big fan of Warcraft 3/Frozen Throne and would love to continue learning more of the story going forward.
---
Classic is honestly reasonably disconnected from the events of WC3. Their effects are present in the world, but the direct continuation of the two main storylines in WC3 come in BC and WotLK.
---
&gt;8. Any other tips, advice, knowledge would be greatly appreciated!
---
Research various ways on how to farm gold so you can get your mounts more quickly.
---
Yep. Sword rogues get T2 boots, shoulders and gloves as prio over dagger rogues if you're purely concerned with PvE progression. The other pieces get spread around and in three to six months (depending on your luck with drops) most rogues should have close to full 8/8 Bloodfang for farming, etc. anyway.
---
This list is up to date:
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=850
---
I only really used a private server to get a feel for the animations and how each race/class combination would feel.
---
I'm no closer to deciding my main other than its going to be a healer. I'm even tempted to roll Alliance, despite the fact that I've never played one in my entire playtime through vanilla to WotLK.
---
Yeah Darkstorm was the guild name. And East Dragon on alliance side. They had a notorious female night elf rogue whose name I forgot.
---
Putting a SoulStone on an MC'd opposing faction is 10/10 awesome, hilarious, and fun.
---
sure, if they had an infinite amount of time they wouldve perfectly balanced everything in the world. 
---
but they didnt. they had a finite window. 
---
and it just so happens that 1.12 balance was so fucking good that even 15 years later we are here talking about it and they are re-creating it. 
---
Their vision exists though - it is current retail - where everything attempts to be perfectly balanced and its boring af
---
You could pvp 24/7 for trillion years and not gain rank because you are using shitty inefficient methods compared to others.
---
Ter√§sbetoni.  
---
Some of the most epic videos ever made during Classic were set to their music. :D
---
Exactly, yeah. It's a choice between having a bunch of low population servers a couple months after launch or using sharding for release until the population inevitably falls and stabilizes at a more normal level like every other major game release.
---
That right there is my Rogue goal. How much time commitment does it take to pull that off with just raiding would you say?
---
&gt; Do you think a Resto Druid in full healing gear can just switch to cat form and out DPS everybody else in the raid? That's not how it works.
---
never said it did
---
BLIZZARD PLEASE QUENCH MY EVERLASTING THIRST FOR THE MESSAGES OF THE BLUE I CAN'T CONTINUE LIKE THIS
---
Getting R14 took a lot of time and effort, but it was a huge difference between the servers you played on. The smaller server you played on, the less you usually had to play since there was less competition.
---
I played on one of the bigger EU servers in Vanilla and was in a premade that played for about 7-10 hours a day and we had several R14 (not me). I was #1 in honor gained for a few weeks though, while going to high school for 8-9 hours a day and without skipping sleep.
---
While it is possible that not everyone claiming to have a R14 are telling the truth, it still was "easier" to get than some people now says, so it is entierly possible that most are telling the truth. Those who claim that it takes +16 hours a day for months, or account sharing, either gets their info from private servers that have population caps way higher than Vanilla had (= more competition = forced to spend more time grinding), or simply didn't play in premades good enough, which forced them to compenaste by playing a lot more than others to be able to compete.
---
I'm realistically limited to the rare PVP gear though. 
---
What when you're T2+ ? You'll still roll over me while watching a Twitch stream on your second monitor.
---
I already thought about that. I will have to raid for this only reason.
---
A friend insist we play on a PVP server. If not, I would roll on a PVE server, enjoy PVP while everybody is about the same gear lvl and stop once most of them are T2+.
---
If I was creating my own pserver, there would absolutely be no raids, only dungeons (I would upgrade the difficulty though) and absolutely no PVP rewards. Imagine if everybody was PVPing for fun ?
---
I love my wide aspect flat screen, but I miss these old CRTs, at least their flexibilty with resolutions and refresh capabilities. I had the Sony flat screen and it was beautiful. Crisp colors and inky blacks.
---
Had Icemetal Barbute need rolled and Ed‚Äôs in front of me by 2 different clothies. Both said ‚Äúno one said they needed it.‚Äù As their excuse. One was in a group of 2 paladins, 2 warrior, and a lock.
---
Also you meant BFD not SFK.
---
\&gt; Yes, let's set the stage for a completely borked faction balance because it used to be that way during retail.
---
They're already going to be it's just we won't know which servers it's fucked on, so it'll be a crapshoot instead of a known. AND finding old guildmates will be harder. I have never seen a pserver, official server, anything where factions were even remotely class to equal. Trying to attain something that absolutely won't happen means any sacrifice made to make it happen is wasted.
---
\&gt; What does this even mean? 
---
It means the criticism applies to both sides of the argument, and is therefore absolutely meaningless. As in it's not unique to one side.
---
Do you not realize this is blizzards last hope for us hardcore fans and players if they don‚Äôt deliver properly for Classic? They better make sure they do everything the correct way like it‚Äôs supposed to be or else shits really going to crumble for them like we are already starting to see. Thank goodness that classic is coming up or else I don‚Äôt see them doing anything great in the near future.
---
I remember my human warlock looking like that. T2 looked even worse.
---
The end of Cata was when they introduced a lot of the things that personally ruined WoW for me then mists took all of them and shoved them down you‚Äôre throat.
---
Rogue t3 is pretty subdued.
---
i would argue because they get stomped in solo PVP, have the hardest levelling experience, and only really shine once they are in endgame gear - something a *very* small percentage of actual warriors achieve
---
I answer the intention question elsewhere - I realize they wanted to perfectly balance stuff if they had infinite time but they didnt so they made a decision what to do, and lo and behold, 1.12 was loved by so many people we are still here talking about it.
---
so yes, I still argue that given their time crunch they still intended to keep 1 main pve spec for hybrids, and it turned out FAR better than they expected
---
I played from the beginning of vanilla through TBC and I certainly believe that the magic of the world ended when TBC dropped. We went from bustling major cities, raids that required huge efforts of player cooperation, and lively world PvP, to a world that was suddenly too big and impersonal.
---
Warrior set is bae!
---
TBC is a better version of WoW than Vanilla. Downvote me if you want. 
---
Yes, I played vanilla. I started in early 2006, so I had a year worth of vanilla before TBC came out.
---
This is certainly rank -15 play by the druid \^\^
---
A lot of your questions are either highly subjective or unknown, so I will answer what I can. 
---
Grouping is totally optional during the leveling process. It can make parts of leveling easier or quicker, but you can go 1-60 without ever partying up just fine. However to experience basically any of the endgame content you are going to need to group with other players. (5man dungeons and 40man raiding).
---
The game does not have a large focus on the plot of Warcraft as a whole. Lore wise the focus of the game seems to be centered around making you feel like you are an adventurer in the Warcraft universe, rather than a driving force. Think of it as, during the events of Warcraft 3, and (mostly) shortly thereafter, what is the rest of the world up to? That's the lore of WoW Vanilla.
---
Someone has recommended leveling guides already, and if you are easily frustrated/prone to giving up/in a hurry to hit max level they are a useful tool, but I would recommend avoiding them if you don't meet any of the above conditions; a huge part of vanilla WoW was the exploration and discovery, and if you started in retail wotlk (like I did) I can promise you there are huge amounts of areas in the old world that are undiscovered and waiting for you. I personally wouldn't want to cheat myself out of that by following a guide, but that is down to taste.
---
i'm not an expert at all but when i was testing stuff it was like 1 min to oom even with my build with more mana and the proc to return mana
---
this is with 0 buffs and 0 consumables, and no 5 sec rule or FD+drink or anything like that.  just pure dpsing
---
1. Yes and no. The old, fewer polygon character and mob models will be in place, but the client is being "backed into" and will run on the 7.0 infrastructure, so it will be vanilla graphics but a little more polished compared to 2004/2005/2006
---
2. The BEST description I can think of is modern wow plays something like an application game. You hang out, queue for stuff, do things at a fast pace with no real feeling of character progression other than killing a boss. In Classic, things are slower paced, every little achievement feels awesome, and the game ultimately plays like an MMORPG used to, and should in my opionion play. Community interaction is essential to anyone wishing to really achieve meaningful feats in Classic as well, which is a highly sought after aspect of the game compared to modern wow.
---
3. It's made out to be a larger gap than it is, but general consensus is Alliance (Racials and paladins) are more favorable in PVE than Horde, and Horde is more favorable in PVP (Racials). Again, this gap is nothing to worry about, AT ALL. Play Alliance 100%. Dwarf is great for PVP with StoneForm, and Human Warriors / Sword Rogues are an AWESOME option for PVE.
---
4. PVP servers add the extra "content" of wolrd PVP, which is a highly sought after aspect of classic wow. Not being able to have Alliance and Horde on the same PVP server really establishes a faction love within people, which creates some great immersion with World PVP. PVE is fine if you want a relaxed leveling experience, but you are limited to battle grounds (when they come out in their respective phase of Classic) and niche World PVP interactions if you or the opposite faction happens to have PVP turned on at the time. Personally, I prefer PVP servers.
---
5. Grouping is NOT essential, but is a HUGE part of the game. I suggest you interact with as many players in a positive way as possible... Make friends... Group up for those elite quests and beautiful dungeons... Really get into the feel that you are NOT a hero from modern WoW, but an adventurer trying to make his place in the world, a world far too massive and daunting to achieve on their own.
---
6. No news here. Classic will be Classic forever, just like Zelda: Ocorina of Time will be the same game forever. There are hopes within the community that renditions of the game such as Classic: TBC come in the very distant future, that have no effect on the Classic servers.
---
7. Classic largely takes place after the W3 games, after a bit of time has passed. If you aren't in a rush, I suggest reading quests to get the millions of wonderfully written, well established, lore based stories that come with questing, especially if you roll Alliance. Beautiful quest stories there. There is no OVER ARCHING story in Classic, but rather unique stories in every zone/quest hub worth taking a read, whether on a main character, or an alt you level later for that reason alone.
---
8. Community, patience, and dedication. Do no rush to 60. Take your time. Enjoy the sights. Enjoy the JOURNEY and play the DESTINATION when you get there. Afterall, it's going to be waiting for you forever. Classic is timeless, and I hope you find that out for yourself.
---
Cheers brother.
---
Thanks so much for this link, as someone who‚Äôs never hit 60 before this will be a great help!
---
lmao yep, we never saw a single one in months of clearing MC and of course these guys got 1 every raid it seemed...
---
I have only ninjalooted once and it was when there was a bug with masterloot. Sometimes masterloot would bug and no other than the masterlooter could see what had dropped. I was leading a UBRS group and was asked to put on masterloot for Drakki so that nobody would accidently press the wrong button as that had already happened on Rend where one of the Dalrend swords went to a Holy Paladin.
---
Okay sure. BOOM CLOUDKEEPER LEGPLATES DROPS and nobody reacts. They ask me what dropped and I was like wtf? Cant you see? Nope. So I only linked the blue gear in chat and asked for rolls then after everyone had left the instance I just gave myself the epic legs and then sold them for 500g.
---
Old timers unite!
---
&gt; Ret was not a top tier dps class in TBC. I know for certain this is true in T6 and beyond, and may even be true for T5, I just don't remember.
---
certain patches they competed for top in dps and yet still had very competitive other specs, and were also pvp beasts
---
we all have our opinions, I happen to feel vanilla's balance decisions and particularly, some of their *im*balance decisions, created a more interesting and exciting landscape
---
TBC is the point where they began trying to get everything 100%  equal, pallies and shammies on both sides, all classes work, blah blah..... it just got boring from there on out
---
Vanilla you have cool balance created by imbalance, certain classes counter others, a lot of great interactions created from the "issues" of non-perfect classes and skills and factions etc
---
I hope i can get my banana set before rolling for cloth
---
Just go druid they are super fun.
---
Warlock and Rogue actually isn't half bad. Glad they reused the skins for other sets.
---
Another good thing about druid is that, if you are going to be in a casual guild, you can probably spec into a hybrid balance/resto spec so you dont have to spend gold respeccing but still wanna farm for consumes and whatnot.
---
Yea I'll just be a little hampered by doing it in vr.
---
It's the talk of so many places. It's got the buzz. It's got the fans. It's got the hype. Once released, it's going to have the controversy. It's going to be dying 2 months in, but then it wont, and it will be a steady growth. It's going to be seen, heard, people are going to come check out what all the commotion is about. It's going to be high ranked in streaming.
---
This thing is going to snowball and be huge. I have a feeling developers will be watching to see if this is the kind of gaming users really want. Even though users bitch about finding groups, or other difficulties in game, when they see the spirit of the game that is sucked out through convenience we see in modern games, they will realize the RPG element/flair  is the way to go, not the convenient way.  I play on a classic server and I had a painful death walk, stuck in a corralled in area and had to walk a good ways to get back to my body. Got killed by a rare mob and failed killing him by like 1 hit. DID THAT THREE TIMES! Ran to Org, got some pots, came back and killed that guy. Felt good. I could bitch that walks are inconvenient.  I could bitch that there is no flight path from Razor Hill to Org, and I bet a lot of people would bitch about that and make a dev think we want that, but actually, WE THINK WE WANT THAT, BUT WE DONT. There is nothing worse than everything being easy. Easy is lifeless. Make people cry. It's what gaming needs.
---
I bet this also kicks off copy cat developers and we will all be playing EQ I in about 4 years.
---
Some background: I was the rogue officer and one of the raidleaders of a big guild. I was raiding 4 hours, 6 days a week for a long time to get this gear.
---
Dude I was 9 when Vanilla was around, you have no idea how excited I am to play the original WoW Classic without ever actually playing it. I am now 23 and the fact that I can experience something that I thought I was never going to experience, is a blessing.
---
Druid also has all of these things but with a movespeed buff. There's almost literally no downtime as you fight in cat and switch back just to heal, and by the time you get another couple fights in in cat your mana is already replenished.
---
I had a rogue full T2 as well and quit shortly after TBC too. I had 100+ days played on that rogue and I felt like I had wished Blizzard did a better job transitioning gear into the expansion, especially for those that grinded so many hours into getting T2-T3. Instead... by level 72... green quest items would replace your Bloodfang chestpiece from Nefarian. I wish my efforts of grinding all that gear in vanilla didn't feel worthless the **instant** TBC released. It was disheartening and I ended up quitting.
---
You should be able to download the client from the private server website.
---
If their marketing has bought any of my data they for sure know it's safe to keep teasing me, I'm going nowhere. Blizzard has swelled my balls to gargantuan levels it's nut or die at this point
---
I guess I'll be frank here: Why should other people kowtow to your desire for no raiding or high-level PvP because you'd feel personally inadequate due to theoretical gear discrepancies. This is the MMO equivalent of telling people they can't eat donuts because you're on a diet. If you don't want to eat donuts, fine. But you can't go around forbidding other people from having a bunch of sweet donuts.
---
If you want a game where nobody can beat you in PvP because you have the best gear in the server from only 5-mans because raids don't exist, then go set up a private server for five people. Or just play Classic and deal with the consequences of self-restricting gameplay.
---
I just checked again there is a leatherworking bag lvl 6 but its pretty much horde only. will have to go for tailoring but I wanted to save cloth for first aid :/
---
ok ! lets do it then
---
Yeah I am planning to get this in 1 or 2 years as I have a full-time job and lots of other things to do in real life like gym, martial arts etc.
---
This is just my goal in game but not my life goal.
---
[link](https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Default.aspx)
---
Filter ndale, naxxramas. It has been released last week. Notice the performance of druids. It is perfectly fine, they are always in the middle of the HPS charts.
---
1. Killing other players slows your experience gains.
---
2. Slowing down your experience gains affects how fast you get to 60.
---
3. Slowing down how fast you get to 60 slows down how fast you obtain gear.
---
4. Slowing down how quickly you obtain gear makes you less of a threat.
---
Oh absolutely, druids are stella levelers. I just wanted to point out that priests are definitely better than the average class, too. Far ahead of rogues, warriors, shaman, magi and paladins.
---
Yeah when I relistened to it I felt I was cursing too much as well, I'm have to admit I was super nervous but mad excited at the same time I'll try and do better in the future episodes
---
I appreciate the criticism I'll work on it
---
1. Yes, and they said early that they knew about it already. They just wanted to show off that they got shit working (hence demo, not alpha or beta). Classic will have the correct data for everything, if you think otherwise you're either trolling or just dumb.
---
2. Same as #1
---
3. ?
---
4. Okey, read this 100 times. THEY HAVE SAID.. BLIZZARD HAVE SAID.. ION, FROM BLIZZARD, HAVE SAID.. That they'll only use sharding in starter zones at launch for a smooth launch. Okey? Read it 100 times.
---
5. Read #1
---
6. Not my problem if your internet connection is bad. On retail I'm around 8-9 ms as well. 
---
7. What does that have to do with anything since Classic will come with Classic graphic. Also, no.. Graphics performance on retail isn't terrible in any way what so ever, it's actually very good.
---
it depends on how many other people are also grinding for rep14. I reached rep12 on my vanilla warrior, and i was highly addicted to playing, some days i logged in 18-20hrs, farming around 200k honor per day, and still was not close to High warlord. 
---
Rep 10 will be doable, but I remember the blue set being kinda mediocre and not worth wearing at that point
---
Dat free mount.
---
Don't worry, these stats aren't going to be realistic. Most people will switch off of their warriors and priests onto mages, hunters and rogues. Plus this subreddit is definitely skewed in favor of more hardcore players. I have a feeling that more casual players will play rogues.
---
The thing is you can't do it over a long period of time. It needs to be done every week or your rank goes down. It's a really stupid system.
---
1. Not the same graphics, but an updated version of the old graphics. The demo they released is still, as they said, a work in progress but you can check it out [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLdafB_0QVM) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tx0zfziIhE)
---
2. The short version is, its an actual MMORPG. Socializing is big, the world feels alive and dangerous, you'll care about your gear and feel excited when you finally get that drop you worked hard for and it is hard and time consuming to level up, but you'll enjoy it. All things the current WoW lacks. 
---
3. Horde's racials are better for PvP, but thats about it. It comes down to the server and which players you have on both sides. Personally, and this is of course a biased and totally unfunded opinion, Horde players seems friendlier leveling up. 
---
4. They are both fun. Some "pro players" (of a 15 year old game) might want to tell you that "PvP is the only way to TRULY experience WoW vanilla" but that is BS. I love PvP but it comes down to personal taste.
---
5. Some quests (and obviously dungeons) can only be done with a group but the majority of players level up solo.
---
6. So far, Devs said they'll only release classic content.
---
7. I'm not the biggest lore expert but the story does take off after the events of Frozen Throne and many characters from that story show up. 
---
8. Its hard and not like current WoW at all. You aren't a god amongs creeps, at all levels you might die if you pull 2 mobs, and is in serious danger if you pull more; Gold is hard to come by if you don't spend some time learning the various farming techniques; Some contested zones are a gank fest in pvp servers and you'll have to abandon them untill the balance tilts to your faction's side; [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wi-7oKvOM4c) series of class guides might help you choose a class and remember that in Classic, player &gt; class unless you are going for a hardcore guild with min/max players.
---
He was addressing the current player base, the people at that event were current players, thats why they were there.  
---
I'm sure the vast majority of the people at that event; that he was addressing at that time, think they do, but they don't.  
---
The people that think they do, and really do ( you and me ) were not there, he was not talking to us.
---
This is being done to bring us back, and it will work, its got nothing to do with current players.
---
Retail and classic are different games, enjoying Pac-man does not mean I will enjoy Mortal Kombat.  
---
Different target audiences.
---
Warrior set is really nice also.   The rest look like BC era clown gear.
---
*conflicting
---
Uhhhh the gnolls are killed for their armbands....yikes
---
Just raiding was 4-5 hours 6 days a week:)
---
1. None whatsoever. Patience my friend. 
---
2. Timeline is gated using the 1.12.1 version state of the game. No actual patches, but rather content being released after a not-yet-determined amount of time/activity.
---
3. No plans. Way to early to tell.
---
Dude sameeeee! Mordhau is the first game I've played In quite some time that I just want to call out of work just to play it
---
The problems with garrisons wasn't the customization, but it *benefitted* players to stay in their garrison. If player housing didn't award gold, crafting mats, or anything and didn't have npcs like auctioneers or vendors, people wouldn't just sit in their garrison all day. Especially in Vanilla.
---
They do...
---
This isn't a matter of opinion.  WOTLK was the beginning of "bring the player not the class".  Bring the class was still extremely important in TBC, to the point that the raid comp was neatly formed based on the party specific buffs/utility each class brought.  Pure DPS classes were still the best raw dps in the game, hybrids suffered from less scaling or simply just had lower numbers overall due to the fact that they brought necessary buffs.  You shouldn't be  seeing a shadow priest, ele sham, enh sham, ret paladin, or warrior top dps.  The only time I remember ret paladin ever "topping" was in the WOTLK pre patch when TBC was effectively over, we had already switched to 3.0.
---
I agree that they have stripped classes of way too much utility in retail, and that DPS has become the only important metric for DPS and it's contributed to the game being more boring, but your opinions about TBC are ill founded.
---
It all depends on what you can get your hands on but generally you want items with a healthy mix of both offensive and defensive stats. Agility is great because it provide both crit and dodge.
---
Warrior t2.5 set is perfect. Onyxia tooth pendant. Early on if you're only swapping one or two pieces Lionheart's Helm is strong because it provide good offensive stats however no defensive stats at all.
---
Keep in mind that #1 prio is to survive. Otherwise you are useless. When you feel comfortable you can start swapping some pieces and try to find a nice balance.
---
have u ever seen a bg full of premade russians? aids.
---
Imagine if they released it today..
---
sw_stats my friend (dmg meter)
---
I'd say it's arguable that they're above mages, but they are a lot better than most inexperienced players would be lead to believe.
---
NSFW? Seriously? Come on... 
---
What, stacey is going to get a glimpse over the shoulder at your office cubicle job and file a REEEEEEEport for sexual harassment and your career is over? BLUE SACK!!!!111
---
Yeah lmao, you are right. I suppose it didn't stay as a negative thought from younger me.
---
xposting a 3 year old post. wild.
---
Uhm one per week per server. Two of my closest friends were both 14. I gave up grinding 12. But still, if you no life its possible.
---
Shieett. Hopefully can pull that off with 2-3 hours a night Monday-Friday.. or something like 4 hours 3 days a week. I want that set for damn sure. Looks amazing man. You going to do Rogue again?
---
We gave them to DPS. Our tanks had Quel'Serrar lol.
---
here's some math, though the numbers may not be exactly accurate cos it seems hard to find this stuff online.  I dont have WoW installed atm.  
---
with the BiS items you have like 2k mana?  
---
aimed shot is like 50 mana per second, multi-shot is like 20 or something? lets assume 70m/s that's 28 seconds to OOM, not factoring in raptor strikes or whatever else
---
even with 3k mana and a major mana pot that's something like 60 seconds on average by my numbers
---
I was hoping for Hootie and the Blowfish
---
T16? excuse me?
---
I really want to roll a druid in classic as I've never played one in vanilla but loved healing in TBC. My question is with leveling, everything says to level feral but I kind of want to level balance. I recently leveled a shaman full elemental while leveling on a p server and yes i went through mana and I know it wasn't optimal but by no means was it impossible - and the ele burst was fun once i got in the higher 40s. Is it stupid to level balance or what are your thoughts? I plan to heal dungeons along the way (which I know I can do as feral just keep some int gear) but I just want some fun ways to get starfire crits and higher mf damage (knowing full well that when mobs are in melee range ill shift). What are some other druid thoughts on this?
---
See, back in TBC I had a good gig for over a year where my guild would set up login times and then raid times. So we'd have a pool of 50ish people who were down to raid, the leader would say Friday nights, login at 6pm, raid is after. So you'd login sometime after 6, raids typically started by 8, and people would sub in for one another if there were holes.
---
It worked well enough and people weren't bound to a specific time, more like a certain evening. This was big for me because i'd sometimes get out of work at 7 or 5 or 8 and much of the time i'd get home early enough and jump in. Sometimes we'd have 2 raid teams going at once.
---
We had a good mix of being casual but actually getting raids down. I hear what you're sayin though.
---
I did the same. Got a group for Ragefire Chasm. It took a while for the group to form. Had a drood tank, but needed some heals. We were all in the barrens as the group was forming. Finally got some heals and one of members was on the timed quest to Thunderbluff from the cross roads. He was almost done, but had to fly back. We were grouped up for about 10-12 minutes waiting for everyone to get Org, but we waited. We buffed, we danced. We talked. We were patient because getting a group takes effort and we didn't want it to fall apart. Our drood tank was lower level, but we dealt with it. We sheeped things, we peeled rogue mobs off the healer. We died a few times. It was great. It wasn't easy, it wasn't convenient. It took time and effort just to walk through the instance portal. I remember all of it. I can't recall any details of the last BFA dungeon I ran, it was uneventful. This classic dungeon run. . . Cherished.
---
Mage and priest! That's exactly the choice I've been stuck with for the last two months. Care to share any thoughts on picking?
---
&gt; Hamstring everything. If it moves, hamstring it. If it's dead, hamstring it anyway. 
---
This is why I call it spamstring in my head :D
---
Shitting on Vanilla? Just because a handful of items from the last raid of Vanilla was still usable in the FIRST raid tier in TBC doesnt make the point invalid in any way.
---
I‚Äôm considering buying it after reading the responses here. I‚Äôve been around wow since launch and it feels like I could get a lot of joy out of it.
---
Yeah, I also like the Warrior set
---
Mages only problem is that they spend forever on drinking
---
No, I'm just tired of people trying to defend retail in the Classic WoW sub. The Classic WoW community can't get a break from the white knights.  
---
r/wow has 1 million members, isn't that enough people for you to discuss retail over there?
---
"nothing like" is a bit of an overstatement.
---
It was a more balanced version of vanilla, made a lot of specs raid viable while still keeping the need to grind/farm.
---
The only thing I didn't like about TBC was the introduction of flying. But to this day it was my favorite era playing wow.
---
Ret was playable but not amazing for most of TBC then when the Sunwell patch came out it became extremely good.
---
A lot of (pre)BIS lists are 1: Limited by the writer's knowledge, 2: Based on their personal preferences and 3: Based on the time needed to get an item.
---
Some mages might value 1 crit higher than it actually is worth in terms of damage, some might overvalue stats in terms of SP etc., so the lists can end up being largely subjective. 
---
A lot of mage pre-bis will be "Of Frozen Wrath" green/blue items. You can, theoretically, get a Bloodstrike Dagger of Frozen Wrath which gives +23 Frost damage, which is miles better than 1% crit. However, very few mobs in the game drop Bloodstrike Dagger, and the roll is pretty rare. Including it on a prebis list is argueable. 
---
However, Inventor's Sword is not really prebis by anyone's definition. It's strictly worse than Witchblade, which is a normal dungeon drop.
---
Excactly yes!
---
I feel kinda relieved to finally understand what is up with them.
---
Now what about Gauntlets of Martial Perfection from Gruul and Girdle of the Endless Pit from Magtheridon?
---
You spelled Cookie wrong.
---
Yikes... need help digging that grave?
---
Key bit of info there, that being 'demo'. I'm sure any issues raised will be looked into. 
---
I'm not sure why you are so bitter about it, its not out yet so wait untill its released. Your shitpost may have a bit of weight to it then, but thinking about it probably not.
---
1. Still summer 2019 last we heard, of course that could be as last as September.
---
2. Almost certainly no, they're using 1.12 with scheduled content releases likely months apart.  In that regard it should be much more stable than vanilla.
---
3. No plans yet, I would think if classic works out well then BC and wrath and possibly later servers would be a no brainer though.
---
Orc paladin just looks wrong
---
TBC was the golden age of WoW imo. (apart from flying mounts).
---
I'd play in a TBC server forever
---
Classic isn't a free service, what are you on about?
---
Is this not the Azuregos cloak?
---
The struggle is real. PvP happened on a PvP server. etc.
---
I agree the priest are very solid lvlers i barly died with priest meanwhile lvlef rhe priest
---
Yeah, in trying to make the game more convenient and removing ‚Äúchores‚Äù they made the game feel empty and meaningless. You can‚Äôt truly enjoy something if you don‚Äôt put any effort to get it, just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. Or at least it works that way for me.
---
Yes it is possible to do it with less hours commited than what I was doing. I was one of my guilds raidleaders so I joined all the raids. Was my servers second horde rogue with full T2.
---
I don't know the exact mechanics but I was under the impression it was about how much farther you were ahead in honour than the rest of your faction. It's why people started to coordinate when they would get r14, because if two people grinded hard out (it used to be multiple people per an account for 24/7 honour grinding) then neither may end up getting it. I don't think it was feasible, at least initially, as I remember it, to have more than one per faction per week.
---
&gt;The thing that destroyed your eyes was spending too many hours staring at a screen
---
sooo they really are harmful then lol
---
Take all the servers and all the weeks it was possible to get Rank 14 and you have a rough total.  I‚Äôm sure there are less individual comments on being R 14 than the number you arrive at.  
---
You also need to take into consideration that many of the people who post and participate here were on the higher end/more hardcore than casual side of the playing spectrum.
---
Ah this sounds very logical, so a lot of crappy gameplay things I guess? Which things exactly?
---
They're turning on cash valves that rusted over as many as 12 years ago for some people. It's a guaranteed boon to the brand. I'm just amazed they didn't implement it at the height of their popularity. I guess that fell too closely to vanilla itself (which says something about the last multiple expansions). 
---
I hope it does well. I hope the old spirit of Blizzard is reignited and recognized by the Actividiots so that they'll relinquish their deathgrip on the IP.
---
It depends, imo, on what you start playing classic for. When they go in and think, hey, i always wanted to raid in classic or do end game pvp,  sure they will be bumped because it will take them far longer than they anticipated to get there and they will loose interest. Those who "just try it out" and do it because they love wow in general Will fall in love because classic connects you alot more to your character, the server community, and the journey.
---
In short, if they play for tje journey, what classic always was about, they will love it.
---
If they are not open minded and approach it like retail, leveling is just s hurdle to reach endgame content, they won't enjoy it.
---
All hybrids should be crappy healers by your logic
---
&gt;I cleared normal and now I've seen the content
---
lmao
---
Of course people knew what weapon skill was. Wtf? 
---
Also, he is holding an AQ weapon which means BWL was on farm for 8 months at least. Could've seen a lot of Maladaths in that time.
---
&gt;Shitting on Vanilla?
---
I literally said the opposite, *"shit on anything* ***not*** *vanilla".*
---
Besides, someone needs to learn what a joke is.
---
I mean, there‚Äôs a big difference between ‚Äúmade it into ulduar‚Äù and ‚Äúwas better than t7‚Äù. Because it certainly was not better.
---
Except for BFA...they didn't admit it was rushed, they just released a half-baked product..
---
Or played when it was new and there was enormous and intense competition. You said yourself there were already multiple r14s in your one premade. So a ton already had it, and those that did were the more hardcore, so naturally the less devoted are going to earn it with less competition.
---
Well?....it's tomorrow...
---
WoW Retail is a good modern MMORPG. WoW Classic is a good traditional MMORPG. Having both will cover a large market.
---
Some have said it's possible that the purpose of WoW Classic is to bring players back before launching a completelly new, built from scratch MMORPG.
---
Retail is that way, sir --&gt;
---
4. Askyl is 100% right, but I don‚Äôt even know if they‚Äôve even committed to using it in that limited scope. Server community integrity is one of(if not the) most important aspects to the development team, so I have little to no worries on that being an issue.
---
I also wonder how much sharding in live negatively effects 6. &amp; 7. from a tech standpoint. Could be why server performance in open world large scale combat is in such a bad spot
---
imo, BiS will always be squishy. Not everyone has the exact same spec. The value of mp5 vs spirit vs spell power can be argued, and your BiS item might change when the boomkin joins your group, or based on which fight you're talking about. Some items are better for AoE than others, for long fights or short fights, etc. Some stats have diminishing returns, so BiS might be valid if you have the full set of items, but if you are in between tiers, some of the BiS adjacent items can actually be better. Ex: +hit is great until you hit the cap, and then it's useless.
---
Basically, BiS is a rough guide, but you'll have to make some of your own judgement calls.
---
More like day -30+
---
It is, I specifically was speaking from the perspective of a Warlock, where the Bloodvine Set is stupidly good. Though I understand why it would be assumed I was talking about rogue.
---
Im surprised that shaman is second after warrior on horde. Might switch to hunter after all for easier gear.
---
Haha I was going to say, dagger tanking is definitely en vogue in the current meta.
---
Uhhhh yeah.  If we can keep core gameplay identical to classic, but have an absolutely gorgeous world like this screen shot.  dude... I may never go outside again.
---
The true defias leader
---
That's a bummer. I totally get it though. TBC raiding was so good too. I don't think there is any way to prevent that the next time either without breaking nochanges and sabotaging what makes the game great.
---
Yea pretty good movie
---
It was really annoying in pvp.  You went from having a good idea what kind of gear your opponents were wearing to absolutely no idea at all.
---
Yes there were. They were the quest givers for the robes ( I can't remember the name of them, but the quest required Robes of Arcana ), and the ones inside gave Shard of the Infernal/Felhound. Whichever shard you chose to quest for. None of them were trainers though.
---
was duo leveling as a warrior and we were being chased by horde near Theramore. They had already killed us a few times while trying to get back to town, so when they came around again I told my buddy to run while I distracted them and he ended up making it to the boat and back to IF.
---
Seems small but I remembered it after all these years as it just felt like it fulfilled my class fantasy, holding the line while allies escaped.
---
This makes me want to roll a Tauren so bad. :( But I don't like the classes anymore they have to offer.
---
Engineering is great for Hunters since you can craft scopes and make your own ammo. You can also carry jumper cables for a "ghetto rez" which will make you more useful in raids.
---
Leatherworking is "meh" other than the black dragonscale set, and that will be replaced eventually.
---
Mining vs Skinning is probably a tossup, mining will sell better long term, but with Leatherworking you can craft cured rugged hides on cooldown, which provide a decent income stream.
---
does ur dad work at blizzor
---
This sounds like my brother and I. I was 13 and he was 17 playing WoW while I was playing FFXI. We gamed side by side and I watched him raid and he watched me raid. I never played vanilla so I've been asking him a ton of stuff about it. His guild was one of the first 5 to down MC back in the day. 
---
Unfortunately, he won't be playing because, "I've literally done everything that is to do in vanilla." makes sense.
---
Every single raid should be bringing an enhancement shaman for windfury totem alone.
---
The thing about eyesight, it usually gets worse as you age
---
No, starting at something up close for countless of hours are harmful.
---
Hit 56 on a pserver in anticipation. didn‚Äôt want to hit 60 and spoil it. But the taste I got just built up the hype
---
even more.
---
These exact thoughts every single time.
---
I can‚Äôt wait for everyone to look mismatched as fuck!
---
Lol. For me it was Kil'Jaedan. I logged in, stood in stormwind, joined the queue, popped in. I was the most geared tank, so I was main tank. I told the group I hadn't done the fight and they told me to "just pull". So I took about 10 seconds to read the dungeon journal again and someone pulled.
---
So, I take aggro, start wackin him, everything goes dark, some things appear, about 30 seconds later he's dead.
---
There's loot, everyone leaves, i'm standing there wondering what even happened.
---
Exactly, everyone knows that titan dicks glow
---
If you PvP seriously on a character, it's a must have. 
---
For PvE, it has some good AoE damage items if you are min/maxing while raiding. You can also get teleports to Gadgetzan (fastest way to AQ, especially for Alliance) and Everlook (Winterspring, good for gathering).
---
Locks are the general consensus best pvp class in that patch.
---
&gt; Only the hardcore fans will stick with classic longterm.
---
I don't know about that. I wouldn't consider myself a hardcore fan. I wasn't back when vanilla came out, and I won't be when classic comes out. What I am, though, is left out. You see, I was too young to understand much of anything about WoW when it came out, and I was certainly not able to afford a subscription every month, so my enjoyment of WoW was patchy at best. But in the lead-up to WoW Classic's release, I've been doing my homework. I've been gobbling up hours and hours of stories from Vanilla wow, as well as information about the various changes, raids, and most of all, the expansions.
---
I was not ready, nor able, to experience Vanilla WoW on it's first go around, and I regret that. So now that I have been given a second chance, I am NOT missing out on this. 
---
And honestly, I'm truly hoping for Progression servers that go through all of the expansions in order, because I want to see what I missed. I want to be a part of the WoW community again. And who knows, along the way, maybe I will become a hardcore fan. But what I do know is that I really want to stick around. I won't forgive myself if I don't at least get 1 character to 60. It's been one of my big gaming regrets honestly.
---
I was a smart kid so when a green item dropped in DM i asked what to click. A friendly player said that if i needed it i click the coin else i click the dice.
---
Friendly and sincere players ftw.
---
Could be wrong but as far as I remember a while back twitch did say they were going to separate retail and classic wow
---
I just threw up in my mouth.
---
I hate it. It makes your gear inconsequential.
---
I would not mind some news!
---
that smug look pisses me off every time.
---
I wouldn't mind dungeon queue if it wasn't cross realm. Non cross realm dungeon queue would still add a little sense of community but cross realm adds literally zero.
---
I was running dungeons pretty much as soon as I could because I thought it was so cool...but also before I knew what I was doing. All I knew was if I pressed the top button, i would win almost every roll, if i pressed the bottom, not so much. So I just pressed the top for a long time until someone finally explained exactly what I was doing and why it was bad. 
---
So not really ninja looting in the sense but more oblivious to simple mechanics.
---
I hope they go back to their original development plan if they wish to progress WoW Classic. For example, add Hero classes with no level cap change.
---
Chance of blue post: low

Chance of many non-value-adding posts to this subreddit: very high
---
Hey there thanks for your interest, here is another one.
---
https://discord.gg/yuPzSP
---
Sorry bud, that's genetics.
---
Everyone here has cleared Naxx and received Rank 14, it hilarious.
---
That dosen't sound strange at all.
---
I disagree. The electromagnetic radiation alone from it is super harmful in many ways. That shit often made me physically ill.
---
I do not deny that my eyes would have gone bad even if I was using an LCD from the start but not to such an extent as they are now.
---
Yeah, I referred to them as placeholders in my message below. I just meant original in the sense of this is how they originally looked like before they were replaced.
---
And at the same time, they ruined the carrots. I like my carrots to have unique models and proper names, thanks.
---
It's mostly incorrect.
---
That would be something. I doubt they will do it so suddenly. I think people want to prepare a bit for launch, and Blizz likely respects that.
---
ok, attached to our retail account
---
I started my honor grind about 5 months after the release of the honor system, so it wasn't that late but I'm sure it played it's part as well. The same can be said about Classic though, it will probably not require the same effort to get R14 after half a year after the patch as it will for the first few people that goes for it.
---
I agree, and I don't know why you're being downvoted.  I got rank10 back in the day as a feral druid...while progression raiding in AQ40/Naxx...while going to college full time and holding down a job.   I didn't have to get anywhere near 2k HKs a day.  This guy was either doing something inefficiently, is full of shit, or they were on some *really* oddball server, or some combination thereof.
---
Kinda like that one tier where they gave hunter's an eyepatch cuz, y'know, who needs depth-perception amiright
---
You really can‚Äôt go wrong with either Paladin or Priest. If you can‚Äôt stand leveling, Priest is a lot quicker. Also rolling Ally. I love the old school RPG feel of the Alli races in Vanilla.
---
I'm sorry, out of the loop, but what's the CDN version?
---
I left Russian Reddit to hide from the KGB, do they really find me here ?!
---
But a lot of classic players will only sub for classic.
---
You're defining the activity using a population that is a tiny fraction of the pvp community. Most people who pvp know they can't reach r14, but they still pvp. Why? Because it's fun.
---
Great stuff - just watched the 1st 2 videos.  
---
I'm keen as anything to roll Warrior on classic...but hoping for dwarf. I'm not close to as knoledgeable as you, any chance on a 1-12 guide for dwarves that would feed nicely into these?  
---
Additionally, any advice on changed paths if I'm happy to slow my lvling a bit to improve my rep overall?  
---
ty again
---
It depends on the server. You need a push getting 12k RP the final week to get from Rank 13 to 14, and only 0.03% of the PvPers can get 12k RP in a single week. So only one could get it on low pop servers, while multiple people could get it on high pop servers. [If you want more details about the math to get there, check out this article](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html).
---
Leveling balance could be fun. I'm naturally inclined to play caster hybrid specs too. Unfortunately though, leveling as balance is a lot slower, and it will get tedious, and probably frustrating. They not only have mana issues, they also have pretty low damage output, and they have issues finding good leather gear for a caster
---
Also why we just sit here with baited breath for the next Blue post.
---
I have nothing else in my life, give me a release date!!!!
---
I mean I‚Äôm all for classic but T16 destroys defias leather in terms of looks. In fact the only set I thought was cool from Vanilla for rogue was bloodfang. Blizz has done an excellent job these days with there 3D modelling and textures compared to the old days.
---
It was good for leveling!
---
that‚Äôs great. and activision will try to leverage that.
---
Okay I will clarify some thing here. There is radiation coming from your CRT but there are no evidence that it's harmful. The shit that made you physically ill is probably that your CRT was running at 60hz or lower which can cause headache for some people.
---
Posts made by Blizzard employees on the official forums. They are called Blue Posts because the font they write in is colored blue, which no one else can use
---
They can also kill a lot of mobs at once too, though.
---
I will kite you from Kalimdor to the Eastern Kingoms, better bring a friend or 2 for moral support.
---
More people know of the placeholder T2 designs because they weren't replaced until 1.9 I believe.
---
[This is what they looked like](http://i.imgur.com/yVSTr.jpg)
---
Yeah, getting R14 is not something that goes in line with a family, kids, a job etc., unless you are willing to make a big sacrifice.
---
to be fair, competitive shooters in the olympics use things that hold one of their eyes shut haha
---
Just trying to spark some discussion in these dry times. Didn't mean to come off as needy
---
Madseasonshow has lots of videos about classic, also his voice is very calming.
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/madseasonshow
---
That's true. You pretty much had to be in a decent premade group to even have a chance at getting to Rank 10+.
---
I‚Äôd love to play my OG Orc Paladin. I‚Äôll judgement those fools in molten core bro.
---
I guess you didn't understand me here : I'm not asking the game to be changed, I know better. I'm just explaining what are the flaws of this game design for people like me.
---
I stop playing at the beginning of TBC and came back in Legion. I lasted less than a month I think. Never played BFA.
---
I'll take the imperfect Vanilla design any day instead of the solo game that modern WOW became.
---
They would instantly lose the subscribers who's char got deleted. Thats minus in revenues and in profits. Publicly traded companies do not act like that.
---
Yeah, I think there's a huge bias towards hardcore players in this sub. I mean, people who just played casually probably don't really care *that* much about returning, while us hardcore players can't wait!
---
Go home tips you are drunk
---
Cool, Jul 4 - Sep 8 here. Same thoughts, made a huge time window. Just booked it to begin very late, as I don't expect a release yet in June.
---
I'm sorry to shoot you down, but no. Just no. Seriously.. No
---
I'm looking forward to the actual carpet of skeletons you always had at Nessingwary's. You could always tell how hot the place was on how well filled-out the carpet was.
---
If it‚Äôs a post it will be something like ‚Äúclarification on *insert old post here*...‚Äù
---
bro my main since 2008 only has like 60 days played
---
magic?
---
THE FUCKING TALENT TREES MAN. ITS WHEN THEY KILLED THEM. LFR too. Pet battles maybe. THE FUCKING TREES THOUGH
---
This kid tells his mom on you when you kill him in WoW
---
Most of it was horribly itemized at this time as well. Rogues in particular wanted nothing to do with T1 until it was given better stats. We DEd so much rogue gear.
---
That's one of the things that I enjoyed about Everquest. When an expansion came out, sure you replaced *some* pieces of gear, but some pieces, such as planar armor from classic raids when the first expansion, Ruins of Kunark, came out, were still bis, hence the classic planar raids were still viable and still run. 
---
Hell, some expansions didn't even raise the level cap, and were more about providing new lower level content for newer players to spread out in. When you finally did replace a piece of gear, you didn't have the feeling of "lawl, that boar was apparently tougher than KT". It was more like "well, I've had this piece of gear for a very long time and got a good amount of use out of it, but alas, it's time to finally retire it." Made raids and the gear itself that much more memorable.
---
I really wish I could answer your question better because MoP is where I quit WoW.  I played a lot all the way through Cata but only lasted into the first patch of MoP.
---
The questing was good.  Fun quest chains recruiting new races, meeting people like Anduin and Chen.  Zones were gorgeous.  I enjoyed the farming mini-game because it reminded me of harvest moon.  A great guild I enjoyed playing with.
---
I'm having trouble putting my finger on why I disliked it.  The weird new focus on very linear story lines in each zone?  No Cata pioneered that and I really liked those zones.  Maybe the 5man content was less interesting?  Maybe the move to personal loot?  Maybe the fact that within the first month I was just doing dailys forever?  Possibly the move to giving feral 4 specs instead of 3, I didn't like that one, it came with that god awful talent revamp if I remember correctly.
---
I'd say compared to Cata it lacked a LOT, I can't understate that.  Cata's new zones were pretty lore rich for stuff we wanted to know more about vs Mists zones being very lore rich to stuff we hadn't encountered yet.  I think this meant we were way less invested in learning about the lore.
---
Archeology was added in cata giving us a brand new profession that I was actually pretty crazy about.  MoP didn't add one.
---
The cata redesign of the zones was amazing.  Not because the zones were better but because after 2 expansions and years of just leaving the old world to rot and visiting new places we got to experience a whole new Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms.  Yes looking back I miss how the original version worked and we "lost" content but it was absolutely amazing to see the story move forward without just visiting a new set of 6-7 zones.  MoP just went back to the old formula.
---
I think the issue is Cata set the bar really fucking high for what expansions could do.  MoP was more of the same in a zone people cared a lot less about.  Northrend was Arthas.  We'd been dealing with the undead in Vanilla and Arthas was pretty damn important to WC3, visiting there was huge for lore reasons.  Outland was Illidan, also huge in WC3 but also tied up lore from WC2 and we got to see the origin of Orcs.   Compared to that MoP was about pandas, who were cool and all but never really important.
---
Last I checked there was a bit more to PvP realms than getting ganked by lvl 60s while levelling? So why should you have to give up all that stuff by rolling on a PvE server just because some asshole is fucking your day up while levelling?
---
This. I felt more invested and connected with more players via my lvl 6 druid last night than my max level warlock in live. And it‚Äôs not even a real server! haha
---
Yeah.. But imagine.. Me and you, logging in to azeroth.. Another adventure üíõ
---
Guys, I'm pretty damn sure it's referring to retail's shards, not classic opening weekend shards.
---
Very true, feel like doing that all the time would mess you up somehow tho
---
*shrug*
---
It's way older than that
---
Yeah 2k hks a day is almost 3 kills per minute if you're playing 12 hours daily. It's nearly impossible even without taking into account diminishing returns on honor
---
Classic wow is a repost. Get over it.
---
Me too
---
For 1-10 zones yeah, sharding is kind of a necessary evil. I‚Äôm still worried they might have to expand it if the game is more active than they thought, as they expect 50% of people to quit before 10. They haven‚Äôt stated for a fact it‚Äôs only the starting zones either, they used it as an example. 
---
I think it will be fine, but I would hate any sharding past 10, even if I have to fight for mobs.
---
Spec into imp charge + tactical mastery. Switch to zerker while charging. Use bloodrage.
---
Actually, what powers the head quarter is our desperate calls.
---
It works exactly as in monsters inc, the more we cry the more power we are generating!
---
Interesting  buy Honestly  no
---
I'd like to know if it'll progress indefinitely or if once we get naxx, it'll stop forever. 
---
Do they plan on releasing new progression servers?  Or releasing TBC but only on some servers?
---
Did anyone else level rogues just to get the full defias gear...and then make another rogue to do it all over again?
---
They scrapped the AH app from retail because the it wasn't popular enough with the player base, so chances it becomes available in classic is practically zero.
---
Hello,
---
All the "change" you ask are mainly outgame features. 
---
- signing up for raids using the in game calendar / integraded addon or Shivtr
---
- general server info; patch release dates, current amount of players online(horde-allience)
---
- days of WoW subscription left.
---
- Battle.net integration
---
However, this idea is terrible :
---
-option to vendor trash for creating free bagspace.
---
You have to find a vendor to sell your trash. If you can use an app to do this, it will 100% be abused
---
if it was black i might have assumed rogue yeah. Still those spikes look like they are compensating for something, and the little design choices here and there - such as the belt yeah - are just bloody weird.
---
Without the MM. 
---
Just ORNG.
---
 #nochanges!
---
By deleting the character or threatening with it, they risk losing the given subscriber FOREVER (as far as I think with my own head and imagine like minded ppl). Thats minus in revenues and profits in the long run. Publicly traded companies dont act like that.
---
I understand that you and many ppl hate Actvision(-Blizzard) for well grounded reasons but they cant reasonably pull something like that in the current circumstances (fierce competiton in digital gaming sector, market cap halfed in the last months, goodwill and market reputation extra important for consumers etc).
---
Both are healers both are wanted. 
---
Most guild run with 2 or 3 rdruids not cause they suck, but cause no one plays them. Even your server first naxx guild will bring druids. 
---
A good casual Druid will beat a mediocre priest every day. And honestly, the gulf between them is small enough the good Druid will beat the good priest often enough as is. 
---
Play the one you want, you‚Äôll be happier, and want to play more. No guild who needs healers will turn one away who is a good player.
---
Hell, you can make a good 20g plus per hour just grinding whiskers in stv. My 40 mount gold farm is always grind 32-40 grinding panthers and tigers in North stv
---
I thought T16‚Äôs were for bullseyeing whomprats.
---
(They‚Äôre not much bigger than 2 meters)
---
Gotta lose some to win some. I personally won‚Äôt play on a private server ever, but will jump at the chance to play on a Blizzard server. 
---
Let them get pats on the back and feel like they are the saviors of WoW. We all know they‚Äôre doing it for the money. Just wait until microtransactions become a thing after the last phase is released.
---
This is a fucking troll post
---
Well its a different game so its pretty obvious that'll be the case
---
The way I looked at it, I couldn't even go to a movie for $15, once you factor in popcorn and a soda.  So a movie for $20-25 that lasts 2 hours, or for $15/month I was getting around 200-250 hours of entertainment.  Seemed like a good deal to me.
---
I've been saying this for a long time.  It will make them money, because it will bring players back.
---
It was indeed 60hz but I often got headaches. Now that I use an LCD (also 60Hz) the headaches are very rare. Unless I just built up some resistance or something...
---
I made myself a rule after classics announcement (knowing i'll lose my private server chars). It is for testing, and sheer enjoyment. I have a number of classes close to 20 now, which is so i can run the first dungeon and get a feel for the class. So far i really enjoy warlock and shaman in the early levels, druid is so weak it is ridiculous (high mana cost, low dmg, but otherwise fine. Just a pain), and warrior is so tough.
---
Fucking Diablo players
---
Actually, yeah, kinda. It was all very legion themed. Lots of glowing green everywhere.
---
I was technically active last year as I was missing WoW and wanted to see where things were at, but quit again after a month. Last time I seriously played WoW was in WotLK. HATED Cata, and quit a month or two in. 
---
So excited to be returning, it‚Äôs been so long. I‚Äôve thought about pservers, but trying to save myself for the real deal.
---
It does not by the looks of it
---
lmao dude xD that is some Tipsout level knowledge bomb right here!
---
haha yeah definitely - but so would slaughtering thousands of animals and humanoids in order to level up and get money xD
---
You could just play it safe and roll on a US server with a VPN.
---
If I plan on rolling on a pvp server, doing bgs, but not caring much for pvo other than that, how badly am I shooting myself in the foot by going alliance warlock? Is it as bad as people say?
---
I am very jealous of your view on the game.. I tried high end raiding for a few expansions but in the end when I was fully geared, there was always a new raid or expansion rendering my gear useless and if i took a break for a couple of month some casual had overtaken me with LFR gear. Couldn't stand it in the end.
---
Keep your view, I believe its healthy
---
I didn‚Äôt raid after MC really, or was so far behind it didn‚Äôt matter.  There are several solo or grinding options, as well as crafting items you can buy with gold (or eventually buying a raid spot/specific drop with gold).
---
If you don‚Äôt play enough to get the best gear, why do you feel entitled to be competitive?  Its no different than lv 50 vs lv 60.  The lv 60 played more and is currently more powerful than you.
---
I think something like optional normalized geared battlegrounds could be cool, but ultimately that would fall under the same situation, with more casual players getting stomped by people who pvp 12 hours every day.
---
Thank you for linking this holy shit
---
Was playing a holy priest during a SM:Cathedral run. We had just downed Whitemane and the shield dropped. I told the tank that if he ran it again, it would be better to down Whitemane before downing Durand so that she wouldn't keep healing him during the fight. The tank (who had lead) got pissy and kicked me from the group. Too bad for him that he hadn't noticed that I hadn't yet selected need/greed/pass on the shield. So of course, I selected "need" during the 60 second countdown.
---
I actually really like the Shaman set outside of the helmet.
---
Did he spend a full day mind controlling players into the sea while in boat rides from Menethil harbor to booty bay?
---
Nope.
---
God that‚Äôd be the dream. Blizzard creates a realm just for the streamers and their fanboys.
---
I know but what to do, so whenever I get time I will sit and grind in a loan of two years.
---
Jesus I know we‚Äôre strapped for info but this is nothing but a shitty meme circle jerk. 
---
The textures and colors on the Defias gear don‚Äôt even look good. It‚Äôs only being put on this pedestal because of nostalgia.
---
it is maladath brah
---
Druid master class
---
Waiting for Serenity Now Funeral Raid server myself!
---
You should probably compare pvp to pvp. And then you can't reammys ay dota 2 is more (or less) complicated than wow, because you just play against other people till they are of your own skill level.
---
found the pvp 20 year old, still living in moms basement cause I'm an unemployed high school drop out while getting 420 blazed all the time.   When I'm not showing people how hardcore I am in game cause I pvp, I like to go on forums and insult people.
---
I consider myself somewhere in the middle but yeah, I imagine if you never visited thotbot or world of ming or other early wow sites you probably aren‚Äôt on r/wowclassic waiting for a release date.
---
True. I'm hyped as hell for Classic, but when i tried leveling on a pserver 1 month ago (my goal was to level 30 with 2-3 class to make a d√©cision about my first class on classic).  
---
I stopped around lvl 15, because it's honestly really boring to level. I know pservers aren't classic, and that i will be extra motivated to it in Classic, but honestly, i'm still unsure if this motivation will get me to level 60.
---
yea, dude, that idea popped into my head when watching the investors q&amp;a and just looking at numbers. i was wondering if they wouldn‚Äôt do that to assure they wouldn‚Äôt have a dead mmorpg on their hands and kinda forcing players to be subscribed. dunno, honestly, thought i see what the community thinks.
---
thanks for your well thought out comment :) it adds to the conversation nicely.
---
It‚Äôs going to be like that guy who had 30 accounts running at a time, instead you‚Äôll have 50 fanboys swarming the streamer and utterly dominating you in world PvP.
---
There are a lot of good responses here already... I'll add that, as all PvP will be World PvP on launch, having someone to dispel you and toss you the occasional heal solves 90% of your problems. Find a friend who wants to play a priest, paladin, or druid.  
---
Then, you can focus on being a wrecking ball :)

1. No, it'll look just like Vanilla. It's a recreation, not a remaster. (There will be optional improvements because Classic is using the modern WoW client as base. The most notable ones are better shadows, the new water and increased ground clutter distance.)
---
2. Vanilla/Classic is basically a different game than current WoW. It's hard to describe in a few sentences but a lot of people really liked it when it was released and really like it now too, so it must be special. :)
---
3. It's complete BS. There are some differences in gameplay, the largest being that Shamans are Horde only while Paladins are Alliance only. But both is equally interesting.
---
4. Completely depends on what you like. If you like your gameplay dictated by others, go PvP. If you rather go at your own pace, you are better off PvE (you can PvP on PvE servers too).
---
5. Large parts of the content is soloable. Most other parts can be done by 3-4 people (especially if the overlevel and overgear the content). This includes most dungeons and elite quests. High level dungeons *most likely* can be done by 4 people (you'd just miss a dps), while raids cannot be done without a proper group (and you are way better off in a guild to do them).
---
6. Blizzard was very careful to not commit to anything. I guess they are waiting for how successful Classic will be. My prediction is that it will be and they'll re-release the expansions too. However, unless they are *completely* brain dead (which I hope they aren't :), those will be separate servers. So yes, Classic will be Classic/Vanilla forever.
---
7. It directly follows Warcraft 3. However it's much less focused, apart from the main story which leads to the raids, it's more local and laid back. It's a long game, the story is just there in the background to have the fighting make some sense. There are no quest cutscenes and such.
---
8. I highly recommend you don't "prepare" for the game. Go in blind and learn by playing. It takes a lot of time, especially if you restart with a new character. If you have the time, though, it's a very fun and unique experience. And don't worry about not finding other people to play with, if you later decide you want to. There will be plenty who'll not rush (contrary to the prevailing attitude in this subreddit).

great healers OR great dps OR great tanks
---
not great at all the above

CRTs produce a flickering effect on low refresh rates, something that LCD monitors doesn't do. The flickering comes from a brightness drops during a frame update. On LCDs the opacity is the same until the next frame, that's why you don't get that flickering effect. The flickering effect is what can cause headache for some people.
---
Inb4 there are massive launch issues/controversies that cause stocks to tank.
---
(Here's to hoping that isn't the case though.)
---
I can remember one of my first world pvp experiences which probably got me totally sold and helped develop my wow addiction.
---
I started in early Q2 2005 on Magtheridon PvP (US-East) so by the time I started people were already well into 60 or at least beyond 40.
---
There was a raid in the barrens and being a druid I couldn't do much.  As they were killing questing NPC's and starting to get overwhelmed by horde high levels funneling in from Org, I had a break through idea. Character level difference doesn't matter for healing! Granted at level ~20 my heals still sucked but it was still enough to start turning the tide and we ended up pushing them back into Stone Talon Mountains where now sunrock retreat was under attack. I had no idea that town was even there, so I learned a new questing area, got killed, helped kill alliance.... good times.
---
Lfr is like watching a video of the fight on YouTube, except you get some bad loot for it. Nobody cares about it.
---
Haha Jerry crazy
---
Beautiful
---
&gt;  and having to have 300g in consumables to raid burns out everything but the uberguilder in record time.
---
tbh, you don't really need this amount of consumables until C'thun, Naxx. I cleand everthing until C'thun without having to farm more than 1-2hr a week .
---
&gt;Skull of Impending Doom
---
Not sure you're going to regen a lot with that \^\^
---
Seriously. BC was the best WoW ever got.
---
Sadly, there's several issues with this. One being that Hero classes should - under no circumstances - be added to the game while there are other classes / specs out there that have no meaning in this game. 
---
Personally, and this is just my opinion, the overall class balance of TBC is where the game was at it's fullest. If there'd be a way to get the TBC class balance into classic, that'd be phenomenal.
---
Should level 60s spend their time forming roving "gank parties" to make life hell for low level opposite faction players? Not at all in my opinion. In fact, when I was GM of a guild on a PvP server back in BC and Wrath, me gud had very specific rules forbidding unprovoked attacks on starting zones and low level players of the opposite faction.
---
However, it is something that is possible within the ruleset of the game, and Blizzard's official stance has always been that rolling on a PvP server means you are agreeing to that style of gameplay.
---
I would be far more sympathetic to the complaints of people who rolled on a PvP that are unhappy with being ganked if the only way to engage in WPvP (or PvP of any kind) was to roll on a PvP server. But because you can roll on a PvE server and still flag yourself for PvP whenever you wish, this not locking you out of every engaging in PvP, and ensuring that you aren't ganked by level 60s when you are only in your teens or 20s, I don't feel any sympathy for those who chose to roll on a server that explicitly stated that PvP would be an Always-On affair.
---
From experience you won't go oom even in long progression fights as long as you're rotation is good, you use mana pots, and pop the occasional rune.
---

If someone is using the auction house I want to be able to see their character standing at the auction house. I want *World* of Warcraft, not Game of Warcraft.
---
Things that will never happen for $500, Alex.
---
thank you for telling me how to play a game
---
Agreed. You are the "other" type of gamer that Classic will be fairly interesting for. However, I do believe that a mayor part of your core group will not like the game long term.
---
There are absolutely gamers in your core group out there who are looking for the challenge. Who are looking at exactly a "different" kind of game on the market. These people will probably love classic. But those who just want to take a look at what classic felt like - being spoon-fed everything in every single game currently on the market - these types of people will run away from classic very, very fast.
---
Crazy thought:
---
What if we let everyone play however they want?
---
people want to hate on the little guys. I am rolling gnome warrior for classic, mostly for PvP. I intend on tanking too for my guild. not trying to min / max, i think we will survive without the extra weapon skill humans have. Im sure some people will come in saying not possible, forget naxx blah blah. Play what you want, anything can be done with whatever race / class combo. but i think people have just hated on the gnome race since the beginning, dont think they are selected much in general
---
If so, they need to make it a toggle, because for some reason in-game time - even on Oceania servers - is tied to US time. This means most Aussies are stuck with pitch black night all the time (not to mention the IG calendar being a day behind).
---
I mean of course I really hope this happens, maybe it'll shock them into fixing the main game. But classic will undeniably lose a lot of players after the one month mark due to retailers trying it and not likening it and also to the "FRESH WHEN" mentality that people have now. Still I'm pretty sure the initial zerg will be huge and the streamers that have said they will main classic will be a massive plus.
---
Most astonishing the tauren druids and nightelf druids üôà
---
&gt; This isn't a matter of opinion
---
Lol, a weak start
---
&gt; your opinions about TBC are ill founded
---
sorry, didn't you say it wasn't a matter of opinion?
---
Aside from your stupid opening statement, I understand what you're trying to say. This statement is key:
---
"bring the player not the class" 
---
this is the antithesis of what makes vanilla fun. Distilling down classes and allowing any player to bring any class means classes themselves lose individuality.
---
In fact, what makes vanilla fun is you *are* your class. You aren't you. You aren't human player #2423. You are a mage, a hunter, a rogue. 
---
Having a paladin pull great DPS, healing AND tank numbers is just wrong. It isn't fun. It's why vanilla remains the best patch. Because of the IMBALANCE. Not in spite of it. 
---
The imbalance and uneven field across PVE and PVP, somehow, for whatever reason, hit a perfect note in 1.12 and it just works. It works better than any other WoW patch. That's why we're here my dude
---
Because it's hilarious.
---
**Graphics:**
---
Currently the graphics are optional between Classic and Modern.  (This is a point of contention, as changing things like how you see through water or how detailed bushes are can affect your ability to hide and sneak in PvP).
---
**Old vs. New Gameplay:**
---
The highlights for me are:
---
* You are an adventurer, not a hero.  This makes the world feel larger and scarier.
---
* Everything is slower.  Leveling takes longer, travel takes time, running back from death, getting to dungeons, loot progression, everything.  Instead of logging in and doing your dailies to get your AP cap, you're logging in and progressing on whatever goal you had when you logged off the night before.  This combines to keep players from getting bored and burning out as fast.
---
* Community is very important.  You rely on others to accomplish your goals, and actually have a reputation on your server.
---
**Horde vs. Alliance:**
---
Both have good players and bad.  Both have friendly players and jerks.  
---
**PvE vs. PvP:**
---
I personally prefer PvE servers.  They exist because some people do.  My issue with PvP servers is that I am thinking they are:
---
* You're level 42, and come across another level 42, and you square off and test your mettle against each other.
---
* You have a group of 20 people and go to raid an enemy town, and there is a huge battle of 20-on-20.
---
This is what usually happens:
---
* You're level 22, and come across a level 60, who corpse camps you.
---
* You're level 22 in questing greens, and come across a level 19 in full BiS, who corpse camps you.
---
* You're level 22, and come across a group of level 23, 25, 27, and 21.  They corpse camp you.
---
* You're level 22, in combat with 3 mobs (and that was a big deal back then), at 2% mana and 15% HP.  Someone on the other faction, who has been watching you until now, decides to kill you.  Oh, and corpse camp you.
---
* Should you win any of these fights, they will go in general chat and say "I'm being ganked and camped, please help" and then you get a whole group of 60s who come in and corpse camp you.
---
I much prefer PvE servers.
---
**Solo vs. Group:**
---
It's possible to play solo, but I don't recommend it, for several reasons:
---
1. Sometimes it's better to group up, because then you're not competing for kills on quest mobs.  
---
2. You will miss out on a lot of content if you don't group up, including dungeons and open world group areas.
---
3. Some non-elite quests...you still want to group up for.
---
4. If you're going on a PvP server, grouping will be a huge boon for your safety.
---
5. You miss out on the chance to get to know people and build a reputation on your server.
---
**Expansions:**
---
I hope so, personally.  Right now there are no plans to, but that doesn't mean they're against it.
---
**Story:**
---
The story of Vanilla is that you are an adventurer.  There isn't really an over-arching story, and that's honestly what's so great about it.  It makes the world feel bigger.
---
This is some paranoid delusional shit.
---
People tend to go for style or efficiency. 
---
Dwarfs definitely win the Style-War against Gnomes  and when it comes to efficiency you can't beat that juicy +5 Sword Skill for Humans.
---
Although I do likes Gnomes as a race, they just look very unimpressive. 
---
Who looks more fearsome, a big burly Orc or a tiny Gnome with stubby legs?
---
People want to show off their armour and weapons.
---
Pretty nice for aoe tanking! Must have for every tank
---
Came here to ask this
---
&gt;8.1  If it's your first time leveling is suggest doing all the dungeons at least once 
---
Skip 'other' faction dungeons (Deadmines, Ragefire Chasm, Wailing Caverns, and Stockaids) don't try to make your way over and corpse run, not worth it imo.
---
Thunderfury looks like a spellblade, shame it isn't a caster weapon design.
---
Don't forget that they also got Scarab Lord ;)
---
Well said
---
Stealthing into the Gurubashi arena while my friends were distracted fighting, and ninja-ing the loot.
---
Aimed shot is about 30 mana per second and multi is 20. You also have a 10 second rotation so you should be getting 1-2 ticks of spirit regen (5 second rule) in every 10 seconds
---
Beats me. But my favorite wow friend, who passed away a few months ago :(, main'd a gnome warrior with pink hair named Speedbumps for a long time. So the combo will always remind me of a lot of good times when I run into them in the world.
---
Don't base your class choice off a survey lol
---
Hey, if you aren't there to gank and you bop a few heads it's cool. If it's ever worth honor it's cool. Killing the ganking rogue, that's a service. None of that's ambiguous. A lot of people use this kind of argument to say it's a good idea to camp lowbie of the other faction. That's all I wanted to argue against.
---
Yeah it only looks that way because there‚Äôs literally one choice for them. If you were to aggregate the class data they become the least picked, which is sad because they‚Äôre a great class.
---
Well the auction house thing would be great, it‚Äòs not 2004/2005 anymore ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
:D i just expect things from corporations. water wet, fire burns, corporations want more money
---
Name of the addon?
---
Even if ‚Äú50%‚Äù of mobs have something to negate hamstring kiting, such as being ranged or whatever it happens to be, the other 50% of ALL the thousands of mobs you will kill throughout your leveling process is huge. So if you‚Äôre able to reduce your downtime during that half of the whole leveling process, it‚Äôs huge. 
---
How people like to say, leveling is a marathon, not a sprint.
---
And this was the argument blizzard had used against transmogrification but for some reason they tossed it
---
I know lol üòÇ
---
But the attack speed is so fast, every backstab would be hitting like a wet noodle
---
I got 4 going right now as well for practice/testing too. Want to get one close to 60 though so I can remember certain quests when classic releases
---
I never said it was better, i said it made it through one tier into the next.
---
I'll be that guy who will give away small pouches to random folks once I get 4 for myself, others did it to me, I'll have to pass it forward
---
As others have mentioned before, there's probably a bias towards more hardcore players in this sub. That said, I think some people might be lying. Getting to Rank 14 in vanilla took a huge amount of dedication, and at bare minimum a 3 month grind. [Here's some math on the subject if you are interested](https://www.powerupguides.com/2019/05/guide-classicvanilla-honor-system.html). The short story of it is that you could theoretically get it in 12 weeks if you were among the 0.03% top players of your faction each week. In reality this is next to impossible, because the 0.03% bracket could only have room for 1-3 persons per server, so getting there 12 weeks in a row is just not realistic.
---
Because very unsurprisingly, most people are big dumbdumbs and haven't seen the light of the Gnome Warrior. Stupid tall folks lmao
---
Lol. Likely not, he was a lock. I think he means content wise.
---
The site you linked has the t2 shoulders as bis sword rogue stage 3...
---
Most specs were actually raid viable.
---
Only Ret, Boomkin, Arcane, Survival, and Cat were still bad to meh.
---

---
This is the zone that raid is in. What you said is not that far off base, lol.
---
It would be nice if they work on Burning Crusade + Wotlk so we can choose which expansion we want to play.
---
Burning Crusade with :  [https://www.wowhead.com/item=163604/net-o-matic-5000](https://www.wowhead.com/item=163604/net-o-matic-5000) 
---
Wotlk without : LFG/LFR 
---
Everything else stay the same. It'll be a dream for a lot of us.
---
Dude I commented on YOUR thread about retail. This doesn‚Äôt seem to be the ‚Äúcircle jerk over retail hate‚Äù subreddit. This is the WoWClassic subreddit, and I can‚Äôt wait to play Classic, but I also love retail. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with enjoying both.
---
Agreed on pre-AQ40/Naxx with being more lenient on spec performance.
---
I've actually been torn specifically on what to play between: Shaman or Paladin as I both love healing and the class flavour, and aren't a huge fan of priests. 
---
(LOVED Priest in WotLK, so many buttons, enough mana to use them. Vanilla Priest just doesn't seem to have the same playstyle by any margin.)
---
I was considering Warlock as I've never given myself the chance to play pure dps. Always needed to feel useful, wanted faster group access, etc.
---
Druid was going to be my pick at first for it's offtank/heals and fast gearing, though it's looking more as time goes on that there's not enough demand to fit the number of druids around. Also not sure if I love the flavour.
---
I just don't know how you would detangle the extended talent trees from whatever shaman buffs they had planned earlier that got mixed in. I think un-nerfing windfury to an older version might be a nice compromise, still classic.
---
But the points is... most of us want it to be. There isn't a desire for kinda classic. Kind classic, expansion after expansion, is how WoW ended up where it's at now.
---
&gt;Who looks more fearsome, a big burly Orc or a tiny Gnome with stubby legs?
---
Definitely the Gnome. Why is this tiny thing running straight towards our group? What's happening? What is he planning? Is he insane? Oh whoops we're all dead.
---
If anything Classic will allow Blizzard to make even dumber design choices with retail.
---
I thought that Axes were better than swords anyway. Everyone seems to go into Axe specialization. So is a +5 sword skill even applicable?
---
There is a difference of getting benefits from raiding VS being invincible against non-raider 60s. I'd like the first, the second one is annoying.
---
I honestly lived wow, even cata, but fell out of love with mists.
---
WoD's main problem was the lack of content (lots was cut), what we had was actually good. None of that titan forging bullshit, endless grind for azerite, etc. Bfa has tons of boring, unfun content. And shit classes.
---
The idea that druids can't get raid spots is basically perpetuated by idiots on private servers and people that never played vanilla.
---
They see "min/max" and think that brezzes and innervates don't matter, and they forget that having to d/e gear instead of having it gear up a druid has a net loss in healing potential. 
---
If the guild only runs 1-2 druids because of some idea of min/maxing, you don't want to be in that guild anyway. Either they are the most hardcore guild OK the server or they'll disband at some point because they attracted hardcore players that tend to leave their guilds for the more hard core once they are geared up
---
Thats why im rolling medium pop. Had a near 50/50 server all the way to end tbc before faction balance started to become a concern. 
---
As for some high level no-life jack off camping me for an hour, only happened once in Arathi Highlands. Leveled 2 toons through vanilla.
---
Never done it. Never will
---
I hope they don't do expansions... defeats the whole purpose of Classic. If they have ANY plans of doing that, this should be called "progression" and not "classic."
---
It's an ideal off hand
---
&gt; I think that v1.12 is almost too late for me -- it's after things already started to go south, in the vanilla days. 
---
But then you provide an outline that leads directly into how TBC was done...
---
so cool
---
Nah. You may not agree there is a "deeper" aspect, or that people engage in PVP just to be dicks. But the fact remains that slowing down leveling slows down everything else, and thus keeps your side safer. Aggregated across many instances, this can have a sizable impact. It's just math my guy.
---
WoW should be a living world, and PVP servers add an additional aspect to it. This is a fact. Or would like to explain how corpse runs dont add time to your leveling?
---
&gt;It was like when Jon Snow left Ghost last episode.
---
I fcking hate you for that....
---
The cata set, with the green glowing fire and eyepatch was the best set ever for hunter
---
You should probably roll on a PvE server if you don't care about world PvP.
---
The guy said he want's to get a basic understanding, not be preached to about how he doesn't know what he wants.
---
Anyone feel like this is a troll? I mean after rants about how the warrior guides are off and then he claims he wants to be a warrior ü§™
---
Sub and play.
---
I like madseason
---
Only problem with your statement is the "u can" part.  Barely anyone can perform on the level of monkeynews while piloting a warrior when you consider the total population of the game.
---
Think of it like this. Say there were like 89 servers. On each server, every single week, someone could be getting rank 14, for like a 16 months straight. So with some shitty math that's like 64 potential rank 14 players per server. With 89 servers that translates to 5696 potential rank 14 players total in NA alone, but that's only counting one faction, so multiply that by 2 (for each faction) and we get 11392 rank 14s over the lifespan of vanilla.
---
This probably isn't anywhere near reality...
---
...but throw in private servers, where it was arguably harder to achieve rank 14 due to more competitive players and a larger player pool, and we get MANY more rank 14s that were cranked out like clock work, 2-5 every week.
---
Thats why i hate having 4 difficulties and the mentality of having the right to see everything just because they pay a subscritpion, to me raid finder should never have existed and raids should have max 2 difficulties (something in between normale and hc and then mityc) old raids of the expansion should still be relevant and the catch up mechanics softened a lot (meaning that you would not release a dungeon/wq/whatever that will trivialize old content).
---
It's kinda cool to see a gnome wrecking shit up though. Well I already have the perfect name for my Gnome Warrior when classic comes out. I'll have to keep it a secret until then. Once you pick out a name, your pick is set in stone.
---
What were whiskers used for?  My google-fu and wowhead-fu are failing me.
---
Most of us has already paid a ton of dollars to play wow over the years. They're making classic part of the base subscription because it would be shitty to do otherwise.
---
You don‚Äôt necessarily have to ‚Äúno life‚Äù it but something will have to take a backseat. 
---
It could be your family, career, sleep, or relationship. You‚Äôll have to ask yourself if it‚Äôs worth it to you and what your priorities are. 
---
I did it in retail, but back then I was 22. I was right out of college working 40 hours a week, single, and living at home. Now well it‚Äôs a different ballgame and getting &lt;6 hours of sleep a night for a month would have serious repercussions hah.
---
I cba to figure it out but i'm confident you can't get too many 5 sec rule ticks cos of the difference in the cds - unless you limit your dps to line them up more i suppose
---
and then there's the fact that you'll have piss-all spirit :D but using the t0 set gives you a wee bit more
---
i didn't go too deep on all the maths but i found on ret wow (legit source 100%) that i did more dps and for longer using the t0 set with the rest being BiS, vs the full BiS
---
bear in mind though i haven't really played hunter much so i dont know it inside out
---
I would much rather see them continue to be combined as it makes the overall number and ranking look more appealing. Twitch recently introduced the tag system (i.e. you can set the language or what are you doing) and I would much rather see people use this feature. I know its not perfect because some people don't care to set this tag properly but either way I think it's better for the game to be in top #5 of twitch for a long time. If the games are split apart on twitch it will look less appealing for new and returning players to see classic wow #20 on twitch after few months when all big streamers go back to their old shit.
---
For PvE, the human racial is the best since many of the BiS weaps are swords. For PvP, Axe specialization is useful since many of your talents play off of crits.
---
They are grey vendor trash. A stack of 10 vendors for 75s
---
The expansion release weeks were the best times in warcraft. The loot was always boringish outside of the fun stuff like mounts and shit that could make gold.
---
This is just one step down the road that turned WoW into what it was (an MMORPG) into the session-style game with an interactive lobby that it is today.
---
Have to say, I'm not in agreement with these ideas.
---
farming for pots and runes?  ain't nobody got time fo dat :D
---
Zero purchase necessary, normal sub.
---
However, knowing what I know now about Acti-blizzard, I'm very tempted to not have my billing info on my account. I'll probably just buy the 60 day cards.  I kinda liked it when they came in the oldschool boxes, anyway.
---
What a shit show it'll be lol, just imagine the cloud of 8-12 yo fans surrounding the streamers toon
---
Oh nice, thanks.
---
I want this
---
Don't let people tell you otherwise.  I did the same thing.  I came back like a year later to play through it and still had the feeling that I knew where this treadmill was going.
---
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt like this feature that I like? You‚Äôre an idiot!‚Äù
---
top tier m8
---
is it based on a reddit survey? probably because people are bad and don't know how sick gnome warrior is.
---
There are BGs and you can flag open world at 60 for that on a PVE server.  There is no such thing as fair open world pvp.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzQ4P6huu6M
---
Warrior deep dive. Everything you need to know about a warrior is there.
---
If you want leveling guides you can find some so detailed it will break it down quest by quest for you. Just google vanilla leveling guides. On a basic level just know that you aren't going to be able to just sit in 1 zone and level up. You are going to have to exhaust as many quest lines across all level appropriate zones as you can

I have to say, I will always have a very distinct memory of playing one of my first ever AVs and I was rolling with a group of four or five people to take a bunker and out ran a little gnome warrior with a T2.5 set and a legendary hammer. We all hit 180s and peeled out as fast as we could!
---
Don‚Äôt doubt a gnome‚Äôs ability to stoke fear in the horde at least from time to time.
---
&gt; Should level 60s spend their time forming roving "gank parties" to make life hell for low level opposite faction players? Not at all in my opinion. 
---
And yet some do. So why do you not have sympathy for the people complaining about that?
---
Nah

Also for places like the portculis in undead strat for am easy aoe for classes that dont have one to clear the bugs.

I think your approach is bit off the table.
---
As I see, Blizzard did its best to balance things during the vanilla years and the game we all know was the outcome of that process.
---
Fury warriors werent top dps until the later vanilla patches. As an example, whenever I talk to my high school mate he says that they didnt really have fury warriors midway vanilla (he was in a t1-2 content guild). 
---
Or take warlocks who were absolute thrash half of the vanilla (well documented).
---
Things were changing throughout vanilla. Maybe if there had been 1.13, they would have nerfed fury warrior pve damage and/or buffed hybrids (just like they did in tbc).
---
We will never know for sure, but at least ppl have info know on what class to start in Classic and they know what are they getting  into by rolling pally/sham/druid.
---
I for example, was the victim of the hybrid tax system until mid tbc (a shaman forced to healing both in pve, pvp despite wanting to go enha and dps).
---
I would be okay with it, as long as they just silo'd each expansion.
---
You could have Classic servers, TBC servers, Wrath servers, etc...
---
Cool.  Thanks to you both.
---
This man is some kind of special
---
I feel like transmog is a smaller part of this than people realise. Even if you inspect someone in BfA, you don't recognise the items, just item levels. So much more gear is given in BfA. It's not like there's such thing as *the* rogue shoulders to have. So the frequency of drops and lack of unique appearances for those drops is also a factor.
---
Depends on your server I guess. On my server if you were the better premade you would usually just snipe out the honor farmed in the 1 or 2 other premades on my server, and make sure you have more honor than them. 
---
And if you were alot better, you would farm so much faster than them, so you could play less. And with most of us being younger than 18, most of our playtime would be during the weekends which also gave you bonus honor for WSG or AB. Ofc some of them played 6+ hrs in the weekdays too, but it had its ups and downs with how hard it was. I had some friends who got rank 12 or 13 (usually casters) without it being 12+hrs a day. But also had a friend that was 1 week away from rank 14 and lost the 1st standing cause of drama within the premade and some guy didnt wanna wait his turn, so he either account shared or went full no-life and played like 18hrs a day, which my friend could keep up with cause of school. Which led to him giving up the grind.
---
So to sum up from my experience, it would have its ups and downs with how hard it was to get. And it depended alot on who was already going for r14, how many premades were around etc. It really wouldnt surprise me if there were smaller servers out there that had 1 premade on each faction and they would just take turns getting rank 14. The scary part tho is that if you are rank 13, all it takes is one guy to fuck with you and farm as much as he can, even he is a Grunt/Private you'll have to farm more than him.
---
#2 is a funny reason, it's really not a big deal for the few classes it affects.
---
Unless you play Dwarf. Then it's actually worth using. But yeah, your gear progression will look like this for the most part:
---
LBRS/Alterac Valley Xbow -&gt; Rhok'delar -&gt; Ashjre'Thun -&gt; Ouro Gun (if Dwarf) -&gt; Nerubian Slavemaker
---
I don't play wow so someone please explain the steam punk gimp
---
Tmog is a cool IDEA, but ruins aspects (as you noted) of what WoW should be.
---
Let's keep this subreddit in english. It took me about 9 months to finish. From idea, through designing everything, searching for graphics, and finally assembleing everything together.
---
I have found myself wondering on occasion ‚Äúwhy are these squeaking noises making my health vanish?‚Äù
---
Even cheaper if you sub yearly
---
I agree completely with this assessment.. plus the image of a Gnome with Ashkandi in PVP strikes fear in every Horde.
---
Why this thought would even cross your mind is baffling to me.
---
&gt;The Blastershot Launcher in MC from Golemagg, DB handcannon in BWL from Ebonroc and the Toxin Injector in Naxx from Grobbulus
---
I would quit the guild if Hunters wanted those, and the guild actually decided to give it to them over giving those to Warriors/Rogues for PvP.
---
This guy BIS'es
---
The living world aspect of it comes from the ganking, and griefing, and things like the old Hillsbrad battles. 
---
The only point to any of that was to be a dick or to have fun. Literally no one gave a shit about being delayed while leveling beyond the initial frustration of getting ganked. 
---
I‚Äôm not complaining about people being dicks, I loved corpse camping hordies back in vanilla. I‚Äôm just saying you don‚Äôt need to delude yourself pretending you‚Äôre following some kind of master strategy to dominate a server. 
---
It‚Äôs fun to gank people. Sometimes it‚Äôs fun to grief people. You‚Äôre being a dick and it‚Äôs fun. That‚Äôs it. Don‚Äôt need to justify it to anyone.
---
Bruh that‚Äôs like saying a level 7 green made it to undue because no pants dropped. Any ilevel 200+ epic easily beats sunwell gear sockets or not.
---
Not Vanilla but WotLK, but i still like this story. In the same day my friend and I both lead separate VoA runs and ninja looted the 3 man war mammoths, the chances of us both seeing it were so astronomically small. My guild leader got a lot of flak that day and chewed us out on ventrilo. Honestly used to play the game with a lot
---
of bad manners and had a ton of fun doing it. We talk about how reputation followed you back then when there was no cross server/sharding. It made for an extremely fun dynamic having rivals/enemies you would interact with interact with. If you ever played an RPG where you could choose to be a hero or villain it was like choosing Villian on WoW.
---
If you think its boring to level, then classic definitely won't be for you. I've done the same with a private server, and it's pretty fun to level and meet new people (most of whom are really friendly). Theres obviously not much point in leveling there though, as the characters will be deleted soon anyway, so its possibly you'll find it more fun when you know its actual progress instead of a pointless leveling grind on a soon to be deleted private server
---
Looooooool.
---
Ret sucked dick until you were in Sunwell gear, and if you were in a guild doing Sunwell your Ret dps didn‚Äôt matter. Holy was the best Pally spec in TBC and it wasn‚Äôt a top healer. Prot was trash in raids outside of Hyjal and bosses with lots of adds, and only really shined in dungeons.
---
Im thinking by the time you can get an Atiesh you already cleared the entire game. The weapon should exclusively go to whoever the guild deem most deserving of the weapon and not to the player where its the theoretical best DPS upgrade. Because it doesnt matter at that stage.
---
Looks sweet!
---
They have one of, if not the best racials for warrior. It's not that getting out of a slow or snare is so amazing it's that escape artists it's cooldown is ridiculously low in vanilla.
---
This seems to be what BIS lists miss. I would like to see BIS lists with multiple pieces of gear, and notes on /where/ it becomes BIS. For instance, if you are rolling a more MP5 heavy build, your BIS will be different than an Int heavy build.
---
Mitigation is greatly overestimated. You dont need Warden staff for anything except C'Thun tentacles, Patchwerk and maybe Ouro.
---
Blizz has a history of shitting on other mmo release dates so I'd guess (note guess) they would release on July 2nd to cuck ff xpac or if pantheon dropped an alpha date or something.
---
Because that‚Äôs what Pilav mains and no one wants to be a beta male like him lol
---
Yeah haha, what a weird reason.
---
Also keep in mind the Armor cap is like 17.000'ish armor. You can reach this without Warden Staff in AQ40 level of gear with Devotion Aura and Stoneshield Potion.
---
About 200 max if there was no sub fees.
---
I usually see comments in posts that have anything to do quickly gearing mentioning some routes or strategies doing things that apparently only one person can accomplish. I've never played wow before so I have no idea what that means when I see it. Is there a list somewhere of everything in the game that can only be accomplished by a single person?
---
That's one badass looking mf
---
I think your approach is a bit off the table.
---
1.12 as we know today is the outcome of Blizzard's attempt to balance things out during the vanilla years.
---
Vanilla was a process not a stale thing. Fury warriors werent top pve dps before later patches (confirmed by my high school mate whenever we talk about their t1-2 content progress in the old days). Warlocks were absolute thrash in the first half of vanilla (well documented).
---
Maybe if 1.13 had come out, Blizzard would have nerfed fury pve damage and/or buffed hybrids (just like in tbc). But that never happened and we are getting the 1.12 version.
---
At least now ppl know what they are getting into by rolling shaman/paladin/druid.
---
I, for example, was the victim of the hybrid tax system until mid tbc... (Wanted to enha dps but was forced to healing in both pve and pvp).
---
Nope you're just impatient and overthinking it.
---
Damn I actually really like the shaman set, not as much as what replaced but it‚Äôs cool in its own way.
---
I'm going to be a gnome warlock this time around.
---
Sitting in a bush DOTing horde.
---
Looks absolutely amazing, but Sulfuras really isnt *that* great of a weapon once you get out of BWL tier raids.
---
I think he was just kidding with that question due to the whole Diablo fiasco. Shame though, sorry to hear that.
---
I'm leaning toward female gnome rogue... or dwarf, but I feel like gnome is a bit better with the 1 minute racial cd. It helps against more of the annoying matchups like mage, hunter, druid, and anyone with engineering.
---
I look at gnomes like I look at tattoos.
---
They are awesome!... on other people.
---
Cause that counts haha
---
Personally I find gnome warriors far more memorable instead of humanWarrior123.  On top of that, there's something to be said for NOT standing out when it comes to PvP - for instance if there's a tauren warrior you're pretty much forced to notice it.
---
I think they are testing to see what direction they should go in for WoW2.
---
More classic-like or more BfA/Legion-like?
---
If I could play with no sub fees I'd pay a couple hundred or so. If sub fees were still in and I'd have to pay then I wouldn't pay more than a normal video game, so $60 or so.
---
they are short and ugly /thread
---
For sure. Its pretty impossible
---
convinced a shaman not to roll on ironfoe so my warrior friend could get it
---
convinced a mage not to roll on Blade of Eternal Darkness so i (lock) could have it
---
I'm most likely rolling a human rogue, for that sweet combat sword spec + racial.
---
You have no idea what you‚Äôre talking about, do you?
---
I am curious to know what you have in your inventory and bank! I wanna see if any of it is even available to get anymore.
---
Lies. Lies everywhere.
---
&gt; no one gave a shit
---
I did, so grats on being wrong. This is a subjective statement, OPs statement is objective: even if slowing down the other faction isnt YOUR goal, it is what happens. And being aware of this side effect, even if it's not explicitly why people are ganking, may encourage those rolling on a PVP to take it a little more seriously. 
---
Thanks for spending your time in your subjective soapbox, and making assumptions about why the rest of us do what we do.
---
Oh yeah? Do tell...
---
I think you'll see the opposite with Classic WoW being higher ranked than BFA for the forseeable future.
---
/cackles in gnomish
---
Running bfd on my priest, needed everything.
---
When asked why i responded "so i can sell it for money".
---
Nice!! I bet it does, but the result is really good! Do you know which zone you might want to do next?
---
BC was the best expansion.  Vanilla was better.
---
&gt;Is it really the fresh server that's the cause there?
---
It's a combination of multiple factors. In the private server scene you have had fresh servers open up constantly. The idea of starting fresh with a new class is very appealing to a lot of players.
---
There's also the fact that playing in Naxx patch just isnt as much fun as playing in earlier patches. Now this is subjective on my part, but I dont personally enjoy it when PvP turns into a game of who can oneshot the other player first.
---
Earlier tiers also have better balance between the top players and the more casual players, meaning skill plays a far bigger factor than gear at this level, and players being able to stay alive longer, because of everyone doing reduced damage, leads to more interesting PvP engagements.
---
There's ofcourse also the whole issue with available upgrades late game. Earlier game there's so much to look forward to. So many new gear upgrades that become available as the server progresses, where Naxx patch is just about spending 300g/weekly on consumables for a chance to get a couple more items from Naxx.
---
It gets stale quickly.
---
I am working on the warlock one from Nost, cutting out some post-phase stuff and making it link to the items.

You will need an active WoW subscription to play Classic. The old battle chest concept went away a while back and was replaced by a new model where everything short of the latest expansion is included in the subscription. So that means you won't need to buy any copy of the base game to play Classic, just pay for one month of sub and you're good to go, for both Classic, and for all of retail short of the latest expansion.
---
150$ max if its just a one time payment
---
Same
---
&gt;One thing to note about private servers is that they don't have the exact numbers used in vanilla so you can't compared them 1 to 1.
---
I think this is greatly exaggerated. The two are very similar. Some numbers being off is just as likely to make the content harder as it is to make it easier.
---
We know plenty of guilds cleared Naxx in Vanilla and we know the DPS checks arent really that brutal. When guilds clear Naxx in 4 hours after opening on private servers then It seems unlikely the raid will remain uncleared for a long time in Classic.
---
$2000.
---
Daybreak Games already endorses Project 1999. Which is a private server of the 1999 version of EQ
---
Yes.
---
My life.
---
Pretty much all of them I believe.
---
Here's the very first Naxxraid from a guild on the most recent server to release Naxx:
---
 [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420283293](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/420283293)
---
I see a contradiction:
---
&gt; The p.server I play on is actually very well run 
---
With:
---
&gt; pay-to-win   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; bugs go unfixed indefinitely   
---
&gt; customer support, even for donators like myself, is nonexistent 
---
How is that server very well run then?
---
Ah sweet.  Im about 3 expansions behind so i might look into resubbing for retail.
---
Right!  Me too.  Most lists are just ‚Äúhere ya go, this is best‚Äù but I‚Äôd like alittle more in-depth such as:
---
‚ÄúThis is BiS greens if your RNG drop god‚Äôs gate you.
---
‚ÄúThis is an alternative BiS gear that‚Äôs alittle easier to obtain.‚Äù
---
Etc...
---
Haha
---
Alright. Well I‚Äôm sorry you had a hard time getting ganked. Not everyone can brush it off so easily so I stand corrected. 
---
I‚Äôm not saying it doesn‚Äôt LITERALLY slow someone down. I‚Äôm saying it LITERALLY doesn‚Äôt matter after a month or two when everyone that cares is raiding. If you want to affect a server in PvP in that way then you‚Äôd better wait and join a server with an obvious faction imbalance cause that‚Äôs the only thing that will matter in that regard. 
---
So more power to you if your personal goal is to somehow attempt to ‚Äúdominate‚Äù a server by ganking some lowbies but you‚Äôre deluding yourself. That‚Äôs not an assumption. That‚Äôs the truth.
---
Female human rouge. Just like back in the days with the same face and all :)
---
Doomed? We all know artifacts ‚Äúexisted‚Äù in design from the beginning. Ironically the artifacts from Legion were actually pretty cool
---
Thanks, autocorrect hates me
---
If you're wearing all plate as Fury your damage is going to be *at least* 20-30% lower than one wearing the actual good gear. That's just how it is.
---
I think people would like those more, yeah.
---
Fake they should be ghosts
---
doesnt look like the Tier 2 legs,or are the colors messed up? could be wrong
---
I JUST WANNA TURN IN MY PAGES
---
That‚Äôs always been a thing and we still get some subdued outfits. I have a privateer set from legion that doesn‚Äôt glow and looks perfect for an Outlaw Rogue.
---
Gimme dat Orc Druid Paladin and Priest plz
---
&gt;And guilds would help provide materials for both, if they'd provide for one. 
---
No? One weapon provide a massive benefit to the guild when raiding.
---
The other weapon is purely a PvP weapon. There's no logical reason why the guild providing materials for one would automatically do it for the other.
---
Consider that the Ingots sell for 7-800g each. Thats 7000+ gold the guild could use to buy flasks for their Tanks instead.
---
Shit classes = unfun raids imo tho
---
would you feel the same for hunters getting hand weapons over Warrior/Rogues for PvP?  At the end of the day, if they are an upgrade for a hunter, then he should get 1st choice on it. Not a Rogue/Warrior.
---
I mean... they've told us it's pay sub and play. Why would a one time additional purchase change anything? 
---
You're really just adding an opinion that you don't trust that what the dev.s will stick to the cost of the game?
---
Probably 75% of Vanilla R14s account shared/botted/etc. 20% were unemployed and spent 100% of their time playing. Maybe 5% happened to be on a very non-competitive server, and could get away with 10 hours a day instead of 18.
---
I also choose his life
---
How does RP earned and bracket stacking work when the number of players stacking in the top bracket exceeds the number of ranked players allowed into bracket top based on the total number of ranked players for your faction? 
---
Ex.  Say there are 1000 people ranking on your faction+server that week, and a premade of 10 have identical honor values at the end of the week.  Do all 10 get 13k RP still? or do they get kicked down into bracket 12 and all of them only get 10k rp?
---
I'm going Gnome Mage
---
Well there‚Äôs only like 4 races to choose from-
---
I don't see paladin on that site.   Is it just borked for me, or is that an oversight?
---
sure, but you dont need 40 good players in retail. You will in Classic. That hard to get in itself.  Still doubt many folk will be clearing Naxx a year after its released.
---
That wasn't my point but ... okay.
---
Am I misremembering MC because we never used any fire resistance gear in my guild clears. 
---
We did mind control one of the mobs near the BWL entrance to get the FR buff for the first couple of rag clears, but stopped quite quickly after people got the hang of it as it took much time.
---
In a 1v1 is it better to use a rage potion than a healing potion?
---
It's worse than using something like Neretzek (trash drop in AQ40) because of how its life drain proc scales with Spellpower. Having a proc heal you for 500+ in PvP while critting for 1k damage is quite huge.
---
You can manage 15-20g an hour fairly easily.   I do it as a ret paladin not even at one of the top farms (I farm the twilight cultists in Silithus usually to sell the sets of consumes for summons, plus encrypted texts, plus runecloth, plus the occasional potion or green boe).  30-40g an hour or sometimes more is what the serious farmers with actual farming class/specs get at the good spots.
---
dam not even a HK: Scout at the end, guess he hearthed to tanaris inn, how inconvenient
---
No this isnt true. You need to buy the armor / weapons when you are that rank. if you de-rank, you cannot buy the rewards later.  
---
Your Highest Rank will always show, and you can choose to use it or not.
---
If you dont intend to use the weapon then for the love of god pass it. Nothing worse than players taking items "because I can" when they wont use it.
---
The only reward I need is the satisfaction I get of making someone run back to their body.
---
&gt; Do you have any idea what impact sharding will have on the server economy? No? Don't worry, we'll find out soon enough.
---
Yeah being able to farm the 1-10 zones is really going to fuck the economy, better just cancel the game to be safe.
---
Well your argument just neglects a very big thing which is to keep the player engaged.
---
An expansion is made for many reasons, and one of them is to "reset" everyone back to start. Give veteran players new things to chase, and let casuals feel the chance of starting a new adventure and not feeling too behind.
---
If you think the you'll keep players engaged by keeping everything in a stasis forever then you don't know what motivates a large audience of RPG players.
---
Do the carrots suck and feel unrewarding in modern RPG games? Yea big time.
---
&gt;Minutes ago
---
Still openly recruiting all classes.
---
Also, high demand:
---
***Highly experienced dedicated Prot Warrior for OT position.***
---
***Specifically, with extensive Classic raid experience.***
---
looks amazing
---
No, but I had full fang and wildheart sets on my rogue.
---
no way they do ladders. they will maybe have a 2nd server where you can upgrade to TBC if u like.
---
Resto shaman can do that and not be a wasted slot.
---
Hey, at least it's a crosspost, instead of stealing content, amiright?
---
&gt; You can reach this without Warden Staff in AQ40 level of gear
---
You think I'm going to play this game a lot harder than I'm intending too. :D
---
While I plan on being good, and progressing a bit, I don't know that I'll have the drive (or time) to get 39 other people to follow me through AQ40 and into Naxx.
---
Although I do want to get like a 25-30 druid AV group going one afternoon and just run some crazy hard to kill pre-mades
---
To keep it simple you usually replace your weakest mitigation slots with your strongest threat pieces (items with +hit).
---
Some example would be LH helm because it's so fricken strong. 
---
Or usually a ring or two because mitigation rings are pretty weak.
---
Ony neck piece is good threat.
---
I had one on my Nostalrius Ret Paladin lol. I'm sure that pissed some people off.
---
In my first ever dungeon (Deadmines, naturally) I rolled need on every item because "greed" sounded bad, and I wasn't greedy. Luckily it was a run with the random guild I had joined and finally after needing on like 3 or 4 items I couldn't even wear the tank was like "You're supposed to click greed unless it's an item you actually will use" 
---
Then I stopped to think about it, and the picture of gold vs the picture of dice and was like "Oh... that makes sense."
---
Never done it but basically it depends heavily on the server
---
The amount of bracket spots depends on active players reaching 15 HK's, but ofc with more players means more that want to rank. It's a race to get honor versus your own faction, so if your own faction plays 24-7, well then you basically have to play 24-7. But it's just as possible that your own faction only plays 10 hours a day, and then that's what you have to do. Well if you have similar honor per hour that is.
---
The thing about ranking though is that it's a marathon. It takes 12 straight weeks from r0 to r14 IF you go by the fastest method of being the highest bracket(top 1-3ish depending on pop), you get to a fairly high rank playing less taking mabe 14-16 weeks, and then sprint rank for the last 3-7 weeks where you get the highest bracket.
---
Either way, it depends on your own faction, so experiences can differ.
---
nice website, paladin healing is missing tho
---
&gt;  In the private server scene you have had fresh servers open up constantly. The idea of starting fresh with a new class is very appealing to a lot of players.
---
Yeah, I just meant that the whole fresh server thing is more a symptom of the staleness of the game post-Naxx than the other way around. Even with only one server people would still stop playing after Naxx, because of the reasons you accurately pointed out. The reason we like fresh servers is because a restart is needed to keep the game fresh.
---
Just roll human and complain about alliance racials being bad for PvP. Just like everybody else. Gnome and dwarf racials are excellent racials but unfortunately people don't roll them.
---
So it will be just like Vanilla :D
---
Seriously, that's pretty much the experience "normal" players had back in the day.
---
Best mage!
---
Pretty sure fd drinking is a big no no? You just want to be autoing if you are oom.
---
That is really fucking cool! Do you plan it to play out like D&amp;D or what were you thinking?
---
I honestly havent heard anything, but also havent looked.  Was just brain storming.   Cost wouldnt change anything for me, but i know people that would refuse to purchase.  As for the devs, people can change minds.
---
I understand you trying to be conservative with your estimates but i am very confident classic will easily hit a few million in the 'honeymoon" period and then easily maintain more subs than Retail.
---
This is so great lol. Took me way back
---
You're welcome.
---
It's a joke, bruh.
---
Anyone can buy and use Goblin Rocket Boots, but they're expensive and break 1/3
---
I'm a fan of the WC Fang set despite it not being perfect stats. Armor sets should be a thing throughout the game imo.
---
old good

new bad

fuck ion hazzikostas and fuck bfa

i mean i‚Äôll give you that.

wow, inc tipsout video 'reddit gathered all current announcements"

are elbows just not a vulnerable spot for blizzard now?
---
I had the healing mace from Maiden in Karazhan on my rogue since it dropped and no one in the group needed it. I slapped the 81 healing enchant on it and would run around with it equipped. I called it my "bandage spec" item.
---
That's too bad, you missed the best version of the game!
---
I don't like their animations. Specifically the running animation and the "standing still and idling"-animation. If it weren't for that I'll probably maybe be a Gnome. Maybe. Probably. Most likely not, but yeah.
---
My 29 priest on a legacy server goes oom during any pull in a dungeon that is slightly more mobs than usually.  I used 7 mana pots and 70 sweet nectars in a bfd run at 26 with a crap geared warrior.  Will it be like this at 60?
---
Paladins never even came close to mage/lock/rogue/warrior/shaman dps in TBC at any point besides the wrath pre-patch. You could still bring one, because they weren't awful and they provided some utility that pure dps classes didn't, but  Their only function as healer is tank healing and can't deal with raid damage at all, and as tanks they have serious issues with single-target threat compared to a warrior or druid so they can't tank many bosses. In no way did Paladins (or any other hybrid except lolwarriors) ever outclass pure dps classes during TBC.
---
Your "opinions" are really just factually incorrect statements, so no, it's not a matter of opinion at all.
---
Also pretending that Vanilla was better about this when Warriors were overwhelmingly the best DPS and only real tank is fucking hilarious.
---
Tiamat? Sargeras?
---
has happened in other mmos, when they see their subscribers are falling. 
---
for example, Ultima Online. Of course UO is 22 years old, but still. You can have a house &amp; a boat in the game, and up to 8/9 toons on account. If you unsubscribe, you lose your house, boat, and you are left with 1 toon.
---
I sure as fuck hope I am wrong and is paranoid delusional shit.

https://itemization.info/?search=phase%3A1
---
They have practically the same cd, if you start off right they won't drift by much over the fight. 
---
Also buffs will go a long way. Priest spirit buff alone doubled my spirit if not more in pre bis/t1 (and it was very noticeable when I didn't have it). Arcane int gives you around 25% more mana.
---
I also forgot the efficiency talent above, you really only burn about 45 mana per second.
---
No matter what you will need to pop mana pots though, often you can get by with the cheap ones though. And I would usually pop 1-2 runes per raid, usually on the last boss since those fights tend to be longer.
---
I think I was remembering the non-breaking boots from BC, actually. The super awesome ones that were nerfed in, what, 2.3? I think it was 2.3.
---
I think most people trying for it will end up meeting and getting the help of other grinders. You are competing, but the goal is still the same. And they will be keeping close eyes on whoever is grinding.
---
The biggest issue is time. If I was serious about getting rank 14, I would plan to play 100+ for 4 weeks in a row at the end, and no way in hell is that ever happening.
---
Imp sprint bruh, doesn't have cast time either
---
No. You turn it on or off in capital cities. It's not quite the same
---
Awesome. Fucking awesome. This is how I want to remember WoW
---
i wonder if with the release of classic, the team working on it will move things in a direction not trodden originally... i expect to see tbc expansion coming for vanilla in 3-5 years too
---
Congrat
---
I would probably give up already.
---
Female undead rogue for the flips on special attacks!
---
This seems to be assuming progressive itemization? It's recommending Maiden's Circle over Rosewine Circle.
---
If you use the term ‚Äúbeta male‚Äù you are a beta male
---
Right. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Ironically, you should have kept playing BC. Small group PvP in arena could get you BiS gear without issue. I hardly raided at all in BC save for one Gruul PUG and a few Karazhans, and I never fell behind in gear despite that.
---
I see Paladin.
---
Of all replies I don't agree with, I like yours the most, because it actually attempts to dismantle my points directly instead of using name calling and argumentum ad hominem. 
---
If it takes me 12 seconds to kill someone, but takes them four minutes to walk back to their body, that's a net positive of me hurting them more than they've hurt me. 
---
If I were looking only to benefit myself as an individual, then yes, the person who avoids PvP when at all possible is going to beat me to 60, but if you could see an aerial view of how each choice impacted the next person who impacted the next person, ad infinitum, I think you'd see it's a collective win in the long game, even if it's not an individual one in the short game (which you're right about).
---
1.12 balance *wasn't* good, people enjoy it despite that for plenty of other reasons.
---
Quitting WoW in TBC is something I will never understand, barring any illness or personal issues
---
If you want to be a caster dps just go warlock. Druid is about being flexible, sure you can dps as a druid but depending on your friends/guild you're playing most people will want you as a tank/healer.
---
Yes! It's supposed to be played like D&amp;D, except players can use unique abilities via cards. Most of the mechanics were designed by me though. To build basic shape of the game I used some of the typical RPG ideas (like fantasy classes, die rolling, build the scenario as Game Master etc.)
---
Absolutely possible, just slow and mana intensive. If you‚Äôre having more fun that way, it‚Äôs worth the extra time.
---
Well it's actually a lot harder to get R14 on private servers than it was back in real vanilla. Mainly because of the mega populations private servers have and because the pvp is a lot more competitive nowadays.
---
Companies don't change price structures that have been promised and marketed for months just before release of a product. If we saw any change it would be a reduction, never an increase. That literally never happens in the real world. 
---
Blizzard will not just add an increased arbitrary price to access classic.
---
some things are just good and calling people idiots for not seeing that is pretty apt
---
Transmogrified gear made WoW fun in a completely different aspect. There are people who love customizable armor sets. Not to mention that the raiding and pvp scenes are really competitive. Transmog doesn't belong in classic. But I'd say in retail it's awesome. Plus everyone knows the saddest moments in WoW history are Warlords and Pandaria. Warlords was just bad...and Pandaria had great content, but the raids and dungeons were too damn hard so it pushed everyone away.
---
I think everyone understands where he was coming from. However, everything about the way he responded to that question was irritating. He showed complete lack of understanding as to why people want legacy servers. He responded in a very ironic manner, as if he knows better than you, me and everyone else what we want. The argument that "because LFD isn't in Vanilla" by itself is very weak and he didn't leave any room for discussion as to why people might want vanilla, why they might dislike the current game, what they could improve upon, etc. As if he really thought that responding like that would keep people who would rather play vanilla engaged with WoD. As if he really thought that retail WoW was superior to vanilla in every aspect. Besides, I don't think anyone who asks a question to a developer in a Q&amp;A panel wants the developer to echo the community's sentiment. Even at that level, his response was awful because I wanted an answer from the devs. If I wanted an answer from the community, I'd have made a post in the forums (or reddit), like so many other people.
---
Druid actually looks so good
---
Male undead rogue with the Mohawk and engineering goggles.
---
So he says, but behind the keyboard there's a boy dreaming. Dreaming of the glory days. He turns around and looks at an old photo he has on the wall, his 60 shaman from 2006, Rank 10 armor and TuF with crusader enchant.  
---
A tear starts to run down his cheek, he wipes it away. At the same time spotify is on shuffle and as he wipes the tear away Seasons of War comes on  
---
***The drums of war thunder once again***  
---
The boy is no more but the man is prepared and completely chilled
---
A long time ago I remember hearing that players who strive to be ‚Äúthe best‚Äù in WoW PvE are actually more likely to quit the game than a casual or average player and this is a good example of that.
---
Yeah, looks like they aren't even using the right hit cap. Not one of the hunter sets I looked at seemed correct.
---
Incredible work you've put into this! And for how it's played out, making a story-telling way to play out the game, I think was a good choice. One can't reinvent the wheel! Send this idea to Blizzard! :D
---
A chill just went through every player questing in Redridge.
---
I am replying to this thread because it makes me look busy at work.
---
It's a shame you missed out on TBC. It was pretty much a more fine tuned extension of Vanilla (you can argue the integrity of flying).
---
I was on an RP server at launch (so opt-in wpvp) but we still got into it from time to time.  It was a classic Hillsbrad/Arathi rolling PvP.  I had a small group of guildies.
---
We battled all the way over towards Hammerfall in Arathi when Horde reinforcements finally arrived and pretty much stomped us.  All of my party was dead except me, so I did the only thing any self-respecting Paladin would have done.
---
I bubble-hearthed.  If I remember, I had a macro for it that also made me /dance at the same time.
---
Only I was too slow in activating the hearthstone.  The bubble came down a split second too soon and I got interrupted and promptly destroyed.  It was glorious and I remember laughing and laughing about it for days.
---
Because DotA 2 requires that you be knowledgeable about how your hero works and how you build it according to all the available weapons in such a way that counters your opponents.
---
Touch√© :D
---
Though that boy was a Night Elf Priest and wiped his tears from his 28/40 Atiesh Progress :'(
---
Going for Tank-Warrior this time around for that TF :P
---
Then again there's still the chance of going Tank-Bear for a more casual approach. This boy still hasn't decided...
---
In some aspects maybe (e.g. flying and questing) but for the most part TBC was great. Wrath I would say was kind of the tipping point before the complete downfall in Cata.
---
I thought Pilav is a Giga Chad?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm fairly sure Blizzard already has an original Warcraft RPG system that appears to be quite similar to D&amp;D ([https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft\_RPG](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Warcraft_RPG)). Although I never really bothered to look into it.
---
Classic is a full game even without any expansions. I would pay a one-time fee appropriate to a full game, which seems to be $50-60 these days.
---
I can't justify dropping much more than that on *any* video game, no matter how much I love that game. I probably could justify it a bit at a time, if Classic's content buckets were each released as expansions to the original game I could be talked into $10 each on top of the game purchase.
---
Why did you leave?
---
Best armor and block by a long shot, vanilla itemization for you
---
Because, as I've said in other places, both on this subreddit and on the official Blizzard forums in the past, choosing a PvP server and then complaining about PvP happening is like moving to a foreign country where the primary language is different from yours and then complaining that people don't speak your language (the example I used in this exact thread being moving to Italy and then complaining that people don't speak Korean.)
---
The game gives you all of the information you need to make an informed decision, without having to go outside of the game at all, about what you can expect on a PvP server. It never once mentions that fights will be fair, one-on-one, or against character(s) of approximately equal level.
---
PvP severs exist to really play up the War part of World of Warcraft. This is something that Blizzard had said many times. The world of Azeroth is one that exists absent a Geneva Convention, United Nations, or any other similar International body. Because of this, war in Azeroth is a very ugly, Hobbesian, anarchistic and hellish experience.
---
And both sides have done pretty ugly things during the various wars and interbellum periods.
---
The Horde have multiple times put entire towns to the torch, killing men, women and children. They attempted genocide against the Draenei. The Forsaken have experimented on unwilling, non-consenting test subjects. And that's just a short list.
---
The Alliance attempted genocide on the Darkspear Trolls, with no provocation via the Kul'Tiran fleet in their pursuit of Thrall. They kept the Orcs in internment camps following the second war, with many calling for genocide of the Orcs. The Alliance is pretty cool with using POWs as slave labor, including children, as seen in MoP. SI: 7, an elite Alliance organization, opened fire and attempted to kill, the Bilgewater Cartel survivors because they would have been witnesses to their attempted extrajudicial execution of Thrall as a POW at sea. Jaina's purge of Dalaran included the murder or imprisonment of innocent civilians. Camp Taurajo. Again, just a short list.
---
Both of these lists are provided to show that there are no real "rules of engagement" in Azeroth as we would think of them, and that the War in Warcraft truly is terrible.
---
This is why, while I would never be one of those to take part in ganking lowbies, I also don't have sympathy for those who chose to play on a PvP server and then decided that they want to complain about PvP taking place on said PvP servers.
---
Correct. Generally while you're leveling you can just take note of what dungeons you want to run and quest in that zone while you put together a group in general chat.
---
So because one mmo did it you just assume blizzard is going to do the same thing?
---
They had ‚ÄúArtifact‚Äù rarity weapons in-game Vanilla but were not available to players.
---
Red Defias Mask BiS
---
Nice try, Activision- Blizzard.
---
Makes Warlock summoning relevant again
---
Troll Rogues in Defias Leather looked so cool to me  , fucking Ninjas
---
Yeah the first iteration of them was largely pointless as it was just a poor constructed way to enter an equally shitty LFG queue system. I don't recall them ever getting use
---
Okay, what do you suggest we post here, great /u/Garblike ?
---
Every blue post has already been discussed to death, and we're just waiting for more blue posts / the game to release.
---
All that's left is the flood of "What class should I play?" posts, and memes.
---
An enhance shaman isn't going to cover 3-4 melee groups, 3-4 resto shamans will though
---
Because the concept of a warrior doesn't really fit a 2 foot tall creature with arms that would maybe reach a Tauren's knee. Gnome Warrior is the only Class race combination that doesn't really fit in WoW. They should have just made them Priests instead of Warriors.
---
I always thought the T6 priest set was the pinnacle of design. And the white set looked fucking spectacular for holy
---
On active PvP servers, it‚Äôs often much harder to get to the instance than to run it. Don‚Äôt be surprised when groups fall apart because one or more of their members can‚Äôt get past a gank squad to reach the instance.
---
thats why we need quest mob sharing and hopefully zone scaling.classic is built on bfa engine so cant be that hard ... just wont be 100% classic
---
why would you do that to yourself?
---
I thought being greedy was rude so I rolled need on a malachite in the Ban'ethil barrow den. Crushing guilt ensued.
---
Thank you all for the responses! I will have to read them individually and answer back this evening. I really appreciate the feedback on this.
---
Lol which is funny because my lazy friend that i was refering to in the one playing the warlock.
---
Nobody here gives a shit about retail. If that's what this is about, he should take it to r/wow
---
Holy shit this is amazing, incredibly well done. Did you graphically design everything and then print it yourself or send it out to someplace?
---
I like this spreadsheet. Any idea if one exists for a warrior anywhere?
---
Could you not zone in as a ghost in classic?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm playing female undead rogue. I‚Äôve always played a stealth class and I hate playing the game without stealth. If we get TBC/Wrath, I‚Äôll play rogue in TBC and feral druid in Wrath.
---
There's no discussion to be had. Its never going to happen.
---
My wife is going to be trying Classic for the first time ever. She is a very casual gamer. I know she will end up rolling a Hunter as she likes archers and pets, I obviously want to play a class that compliments that. I'm thinking Priest or Warrior. Thoughts? She will probably only put in 5 hours a week at the most.
---
I will obviously be playing a Rogue on a PvP server.
---
TBC was the prime of WoW!  That's unfortunate :(
---
There isn't exactly a item slot that is best to swap first. You swap what's the most optimal to swap basically. When you are going for threat, you set yourself certain tank limitations, you need to be X tanky to survive, then you get as much threat as possible while still maintaining that tankiness. Some items are amazing to swap because they are super efficient, like fx band of accuria, amazing efficiency because not only does the item give just ridicules level of stats, but agi hit and stam is great for threat+defense. 
---
So yeah it all becomes a optimization game.
---
Good read. Then again since i often participate in threads like this, it's hard for me to "answer everything" with one opinion.
---
Yes i can imagine it, and yes, if its the same it will be good. But then i remember that people read fantasy books and also imagine stuff, that isn't happening. Yes in my imagination it can work, same as in yours. Thing is, everyone has an imagination. 
---
I want to quote something you wrote.
---
&gt; What PServer has been continually active since then? They all grow stale  and the community dies, because everyone hits 60 and either gets bored  or clears naxx and gets fully geared. Then they move on to the next  popular PServer that is going through progression again. The content is  good enough to keep people interested for 10 years, but only so long as  the rest of the community is active enough to keep them interested.  People play MMOs for the *massive multiplayer* aspect, which retail has totally tried to move away from. 
---
You pretty much described server resets, every 3 years. 
---
Now while i cannot imagine what people imagine, and how good Blizzard will implement that imagination, given their recent questionable decisions (or maybe not decent but since halfway WotLK).
---
What i can imagine however is server restarts. If people don't agree with this, then here lies the problem. Imagination and implementation is directly related to opinion and this is the biggest problem.
---
Free I already paid for it 14 years ago.
---
I want to roll rogue but I know there will be tons of them. I like to stand out and I don't like a lot of competition so I'm considering warlock instead, even though I love rogues and I've been playing one for awhile.
---
The fact (s)he was coming out of forms and not realizing (s)he could avoid those pollys tells me (s)he probably didn't think about moonglade lol.
---
This is why you bring your friendly neighborhood warlock(me).
---
Got some ideas coming from different comments, Maybe Elwynn Forest, or Mulgore.. I have no precise idea to be honest atm ahah
---
Not sure I understand the question. A guild should handle loot in such a way that the guild as a whole benefit the most, so onehanders should always go to Rogues and Warriors over Hunters for PvE as they are huge upgrades for them. Hunters only get slightly more stats out of them.
---
Besides, it's not really a big issue anyway since most onehanded weapons wanted by Rogues/Warriors are not wanted by Hunters anyway. Exceptions might be Daggers like Corehound Tooth, Fang of the Faceless etc, but they drop from MC and ZG respectively so not like they are difficult to obtain.
---
Aaah. I didn't even know.
---
No.
---
I leveled a moonkin during vanilla and loved it. As others have said it's slow and not very forgiving. Get used to the "I'm out of mana" audio clip.  I would suggest keeping some feral gear as you level just in case you want to switch specs. Just remember, the more you switch the more gold it cost. Adds up real quick.
---
I designed everything, printed it, and cut it out. The quality is really good because my boss allowed me to print it at work (I'm a DTP graphic specialist in a printing house) using professional printers.
---
Do you think you‚Äôd give the other expansions a shot if they made more classic servers?
---
He had one job!
---
Haha, coming from a former Paladin main, I literally had 0 sympathy for Ret paladins from classic all the way to now.  To me they are still a spec that should be worthless.
---
The travel form made me laugh
---
Have fun finding a group at 60 when all your gear is reserved by the guy tanking.
---
Pocket healers are always convenient, and Warriors don't have a bunch of synergy with Hunters anyway, so I'd suggest Priest.
---
Not true.  There were several in my guild.  They played mostly Hunter/Lock/Druid or Hunter/Rogue/Druid.
---
I feel sorry this is where your mind takes you
---
defo fresh it will be more fun
---
I think if you want the whole experience just go in fresh. I have also played a few days on a private server but I stopped because I didn‚Äôt want to ruin the summer experience:)
---
I seriously can not wait to gank Allys for a solid hour at STV.
---
yeah i just included it as an option
---
It's funny, I love transmog for *all the wrong reasons*. 9 times out of 10 I will almost exclusively transmog my gear to look like items from Vanilla entirely. For me, arguably the item model design has gone completely downhill from TBC onwards. It just got too ridiculous. 
---
That said, I would NOT want transmog in Classic since, well, I'll have access to all the items I ever want to transmog to :D!
---
No. Once you properly gear up, you'll have pretty decent sustain as any healing spec, especially if you make sure to properly downrank spells to avoid overhealing. You'll still use potions and all, but you won't find yourself going OOM in ten seconds or anything.
---
Why not a hybrid class like Paladin or Druid so as to be able to jump into multiple roles as needed for instances, or provide healing, damage, or tanking as needed while grinding?
---
Whatever you do don't roll on a PVE server. You're willingly removing a very large aspect of the intended game design and story line if you do.
---
What people said about OSRS and RS3
---
PUG PvP is about it. Classic WoW is unequivocally a group game. You can't complete any meaningful endgame stuff without groups.
---
I'm not necessarily opposed to server resets, but I play on private servers and am used to it.
---
*There will absolutely be backlash if there are server resets in classic. Especially if they don't explicitly state that they will do that before release*.
---
Remember that classic is going to pull in a lot of the retail crowd, a good portion of which have been playing the same characters for several expansions. People will feelbad about losing their characters, and it isn't something blizzard has *ever* done in the past (outside of PTR/demo, which are another story).
---
Personally, if my options were 1) Blizz leaves some of the classic servers untouched, possibly allowing server xfers to untouched servers and attempts WoW 2.0/1.13 with the rest, 2) Blizz does nothing at all after the phases, or 3) Blizz restarts the servers every few years, I'd prefer they at least try 1.
---
You are not supposed to encourage the use of pservers on this server, soo I am certainly no going to say you should. You should do what you want to do, I and many others are certainly having a good time, there is a large community of people, and there is a lot you can learn before you play the actual release imo.
---
What I am going to say is I disagre with the rule and think its more about pandering to blizz/act than something we need on a website that is independent of them... The rule is poorly implemented, poorly designed, poorly regulated, and the true purpose is oviscated.
---
How can they see the light if every other character in the game casts a shadow over them?
---
$250/box&amp; 50/month
---
Hahha, might be someone had the same name as you. But I remember shiftmeister, a tauren druid totally destroying me when I was ally, over and over again... üò©
---
Well I refuse to play Alliance so PLD is out -_-
---
Not really a druid fan, but you have a point about being able to tank or heal. Thanks.
---
No one
---
Naturally I assume they are going to be called Vek'lor and Vek'nilash?
---
I can hear the rogue kidney shot sound when I look at that picture.
---
Glad you enjoyed it!
---
The Rogue set by far looks one of the best in the entire game. Both my rogues in retail have that full transmog minus the mask. One rogue has the headband and the other has the black face mask. Super cool and thematic looking set. I believe the agents at MI:7 use it, which is why VanCleef also has it.
---
What server? üòá
---
Well why would a guild, benefiting the guild as a whole, give a warrior or rogue a ranged weapon over a hunter, if its an upgrade.
---
Depending on just how successful Classic is in the long run (i.e. several months after launch) I think the most we'll see for the modern game is Brack's idea for  ["pristine realms"](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Pristine_realm). I think server options like this would draw at least some of us back to the game, especially if it included some re-tuning and balancing so it isn't so faceroll outside of raids.
---
I dread guilds with that mindset being created. That weapon you assert is a PVP weapon purely is the best weapon for arms warriors, ret paladins, and more classes that make me facepalm... Like the feral druid who would wet themselves at being allowed to have it.
---
I led a guild. I was that warrior who got the thunderfury in vanilla. We had 3 rag eyes drop. I was a blacksmith. My guild funded 3 rag hammers. I'm just saying. I got the thunderfury. I paid for it out of my own pocket, literally, because back in Vanilla, Elementium Ores were FRIGGIN ridiculous RNG, and my guild was super unlucky. Ended up having to buy 4 of them with my own cash. 1200 each. Not awful, since I was fairly wealthy and a decent merchant in my own right, but just saying. Your thoughts on this are inconsistent with what I went through in Vanilla.
---
And quite frankly, I'd prefer the way it went down on my side rather than yours. My guild helped everyone with everything, regardless of the level of functionality within a raid structure. Whether it helped 10% or 0.2% in a raid, it was still a boon to improve every player. Your guild is only as strong as your weakest link. Every benefit is a benefit.
---
Because many people dislike gnomes, especially for melee. They are pathetically small and make your gear appearance very underwhelming. Blizz had to give them gg racials so they would at least have some appeal. 
---
As for me, I have to roll horde so I can punt them.
---
It is the Ragnaros cloak
---
üò´üò´üò´ I miss my vanilla druid I lost all my footage in the great hard drive massacre of 2010 üò´üò´üò´
---
Eh, not really. You don't have to spec enhance to drop windfury.
---
They might just be using dungeon loot bis? A lot of people aren't looking to spend 500g on a pre bis weapon.
---
Yea that would be dumb. True.
---
I feel you! I had 3 PvP videos and could only salvage this one. üò≠
---
Post me even one single thread were 12 independent people claimed r14.
---
Sounds like Shaman would be the class for you. Lots of buttons, fun to play, EXTREMELY useful in so many regards. I have a hard time coming up with a scenario where a group gets worse by adding a Shaman. Totems are immensely powerful and very versatile. Still pretty OK at DPSing. If you decide to run pure DPS, Warlock and Mage are definitely among the more useful DPS classes in terms of utility.
---
^^ Probably the only thing someone has said on r/classicwow about rogues that's actually true ^^
---
Why do people keep saying damage meters weren‚Äôt a thing? I feel like a lot of people were playing a different game than me in vanilla. 
---
Everyone in my guild had a dmg and threat meter, and people were constantly fighting for the top spots and shit talking each other. There were class leaders to help people struggling with their dps. I also remember the ubrs and strat pugs where people were constantly getting kicked for not doing any damage or healing. 
---
Either my server had a completely different culture or there‚Äôs some selective memory going on. Idk.
---
Trolls wore it better.
---
Check out the P6 Prot Warrior shield, its a healing shield lmao.  I am not sure if 400 armor outweighs 3% block and +8 defense.
---
If he plans to raid other locks are going to hate him, every group has one that never brings enough shards to summon ect
---
Aha, that explains the craftsmanship. I‚Äôve got delusions of creating something similar to goof around with friends and planned on just writing things out on standard playing cards, but this is beautiful.
---
I tried every class on private servers up to level 20 and now I‚Äôm honestly just more undecided on picking a main. And kinda burnt out. I‚Äôm taking a break until classic
---
Some of it is flat out wrong.
---
Hell to the no.
---
Hello there,  fellow PvPer.
---
I agree. It's still an action/hack n slash though.
---
Retail has transmog, so you best be using the better stat brick and slap whatever pretty paint you want on it. When you have to look at your gear, looks matter!
---
Sure. And in arena you need to basically know every CD, ability and items of all the classes present. I played both game, it's only as hard as the level you want to obtain in both. Because it's pvp.
---
Yeah I actually liked them too, it kinda felt like a 'classic' thing to do because you felt more connected with an item of gear
---
Kite kite kite kite kite!
---
Nice job that must have taken awhile and required clever use of mechanics, plus head on a swivel to avoid adds.
---
Uhm i dont recall, ravencrest or stormreaver. Had chars on both of them
---
/shrug people were way too obsessed about the color of text on their gear in vanilla.
---
It was part of why I quit. In EQ there would be some expansions where the level cap wasn't raised and raid gear was hardly ever replaced by non-raid gear of the next xpac.
---
My guild is still deciding which faction to choose so I've been leveling lowbees up to about 10 of every race. It's a nice little refresher and knowing the first dozen quests will give you a leg up on beating the initial zerg at the starting zone at launch.
---
We are talking about it because that's what we are getting, tons of people will settle for 1.12 because its leaps and bounds better than what they have as a current option but it doesn't mean its the perfect version, even the people who want classic can't unanimously decide what they want though, 1.5 av, cross realm bgs, progressive itemizaton, the future of classic post naxx are all highly debated with tons of people standing on different sides of the issue, vanilla isn't just 1.12 .
---
On the second point you are free to argue whatever you want, but unless you can come up with evidence more solid than vanilla devs saying they wanted every spec to be competitive I don't see how it would hold any water
---
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.usgamer.net/amp/activision-stops-reporting-wow-subscriber-numbers-at-55-million
---
Blizzard kept releasing sub numbers until just before legion. They stopped at 5.5 million in September 2015.
---
If you scroll to the bottom of the above article you will see the list of dates and their respective sub count at that quarter.
---
Yeah it doesn't help. But if you just look at the raid design, it is still great.
---
Lemme post on my old disc
---
lol there were quite a few hunter/druid glads and iirc even hunter/disc s
---
Wouldn't it be nice if there were remnant of a shaman buff they had started but never implemented latent in 1.12. Even if there were I don't know if people would accept them being implemented, but I can dream.
---
2 of you soloed him? üòÖ
---
My friend was a warrior and he would Hamstring him without taking any aggro (otherwise we would be doomed). As a Hunter we led him around a big circle right before the entrance to STV. Took us about 10-15 mins to take him down but it was all worth it. He didn't drop anything but that didn't matter to us.
---
I don't think you can even zone in now as a ghost. The only time you could zone in with your ghost was if you died inside the dungeon. Back when you had to run back to the entrance from the nearest graveyard upon wiping, instead of being resurrected at the entrance inside.
---
This seems the sensible answer but Blizz is desperate to maintain cash flow, so they are tying it to the existing WoW sub to prop up that dying behemoth. 
---
So many other 'remastered' titles come out for like, $20 or less.  Hell, Blizz released Brood war and sc2 as ftp!  
---
It doesn't take much to maintain staffing/server loads for Classic so I'm very bitter that they're charging like it's a premium service, which let's be honest it's not.
---
Not gonna lie, that aquatic form backpaddle coupled with the music both made me laugh and questioning my life
---
Private servers are filled with new people leveling, not even worth it imo unless you feel like sitting around waiting for mobs to respawn.
---
I plan to binge level on classic release. If I can't stand that, I'll know it pretty quickly.
---
Hahah I realized how funny that sounded after i posted. How else would I say it was just us two?
---
Sure. It's much more engaging and fast paced, but if I dont have fun driving my car then I'm not lookin to race no matter how sick the tracks are.
---
They reported record earnings last year.
---
My $15 a month subscription should be sufficient.  If it isn't they need to start cutting upper management because they don't know how to run a damn company.
---
Too much speculations (me included), do we have the community to make everyone happy? 
---
Backlash fro that, backlash for this, servers for everyone, happiness for no one.
---
Thats why i want them to do nothing, if not resets, open fresh, but ofc that's still splitting. 
---
There are no easy answers and that's why im against changes or OSRS approach. Its too much variables.

Na, you are correct. They are not t2 legs.
---
Definitely at some point, probably 3rd or 4th character.
---
Fresh, no question.
---
Probably wasn‚Äôt me.  I played on Frostwolf during classic.  Stormreaver was an awesome server in classic if I recall!
---
Huh. I never did Naxx so I didn‚Äôt realize that was the case.
---
I read this imagining the spongebob mend.
---
The hit gain for human's allows easier setup for raid progression than gnome.  If raid progression is easier you are essentially gearing yourself possibly weeks sooner than if you rolled gnome.
---
Ahh, well it was mot frostwolf. Hahh yeah, so insanely many wpvp fights.. Loved it!
---
Well it's not like they didn't exist or where not used. But for what i can tell, on german server or my server, they where not used as much as they would be today. But maybe my memory isn't as good nowdays. I mean the release of clssic WoW is closer to my birth than the current date.
---
Good ol' team solo.
---
You see everyone recommending axe specialization for two reasons:  1) most of the good leveling weapons you get are axes (esp whirlwind), so going axe spec will benefit you over sword/mace/polearm most often while leveling without having to respec.   At 60 you go whatever spec matches whatever good weapon you manage to get (ideally sword for alliance and axe for horde) 
---
2) There are a solid amount of good endgame axes and orcs get +5 axe skill, and many of the guides are (in my experience) written from that pov.
---
This is the one. Magey is doing amazing work.
---
It will show every version of each item if you want to see it as well.
---
I am glad it brought you a laugh :)
---
This doesn't look like it's been updated since the confirmation of 1.12 gear?
---
I just can't look at an orc in Paladin gear
---
My exact same goal on my paladin. Lok‚Äôtar Ogar, friend(?)
---
do we like rogue t1 now? 
---
joking aside most of these sets look bad on humans, i bet this looks pretty cool on undead or female ne
---
Ok, so it's just borked for me at work (honestly surprised I could even get there at work).
---
One of the lower key things I‚Äôm looking forward to are actually needing groups for group quests and elite mobs. Nowadays it feels like any silver elite or general elite can be solo‚Äôd pretty handily if you try.
---
One of the major issues is LOS is actually measured from your characters head.  Gnomes frequently cannot charge due to LOS on small hills or terrain.  I am not kidding it is really infuriating.
---
Some of the zones are the private servers are pretty congested with new players and you're often sat around waiting for mobs to respawn. I'd honestly just wait, don't want to get burnt out on the leveling grind before classic even comes out. Plus there's not much to practice as a mage, you spam frostbolt and fireblast on cd or just blizzard/roots if you're aoe farming.
---
One thing I'd definitely look into if you want to play a mage is where to get wand upgrades.

As a hunter you can solo him. Kite him along the path and into the town.
---
You forgot the corollary: Do them if you can stealth in with a group as druid/rogue cat pack stealthing in can give you decent cover.
---
I wish I shared your optimism but of all the people I know that used to play, only myself and 1 other person is planning on coming back. Obviously my friends and old guildmates are not completely indicative of the entire WoW community but that is where I'm basing my projections from. With that said, the more the merrier, lol. I'd love for this to be a HUGE hit because if it is, then they may move forward with an official TBC server which would be greatest day ever status for me. 
---
I know a number of people are concerned about a TBC server splitting the playerbase and such concerns are justified. That is why the larger the playerbase that stays after the initial "honeymoon" period, the more likely a separate TBC server could become reality. I dont see Blizz moving forward with one without a very substantial commitment of players on the Classic servers. They will only make and maintain these different iterations of WoW as long as there is a substantial playerbase that play and stay
---
The Defias set isn't complete without dual cruel barbs and the mask
---
I really want them to just implement weather effects from the outset. It would be stupid if they included those in one of the phases like what happened with the initial vanilla patch schedule.
---
This is like saying, "It's only difficult for some but not for others." In other words, like saying nothing at all.

Question 4: PvP vs PvE
---
To me PvP servers ad that additional layer. I didn't pvp too often. It was something I just did occasionally, but what I loved was the fact that I could be hunted at anytime. It kept things alive. You were on your toes and your head was on a swivel. Sometimes someone would go for a cheap gank when you were fighting 2 mobs. Sometimes people would jump you and you would end up winning. IT's just some additional spice added to the game. It's a randomness I learned to appreciate. I liked operating in that mode so much that I would go into Stranglethorn Vale about a level before the qeusts and just grind mobs until I hit the level to get quests. I would stay until that zone was exhausted which was like 10 or more levels.
---
Pvp is the way  to go. You will be interrupted, your plans will sometimes change, but it is way better than an on the rails predictable experience. 
---
I'll do 2 as well. Whats so special?
---
Things matter. Gear matters. Professions matter. That 40 health scroll buff at level 12 matters. You get a new peice of gear with +6 stamina on it at level 14 and it makes a difference. Rumsey Rum (+15 Stamina) is god mode! Getting green gear was reason to celebrate. Getting a bag was a stand up and cheer moment! Things were more difficult, more frustrating, more dependant on things than we see today. Although comparativly, wow was much easier than other MMO's of the time, it was hard enough to frustrate people. People complained and now we have a taxi cab of a game today because those complaints were unfortunatley addressed. A customer service mindset was applied to design theory. I dont like the results of that which we see in the retail version. But what people didnt realize, is that even though you're bitching, having the things you're bitching about "fixed" is far worse than living with the difficulties you had in the classic experience. Sometimes things are hard and it sucks, but thats the way it is going to be and the experience will be better for it. So bitch all you feel like bitching, but gear up and drive on because you are heading into a great gaming experence.
---
Absolutely go fresh. It will be a much better experience for you that way.
---
Yeah I thought that was implied, I thought OP was asking if blizz had mentioned anything about adding content post 1.12..
---
he'll summon for raids... its just partying with me he becomes a lazy ass.
---
The text used to be Red also, not Gold.
---
Technically patch 2.0.1 is still classic :o
---
I remember our priests looking like walking traffic cones which everyone guessed was so we would be an even more obvious target in pvp.
---
The  friendly neighborhood warlock still need 2  friendly neighborhood clickers though :o
---
Defeat the stereotype by being a human, not all human paladins have to be jerks, dwarf paladins are badass but I just like the look and racials of the human better, the mace specialization for human helps a TON considering how many maces there are leveling up AND our OP class weapon Vergian's Fist (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6953/verigans-fist) can literally last us until our 40s when we get it at 20, so the mace spec helps a ton with that.
---
Wow your friend sounds like mine when we play together...
---
Honestly, I loved some of the extreme weather in vanilla. Couldn't say which I preferred as they were all great, but when I was in one I would go around taking scenic screenshots. Sadly I didn't keep any of them though. That was a mistake :(
---
If you wanna make the walk sure, but its gonna be a ballache getting people to want to
---
&gt; I'm very bitter that they're charging like it's a premium service, which let's be honest it's not.
---
Oh yeah, having no up front cost and rolling it into the existing sub cost is totally a premium service. 
---
If they were ACTUALLY treating it like a premium service it'd have an up front cost and be an extra $5-10 on top of the existing sub. 
---
So many cheap fucks in here thinking everything should be free.
---
Dagger's up
---
I have no memories because I ran on 15 fps all through Vanilla. I doubt my computer could handle weather.
---
I love that the excuse for this place devolving into braindead rehashed memes is that everything else has already been "discussed to death." Like making the ten thousandth 3-minute MS Paint edit about stv or undead rogues or &lt;insert funny spec&gt; hasn't been stale for months
---
You can make whatever excuses you want, but I don't think there's really any case for this sub not being a fucking joke at this point. We can both see the front page; if you think I'm being a snob or something for thinking it's terrible, then I dunno what to tell you. Sorry if you're still laughing hysterically about *dude moonkin bad üòÇ* or *stvietnam xDDD,* I'm not saying you have to think it's painfully unfunny like I do
---
Addons will help everyone play the game pro.
---
This has been interesting. I'm glad I made this thread, even if I am personally somewhat disappointed in the result.  
---
I expected that not helping someone if you seen them fighting in the world would get that person reamed for not supporting one's faction.   
---
Instead, based on the karma points, it seems that fewer people are hardcore about this than are not. I can only hope that some of the more tribal players are on my team, for once. I'm the opposite of tribal in my actual life, but in an at-war fantasy setting, if I wouldn't "respect the 1v1" in Alterac Valley, I won't do it in the world, because beating the other faction feels like the point.  
---
Disappointing to be in the minority on that, but very interesting. Still, the fact that the most ruthless faction is going to  threaten to dominate the server is a fact of nature, same as the real world. I just happen to be the equivalent of a PvE carebear in real life, but am an RP-PvP in spirit though not in speech online. Speaking of RP, I would respect "gatekeeping" over there insofar as vocally disapproving of people who will not speak in any sort of character. Same for vocally disapproving of people not being ruthless on a PvP server. There is a server for you if you want fair "1v1 duel" PvP, and I can't force you to go there, but you'd arguably have a better time there.
---
If you have never played Vanilla you won't really get the INSANE nostalgic feels others get during the first 10 levels or so (which is a big selling point to wait imo). You might want to do some practice runs over the next few weeks and leave it at that. This is just so you can get a feel of the gameplay and pace as it is much different. Just don't burn yourself out, I think that is the general consensus.
---
look up r34 on google, you will be pleasantly surprised
---
Sharding will be there, yes, but how much it will affect anything post early game is still TBD. 
---
Latency/performance could still be an issue honestly. The new server infrastructure folds when large open world events take place. 
---
So if you were around for Vanilla and remember the OG TM v. SS, there is still some question as to whether or not that will be possible, not to mention capital city assaults. 
---
The servers will either fold or shard the participants unless they have planned for that ahead of time.
---
So you do a 10 min vanilla lvl 12 difficulty quest and obtain a free artifact weapon and you feel like back in Vanilla ? Did we play the same game ? oO
---
Back in Vanilla you would be happy to get a green item and not a white for that kind of quest ! And if this item is an upgrade you feel like you won the lottery !
---
Still considering it, rogues are a real rollercoaster in vanilla, you feel like a king when things are going your way, but things can go south so very fast,  theres always that one hunter or druid that seems to have hunters Mark or faerie fire mapped to every button. Allies that like to stand by you while you're in stealth just asking to get you aoed
---
You're either rich or desperate. Or both :D
---
When it just pours down in STV. its one of my absolute favorite weather effects
---
I did the walk and wait last night on a classic server. Was a good time. Dancing, buffing, talking, inspecting. Didn't take too long before everyone was assembled and it felt like everyone was committed to the instance when we walked through the portal. Few healer and tank deaths but we completed it.
---
He asked you what to post instead - trying to put the 'constructive' in your criticism.
---
Not a problem! Hope you guys have a great time at it! :)
---
FRESSHHHH.  Unless of course you're struggling to choose a class, then I'd recommend a bit of experimenting with different ones til lvl 20 or so.  You can always choose a faction or race you don't plan to main/play in Classic so that your experiment doesn't spoil any of the real thing.
---
Answer the question.
---
What should we be posting on this sub?
---
No I‚Äôll listen to it! And if I have any more questions I‚Äôll message you, if you don‚Äôt mind
---
stay far away from anything made by "tipsout"

Heavy snow in Winterspring, dust storms in Tanaris, rain in Loch Modan...  lovely!
---
But my favourite ‚Äùweather‚Äù has to be the cinders falling close to Blackrock Mountain, that is just pure love.
---
I know its a difference in perspective but it totally blows my mind that this isn't common knowledge.
---
Same.  But my burnout isn't "sick of this game" it's more: "this is a total waste of timeas I'll have to do it again for Classic this summer."  Took my shaman to 30 tho because it was so fun.  Found my main :)
---
I recommend no practice for two reasons, as others said, it will be more fun to experience it fresh. That New MMO Smell is the best thing about any brand new game, and I'd hate to do anything to spoil that.
---
Also, private servers all are running reverse engineered code bases, some of which diverge pretty wildly from how the game ever actually worked; you may wind up practicing things that can't be done or won't work the same at all in Classic. Classic is meant to be as close to Vanilla as possible within a modern client and server architecture, but in the end it's not going to be exactly the same as any particular official or bootleg iteration or emulation of the game that has come before. The best way to practice it is to just wait and play the real thing, which is how everyone learned to play it back in the day, and how plenty will learn to play it again (or, like you and me, for the very first time).
---
Many dungeons also had several elites outside barring the way, that is why you should meet with your group at the nearest relevant town for your faction before going to the instance portal together.
---
Every single race can be a warrior, unlike other classes. So warrior class population splited on more combos than other classes. so they naturally get less %. also you can see rogues down bottom aswell cos rogues are second to warrior class that can be any race except for a tauren. so they rogue population split on more aswell. So the bottom of the list is almost exclusively rogues and warriors combos. cos there are so many of them...
---
also what do you mean "so unpopular"? they are about 1% like most of other warrior races. 0.8% gnome warrior vs 1.1% undead warrior, vs 1.14% dwarf warrior, vs 0.56% troll warrior and so on. gnomes are about the same really to other 5 warrior races. 
---
also keep in mind its not like this quiz is the most accurate ever. as pointed many times before. its a quiz from ppl, that willing to take time to fill it, which is a special category of ppl that do it that like to be helpful (for instance, i didnt do it). so its not the actual stats from what ALL people play. so its only can be considered as an approximate data.
---
Orc and human warriors are obviously ahead cos they got op racials for each faction, and the optimal pick for pve. tauren is good aswell, and many ppl see them as goto tank race aswell, cos of bonus hp.
---
so rather than these three, all other five warrior races are about the same +-. around 1%.  gnomes arent special, and not specially unpopular, why would you highlight them? i don't get it.
---
And on the server that rhymes with "horsetail", traveler's backpacks are only 4g each.
---
For me the right price would be 20‚Ç¨$ + 5‚Ç¨$ / month
---
They have 2 years development costs + monthly server bills so it seems right they would recover those costs and make a living out of it.
---
13‚Ç¨$ / month seems steep for a 15yo game, but I'll pay it as long they don't do stupid shit like full sharding or tokens or let the Chinese farmers run the servers. 
---
I'll have to take a hard look at cross realm BGs, I can't decide now if I can still play with that or not.
---
No I continued to upgrade it and unlock new things for it, did we play the same game? That was the whole point of the weapon...
---
No he work at acnevizor
---
Biggest wow disappoint of my life was cata. Was so excited for the "Iron Squish" thinking we would be going back to classic style numbers... Little did I know it meant you would go from dealing 10000000 damage a hit to only dealing 1000000 damage a hit. Very big squish.
---
1. There is no concrete indication of a release date. There's a tinfoil hat conspiracy theory that thinks it'll be July 16th.
---
2. They're releasing the game at version 1.12, because that's the most complete version of the game and possibly the only complete server backup they have. However, they are going to stage content releases in 6 phases. We do not yet have a timeline on content release, so we don't know if it'll take 8 months, a year, or even 2 years for all content to roll out and be consumed by players. Items will all exist in their final 1.12 state, but will generally only be released with their relevant content buckets.
---
3. There's no word on expansion servers yet, but Vanilla, TBC, and Wrath were all very popular, very lucrative periods in WoW history so I would be surprised if we don't see them eventually. It probably depends on how successful Classic is in the long run.
---
There are a number of official posts on the classic forum, as well as a "what we know so far" thread that answers any questions that have an official response.
---
 [Official Classic Discussion](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/community/classic-discussion), read the stickies.

---
You can also google the internal employee alpha, as it's going on right now and downloadable on the CDN.
---
There are some changes confirmed, such as loot trading in raids to reduce "accidentally ML'd to the wrong person" tickets. Colorblind mode and bnet integration are also a thing.
---
This could be said about 90% of the updates. LFD, flying, heirlooms, etc. They look good initially because you don‚Äôt see the downsides until well after they‚Äôve been implemented.
---
&gt; but I certainly want it to be dangerous to get too close to me
---
Grab 2 points in Savage Strikes for that 20% bonus crit chance on Raptor Strike and wield a fat 2hander. That's as close as you'll get to it being dangerous to get in your melee range. The other talents (Entrapment, Riposte, Counterattack) are there to help you get people out of your deadzone, not to scare them away.
---
Keep in mind that the Survival tree is *not* a melee tree. It's a talent tree that puts emphasis on *Survival*, by giving you many tools to deal with bad situations (aka something getting in your deadzone) and more tankiness. The only talent that directly affects melee only is the talent I mentioned above, Savage Strikes, which increases the critical chance of your Raptor Strike/Mongoose Bite by 10/20%. That's it.
---
If you want to be a melee hunter for reasons that are beyond me, then you should go BM so that your pet does damage to compensate for the fact that you do nothing outside of a fat raptor strike every now and then.
---
And if you ever want to be become a braindead hunter that does nothing but spam rank1 Wing Clip with Nightfall in raids, then you should be MM to give Trueshot Aura to your melees. The only time melee hunters are somewhat useful to a raid, they'd want to be MM and not Survival.
---
To answer your last question, yes, hunters can dual wield swords in Vanilla, but you wouldn't want to do that if you're a melee hunter, unless you go for the ultimate meme that is double Dragon's Call, in which case I wish you good luck farming Eranikus dozens upon dozens of times.
---
TL;DR Survival isn't melee, and melee hunter is bad in the first place. The only time melee hunter is somewhat useful, it shouldn't even be survival.
---
Yet my hatred for gnomes will make me target them first priority !
---
Yeah, why shouldn't we get to play for free on their server infrastructure and benefit from their customer service, all of which presents an ongoing operating cost that the nominal subscription fee that has existed without a price hike since 2004 pays for! Activision-Blizzard is so fucking greedy, UHGGG
---
Only if there was a Collector's to buy, I'd spend up to 200$ on it.
---
If you are like me and have a tendency towards restarting ad infinitum, you might benefit from practicing as it has helped me focus on a main.
---
Before practice I knew I wanted to start with a mage, but I also desperately want a warrior and paladin and druid.  Playing all of them for a few levels helped get it out of my system and now I am ready to start with a mage!
---
Professions were the next hurdle, but I think I've worked that out, too.  Enchanting on druid, tailoring on priest,  mining and skinning on mage while leveling.
---
I've never had so much fun overthinking a thing.
---
Shut up and take my money
---
This is what I‚Äôm waiting on more than anything. I NEED to know server names so I can start making small print out posters and putting them out around my city at like GameStop and stuff I‚Äôm going to try my hardest to get mostly everyone in my city to play on the same server whether they go alliance or horde. I need this to happen!!!
---
UD Rogue. Undecided whether I go female or male though. Probably male.
---
&gt; Warrior set is really nice also.
---
What? That‚Äôs the most hideous in the bunch. And current Warrior T1-3 are the best in the game.
---
&gt; What is so special about the old gameplay vs new gameplay?
---
Very different game modern WOW is more like a hack and slash adventure game with mmorpg trappings and massive time gating mechanics in an attempt to keep you subbed longer. Old WOW is more like a classic mmorpg since it drew so heavily from others of the genre like Everquest and has large time gating mechanics in the form of stuff just taking longer such as leveling so to me it feels like less of a blatant treadmill even if it still obviously is one. This slowness has upsides as well as obvious downsides and just comes down to some people prefering that style of play/game.
---
&gt; Is Horde generally better or is that just BS opinions? Because, sure I dont mind making a Horde toon to play with friends, but I really would like to be on the Alliance. Dwarf or Human.
---
Horde has slightly better PVP racials, but alliance side are overpowered both in PVP and PVE due to paladins. I have played both sides a lot a lot and personally prefer the horde because I find the community to be better. 
---
&gt; Are PVP servers the best way to go or is PVE alright too? Personally I've played PVP servers I dont hate it but I'm just not good at it. It can be fun.
---
World PVP in old school WOW is way more common to the point you mention certain zones and people will immediately start swearing in anger or telling stories about their experiences in them (Strangelthorn vale for example) It comes down to personal preference to some people they love the stories and experiences from it and others it just interferes with the other parts of the game they enjoy. 
---
&gt; Is grouping mandatory in Classic or could you relatively play solo or at most with 2-3 friends?
---
You can play the entire game solo if you want until you hit max level then it morphs into 5 man content and eventually raids. I will say though their are a fair number of elite/group quests that happen while leveling which you can either group with your friends or other people in the zone with to do.
---
The only reason to disgrace yourself by playing a gnome is obviously "escape artist" the best PVP warrior racial period.
---
In the same.boat but I hot 26 and stopped. And some other charas lol 8-15.
---
I actually was playing pservers like 3 hours a day so I stopped lol. But I did it to learn the quests 1-20 so I can get ahead of the pack in classic.
---
It infact made me fiend for classic even more. Reeeeweeeeee
---
Pretty sure blizzard mentioned that as long as you have a subscription to retail, it's free
---
You are trying way to hard to play wombo combo  that's really not the playstyle of warrior. Check out some pserver warrior gameplay there's is so much footage. Yes spamming ragepot isn't really the best idea, and your need to use it comes from wanting to combo all the time. You are not a rogue, you are a warrior. Of course there is times where combos are good, but it's not not that often and definitely not always.
---
exact macros I can't list because we don't know how addons function in classic , but a good macro is bloodlust cancel on your charge as it keeps you in combat. 
---
Last profession should be used for goldmaking. It depends solely on what you want to make gold with. Mining is commonly used as you want a fuckton of arcane crystals early as warrior, and skilling a hard profession like mining on a slow leveling class like warrior has good synergy. Mining is also neccesary to 2man DME boss farm with a healer, typically the warrior has that. 
---
Skinning is also very useful for devilsaurs ofc, in classic you'd want a healer partner to farm with when you do that, lots of pvp happens at devilsaurs(especially with no/less mafia in classic) so you can improve your skills there and make good gold. 
---
Lastly herbalism is nice for ranking as you will be spending a lot of time in the world killing people, and you can pick up herbs doing so, felwood is particularly nice.
---
^^ This. People are less likely to quit or walk out when they have to trek to the instance. Made 2 or 3 really good friends waiting for people to finish getting there. It‚Äôs all about the journey.

---
my 2 cents is most ppl who roll warrior is fixated on the human weapon skill bonuses.
---
my other 2 cents is that dual wielding 2 two-handed weapons still only look "cute" on a gnome :P

When doing the elite part of the whirlwind quest, can you share the lootfrom the elite or is it 1 per person?
---
Definitely can solo it, but it would would make the fight 30+ minutes without wingclip. Concussive shot just doesn't last long enough.
---
\#nochanges
---
How many months do you plan to play?
---
I really like the shoulders and TBH I'm a pally player so I see it through that lense (and honestly IMO they should have swapped warrior and pally sets for these looks).  
---
Warrior T1-3 are awesome (T3 is one of my favorite sets)...but nothing's more awesome than Pally T2 :P
---
Which is bis for mitigation, check out its armor and block
---
Bis prot is a little weird as a concept though, tanks tend to have at least a few different sets for max mitigation, max threat, and a few other things
---
This sub is somewhat of a self-selecting sample. The types of players that reach rank 14, clear naxx, get scarab lord, etc., are also the types of people who are the more involved speakers of the community and are going to be subscribed to and posting here. 
---
That being said, I have seen it used in arguments as a form of evidence, which is usually bs. Like, "Druids are bad flag carriers. I was a R14 shaman so I know what I'm talking about." Stuff like that is a little obnoxious.
---
~~best looking mounts~~
---
~~gear looks awesome on them~~
---
~~people love you~~
---
Because you have the best dance
---
So here's how it works in general:
---
If you need to loot a quest item that drops from a mob, everyone from the party can loot it. However, if the quest item is a generic item such as 1 Boar Ear or whatever, it's randomly generated and the mob that you're allowed to loot might have it, while the other mob that your friend can loot might not.
---
So in the Whirlwind quest case, as long as you're in a group, everyone will be able to loot the final quest item. Hope this makes sense!
---
Definitely agreed. However, it's a blame to be put on a different team entirely.
---
It's less stupid than saying. Dota 2 is harder than wow though.
---
No 2.x.x is already TBC, new mechanics, new talents, abilities etc.
---
Night time in westfall was one of my big favorites. Either theres a rare that only spawns at night there or I found him at night more. Either way I had it in my mind that he was only there some nights based on the mooncycle or something. Very fond memories.
---
I‚Äôm somewhat in the same boat. On the days I think I want to heal, I bounce between Druid and Priest. Problem being, I find Druid gear to be the ugliest of the bunch and I am not a fan of cat dps, so having to play feral to level just bugs me. On the other hand, I would prefer not to be one of 450000 priests on a server.
---
The rain while running across the Karanas to Qeynos. Oh wait...
---
I kind of wish to play mi Warlock with the benefit of being unique and desirable for more than DPS and health stones.
---
You can share.
---
Wow this is awesome! Great work!
---
Practice makes routine, and routine is why retail is stale. 
---
Fresh.
---
I think he means there are easier to obtain and better options before they would want these.
---
Axe spec is for PvP, you don't PvE as Arms really (bar levelling). Axes are definitely the best option here, and weapon skill doesnt affect pvp quite as hugely.
---
For PVE though, the weapon skill is MASSIVE for Fury Warriors dps and Prot Warrior threat, and there's tonnes of nice pve swords and maces. Orc warriors have a reasonable amount of axes to choose from for PVE too but less so.
---
Also whlist Gnomes are a fine PVP race they are 100% the worst PVE race on alliance for Warriors by a huge margin. Almost all of their racials are totally useless for PVE. Compare to the huge dps/threat boost human weapon skills give, the dispelling/armor cooldown and naxx-helping frost res of dwarfs, or even the dodge/nature resistance of NElves for helping in tanking.
---
A gnome warrior with Axe spec is a brilliant pvp option, but one of the worst PVE choices you can make.
---
I'm on a pserver for tbc. I forgot how many things were handed to us as players. You actually have to read the quests!! Haha
---
I‚Äôm rolling Gnome Warrior. Escape artist is legit!
---
How about nothing, so the relevant information doesn't get buried away in the dreadful memes? Not everyone comes to this sub for months, and you can always take a break from the sub. Shocking, I know
---
Nothing, Trolls are The best. Y'all need da voodoo!

Same as the summon stone though.
---
younger me rolled a night elf because "dude looks badass yo!"

I had a similar experience on a deadmines run that fell apart once we reached the instance. Lost our tank, mage logged out within 5 minutes of zoning in. All we had left was a 20 hunter, 19 rogue (me) and a 16 priest. We killed the first boss by sapping one of the adds, pet tanking the boss, hunter and I killing the add. Then killing sap target, then boss.   
---
Made it all the way to the foundry before we wiped.
---
Honestly i'd probably pay like $200 but thats because i'm crazy and obsessed...
---
Relevant information is always stickied.
---
You can also search by Top.
---
I was really on nearly the same point just with paladin, mage and priest as parts. For me it depends on the profession to be honest and in the end holy paladin with alchemy won. Mage + enchanting and also priest with most likely enchanting was 2nd and 3d. Will most likely alt the mage.
---
I don't think anyone assumes it will be a long time until it is cleared, I just don't think it will be a day 1 clear. It took 2.5 months between Naxx release and full clear in Vanilla and while I get people are much better players now than back then and we know the strats now it still seems like a stretch that it will be cleared in 4 hours of release.
---
People knew them mostly because they were sought after and a huge majority weren‚Äôt going to get their hands on it. So a lot og talking and admiring led people to know about it. This time around, if it goes how the 1.12 patch goes and if private servers aren‚Äôt far off, we‚Äôre going to swim in items like this. With weapons and trinkets being the most sought after, but still, many more clears than back then will lead to this.
---
So you can do it as a group of 5 and only need 1 person to gather the reagents to summon?
---
Probably like 20% of the population will be a rogue. Maybe even higher. I really want to see what the population stats look like after the initial "honeymoon" period is over. I have a feeling that it's going to be 60%, or more, of the population will be either a warrior, rogue or mage.
---
&gt; hard time getting ganked
---
Making assumptions to justify your perception, grade A üëåüëå
---
&gt; by ganking lowbies 
---
Or...making sure I merc everyone I come across, including same level players? What a thought. I think OP (or at least someone in this post) commented on this as well. 
---
&gt; everyone is raiding 
---
OP explicitly cited mat farming for raids, and the ability to slow this down (thus slowing down raid progress relative to the dominant side). And a good way to make sure that your faction is better geared at 60 is to slow down the other side so they dont hit 60 as soon. 
---
Play how you want, for the reasons you want, but dont project that shit on to everyone else. You're the one that sounds salty they got ganked. "Everyone that pvps is a dick üò≠üò≠üò°"
---
people dont like the aesthetics. i played a female gnome def warrior in classic and will play a female gnome def warrior again. gnome = master race
---
What pushed me off in Mists was that it had so many dailies that were needed to do anything else. I felt like I hit max level then just repeated every day to make any progress. 
---
 killed my motivation to log in
---
I subbed to wow for years, and bought original game + two expansions at full market value.  I've paid them like.. around $500 to play the game already.  
---
Literally every other large-scale computer game has huge server demands and customer service requirements.  Very few charge a fee.  
---
I'm not sure where your vitriol comes from
---
I would suggest Arms if you were going to level mostly through dungeons. I think TM is huge for low levels when you‚Äôre going to struggle with rage generation
---
I appreciate your calm, levelheaded response.
---
Yep, there‚Äôs a YouTube video that explains the process. You need to have a combat rogue capable of doing VS though.
---
I bet paladins would love Crusader strike in vanilla.
---
Wow...just wow...
---
I suggest you contact blizzard for a deal...kickstarter it...and rake in the cash
---
I think this depends entirely on how many people play and continue to play.
---
If the interest dies out in a year it will likely die with Naxx.  If there is a lot of interest they will have to come up with a solution i.e. TBC roll or new vanilla content.
---
Bruh you have to make it to WC as either faction, as a druid, rogue, hunter, how could you not? Theres also RFD &amp; Co in the barrens that warriors and clothies love
---
Rainy Arathi Basin!
---
Half of the fun is the danger, and the adventure. Especially if you can all make it as a group instead of going 1 by 1
---
The rep bonus is amazing for patterns and such. That's good for when you are cowering in town waiting for your paladin friend to log on and healbot/freedom you.
---
Ugh the priest placeholders.  Still so traumatized by that chartreuce + turban combo
---
I'm one of those insane horde druids that figured out how to get onto the subway from Lagforge to Stormwind, and I have a picture of the sunken ship from that adventure to prove it.
---
If all of the druids are in catform and stealthed, then you've got the tank and healer at minimum, and if you're bringing in rogues and other druids to pad out the party (as we know how to feral this time around) you're going to be able to clear the content with a full group.
---
Getting to the Deadmines as horde is easy (but dull) as - you go up the coast from STV.  Getting to the Stockades can be problematic as you either need to get through the front gate of Stormwind, or come up from Ironforge.  WC is far enough inland that as long as you're not taking the main road and going through the backways in, you should be able to sneak through provided you know the caverns well enough NOT to get lost.  RFC works best by coming in though the west gate, and trying to sneak there, as coming through the main gate is going to run right into a ton of horde.  Stockades and RFC are the two toughest instances to get to, and by the time that you're going to be able to get to them reasonably safely, you will have likely already passed them by level wise anyhow.
---
It all boils down to who's you can talk into going on an adventure =)

Gnomish Rocket boots don't break and do require engineering in Classic
---
Rocket Boots xTreme from BC are 300% speed, never break, require engineering, and have never been nerfed afaik

I am class loyal to a fault so my main is already picked, but I want a gnome warr alt sooo bad
---
As some discussion about sharding started here (and with it misinformation), I'd like to say that: 
---
**WE DONT KNOW** how and if sharding will be used, and if it will be used, for how long and which zones it will be used ‚Äì also the reason why they will use it (for what specific purpose) is dubious at best.
---
Thread by me asking for clarification:

For those arguing its wise to use sharding so there wont be ques on launch day, I'd recommend reading this thread of mine:

---
Stay classy.
---
I doubt Activision will loosen their grip.  If classic does well it will unfortunately garner more attention for their overlords not less. =(
---
Lil' dudes got electricity tho
---
Walking to the dungeons is a core part of vanilla and vanilla pvp.
---
Dont forget thunderfury is also 100 arcanite bars as compared to sulfuras being (80?)
---
And if you think about it. Watching people play wow classic is the best thing to do while playing wow classic yourself! Other than try-harding server 1sts I guess.
---
I'm sure it'll be popular, but frankly I think for those that aren't already interested they'll see the combat/speed of leveling and be scared off.  Classic WoW has a FAR different pace and feel than most games nowadays, so if you're expecting it to intrigue younger gamers I am not as optimistic about that.
---
For like the whole 5 minutes...
---
I agree, thematically you can see all of the sets have an AQ vibe to them.  They are most definitely not placeholders, especially not the Warrior set.  All of the sets also have matching off-pieces like boots, belt, and gloves.  If they were placeholders they would not have spent the time matching those up, they would have rehashed models on them.
---
It will prevent failures. It's useful.
---
1. Classic literally had a job listing for somebody to restore vanilla graphics. We saw in the demo, and supposedly on the internal employee alpha client, that shadows and shadow resolution are updated with options for modern shadows and water. Same models and textures, for the most part, though.
---
2. Vanilla is basically a different game. There's a lot more RPG to it, and while a lot of its RPG mechanics are clunky and dated, they're *there*, and not in the current game. Leveling weapon skill, feeding pets, buying ammo, using reagents to cast certain spells, as just an example of what some of us miss from the live game. Class design and balance had a very different attitude in vanilla as well, such as "hybrid tax". Classes were a lot less balanced, but class balance over the years has homogenized them, resulting more in "class archetypes" where as of WoD I felt more like I was picking a healer based on which visuals I liked best, as they all had similar toolkits for instance. Some of us miss the wonky balance that gave very distinct and unique classes and specs.
---
3. Alliance vs Horde boils down more to myth than fact. You can play any race/class combination and be competitive and successful, it's just that on some servers the good PvPers congregated on one faction or the other. Some races have better PvE racials, some better for PvP, which contributes to this myth. PvP-wise at least, in vanilla the win/loss ratio in BGs was fairly even between factions except for AV, which was alliance dominated due to terrain issues that were not resolved until TBC. The factions are about equal, the idea that one is better than the other is in the realm of superstition, myth, and personal preference. ^(Horde is better.)
---
4. If you enjoy PvP servers and don't mind being ganked and even corpse camped, then by all means play PvP. Keep in mind STV in vanilla is a meme for a reason. wPvP was a loooot more prevalent in vanilla.
---
5. You can solo most of vanilla, but obviously you'll still have to group for dungeons, raids, and BGs.
---
6. No word yet on expansions. I would be surprised if they don't, though. I know that Wrath and Cata pservers are popular for example. Part of the reason we're getting classic is for legal reasons and protecting intellectual property. J.A.B. stated they'd discussed letting Nostalrius keep going for instance, but there was no clear way to protect their I.P. rights while giving that server a green light to carry on.
---
7. Most of the quest story arcs are tied to their respective zones, though there are tie-ins to the older games. I haven't played the old RTS beyond about half of WC1, though, so I can't say how many references there are.
---
8. Vanilla WoW is a lot slower paced than the modern game. Don't feel obligated to rush. Stopping and smelling the roses, exploring, leveling professions, helping friends with quests, PvPing, screwing around, etc are all part of the game and valid, acceptable ways to spend your time. Leveling is more of a journey, not some poorly tuned slog you have to endure and rush to get to end-game. In vanilla, "the game begins at max level" wasn't part of the design philosophy, so there was something for everyone. This is something many later expansions fail to get right.
---
In that case, no. In order to pick up the quest "The Summoning" which is when you kill the elemental and get his heart, you need to complete the previous quest which is gathering all the reagents. So everyone doing the quest needs to have the reagents and turn them in prior to picking up the last quest.
---
Blizzard will run it like OP said or rather how osrs runs their game.
---
They went from 10-15K to over 100K average online players changing to this model.
---
Because on alliance human is just way better for pve and I'd say stone form is better for pvp than escape artist. Also extra int is useless to a warrior.
---
Unfortunate
---
I don't think so, as the crowd is smaller.
---
I also think it's a good thing if it ISN'T as popular. Tons of absolute morons play fortnite, drawn by large crowds (stupid people always follow the herd).
---
Don't remind me. Ugh. I had to buy so many cooldowns! ARGHHHH!
---
There's a lot of man-children here that think their word on what is fun and what's not is the final say.  They can't process that different things are fun to different people, so they downvote accordingly.
---
Playing a gnome in melee when you are in 40 mans is a bad time.
---
I'm surprised by some of these percentages. Lock over a Rogue for starters. Pally even remotely being that high. Huntard seems a bit high too. It was always more of a noob class and I dont expect to see as many of those staying this time around
---
Having skinnier class wear those would make them alot more attractive, like Undead/gnome/nightelf, big character kinda make all armor look weird imo
---
My soul and my brothers too
---
To be fair it's exactly the same as the Warrior gear just with different shoulders and a blue color scheme.
---
That is epic! For some reason those fights feel the most rewarding.
---
You think you want it, but you don't.
---
Meh it's mostly just people who want to gank that whine about flying mounts.
---
Oh. Just talking about seasonal server here
---
The experience is 10x when fresh
---
learning everything 1st time is just amazing
---
sure for a great game like this even the 10th time is fun but not like the 1st
---
Kargoz has a youtube video all about wants and wand progression
---
It's not?
---
If you are sticking to an extremely hyped community it does not mean that everyone is going to share your passion. Blizzard don't even consider Classic a "Major" release, youtube trailer view counts show similar trend.
---
Classic trailer - 2,4M views 
---
BFA trailer - 19M views
---
Kids players are more than adults players(Classic players) so probably not. Sorry
---
Pandaria raids were hard but god damn were they really good. 25H SoO is still one of the best raids to this day.
---
Real sunny day in STV, near the water in booty bay, fishing. Really made me want to go outside. 
---
But not like, too much.
---
I scoured the Classic Database and I cannot seem to locate the helm/hood your speaking of. Perhaps it was a World Drop?
---
You didn't like getting dive-bomb ganked by somebody you had no chance of seeing coming?
---
Oh yeah I know was just tellin op but thanks.
---
Who cares?
---
world pvp*
---
That's to improve stealth.  Everyone knows the best thing for stealth is 10,000 lumens coming out of your crotch!
---
I played Alliance in the beginning, quit in TBC.  Can back before wotlk and went horde for the next 8+ years.  My guild will be going back alliance to kick it old school.
---
My advice is don't look up anything. Learn by playing. You can find like minded people.
---
(If you want to hang with the "hardcore" crowd, you'd need to be prepared. You decide.)
---
I would recommend doing at least one practice run to level 15.  Just to get the flow of the game down because it is way different then MOP was.  I wouldn't go much further because you then risk burnout because the game gets pretty grindy post level 30 and experiencing the real core game for the first time with classic and not a Pserver will be a much more immersive experience IMO.
---
It was an indirect nerf (and I just looked up the patch, which was 2.4k). They made it so using the boots would make you drop the flag in WSG, so you couldn't rocket boot+slow fall across the gulch. Which was one of the coolest reasons to use them, obviously.
---
Lol, the day they add micro transactions to classic or fully ruin the experience in some other way will be the day we see a world record set for the amount of subs cancelled in a single day. They can try it if they want, but it will backfire faster and more obviously than anything else they've ever done has in the past
---
Imagine being worried over a video game.
---
Sexy AQR
---
Yeah wtf is up with that?  I much prefer shoulders being the fashion/elite piece like it's always been... belts seem like such an odd choice for that.
---
i really like that blue paladin set. pretty badass
---
This response is great. Thank you for taking the time.
---
really? I thought hes just being angry while running back to his corpse and then kills you 3 times like an 3dg3l0rd
---
So your just gunna watch your faction member die if they're losing? Definitely not how it went down in vanilla.
---
Yes scarcity of gear is a good thing. In retail you are bombarded with gear, you even find tons of epics while leveling.
---
I'm rolling a PvE server so I'm pretty sure that I'll be segregated from the streamers. World PvP ganking is going to be a big part of the entertainment for streamers I think.
---
People are mixing up the last reply with a proper bluepost and whining about the info it contained. Its stupid.

There is no way.  I am super hyped for classic and it will breath life into this genre again but I doubt it will get anywhere close to the current top 5 on twitch.
---
It looks like shitty, old-timey underwear. Can't tell if Rogue or gold prospector named Ol' Jangles.
---
Classic wow with only MC beeing out and no Pvp is a snorefest and I say that as a biggest classic fan out there. The streams while leveling will be great after that it will get old very fast.
---
Are we going to have addons right from the start?
---
When this game coming out? :(
---
&gt; drove the game in a poor direction
---
Really? Then please explain how the absolute peak of concurrent players in history of WoW was during WoTLK, that is after *2 xpacs* of flying.
---
Though these are all good responses my money would be on the fact that big shoulder pads = cool in classic, and the sweet sweet tier sets are less prominent on little gnomes. I do like the idea from another response, though, that they are less noticeable in pvp until they are up wrecking you in the face.
---
Where from? If you‚Äôve just started raiding, these are good upgrades for a hunter. You‚Äôre still hoping for random loot drops in MC or BWL.  The hunters quest isn‚Äôt a cake walk either. Can be fk‚Äôd up by anyone. On a PvP server I‚Äôd imagine its a nightmare to finish. 
---
And the Ashjre'thul, from Chromaggus had a lousy drop rate.  
---
My point was that a hunter should have priority over any other class for a ranged bow/gun if it is an upgrade on what they have.
---
The first time I saw a sandstorm in Tanaris. I didnt know what was going on and booked it into the inn thinking I might take damage.

I disagree with the others, I say you play until release. You likely won't get very far, but at least have a decent idea of how shit works

Tells me one thing:

---
I'm pretty sure a MS warr would choose a shammy any day of the week over a priest.
---
The WF can make it very easy to one shot clothies. Also the unpredictable burst will also give the enemy healers a tough time to heal. 
---
It's just super powerful not even considering the other utility the shaman has to offer. 
---
Also they CAN dispel poisons and diseases. Not to mention the tremor..
---
Priests are great but Shaman are OP partners with warriors.

I found an image someone made about a year ago with the human models.
---
? So you mean that EVERYONE should play Classic differently than they did in vanilla because min/maxing is now for some reason obligatory?
---
twitch didn't exist during vanilla
---
Features? If ANYONE prefer "world server down" or "Disconnected" on their screen over actually playing the first 1-2 weeks, they're idiots. That's not an opinion, that's common sense.
---
Sword spec is superior even for horse in pvp.
---
I have one on a VG holy pala. Back in the day and up until a few years ago it was considered a shit tier weapon lmao
---
The capital city town's share trade chat in vanilla at some point, cannot remember which patch it got linked.
---
There were vanilla addon's for the calendar function.  That may make it in with the modern engine.   
---
I doubt you'll have the rest.
---
Wtf? I played in vanilla, but i didnt remember this! :D
---
I thought you could summon with meetingstone.
---
?XD on release i guarantee it will be #1 on twitch. Literally every big streamer will play it even streamers like shroud
---
That's an unfair comparison, there might some truth to it though. Of course an announcement video with largely re-used scenes is going to have fewer views than a CGI trailer for a major expansion
---
That was my understanding. Each one would exist separately if they decided to move forward with having them since they said Classic will exist from now on
---
As someone who never got to experience the game when flying was available, this makes sense, but is also pretty disappointing to hear. I remember when Flight was a Hugely anticipated thing for the game, and I remember when people were begging blizzard to allow flying in Azeroth. But by the time B/C rolled around I couldn't afford to play anymore (and wasn't even level 60).
---
Introduced the concept of hero classes and lorewise brought back the most anticipated enemy in warcraft history

Sharding and Phasing is the main reason the servers can be unstabile now a days. Ofc I don't know exactly how Blizzards server structure looks like, but having different instances running on the same server with different information takes a big toll on the servers. Phasing is a huge deal there, sharding not that much maybe.

Shroud and Soda are apparently going to be in the same guild, with several other streamers wanting to join as well. Soda was talking about the positives and negatives of being "the streamer guild."

How much are you willing to bet?
---
It will he the biggest game on twitch for a few weeks for sure
---
Classic will have at least 200k bare minimum which will put it easily above fortnite most of the time
---
Hunters can absolutely 1-2 shot people
---
I don't care what you post. But if it's a terrible meme you made in 3 minutes I'm gonna say it's terrible. I know that probably doesn't meet your constructive quota but there are some extremely hilarious memes on the front page, one is a jpeg of Futurama (epic) with Wow logos pasted on it and one is even about stv. Pretty funny stuff
---
Time will tell.  I just cannot fathom it.  The MMO genre is dying out and doesn't pull any where near the attention of the current viral games.
---
There's something to be said for having a ton of people in the game even if they are "morons".  There's the obvious that having more people makes the world feel more alive.  Beyond that, there was an argument presented the other day here that having more of a skill/knowledge diversity also makes for a far more interesting dynamic since it gives more opportunity to stand out.
---
True
---
You are a moron

Okay so... people seem to be confused on this whole Vanilla WoW thing, which is alright.
---
What ALL of this is, is Blizzard taking the game that launched in 2004, then starting at patch 1.12 and re-releasing it as it was for people to play.
---
What this isn't is, is adding these little Q.O.L. improvements here or there because it was in Wrath/Cata and makes it convenient. This game is literally a re-release of an imperfect but beloved product from pur our past. This isn't trying to fit retail in a retro box. It's literally just the old box we found in the attic that we remember as being a ton of fun that we really wanna play with our friends again.
---
The problem I see is that most of the time, classic is boring to spectate. I mean it's wonderful to PLAY. But as a spectator you'll be watching a guy struggle to kill two mobs ad once and then bandaging for 15 seconds every two minutes.
---
&gt;This isn't a matter of opinion  
---
&gt;Lol, a weak start  
---
&gt;your opinions about TBC are ill founded  
---
&gt;sorry, didn't you say it wasn't a matter of opinion?
---
You misunderstand.  The historical evidence you are using to support your opinion about TBC are factually incorrect.  That's why I opened with "this isn't a matter of opinion" because you are making claims about the ability of paladins to tank, heal, or dps that were all factually false, and also the goals of the designers during TBC.  TBC was never designed around bringing the player over the class!  That's why I ended with "your opinions about TBC are ill founded".
---
How so ? Asmongold and sodapoppin themselves have 40/50k each lol(with classic launch hype, they had about that during the blizzcon) which places wow already in top 5
---
Blizzard is on record as saying flying was a mistake.
---
Same here, only I wouldn't call it burnout. It's just that remembering I'll have to start again kills my attachment to the character I'm playing, then my desire to continue dies with it. I played long enough to finally pick a main, and now I'm done. Gotta leave enough in the tank for the real deal.
---
Dude this is great, but why have you branded this around Warcraft which is an Activision Trademark and is Copyrighted.
---
This looks sellable and you could make a business and life out of this.
---
But by branding it around Warcraft you have the complete opposite and can now be sued for breach of copyright.
---
I don't want to be a killjoy but you should reconsider!
---
I was thinking around 100ish if there were no subs. Or like maybe 150 max, so 10 months worth of subs.
---
I feel your pain, OP. The thought of having to talk to guildmates, get to know them and remember shit about them is awful. I just want to log on, press some buttons and have shit done for me.
---
/s
---
This interface gave me full blown aids
---
WoW will be the top streamed game for awhile and then probably die down a bit after a month or two.
---
Consider the current viewership:
---
Just Chatting - 160,000  
---
League of Legends - 144,000  
---
Fortnite - 134,000
---
Grand Theft Auto V - 129,000  
---
...  
---
World of Warcraft - 23,300  
---
GTA5 is right on the heels of Fortnite, mostly because of GTA RP which is a lot more niche than WoW Classic will be.
---
Also it doesn't really matter if viewers are all that interested in Classic WoW... a lot people tend to watch streamers regardless of whatever they play.
---
I dunno yet. I plan on leveling a paladin or shaman, at the very least, and if I get sucked back into RP it'll probably be indefinite lol
---
I loved Cata dungeons at the start tbh. It was fun tanking during leveling and then lfg was totally broken to go alone (too long to walk through with randoms, leavers, etc) so the guild actually started organizing 5ppls hcs until raids got open.
---
Mid way Cata I remember helping some friend's alt in hcs with my boomking offspec. Doing 20+k dps and solo annihilating things that were taking an effort from all party members at the beginning was so fun as well.
---
Is it time already for this daily post?? Didnt the mods debate about having these posts not allowed until after phase 3? What happened to that ruling/decision?
---
Since Patch 2.0.1 was "The Burning Crusade", and redid everyone's skills, talents, etc, to reflect the new expansion I'm sure curious how "technically" that is still vanilla.
---
Honestly for casual play I would recommend a druid. The class is an absolute blast to play. They have the most interesting choices for specs depending on activity. Druid's are straight BOSSES in PvP. All this is coming from a priest main
---
Oh look this thread again...
---
BC fixed all of classics issues, I‚Äôd be happy if they added it to classic. I would instantly drop it if WotLK was added though.
---
Flying mounts were not added till burning crusade they won‚Äôt be in classic...
---
Quit...BC? YOU ARE NOT PREPARED...for the fuckfest the game has become
---
1.12 balance is fantastic precisely because of its imbalance weaved into it
---
certain classes counter others, some do well in pve some do well in pvp, some are hard to level but payoff late, others easy to level but slowdown late..... 
---
all this stuff is what makes it great.
---
I never got the chance to do a big raid with a huge group. How much loot is dropped when you take down the final boss? If there‚Äôs 30 people in the raid, how does everyone get something out of it? 
---
Does the whole group get reputation with a faction or something allowing them to buy special items?
---
wtf stop stealing my images noob
---
tbh Omen became an optional addon only in MoP, or maybe even later.
---
How do you quit one day into TBC
---
Was the exact opposite experience for me. R13 on official servers and R13 on lh - official servers were a lot harder (might have just been the competition on my old server). And i'm not even gonna talk about av rankers on afkdale.
---
Are you talking about followers?  They don't have 50k active viewers ever.  What causes rankings is active viewers.  I may have over stepped looking at current views top 5 maybe, I really doubt number 1.
---
You can keep players engaged by naming your epics things like Benediction, rather than Current Weaver's Trident or Plundered Black Tooth Face-Splitter.
---
Epics used to have proper names. Nobody's waxing poetic about their bracers of the fever flare, they talk about Quel'serrar, Ironfoe, or Kang the Decapitator.
---
I like
---
Hey guise, what happens after Na-SHUT THE FUCK UP.
---
it might still be good, go find it
---
wattafak dont steal my image
---
Being bad isn't fantastic, no.
---
Warriors being the uncontested kings of shit mountain and Druids kinda sucking isn't a good thing, no matter how much stockholm syndrome has convinced you otherwise. The game is still great despite its flaws, but that does not mean that the flaws do not exist.
---
Nothing.   I already bought the game, still have the discs safely in the sleeves from 2004 and the box (with code) on my shelf.  Why would I pay for the exact same game twice.
---
I am, however, willing to continue to pay the subscription fee to keep the servers up and patches/content coming.
---
Thanks for all the comments and upvotes. I paid for a month subscription so I could provide some screenshots. While logging in i noticed that all my gear on my warrior alt where gone. I have no idea how it happened, but I did boost him to level 90 at one point when I thought I would do a comeback to the game, but I never got back into it. Maybe I lost it then?
---
Link to screenshots:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/vo9SKgv](https://imgur.com/a/vo9SKgv)
---
But I checked my total on the two chars, which are 167 days total. So I played alot to say the least :D
---
Damn you captured the vanilla dungeon feel. Nostalgia and hype levels are off the charts right now. So much of Vanilla is unexplored for me. Just the right amount is known for that nostalgia train. Release date can‚Äôt come soon enough!
---
You were all right.  Retail blows
---
Do they delete your characters after X number of days unsubbed on the modern game?
---
More likely if WoW dwindle and classic servers (including legacy expansion servers) can't "save" it, it'll go into maintenance mode, stop receiving content updates, and they'll start work on another MMO.
---
MMOs come and go without threatening and alienating their playerbase.
---
I kinda like the tier 16
---
after all big shot streamers, their fanboys, and tourists leave:
---
"what do we do now?"
---
"what do you mean? now we can finally play the game."
---
Aside from flying tbc was a great xpac. Unfortunately flying outweighs the good.
---
If the game does well, then it's highly likely. Now whether that means new servers or what, who knows. AFAIK Blizzard has not commented on this.
---
Let's focus on making Classic a success and having fun first.
---
My man. I'm right there with ya.
---
WotLK also launched with gated flying
---
is this true? crazy, never knew that
---
Ah yes but the insinuation you‚Äôre making is that if you disagree with sharding starter zones you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
So you're just going to sit here and keep screeching that you hate the content here, while offering nothing to help remedy the problem.
---
And you continue to visit this sub while crying that you hate its content.
---
Interesting.
---
I recall really looking forward to the weather.  First time I got to experience it I was fishing in STV and a freaking monsoon poured on me.  Loved it!
---
Although my favorite was leveling an tauren alt in Mulgore.  Such immersion.
---
Those are my 4 biggest gripes with wow. And the reasons why I'm so excited for classic. Well said.
---
Why did you quit in first day of TBC ? You didn't want to try it ?
---
go test it out on a Pserver my buddy started as a gnome warrior and had to re roll in vanilla because he would keep getting screwed out of his charge in pvp.
---
I agree with that for sure.  If its an upgrade from a hunters current wep, they should get it.
---
The official stance is they will listen to the community demand once classic is fully progressed. No point debating it at this time.
---
I‚Äòm fine either way, since i‚Äòm one of the guys who played whole classic, it‚Äòs just a bit qol for me these days.
---
The core things that screwed wow for me is stuff like lfraid tool and crossrealm stuff
---
yes. but they can't take it away when its been around since BC.
---
that's why they make you rep and achievement grind for flying in the new zones recent expansions.
---
My worst instance was in Wrath, I led a pug Archavon raid and ninja'd the Grand Black War Mammoth...
---
I wonder what the longest travel in the game is. For example.. down at Silithus near the AQ wall, no hearth.  
---
How long to get to UBRS in this case? Probably 10 minutes or so, less for alliance I guess. 12 minutes max?
---
People are so fucking lazy!
---
Loot from last bosses are generally 2 Tier pieces, and 2 other pieces epics, along with a few BoE Blue and a sack of gems. Everyone doesnt get something out of it.
---
You get rep in MC, but it doesnt lead to any gear. You get rep in AQ which is good for an epic ring, and a bit of CC rep as well.
---
Yes
---
It'll definitely take the #1 spot on launch because some of the big streamers will play it but I can't imagine it stays there too long.
---
That‚Äôs a good point. Didn‚Äôt think of all those small purchases that add up for them.
---
It won't be action-packed until .... world PVP?  BG PVP?
---
Raiding may get some views for speed runs, but WoW ain't action packed most of the time.
---
And to think Classic fans should all be 26+. Stick to Fortnite child.
---
WotLK &gt; BC
---
Ah, Stranglethorn. A few weeks after launch, it¬¥ll be the perfect place to see the "red = dead" - mantra in action. All those lvl 30 undead rogues ganking lvl 60 human mages and night elf hunters running through the jungle. 
---
Yeah.
---
Explained in other comment:)
---
Oh look another recycled meme. Why can't people just post actual discussions anymore?
---
What paper did you use? I've had a go at printing box art before but all the nice paper I've used felt too thick to get a nice smooth cover (folds are not clean and edges are very obvious)
---
So, you'll likely pay much more with the subscription?
---
Obviously i have no problems with ground mounts only but flying is probably the best thing that ever happend to wow imo. Being able to fly around the world gave me tingles i have only felt when i first started in vanilla.
---
What do you suggest we talk about? We've discussed every blue post and aspect of classic 1,000,000 times over. There is nothing to do now but share memes
---
Can it be my turn to repost this next week please
---
Yeah but no TBC maps or quests, and before they even sold the disc to install it
---
I've definitely been in runs where a party member wanted a specific thing, that I could also use, and they didnt turn master loot on and I absolutely snatched it.
---
If they never ever released another patch after 2.01 would you call it TBC ?
---
Practice if you want to get ahead of the curve. Gonin fresh if you want the virgin experience we had in 2004-2006
---
Blizz just release the game I CAN'T TAKE IT
---
For some reason I remember flying being less of an issue while leveling 70-80, and pvping at 80. I forget why.
---
I think there'll be an intial spike of WoW performing better than Fortnite on Twitch, I forget if it was the launch of BFA or the World First that made it beat Fortnite in terms of viewership for a while.
---
Don't see it lasting too long though, past the first few weeks.
---
Comments going so fast no one will see that I play gnome
---
REEEEEEEE
---
Why did you quit?
---
Is stolen silver bugged?
---
There guys I took care of all the standard comments so no one else has to post them. You're welcome.
---
Added some screenshots in new comment.
---
Pls no wotlk
---
Going mage because the other top two classes played will be rogue and warrior :) mages don‚Äôt really struggle too much with either
---
Such a controversial thought to have on this sub
---
I know this isn‚Äôt exactly what you were asking, but there are two leveling guides that cover dwarf early levels: the alliance leveling guide and joana‚Äôs leveling guide. Joana‚Äôs only covers the early levels so far, but takes into account that you are a warrior. The alliance guide is for hunters but works pretty well for the early levels
---
One more...

---
Some people need to be surrounded by 10000 faceless Anonymous morons in order to feel less alone themselves.
---
In classic it will probably take you like 4 hours, 2 days a week. Aftee you have cleared BWL a couple of times, the guild will most likely clear mc, bwl and onyxia in 1 night pretty soon after.
---
Also interested in the link if possible
---
Go play retail and fuck off.
---
Is it wrong to like both?  I like both.
---
But they need t2 gear or better
---
You'll wear plate in PvP. And endgame youll be back in plate for raiding too mate. It's just a phase.
---
Nice. That sounds very doable for me. Very stoked to earn the gear again instead of getting welfare epics.
---
Blizzard should release something like "Retro WOW" without all these conveniences. I bet that would be a hit.
---
Alright, I‚Äôll bite. lock or mage for solo leveling? Does having a pet outweigh the aoe-grinding potential of mage?
---
A lot of them, yes. Group finder was amazing. I didnt mind LFR. The new talent system felt like I had more choice. I realize now that I was wrong on every one of them.
---
I never liked any of them to be honest, while everyone was all ‚ÄùWeee! Flying mount‚Äù I was silently disliking them.
---
Flying mounts really destroyed how big the world felt.
---
You can have everything aslong as I keep my pc and internet
---
Youtube search "laintime" or "incredible warrior tricks". U might not understand anything about these videos but these should still be entertaining to watch and get excited about the upcoming summer. 
---
Also u can search for "world of warcraft vs runescape". Jk I love both games.
---
Exactly, flight was hugely anticipated. And after people get a full year and a half of vanilla with no flying, then another year or so of burning Crusade with no flying, their so-called flying enjoyment tolerance will have gone back down and if any of them will be excited for flying again. Because unless they are also playing battle for Azeroth and whatever comes after that at the same time, they will have forgotten what it's like to fly so much and it will be exciting again. It will feel new again.
---
What server?
---
That‚Äôs... that‚Äôs the point.
---
Should've played TBC. It was still pretty good :P
---
Also it's not fast or exciting enough.
---
They said they'll never release another MMO.
---
Put yourself in their shoes : spend 1 to 200 millions to create another MMO and open yourself to a colossal fail, or just milk your existing franchise for all it's worth ?
---
They can last like that for another good 10 years, unless a WOW killer succeed. But as we know now there's no such thing as a WOW killer except Blizzard.
---
Legion Artifacts wouldnt fit into Vanilla design. Neither from a lore, a narrative or a gameplay perspective.   
---
They were pretty cool nonetheless.
---
Many had 300 days in vanilla
---
Isn't this from BC? based on these shoulders  
---

---
Dishonorable kills come from killing clearly marked NPCs that will never fight back. Getting a DK results in a lot of honor loss, which is terrible if you're trying to grind for PVP ranks.
---
The main gripe with them is they're given out party or raid wide. So one doofus in a city raid can wipe out 39 other player's honor gains for the week.
---
Are there any other quest-related items with cool effects that go away after completing the quest? 
---
I recall something like a trinket or item that turned you into a moonkin or something. Had some goofy world PVP implications.
---
Probably because more than one color existed.
---
The thing that really pisses me off when playing a warlock is my finally getting to the dungeon after traveling across the world and then getting a message from some asshole who was in the next zone over when the group was created who never moved his ass asking "Can I get a summon?" Lazy bum would have gotten there far sooner than I.
---
Soda goes over 50k all the time. Asmon was regularly at 80k during BfA launch.
---
Hello i'm the owner of the websitewi haven't updated yet since the itemization blue post, it will be done next week
---
How brave if you to think about this?
---
I'm that old, crusty MMORPG player who has been yelling across forums since TBC that Wow and other mmorpgs were going to shit through it's mainstream conversion.
---
And I was right .... so the lemmings who bought into the RMT trend can go suck a stick.
---
Because warriors get the most out of PvE racials than any other class, forcing many to human and orc.
---
Hello, owner of the website here, i'll update it next week
---
I really like it too, but I'm bothered about it being exactly the same as the druid set with a recolor
---
Hey man. I wasn‚Äôt trying to upset you. You said that you were part of the small group that was upset about getting ganked so I apologized. 
---
I‚Äôm just trying to save you guys the hot air you‚Äôre blowing and everyone else their time. PvP is fun but it‚Äôs almost entirely meaningless in vanilla. 
---
Raiders won‚Äôt give a shit about it and PvPers (actual pvpers) will spend their time in BGs grinding for gear. That‚Äôs how it was and that‚Äôs how it will be. 
---
So go gank people. It‚Äôs fun. We all love to do it. You just don‚Äôt have to try and sell it as some kickass master plan, cause it ain‚Äôt.
---
Yes, it will be watched more than Fortnite. For like 2 hours.
---
You forget that half of the raiding guilds died due to tanks getting recruited away to top guild for 4h. We lost our MT to this right after clearing spider and never recovered.
---
Let me guess .... "Football" sounds like a good name for a gnome of any class. But for a warrior, it's extremely appropriate.
---
That would alienate a portion of the classic fanbase, which could drive them to pservers instead. Classic is a thing because pservers continuing unchecked and unchallenged is a threat to the intellectual property rights. J.A.B. stated as much, and that they'd discussed letting Nostalrius stay running but couldn't because there was no clear protection of their rights by licensing Nostalrius or just quietly ignoring it.
---
It would undermine the point of classic by pushing a lot of us away. If we want drama and instability we can get that from pservers for free.
---
I could see it being top for a bit after launch.  I‚Äôm curious to see if more people will be watching classic then bfa a few months in...
---
Zul farak will always be number one
---
I would but all of my RL friends are rolling on a pvp server.
---
Hey guys, it's Tips.
---
Yes, but vanilla hybrids are only great healers, and mediocre everything else, that't my point
---
What discussion do you feel is missing from the subreddit? It's really easy to say "Don't allow memes!" without an alternative.
---
People are under the impression that all of the investors are these faceless, hive-minded monoliths that would demand it in order to continue milking their shares. More likely Blizz would take a break from the MMO market completely, put WoW into maintenance mode until it stops making enough money to operate, and either take a break from the MMO market or start work on a new one.
---
Orcs can‚Äôt be paladin, priest, mage, or Druid silly... gosh
---
I wrote this off to soul link being overrated and the skill ceiling of warlock being underrated. Everyone thinks it'll be ez pz. Have fun with that.
---
Nothing in this game is obligatory
---
Nah. Arena, amazing raids, great class balance fae outweighs the negative of flying mounts. You'll have more fun in 3 other aspects than in 1 world pvp.
---
It was a thing but it's not a necessary thing anymore.
---
Healers were so bad back then they couldn't heal through it but now a day with better computers, internet, addons and players its not a big deal at all.
---
No. It won't.   
---
There's a great big world outside of this sub.
---
Even though gnomer will be amongst the most disliked instances, I actually always enjoyed it. Definitely the most unique instance in vanilla
---
Nope, it's from tier0/tier0.5
---
Think they can only sue him if he sells it right? He can make it for his own enjoyment all day long.
---
Corporations want more money, but the WoW playerbase would not likely return to the game ever if they risked losing everything. We're one of the most whiny, entitled fanbases I've seen in gaming.
---
Ahh, you right. Always forget about those sets
---
I feel like TBC flying mounts was completely fine, there were parts of the world you couldnt go to without the flying mounts. It never hindered my world pvp experience. If I wasnt doing arenas I was straight up hunting players.
---
Imo The concept wasn‚Äôt entirely bad but the grinding aspect of it was a bit of a pain. I had hoped it would get brought back in a more meaningful way. If our characters are becoming more and more important, then isn‚Äôt it time we get a mythical weapon of our own rather than a hand-me-down like Doomhammer and Ashbringer?  
---
But then we got Heart if Azeroth which introduced a whole new layer of RNG to go with normal gear RNG.

Should clarify if 1 is most liked or least liked. I assume it's most liked.
---
I always liked ubrs/lbrs, but i guess theyll he a raid again now, huh? BRD is a masterpiece. The bottom of the bin for me is prolly scarlet monestary. Its 10 levels and four dungeons, you gotta visit over and over and over to get everything you need, haha.
---
Having artifacts in Vanilla would have been way, way cooler.
---
It probably would have included, ashbringer, twin blades, and eventually frostmourne 
---
It would be like seeing a unicorn. Og I've seen a legendary on someone, but have you ever seen an artifact? Never.
---
Instead they made them lame and ruined the leveling process so you could enjoy their ruined end game.
---
I mean, when it comes to usefulness, you have more choice with the new talent system than the old.
---
Indeed. The Wrath of the Lich King expansion made extremely clear how dramatic flying changed the game. First time through, you were stuck with a ground mount. But when you leveled an alt through the expansion (after of course mailing the cold weather flying book from the character that first leveled through WotLK), the ability to fly from the very beginning trivialized much of the content.
---
Do you lose them as in they are deleted, or do you lose them as in "you can use our F2P model but you only have access to these things, resubscribe to regain access to your stuff?" Because that's usually how that model works in MMOs in order to encourage subscribing or using cash shop unlocks. Swtor does this. I believe Lotro did, too.
---
To put it simply. 
---
When Blizzard implemented flying mounts, dungeon finders, raid finders etc., they gave up the single most important thing about MMORPGs which is proces. The proces of finding a group, proces of riding somewhere finding old friends or enemies. When they implemented all those things they thought they optimized the experience, but in reality they gave up the element that made MMORPG an MMORPG.
---
This will be true if the sharding creates an instance with like 3-4 people each, but otherwise, your leg up wont be worth much if there are 50 other people in your shard trying to kill the same damned kobolds.  Ahh, vanilla launch day ü•∞
---
Southshore paarrtiee
---
As long as the whole group is in for the run, a full BRD run is my favorite experience.
---
Nah, you could wave goodbye to knowing what your enemy is wearing in pvp and the coolness of "the warrior shoulders" that everyone wanted went away aswell.
---
Funny how classic content, not matter how old, stayed relevant. Even when Naxx launched.
---
I think I was on board with flying (I joined in TBC but had no idea what I was doing, so leveling up to get a dragon seemed cool -- I'M SORRY).
---
LFD was okay at the end of Wrath, mostly because the Wrath dungeons were made for quick queues and round-em-up-aoe-em-down gameplay... so I was like, sure.
---
I was against LFR when it was announced... give me some credit there (and I got Ghost Crawler to admit it was a mistake on Twitter, which I am proud of).
---
I HATED the new talent trees when they were announced. If anything, they should have gone the opposite direction...
---
There was a whole lot of good in TBC imo, but daily quests and flying mounts turned me off so much that I lost interest in the game as a whole.
---
They were nice because the world got so big "small" They added additional lands which made all the others obsolete. The new lands were filled with quest hubs and no substance. Basically the game as it is today, if you stripped the "QoL" elements it would be beyond piss poor. They wouldn't need sharding because you wouldn't see anyone anyhow. I believe the QoL changes were there to keep this game afloat after every expansion.
---
Well, it was implemented early in wow's lifeclycle (first expansion) and it's kinda strange that these stones were basically useless during vanilla so people tend to remember them being worth something.
---
Maybe we should just ask for release date then?
---
It doesn't matter how much you paid in the past, that money went to the ongoing development and server infrastructure costs.
---
Those other games you mention also have huge amounts of microtransactions and ongoing monetization schemes in lieu of a sub fee. Loot boxes, season passes, skins, etc etc. Look at games like fortnite, which don't require anyone to pay anything to play the game, but make billions with their monetization options.
---
Compare that to WoW which has a handful of store mounts/pets that are by-in-large ignored by the majority of the playerbase, and only adds maybe 1 or 2 a year (not available for Classic, obviously), and some character services which are priced to be used infrequently.
---
Here people are complaining about a $15/mo fee that is the only thing required to play the game now, not even an upfront purchase (aside from current expac, which isn't required for anyone just wanting to come back and play classic). A fee price that hasn't changed in ~15 years. Can Netflix or Hulu say the same, or provide the same amount of entertainment value?
---
On top of that, you can pay 6 months in advanced and be paying $12.99/mo equivalent. The cost of what, 2 starbucks lattes a month? 1-2 hour minimum wage (depending on the state).
---
Get over it.
---
Similar story here, I was at my buddies house during wrath watching him play his Hunter, he got into a Malygos group and as soon as the whole group got there his mom called us for dinner. He panicked, I yelled ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not hungry, thanks though‚Äù he smiled and gave me a quick rundown on how to play hunter. When he came back the boss was on the last phase where you ride the dragons and he finished the boss and got a price of gear. Great times.
---
I disagree. Those are fun parts of the game sure, but flying does three things that (IMO) are detrimental to the health of a MMORPG. 
---
1. World feels tiny. Flight speed makes travel too fast.
---
2. World feels empty. Don't see shit heading anywhere. No random fights on the roads, no being careful not to pull mobs. No interaction. #boring
---
3. No community. Know what you don't need when you can just fly anywhere? People.
---
I'll repost my response here from a similar topic.
---
 To put it simply.

The proces of finding a group, proces of riding somewhere  finding old friends or enemies. When they implemented all those things  they thought they optimized the experience, but in reality they gave up  the element that made MMORPG an MMORPG.
---
This is why I hope they never add anything. It's polarizing. The #1 best thing about Classic will be the community... if you fragment that community, it'll all go to hell.
---
That's a good one as well and almost similar to what I had in mind. That's not it though, I figured it Football would be too common.
---
It's because Gnomes are ridiculous.
---
Process*** I‚Äôm sorry but 3 times is too many
---
MMO on console does't seem like a good idea, you know with the million keybinds and all.
---
Yes, because it's tech they already have that'll ensure a smooth launch for everyone and still give the "big" experience with loads of players everywhere.
---
Took me about 10 minutes to get from questing in silverpine to running Wailing Caverns last night.
---
I still have nightmares from 2006 when I crossed the river from Elwynn Forest to Dustwood when I saw a wolf with a fucking skull instead of a lvl displayed.
---
I think there is an AddOn that lets you play it with a controller.  I don't care how you play it.
---
Even though those are HIDEOUS, they still look great to me for some reason.
---
Fuck off, don't bloody respond after 4 months.
---
k
---
Well, since you're already expecting it, here's a downvote!
---
it will hit a million on twitch on launch no doubt
---
Well, I wouldn't call either way stupid.  However you said "less stupid" so you're also saying your own position is stupid, even if to a lesser degree.
---
Given you think your own position is stupid, I guess I don't have to respond to much here.
---
Think I should have splitted BRD?
---
you just did it twice
---
Misguided craving for nostalgia. It's not that you hate the random dungeon finder, you hate that you no longer have that wanders feeling of forming a group of dungeon people by the sweat of your brow.
---
Even though, you know, there was absolutely nothing stopping you from continuing to do that and just choosing not to use dungeon finder.
---
The number of people who find a kind of safe, comforting joy in being forced back into limitations is fascinating.
---
Most! thanks I will
---
I dunno why you you think I'm angry about this, all I said is that this garbage is awful and embarrassing. And I don't know what stance you're to take by telling me I'm not trying to "remedy the problem," I voiced my issues with the karma milking and you've been trying to shoot me down for it since
---
I dunno why you're this defensive over a bunch of bad memes or why you're trying so extraordinarily hard to own me on Reddit with these weird snarky replies
---
Why be an asshole? He's not saying they should make this change or even asking for it, just stating he wished meeting stones could summon. You know where else you saw that sentiment a lot? Playing vanilla. Vanilla WoW was far from flawless, it's fine to point out flaws, especially when you aren't even advocating for a change.
---
That's why they add both so all parties are happy. Just do vanilla to wrath hell go cata mop too and see if people will play. If not then close it.
---
Even has a banana for scale built in.  This was way ahead of its time
---
It doesn't matter how much you paid in the past, that money went to the ongoing development and server infrastructure/support costs.
---
Get over it. Go mow a lawn for someone.
---
Thanks, edited it.
---
Oh man, there's too many variations.
---
Jailbreak run for Alliance Ony Attunement is my least favorite in there because of how tedious it is.
---
Sweet, keep up the good work!
---
I came back to wow 10 years later and the dungeon finder is the most boring thing ever.
---
Yeah, I thought about that. And while there are some clever control schemes out there that can really boost the amount of actions a single button has access to (Radial menus come to mind) it isn't an ideal solution. That said, the Switch in Hand-held mode would at least have a bit of a better time with this due to having access to touch controls as well as the button combinations.
---
Yeah, I can understand why people would think that, it's just something I've taken for granted for awhile: having to walk to the dungeon is (for me) a defining characteristic of WoW. It blows my mind to see people who don't even realize that that was a thing. I don't mean to be disparaging; it is actually quite cool to know that there are people kicking around this sub waiting for classic that aren't P.Server mega-tryhards. It's just a weird perspective shift.
---
What video would that be? I only see speedruns
---
Thats what I was having trouble with were to draw the line exactly
---
Laptop
---
How would you handle all the keybinds? If you wanted just hook up a controler to a monitor and boom, there's your "console". 
---
Consoles are really just lowkey computers that hook up to TVs
---
Interesting. I wonder how it handles the ability hotkeys.
---
It is 8/8 bloodfang items:)
---
Yeah, sorry, I meant that LFD was present at some point in Wrath - I was just trying to point out that when LFD was first added (and even well into Cata and some MoP) the dungeons still required communication, you couldn‚Äôt just faceroll them with a bunch of randoms - people had to know what they were doing and you still NEEDED a full group to clear the dungeon. Now there‚Äôs no need to communicate or even know the mechanics because the game is so forgiving that you could ignore mechanics, stand in fire, not get healed and still survive. I noticed much less communication and effort as MoP went along and saw that it was completely absent when I resubbed for BFA. I played a resto druid in Cata and it was still very challenging queueing with randoms in LFD - we still wiped a lot had to regroup and rethink our strategy, and that was with RANDOM players - we had communication. That all went out the window when dungeon became time sinks that required no effort.
---
Not everyone is aiming to look fearful tho :p
---
From a purely min/maxing point of view gnomes are better for pvp than humans.
---
Got a chance to check this out this morning and it is a fantastic guide. I love the idea to incorporate alchemy, which is something I was thinking of doing when leveling my warrior as well, but I would have just done the naive approach of leveling it early on. 
---
I skipped around a little, and I noticed you use 1h/shield for a while after level 10. Is this just better for leveling in that level range or is it because the path you take doesn‚Äôt get you a good 2h weapon until later?
---
Yeah, I tought I lost mine, but then, 2 years ago someone uploaded my video, I have no idea why because I was just an unknown warlock lol. But It made me happy as hell
---
You are a capable a very 1v1er even with the raid SM/Ruin spec. 
---
But if you really want to make the enemy rogues cry themselves to sleep and make every ganker's life miserable, you could always switch specs to something like SLife+Fel Domination or just go full Soul Link.
---
Also it's not like Blizzard isnt selling you this same "skip everything" feature for 50$ anyway
---
Pants and belt don't look like Bloodfang, but I'm not sure what they are.
---
if you aren't making decisions based on how cool something looks or sounds, you are doing it wrong
---
Yeah its not bad at all. People are just really lazy. One of them even downvoted me LOL.
---
Like if you dont want to get your ass out to a 5 man promptly, go play warframe, destiny, BFA, or some other lobby based multiplayer game.
---
Yeah, a Laptop would work better in pretty much every situation, but there are plenty of people/kids out there that can't afford both a console and a laptop. I figured something like this would allow them to experience the game when they otherwise wouldn't be able to.
---
They shine a lot more in pvp during tbc arenas. In vanilla you usually have some friends there to get you out of snares / roots with freedom or dispels. A common partner is druid in 2v2 and they can't really help you there.
---
Listen to cragster he seen some shit
---
Hmm, maybe you're right. But I don't feel that world pvp need at 70 because we had arena. And I still ganked in goldshire and stv and occasional Outland world pvp (	at the Flying mount dailies, halaa etc) . It was still there just less at high level.
---
&gt; However I suspect that Classic will draw in a much larger crowd of casual players who won't roll based on whats optimal 
---
I mean, I hope that too. But if you look at the retail servers, its fairly common that the top players end up pulling alot of the community with them. They pick what is best, people follow cause they said so, then more casual play there cause there are more players, and if it gets bad enough horde players will reroll cause they are struggeling with finding people to play with.
---
If you use a mouse and keyboard I don't see the point of console beyond maybe letting those who don't have a PC still be able to play. That would be nice.
---
Supposedly some people do manage keybinds and stuff on gamepads, but it seems terribly inefficient and impractical to me. But with keyboard and mouse support I see no reason not to include the game on console beyond the cost of porting it to any given console. I don't see much reason to not do this beyond the simple cost involved in doing so and added support for console versions.
---
I've been saying for years that Blizzard's design style for endgame gear is fundamentally incompatable with Hunters. Endgame WoW gear has always been flashy and elaborate, but hunters are supposed to be rugged, muted, and wild. 
---
For that reason I always felt like hunters looked/felt the most like hunters in the level 30-40 range.
---
As I prepare myself mentally to read a children‚Äôs book, I decided to read one of your posts. 
---
After an hour or so, I just gave up. I have a superior intellect, but reading your posts just made my head hurt. The content was dull and clunky. The tone was asinine. 
---
I guess I‚Äôm just too used to reading children‚Äôs books to settle for an inferior post.
---
Generally the gist of nostalgia-fueled subs.
---
*ensures BFD and Mara are at the bottom*
---
Wow is the +5 weapon skill really that big of a deal? Like what is the DPS difference if I didn't have that when I PVE as a Gnome Warrior. I've never really thought about the threat factor either tbh. Is it such a big difference that a Gnome Warrior would not be accepted on a semi-casual but full clearing guild?
---
Not really since there‚Äôs a ton on horde..... and not having wotf makes that fight hard
---
"Get this blue set"
---
Looking at this picture squinting, pretty sure this set is brown... ohhhh I'm retarded.
---
As long as you had the ability to use mouse and keyboard, sure.
---
They are. Added some more pics in a new comment.
---
How would they do it though? Brand new server, your start from level one? Or add to classic server with an opt in?
---
If it's an opt in, your are splintering existing servers. If it's fresh, will people any to start from scratch? It doesn't work.
---
Nah, played FF11 on xbox 360 you just plug a keyboard in.
---
But yeah. true without a keyboard no.
---
Seems a little symbol-minded to say they are both not relevant AND would "represent a massive shift..."
---
Used em all the time in TBC, personally... Often to summon warlocks lol.
---
God I hope not.
---
Please stop making these threads
---
Every race runs at the same speed, but Gnomes are the smallest so their model moves faster than other races which makes it seem like you're moving faster. Seriously, went from playing a Tauren to a Gnome and it felt so freeing
---
I thought about this issue as well. Monster Hunter World comes to mind. A single button gives you access to up to 32 different actions via a customizable radial menu, and while it would definitely take some muscle memory to get down, just how many of those abilities would be in constant use? Otherwise, as stated in another post, the Switch's touch screen could supplement (Albiet Awkwardly) the gamepad controls for additional usability if needed.
---
Just scroll down a bit you'll see so much threads like this
---
Definitely not for the new generation especially with returning to IF for a couple quest progressions.
---
Last night on a vanilla server an impatient hunter ragequit after one wipe. Replaced with an oldie warrior who knew what he was in for and we banged out the quests one by one. Took forever!
---
Everytime someone asks for a release date, it gets delayed by a week.
---
How different in terms of tools, success etc are druid and warrior tanks? Do druids lack many options/buttons? Do they get other stuff in return?
---
You dont summon raids.. In classic WoW raids start in the capital (org/sw) for the Onyxia buff. Then you travel together to the raid to protect world buffs.
---
you obviously are not smart enough to use the search. let's hope you're smart enough to figure out how to download the game
---
But that one talentpoint after lvlup just felt amazing ;)
---
Was it possible for a Mage to fly up to the camper, dismount and do PoM Sheep into Slowfall to kill them with fall damage, or at least force them to the ground?
---
Okay I'll delete :(
---
Any change is too much
---
Entirely possible. As I said, I can probably justify paying that much drawn out, but I cannot justify forking over $200 all at once for a video game. I can do way more constructive things with that money right now around my property for example.
---
You're not getting me with some kind of tricky "gotcha". I know that paying monthly costs more in the long run. Literally everybody knows this.
---
But I will not drop a lump sum of $200 on any video game ever for any reason. That's about a year of subscription time, and I may or may not play that long, or may or may not play longer.
---
&gt; I dunno why you you think I'm angry about this
---
If you're not mad, then what's with the slew of insults and shit-talking?
---
&gt;"retail circlejerks"
---
&gt;"all this trash"

&gt;"to help you cope"
---
&gt;"this garbage is awful and embarrassing"
---
That's an awful lot of whining and bitching for someone who is "not angry".
---
:^)
---
Asmon...whatever his name is gets good viewers I thought
---
It removes the fear of being ganked and monster respawn. Also AoE farmers like mages, will abuse this to hell, especially in solo dungeons.
---
Look beyond the "QoL" part.
---
ffxiv works and has quite a lot of button bloat too.
---
I wish they did hearthstone on consoles. So if they haven‚Äôt bothered to create an interface for that I doubt they‚Äôll get around to it for WoW.
---
lol :D that made me laugh
---
FFXIV actually works great with a controller and plenty of people play on PS4.  You can get to all of your keybinds on controller just as easily on keyboard and FFXIV is a keyboard piano game so there is no lacking of keybinds.
---
That's possible but unlikely
---
Yeah, I know that the PS4 supports Keyboard (Not sure about mouse as I haven't tried it), and I think the Switch does too, beyond it's own build-in on-screen keyboard. Communication would be a bit tricky. There is only so many macro's that you can set up to talk with other people through.
---
Yup, here have my upvote.
---
Ah okay I see it better now. But for some reason I remembered the belt "for sure" having a that deep red color as well. Only Bloodfang piece I was missing in vanilla was the chest :(
---
I mean at that point what's the point of consoles :D 
---
But sure if that is the case then bring them along, more availability is always good.
---
I‚Äôm weirdly excited for dungeons to be like this again. I don‚Äôt mind downtime like that in games (if I have the time for it at least!) and retail‚Äôs dungeon finder makes dungeons so generic, no one talks or interacts just a nonstop run forward. 
---
Gonna help that I plan to go warlock so I‚Äôll have the summoning job haha

about 10% overall dps

I was having a discussion with some friends I'm rolling with in classic about this last night actually. We more or less agreed that BC was better in terms of game design, but there is a certain mystique and "feel" to classic that makes it great. At the same time it's harder to explain what made Vanilla great than it is to explain what made TBC great for me. That being said, I love both games and I don't know which one I would say is better personally.
---
Yeah, like I said I would frankly be shocked if this was ever something Blizz took seriously unless PC use started to plummet. And HS makes way more sense to put on consoles than a full-blown MMO.
---
It has a actual gameplay element to it, because it forces you to constantly be on your edge, as to what will respawn behind you. Obviously in Retail it does not matter if 10 mobs respawn as you can just maw them down Diablo style, but Classic was far more methodical.
---
Sure. Up until 2009, they used to release fresh new servers. New servers w/ new expansions would probably work best.
---
&gt;yes. but they can't take it away when its been around
---
Which is why a lot of retails flaws that were exposed later once implemented can never be taken back.
---
Imagine the backlash if flying got removed, even if zones were redone to fit ground mounts.
---
Same would go for LFR, portals everywhere (which has already happened) and a bunch of other things.
---
Not all of them, but they stacked up to horrifying height. That's why sometimes it's better to stop with expansions and patches and simply make a sequel.
---
Some times a developer should protect players from themselves, and blizzard spread too thin. Trying to make everyone happy, eventually backfires.
---
Self adhesive paper covered by a layer of matte laminate.
---
Not at all - they weren't relevant because they basically did nothing, if they suddenly are changed to what they ended up being that provides a huge QoL boost.  How is that not a massive difference? The repercussions of that are wide spread.
---
I find as long as the group kinda knows where to go it isnt that bad
---
Priest tier set robes are usually more elaborate then anything else.
---
Sounds like some pserver shit
---
Druid is actually the 2nd fastest leveling class (behind Hunter) because they have very little / no downtime.
---
Yeah, level 1-10 kinda sucks because you have no shapeshift so you have to just cast spells and whack things with your staff, but at level 10 you get bear, and at 20 you get cat, things just get better and better as you level.
---
Some for sure. Hopefully gatherer will be there.
---
Yeah, I feel like the control scheme is probably something of a Non-issue for the most part. In Monster Hunter World you can have access to 32 different actions with a single button, so with a bit of muscle memory, it's doable. And besides, just how many actions do people really use in their rotation? I've see so many videos about "Super simple Rotations" and stuff for Hunter and Mage (As an example) that only use like 2-3 abilities. So Idk, I think it's doable. Now, communication on the other hand would be a bit tricky, and navigating other interfaces could be a pain in the ass.
---
Absolutely. Respeccing completely changes how you play the class and talents allow fine-tuning.
---
What are we going to have in vanilla? Many classes have just a single viable spec, and hybrids with multiple specs still play 90% the same.
---
Vanilla talent trees only gave the illusion of choice, in reality the the talent respec cost pigeonholes you to a single playstyle, often times making you incapable of doing both PvP and pve practically
---
I'm a huge Warcraft fan. I didn't really care about any profits. I just love the universum.
---
Someone called me a "vanilla baby" because I forgot they didn't add summoning stones until BC. I started playing in 05'. Made me a little mad ngl
---
No indication on mobile that my results were actually submitted. I think I just wasted 5 minutes dragging with my fingers.
---
Good luck proposing any change.  No matter how small people will extrapolate it to it's worst possible effect.
---
That being said, there are ramifications of this as you can also easily exploit it to avoid having to go into dangerous locations to gather loot.  That might not be HUGE, but it's an obvious issue.
---
Oh, I aggree, people should be walking to dungeons.
---
Meeting stones shouldn't even exist in vanilla IMO lol, they are basically markers
---
i wish i had a brother
---
Really?
---
This is pure gold, love it :D
---
And good luck getting your group to make the 45 second run over to help you out. "Oh, you're getting ganked? Sucks... are you gonna be able to make it here or not? Cause I got a mage that wants to come."
---
Sitting on the couch.
---
Yes it was possible, for BC only I'm fairly sure though
---
Here I come Mr. Skin Yo Mobs!
---
AoE looting would make it much easier to steal skins from farmers.
---
Thanks for the reply! So maybe something like this: [https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sheets-Quality-Adhesive-Sticky-Printing/dp/B01N9PYOB6](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sheets-Quality-Adhesive-Sticky-Printing/dp/B01N9PYOB6) I should have thought to look for self adhesive paper!
---
but you must have a been an easy target while you were playing and focussed or did you knock him out for a few hours?
---
You'd have to keep dying a little closer to the instance portal every time, and eventually you'd make it so you can res on the border of the portal and run in before anything has time to react.
---
Ya, did you play during Vanilla?
---
Damn you Survey Monkey!
---
The number of "*small* gameplay change" suggestion posts is disturbing.
---
But TBC was even better than vanilla :(
---
Worst Druid ever!
---
&gt; classic connects you alot more to your character 
---
This was the most palpable thing about wow for me back in 2006-10.  Your character was indicative of your investment and when players saw that you put so much sweat into your character - they revered you as a competent player(given that you could play well ofc).  You were literally respected as an individual.  *because we all know im just a lonely nerd irl, and ill be alone forever.* 
---
I might be romanticizing the game a bit too much but what you just mentioned had a lot to do with why people were so addicted to that shit during that time.
---
The slow adding of QoL conveniences in WoW reminds me of the game Mother 3, where the town of Tazmily starts out as a rural, peaceful little town. Everyone cares about each other, and the concept of money doesn't even exist.
---
As the story progresses, money as a concept becomes a thing. Little quality of life things like "happy boxes" (tv's) and modern commodities become abundant, and Tazmily becomes a city instead of a town. People start caring more about themselves and less about each other. Before you know it, Tazmily has lots all of its identity. Everyone eventually moves to New Pork City, leaving it as a ghosttown.
---
Perhaps this is an extreme example, but it's a nice parallel example to stuff that happens too often in MMORPGs and other games. You see QoL things happen over time, and before you know it, they all add up to an unsatisfying experience. I'm not opposed to QoL things that are small, but obviously impactful QoL changes are not good.
---
For whatever reason I'm remembering running into the instance in ghost form but it must just be after a wipe.
---
Escape artist vs orcish stun resist is a close race, but escape artist sure is good.
---
Thanks, I only played BC for a few weeks before losing interest and didn't play a Mage at the time. It's something I always wondered about though.
---
Flying killed a lot of the game? I mean it wasn't the best thing for the game but saying it killed a lot of the game is definitely an exaggeration.
---
Yes there were. But it was the hardest setup for the druid, who could choose a warlock or warrior to faceroll with.
---
But if the hunter was amazing, the setup was really OP and had little (if any) counters.
---
So you say his opinion is wrong but technically someone else's isnt? No "good luck's\* here, just tunnel vision.
---
Please stop misusing the word "phasing".  Even the Blizzard Devs told you to stop.
---
They suggested we'll have "Sharding".  Phasing will not exist in classic.
---
Dungeons really aren't that great for exp anyways, you only want to do them for quests and only when you have all of them. Running them repeatedly with no quests is not as efficient as just doing quests. So ideally everyone you group up with is hopefully in the same zone so the run dosen't take long.
---
Going on a pserver now would be like waiting for a new ping-pong ball and using a plastic christmas tree decoration instead while you wait.
---
I like the celebratory vibe. Early wow was important for many. Consuming even.
---
leterally chills
---
This isnt necessarily true.  You'll still have to buy BfA if you dont have it.  As I understand it you'll need the most current version of the game to play a classic server right?
---
Id love to be wrong here.
---
The reason why retail has issues with player retention is it lacks delayed gratification. Vanilla was the epitome of delayed gratification. As a player leveling, you longed for the day you could have blue/epic gear and a mount. Then at max level you set out goals to get tier gear to look badass. And because so few players actually achieved these goals, the majority of the player base had to keep going to achieve that sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. 
---
The modern game throws quick leveling, gear, mounts and achievements to you like Christmas, which causes players to not have the larger sense of gratification. The first time this happened to me was WotLK when progressing through ICC. Killed LK on 10 man normal, then 25 man normal, then 10 man heroic. I was so sick of killing the LK just to get the same multi-colored tier-set that I burned out and didn't complete 25 man heroic with the guild. Killing the LK was epic. Killing him on a 3rd difficulty/raid size...not as much gratification.
---
Flying also made the world feel much smaller, and caused people to interact less (even on pve servers).
---
Haha, bad advice which nobody follows. You do you, though. Just don't be surprised if you are the only one meeting in Crossroads and everybody else is in WC already.
---
What class should I be?
---
......ok, guy.  You got yourself.  I just asked a couple simple questions.
---
It would probably work fine.  I think it would likely work better for vanilla.
---
The main problem is that nothing in the UI was designed for console/gamepad play.  So the entire UI would need to be redone.
---
The bigger issue also would be addons for console.  Playing without addons feels like torture a little.
---
It might work. Consider making a regular box with thick paper (my box is very stiff. I used the same paper I used for cards - 1,5mm) and then cover it with self adhesive paper. However bear in mind that I had it printed on regular paper and THEN it was covered with laminate.
---
For the Shadow Priest talent Shadow Focus 5/5 reduces the target's chance to resist your shadow spells by 10%. How is that calculated? That doesn't mean 10% more hit - but let's say a boss has a 17% chance to resist spells at level 60. Does that mean it would now be a 15.3% at 60 instead? or how does that talent work?
---
Running through feralas for some quest i dont remember when it started raining. Hard. And i stopped and waited under a tree. Whole place was this gloomy and greenish feel. I wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be in feralas. Just running through to get somewhere. Spent about 15 minutes admiring the rain though lol.
---
And 90% of these warriors will never hit level 40, so don't base any type of reality off of nostalgic giddy survey answers
---
I'll be rolling a gnome warrior :)
---
BRD was my favorite. BFD or Stocks would be my least favorite.
---
Some of us, maybe many of us crave a feeling of adventure. I'm used to older MMORPGs like Ultima and Runescape, which make Classic WoW look like a cakewalk by comparison.
---
I enjoy the process of finding a group. Giving everyone the option to use a dungeon/raid finder makes it so that nobody wants to group up anymore. Sure, you could try and form a group yourself in that environment, but everyone in chat will just say "lol, use raid finder".
---
Also, forced limitations breed creativity. You have to decide what is the best way to move from point A to point B, considering any chokepoints on the way such as "will the enemy faction be in large numbers on the way?" You might even make it there and the enemy faction is waiting, which results in a massive PvP battle before your raid starts. That's emergent gameplay! That shit is fun.
---
That mage better be fucking pro, because he still has to get through the gank squad.
---
That place... it scares me.
---
It's a hugely awesome thing for PvE, really made some awesome worlds and secrets..and I get it kinda stinks for world pvp, but I wouldn't trade it for better wpvp, I think flying just brings too much to the table to care about some dude swooping down on me
---
Well yea but lfg was actually global
---
**&lt;Ascendance&gt;,** ***casual/Semi-Hardcore Raid guild \[PvP\].***
---
**Region**: EU
---
**Server**: TBA, PvP
---
**Faction**: Alliance
---
**Raid schedule**: Tuesday &amp; Sunday 20:00 ‚Äì 24:00 CEST
---
**Loot rules**: DKP
---
**About us:**
---
We are a group of vanilla veterans that have many years of experience raiding who are eager to return to the classic days. You can rest assured; we expect to farm Onyxia, Ragnaros and Nefarian yet again.
---
As the guild recruitment market is saturated with semi-hardcore and hardcore guilds. We aim to reach the more balanced segment, somewhere between casual and semi-hardcore. We do not expect any world first kills nor do we intend to reach the sky on damage parses. We do however take our raiding seriously and do not intend to accept continuous wipe nights due to someone not committed to studying the tactics required. As such, we are looking for people who are passionate and willing to help securing the guilds success. 
---
In addition, some of our members have a lot of PvP experience both from vanilla and in later expansions, achieving high PvP ranks and 2200 arena ratings. This also means that, apart from raiding, most will also have a healthy interest in PvP and as such, if you have an interest, you will find plenty of guildies to share it with.
---
Should your interest purely be social or completely PvP related, you are welcome as well. 
---
**What we expect**:
---
* You to play your class well and have knowledge of the various boss / trash mechanics.
---
* High raid attendance.
---
* Be on time for raids (at raid location at/before scheduled time) \[DKP on time bonus\]
---
* Positive outlook and a friendly behavior towards your fellow guildie.
---
**What we do not expect**:
---
* We do not expect our members to spend exuberant amount of hours on world buffs or consumables before every raid, but we do expect people to be prepared with what would be considered reasonable. (e.g. Healing Potions, Mana Potions, fire protection potions, bandages, soul shards, Symbols of divinity, arrows etc.).
---
* That you play the perfect raid spec down to the last point. This means that we do not expect SM Ruin warlocks to respec if there is not enough debuff slots for corruption. We do not expect every hunter to have true shot aura if your PvP activities require you to have scatter/intim. We do, however, not allow specs that break the debuff limit. This means we do not allow warriors to have deep wounds for example. (For a more case-to-case example, ask an officer or GM)
---
**What our progression roadmap looks like**:
---
* Leveling (Launch + 4 ‚Äì 6 weeks)
---
* Attunements (Week 6-7)
---
* Onyxia &amp; Molten Core (Week 8)
---
* ZG, BWL, AQ, Naxx (TBD)
---
We are well aware, that we are ambitious when it comes to the roadmap. We do however think it‚Äôs important to clarify what our dream scenario is. Naturally, we need a certain amount of people before we can start raiding and as there are some uncertainties when it comes to experience gain, the roadmap might be subject to change/postpone. We will however start raiding as soon as member count allows it.

What's the best &lt;class|profession|race&gt; for the &lt;easiest|fastest&gt; &lt;leveling|grouping|money&gt; ?
---
Agreed
---
Sadly that was the only way to get world PvP encounters, everyone else was flying safely so the few who dared to land became the victims.
---
The flying mount was a lose/lose feature, it trivialised the world and marginalised world interaction, a truly huge WoW design mistake if there ever was one.
---
I'd rather the sub be dedicated to news and discussion, and ideally the memes that'll inevitably be posted could be a tad more inspired than Carl Johnson walking into Stranglethorn. And yes you can type those words without being angry lmao. It's like watching a funny bad movie or an embarrassing video, you say "that was fucking terrible" afterward but it's not because you're angry about it, it was just fucking terrible. I'm really giving someone a lesson in basic human emotions...
---
Hopefully that's good enough, though I know it won't be since I didn't admit total defeat by your superior Redditor intellect and you'll be right back to making embarrassing replies trying very hard to sound clever. So I'm gonna bow out, you're bent way out of shape over this and it's clear now that you just want a pissing contest
---
I mean let's not be ridiculous. The added couple seconds on AoE loot is nothing compared to downtime, respawn time, and instance lock for AoE farmers. "Abused" is about three degrees too strong of a term for AoE loot. It doesn't remove the fear of being ganked, 90%+ of people looting in the open world will be totally unaffected by AoE loot because people are grinding one mob at a time.
---
Let's not try to trick ourselves into thinking every QoL change is going to be a pivotal change in the gameplay, and treat them like they really are: the slippery slope fallacy. I'm on board with just saying no to a lot of these changes, don't get me wrong, but I'm not going to pretend that things like AH improvements, AoE loot, revamped mailboxes, etc. are going to ruin classic and turn it into BFA.
---
The real argument against these features is that we've seen what blizz does with "QoL improvements", with things like LFG, raid finder, personal loot, and XP per level reductions. We don't want those, so it's easier and safer to put a blanket #nochanges over everything since we know it's a fine game as is. I'll take it, warts and all, over what have seen it become.
---
You can move your pawns in chess as if they were queens, but then what would the point be?
---
Impossible there are too many spells in classic.
---
Everyone on ground mounts. No instant dungeons.
---
You use a lot more in PvP than in PvE for the most part.
---
Yep, that's definitely something I noticed between vanilla and retail. In retail, if a pug raid wiped ONE TIME, half the fucking group would leave, since you can just pop open the cross-realm group finder and find another group instantly.
---
But in vanilla, it takes time to find people for a group, and then more time just to make it over to the dungeon. You're not going to ragequit after a single wipe because then you're going to have to wait another 30+ minutes before you can find another group.
---
Yeah I don't know man but for some reason they kept up belt shinies. It's on of the big turn offs from retail currently.
---
Raids are boring, but the rest of the game is slow paced enough to allow for good interaction from the streamer. I think it has potential.
---
No pathfinder bs.
---
There are so few good axes at max level besides a few exceptions that sword spec ends up being a lot more value. Especially if you manage to get one of the holy grail weapons, like a raid final boss sword or a legendary or something, being human is a great feeling because sowrd + mace spec applies to like 10x the good weapons that axe spec does.
---
Axe spec in tree is great for leveling though because crit is just an amazing leveling stat and there are a lot of them
---
That's not what I said but ok. Raiders will care when the server is overrun with the opposite faction, and they cant farm mats. And they can blame themselves for every red name they failed to smash on their way to 60.
---
1. It Would be a huge detriment to Classic if people like them streamed it. They need to stay in BfA for the good of the game.  
---
2. Not really, unless they usually play MMOs on their variety streams. Variety streamers tend to (afaik) go between several real popular multiplayer and newer single player games and would likely shy away from Classic due to it being a lot slower paced than most games nowadays. Maybe one or two streams at the most before dropping it, but I do kind of doubt that.  
---
3. We don‚Äôt know that for sure, especially since a lot of those Big streamers that play other games probably have a decent idea of what their audience likes and what keeps them coming back. If they don‚Äôt think Classic is it, then they likely won‚Äôt keep streaming.  
---
Honestly though, if Classic lacks a major streaming presence then it won‚Äôt be the end of the world. I think the whole notion that it needs a ton of popular streamers to do well is pretty absurd. It will survive without them... heck, it would probably do better without them.
---
\#nochanges, BUT...
---
This level of minmaxing hurts me in the nostalgia.
---
It sucks that people are so worried about how much this or that racial will MARGINALLY atfect their experience that they're not choosing what they would like to be, but what mechanically is 'best'.
---
Though i suppose some people are only satisfied by being mechanically 'the best'.  Nothing inherently wrong with it, just baffles me.
---
Im going to have to get used to seeing a Lot more dwarven priests than before.  Back in vanilla it wasnt a big deal that fear ward was a thing, and now its the minmax standard.
---
Hopefully the game still ends up the same experience as before and it isnt all speedrunning and whatnot
---
I thought it was 10 dollars a month for classic only sub. Did they change this or am I just wrong?
---
This rarely / never happened, at least in my experience. Even playing on PvP servers with 10-12k online, I never had any issues getting to the instance, even SFK or SM where you have to travel through multiple horde-infested zones just to get to the dungeon.
---
The chances of running into a "gank group" that are going to sit there and corpse camp you endlessly are slim to none. Even so, you can just spirit rez and go around them.
---
I'm sorry you had to go through that.
---
I love gnome warriors, im honoustly suprised this is the case
---
It's why classic is becoming a thing. Too many changes, and Blizzard has to ask itself and Activision how they could possibly hope to keep attracting new WoW players to an ever increasing catalogue of bulging content. If the veterans at Blizzard aren't sick to death of retail WoW by this point I would be surprised. Constant gymnastics to think up fresh ideas, on top of streamlining for newer, younger, more impatient players all the time. It's why I think Classic will be the last hurrah for the franchise. We may get more expansions, but WoW is well into the Golden years. It's about getting the last dollars out before they have to finally move on to something worth the resources that the world's largest MMO has required for almost 20 years.
---
Fair enough. Undead with WotF are really hard to deal with, but on the bright side in BGs you don't have to go up against paladins that will cleanse your fears and DoTs. Being alliance warlock in world PvP is a pretty huge disadvantage, but for PUGing BGs it's a disadvantage but not a huge deal.
---
Not applicable because the game of chess is stagnant, pawns were always pawns and queens were always Queens
---
Yeah, that is true. You definitely need to be adaptable, but there are still work-arounds for those dedicated to it. And if there were console-only servers (Not ideal but hey, since I'm already throwing myself under the buss here why not), everyone would, for the most part, be on a level playing field.
---
One of the few changes classic should have IMO
---
I think you didn't play vanilla, defending AoE loot clearly shows this. 
---
Anyway, what makes you think that your idea of change is fine and Jon's idea is wrong? That slippery slope is not something you are going to disprove because you feel that your ideas are superior to anyone else's.
---
Do you think that they‚Äôll roll out the ‚Äúvanilla‚Äù versions of the other expansions every few years, basically like a rerelease of WoW but you don‚Äôt have to move onto Cata if WotLK is the game you want to play. I‚Äôd like that a lot if they did. I was a dumb kid when I started playing so it wasn‚Äôt until Cata when I truly knew how to play the game well at an endgame level. I‚Äôd love to go back to that.
---
...is it that hard to use your words and say in party chat "meet at (town)" ?
---
I wouldn't mind if console players could also enjoy the awesome world of Azeroth.
---
You were never intended to beat Stitches at the level he's summoned.
---
There is no puzzle here o.O
---
Classic has me seriously considering making a Felheart or Herod (don't need to sew a robe if you're shirtless) cosplay. Nemesis was always my favorite tier set, but [Monemon's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFY6Xjmy_04) will always be the best looking cosplay of that set.
---
I said none of that.
---
This sub is filled with people suggesting changes.  I think it's interesting to ponder many of them, but when you have the same things posted over and over it only reinforces the "No Changes" attitude that is so rampant here.  Likewise, some changes do actually have pretty clear drawbacks and/or introduce a lot of the "Slipper slope" as far as QoL.  It's possible to both agree to disagree yet still respect what somebody is saying, it's just in this instance I think it's in vain.
---
I wonder what the other 75% of the players in classic will use as their excuse to play a rogue.
---
Having similar discussions at different times is not a bad thing. There are tens of thousands subscribed to this subreddit, getting different perspectives and answers to even the exact same question is preferable to low effort "lol retail sucks" memes all day every day
---
50 people per starting zone is fine, there are that many at peak times on N*dale. It's when it gets to 100+ that things get hairy.
---
If classic is a success I think certainly we'll get BC and LK. If not ,then classic servers will probably be left to rot.
---
Also, can we not have the discussion about flying yet again? Both expansions were built with flying in mind, no point discussing this.
---
Communicating via an on-screen isn't good enough. Talking to other people is the killer feature of the game, crippeling that would be fatale.
---
Might as well play one of the other thousands of solo RPGs that are out there.
---
Now I'm sure you could reengineer the game and make something very interesting with proximity voice chat, but that might be a to "in your face" kind of interaction.
---
Just wondering, but how many spells is too many? I don't want to sound like a broken record but through the use of Radial menus, you can have near-instant access to quite a few different unique actions. Monster Hunter World allows for 32 actions via a single radial menu interface accessible with a single button and navigable with the D-pad and a Joystick.
---
I've been waiting for a console MMORPG similar to WoW for ages.  I've tried some (Elder Scrolls Online, FallOut 76, and even Sea of Thieves).. nothing has really grabbed me the way that WoW has.  I know some folks commenting here mentioned that there are too many keybinds but I disagree, I think an MMORPG similar to WoW could work on the console controller.  It'd just take some good UI / game play design.
---
What does being stagnant have to do with the pros/cons of limitations?
---
&gt; I'd rather the sub be dedicated to news and discussion
---
And as people already said, every blue post so far has been discussed to death, and there is no more "news" at the moment; we're waiting for more.
---
&gt;Hopefully that's good enough, though I know it won't be since I didn't admit total defeat by your superior Redditor intellect and you'll be right back to making embarrassing replies trying very hard to sound clever. So I'm gonna bow out, you're bent way out of shape over this and it's clear now that you just want a pissing contest
---
"haha ur dum I'm leaving xd xd"
---
Bye Felicia.
---
Its just that post vanilla items are shit. So everyone wants to look like vanilla - u need transmog.
---
It most definitely won't. You might get that impression by being glued to the hype-fest orchestrated here and other forums, but as much as I love Classic WoW, it won't pull out the big numbers on Twitch.
---
Your spell hit chance against bosses will be 7% if you have 5/5 shadow focus. There's a minimum resist chance of 1% that can't be avoided, so having 5/5 shadow focus you will still be resisted by mobs your level even though they only have a 4% base resist chance against you.
---
Kneecapper and Anklebiter are also common shortwarr names.
---
Yea it takes ages to loot a big pack of mobs you aoe'd and that is fair because you are farming. It slows down the process and thats besides the point, youre most likely looting while waiting for the mobs to respawn, anyway.
---
Tbh I prefer a subscription. That said, if I sub at 15 a month and wow runs for 2.5 years, I‚Äôd pay $450 for it up front. 
---
Servers have a real cost, around a million a month or more. I dunno I do not have any problem paying to keep servers running, with low ping, less bots/farmers, content like quests working properly, and a general sense of civility vastly improved from the pserver /world chat.
---
i couldnt shield myself from the hype, so i said to myself 2 weeks ago, lets juts try for short time class and style i never played, so i chose druid and thought i will try to tank deadmines and then i stop...... i m closing now to level 40, with enough money for mount and its very hard to not log in.... damn this game
---
I remember summoning people with the meeting stones too. I ran a LOT of RFD back in the day and this was how I remember getting stragglers that were still in the eastern kingdoms to the dungeon entrance.
---
Did you even read my post? I'm against AoE loot. I played in classic, and every expansion since except BfA. I also didn't recommend any other changes, and explicitly stated I was fine with #nochanges because we don't trust blizz.
---
I'm just not deluded enough to think that AoE loot is going to be gamebreaking, and craft nonsense arguments for why I don't want it.
---
Everyone else has given you good answers, so I'll chime in with this:
---
your friend is right.  Horde is better.  Lok'tar ogar brother!  FOR THE HORDE!!!!
---
they have no fucking clue lol
---
vanilla will have more ppl playing than retail
---
rs is a perfect example
---
I'll go. Eredar, 2005. I personally was a super noob to wow, computer gaming, MMOs, all of it. Prior to Wow my computer gaming experience was Doom, Wolfenstein, skifree, simtower. So obviously, wow to me was akin to the first sexual experience. It was amazing, eye opening, life changing. It really made me question all that I previously thought to be true. 
---
My story: Was a 58 paladin just after WSG was released. I wanted to check it out and when it launched, it was lvl 51-60 I think. So after hauling it all the way to ashenvale, I finally got in a game. I get in and no one would invite me(back then it wasn't auto-grouped) cuz I wasn't 60. 
---
We had this warrior named Dingle on our server and I think he was Field Marshal at the time, maybe already GM. He goes, "na it's cool invite the paladin. He will be my pocket healer." We proceed to get rolled by the horde as usual, but we personally do okay and get a bunch of HKs. 
---
After the game, he invites me to his group and we roll down to Felwood and he tells me to start tagging mobs. I was very confused as I was a super noob. but he proceeded to kill the mobs I tagged, thus introducing me to power leveling. I was actually speechless as this guy who was very well known on our server, almost God like, goes out of his way to help a noob like me. 
---
It was amazing to me and I never forgot that. As time went on, I became less of a noob and eventually mastered the game. I had mutiple characters with max gold, but I never forgot the lesson I learned from Dingle. 
---
For the rest of my time in wow, I would always help lowbies and answer questions in /general. I would even hang out in Goldshire and give new toons large amounts of gold, pots, etc. It was awesome and felt good. 
---
I bet Dingle doesn't even remember our exchange but what he did caused me to be a friendlier gaming and helped countless people on the server. 
---
I remember maybe a year later I saw him in IF and I /waved. He was standing on the bridge between the AH and Bank, he didn't move but proceeded to /nod like the absolute badass he was. 
---
Cheers to Dingle, the Eredar Warrior.üëç
---
For me BRD easily stands out as my favorite dungeon.  Completing it just felt so epic.
---
The Switch gives access to a Full keyboard usable via touch-screen when in handheld mode, and PS4's at least allow you to connect a USB keyboard (If you want) so while not ideal, it's possible. And as stated elsewhere, other MMO's have seen at least some success via Console releases. I'm seeing a lot of people here talking about how FF14 is pretty good on consoles, as an example.
---
I doubt it will become more popular than retail :P But it would be really fucking cool if that happened.
---
"So I know I never played the game originally, but let me tell you how my personal QOL change won't change how the game was originally played" /post
---
I like that they used a Gamecube controller, clearly a man of good tastes.
---
Wann ist invite to Bolten Moar.
---
Roughly 20% of the player base
---
No changes
---
Because the idea of pros and cons of limitations do not take into account the inevitable fact of burnout, deriving less enjoyment from a thing, experiencing a new part of a new expansion that changes the game, and that changes exciting and fun, but the more you experience future expansions and you experience those changes to the game you know, the less fun each of them gives you because of diminishing returns. Because of burnout. And eventually you don't want to play the game anymore, and you wish you could go back to the beginning and experience it all again.
---
Even though you know it won't be exactly the same. You are willing to accept the lesser amount of Joy because you still feel like it will be much more than you are feeling in the current version of the game. Congratulations, you are now at the very beginning of what I like to call the private server play play play a replay replay replay wring every ounce of fun out of the same content cycle.
---
But yeah, chess is too simple and analogy for comparing vanilla with future expansions and choosing to impose your own limitations.
---
You can already manage pretty well using a Steam Controller, assuming you have a PC to play on.  You can ser numerous bindings/contexts so that you can have just as much bound as with a keyboard.  The drawback is it‚Äôll require more combinations (button1 + button2) and it‚Äôll always be a little more awkward for micro movements.
---
If I remember correctly everyone usually needs recipes/mats, but really it's up to the group. If someone can actually use a recipe then often the group will decide to just give it to that person, so I guess there's no set rules, but pretty easy to figure out by asking the group
---
Or what about Twink gear, I assume it's OK to need on twink BoE, since they should only be sold or saved for Twink alts. Even though needing is probably the right thing, I still feel people would think you're ninja looting.
---
Need: Main spec gear. BoE items other players needed on and won't use. Recipes I have the profession for and don't have yet. Offspec gear that no one else in the group needs for their main spec.
---
Greed: Everything else.
---
You didn't happen to play on Smolderthorn?
---
I agree. When I was a kid, the biggest barrier to entry for WoW, other than the subscription, was the fact that I didn't have a computer good enough to run it properly without some issues. I know there are kids out there today that would enjoy the WoW experience if given the chance, but they, similarly, are not able to because they only have access to Consoles or Phones.
---
I mean, I hate to bring up the "F" word, but one of the reasons why Fortnight got so popular was because every single console, even mobile phones, got it, so the barrier to entry was significantly reduced for those kids.
---
The server having an actual community
---
Wow was #1 when BfA launched, it's guaranteed to happen for a few days once Classic launches, and then it will slowly bleed viewers as the bandwagoners go back to their normal games.
---
Druids lack blocking which is in my knowledge their biggest weakness considering tanking. Druids do have a lot of armor but blocking is just very good mechanic. If you are not minmaxing and unoptimal way of live does not make you sad, just go for it.
---
You need when you have the right on the item. If you don‚Äôt you just greed or ignore if you don‚Äôt want it
---
Okay yes, no changes. However, in this one instance, I think it should be okay, right?
---
First toon ever as a noobie 11 year old was a Human Paladin on my brothers account (too young to have my own). I played until I finished the starter zone, and grabbed the quest to leave. Got kicked off the computer logging out to a bright, beautiful sunny Northshire Abbey.
---
Woke up at 3 something in the morning and snuck onto the computer to keep playing... On my way to Goldshire, in the dark vanilla nights, it was that heavy rain. Was so ominious but Goldshire coming into view through the rain was a sight to behold. 
---
One of my earliest, and fondest memories of wow. I died in the Kobold Mine many times shortly after. Good times.
---
I was so hyped when I heard flying was coming to WoW, and i remember seeing my first flying mount when I was in hellfire penninsula at the alliance base. It was a real wow moment for me. Then I got one, I was stuck with shitty 60% speed for the entirety of my time with TBC because the fast mounts were quite hard to get. I really remember wishing the blue mounts were atleast 100% because I ended up staying on my ground mount for most of my travels until I needed to fly to avoid mobs or over terrain.
---
Thing is, this really made me realize that having them be slower was a good move. Because it did incentivize people to stay on the ground a bit. Though most people didn't and you'd barely ever be able to run into people traveling from A to B, you'd see them at A and B, but almost never in-between. Really ruined the game for me, I quit a few days into WoTLK, because of how the game seemed to be changing to revolve around arena in terms of class design and the game not feeling big anymore as flying mounts destroyed it.
---
If it's a BOE that's actually worth something, then everyone should always need on it.
---
If it's BOP or a cheap BOE then whoever has any use for it should take it.
---
God i hope they stay as far away from Classic as possible.
---
I don't see the relevance of your question.
---
The point is that skills and talents were completely reconfigured, as well as professions.
---
The classes didn't work the same, HOTs and DOTs changed completely, multiple major mechanics were altered fundamentally from Vanilla, so it wasn't Vanilla, not even technically.
---
You probably want to replace mitigation neck/cape/rings/trinkets or whatever slots don't break your armor set bonus first.
---
Both T1&amp;T2 sets have bonuses that increase threat, so hanging onto those would work well.
---
AQ40 gear is a good mix of both.
---
This is just from the last two months, should keep you busy for a while.

Honestly just read the room is all. If you have someone like a Furry Warrior or something, and you are a paladin healing but normally run around as a ret, maybe think to not need on an pbvs upgrade for the war. On the other hand, if there isnt a "clear" sucession of the item, dont feel bad about needing for a spec you are leveling with (feral gear if you are currently healing in the dngeon grp etc)

The general rule of thumb was to need if you were going to soulbind it or learn it. Greed was for passive items like crap greens, or sellable rares that a party knew would be worth money. Sometimes you'd establish to need on all blue or purple boes so there could be no dissent among who got it, because good people would greed on them and just lose them to a ninja who needed and then jumped out of group. 
---
I would establish at the beginning of a run how you intend to roll for items. Most will be common sense, but those rare items will cause trouble if you don't communicate.
---
What is it about the term "unchanged game experience" you find hard to understand?
---
No worries mate, it didnt embaress me but you might put yourself in the crosshairs of someone much worse than me pointing it out :)
---
Yeah just like any other MMOs launch in history. Besides all these arguments are based on the assumption that sharding will ensure a smooth launch.
---
I mean wouldn‚Äôt classic be better with flying mounts and some sort of UI that could form a group of players that is looking to do the same dungeon? And the world is pretty big maybe it could also teleport you to the dungeon to cut down on time wasted?
---
for those who don't play WoW currently, how it is now with rep/quest/achievent gated flying:
---
everyone grinds for flying, and it takes so long that once you finally get it you're like, "meh, I've already done everything? what's the point of flying around when there's nothing left to do? *unsubs until next major patch or next expansion*
---
Having oblivious idiots sounds nice so i can feel smarter than i actually am
---
Nah whoever lost just went on the PS2 and played soul calibur
---
And the dwarve joke :)
---
Greed everything that you will not be equipping immediately, need all BOE items.
---
I‚Äôll be waiting for you, friendo
---
Sharding doesn't guarantee a smooth launch but it definitely makes it far more likely by eliminating starter zone overpopulation as an issue.
---
I stopped because you split up Mara. Okay I‚Äôll go back and do it
---
In what context?  Like pre dire maul or just straight up wrong
---
&gt; Imagine the backlash if flying got removed, even if zones were redone to fit ground mounts.
---
Blizzard won't even design zones with ground mounts in mind despite that zone not getting flying for over a year much less being willing to go back later and fix the mistakes. I understand designing zones is hard but so many zones made me go what in the hell? Who designed this? Was this actually play tested at all? Not only because of mob density but other reasons. It is the same with certain cities/towns such as Ashran.
---
All those things you mentioned are actual instances of "you think you do but you don't" because they degrade the overall experience in the end.  For some you had to live through them to really get that.
---
One modern convenience I really love is aoe looting.  Having to spend a minute looting 30 lowbie mobs for cloth was just ridiculous and added nothing of value to the game.
---
There is also a lot of history involved here. You can't really call the slippery slope a fallacy in this case for 2 reasons: 
---
1. This community is predominately made up of people who spent 5-10 years watching WoW slowly morph from something they loved into something they hated. This change was not immediate, it was a death by a thousand cuts. Casual players and people who wanted easier more accessible content spouted "this one change won't make a difference" and they were right. But they did it over, and over again until we got BFA. While this doesn't necessarily have any bearing on the quality of the changes being proposed now, it *does* explain the communities hesitation to allow changes on principle, and their sometimes aggressive defense of #nochanges.
---
2. There are thousands of people in this community, and most people have 1-2 things they would change about vanilla WoW. However what those things are varies from person to person. If I like flying mounts, and you like RDF, and Tim the Mage likes sharding, and we all make our "one tiny change" we suddenly legitimately do wind up far closer to BFA than anyone is comfortable with.
---
The slippery slope fallacy only means that the potential for future changes shouldn't have any bearing on discussions of current changes. It does *not* mean that you cannot look at things holistically.
---
No, not the PvP nor the food and water nor the portals nor the LFM RDPS Pref Mage spams
---
It means that you won‚Äôt play with lazy people. When people can put zero effort into getting there, they aren‚Äôt invested. And when they‚Äôre not invested, they could bow out after one or two wipes and just quit. The run is a barrier to entry that eliminates some people.
---
I would rather fight t16 than a rogue with defias leather at the same level
---
Guilty as charged.
---
I liked flying mounts. I LOOOOVED dual spec. I really liked Heirlooms.
---
And as much as it shames me to admit this, but...I really enjoyed LFD when it came out, mostly because I was alting heavily in WotLk, and most of my alts were either tanks or healers.
---
The reason why I liked all these things: Because at the time I couldn't see how they were slowly combining to destroying the game I loved. I was too invested in my guild, raids and the community directly around me, to really notice the slow erosion of it all.
---
Once I DID realize it, which was in mid Cata, it was too late.
---
Yes I did. How is this relevant?
---
but imagine Escape Artist AND imp. Sprint! Its like trying to stop chucky from stabbing you lol
---
This is why I‚Äôm a mage. Can get everywhere fast
---
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy, but I don't like respec costs. Dual specs maybe?
---
lol yeah or that viewpoint
---
How absurd
---
Only because they are too lazy to design landscape well enough for fly mounts as they did in TBC and Wrath.
---
I never understood why people want to hog exclusive items, its almost like you all want it as a status symbol, why not let everyone feel happy and cool looking?  All the gear that can be transmogged is outdated gear anyways.  And you all still have you "leet status symbol gear now"  Just do mythic dazzarlor and cop the top level stuff.  Most casual players won't have it and you can strut around feeling good about yourself then.
---
Rule of thumb when playing with people you don't know. Need, always. There will always be that one person who just wants to sell it and need on it.
---
I remember running alts through dungeons because I knew the actual drop tables for the bosses and what I wanted from them.  I resubbed to retail recently just to see how it was.  It's blues and purples everywhere and it's impossible to keep up with.
---
It's definitely something. I was just thinking and on my priest I probably had somewhere between 30 to 40 epics total during vanilla and some of those were resistance gear. In retail I probably dismantled 30 to 40 epics a week. I haven't played retail in several months and I can't name a single item I'm using. Not even if I looked at my character.
---
Even on a single realm, dungeon queue results in no need to communicate, no initial travel investment that solidifies groups, etc. Totally different dynamic as a result.
---
Oh u mean just how suddenly everybody raided AQ40 and Naxx back in vanilla?
---
Joke is, im suprised if even half of this subreddit actually played back in Vanilla.
---
I tried to login and get my old videos but they weren‚Äôt up there anymore :( is there a trick I need to do to get them from them?
---
Flip a coin
---
That would look like ninja tactics. I wouldn't do it.
---
Or very few hahaha
---
On nostalrius we waited like 7months for the first maladath to drop
---
Appreciate all of the feedback!  Especially since the itemization in vanilla is so different than it is in live.  Just want to be a good server community member when it finally releases
---
Warlock - Edgelord mage
---
Druid - Hippie priest
---
Good luck to you friend
---
Correct. You can summon people within the same instance as you, but you can't summon a party member from the world into your instance.
---
Of course you'd reply the very second I delete the comment, lol. Anyway, yea, you're mean to need it.
---
Yeah, you can only summon people from outside the instance.
---
Unless they're in the instance already (BRD or somewhere equally big) and then you can summon them to where you are if the mobs started to respawn.
---
What i noticed aswell if the quest is like 20 horns to loot you can both see the loot but 1 person can  keep looting it first, so if you have someone clicking loot immediately one person could ens up with say 16/20 and the other person may have 3/20
---
that's another option.
---
Alliance going to RFD...FML!
---
Waiting times to get a dungeon group. Especially on low levels and such.
---
&gt; Also AoE farmers like mages, will abuse this to hell
---
As someone who has not AOE farmed before but plans on doing it in Classic, I would 100% abuse this to hell.
---
&gt;what are your thoughts on WoW on Consoles?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31g0YE61PLQ
---
Didnt expect that many warriors tbh o.O
---
Is that a retail thing?
---
Talent Trees!
---
Not only do summoning stones not summon, the warlock summon spell won't work on players outside of your instance. So let's say you're standing in front of ragnaros, you need to walk all the way to the entrance and zone out before you can summon your buddy to blackrock mountain. Enjoy :)
---
BellularGaming has suggested that the ability pruning they've been doing might actually be so they can eventually port to a console platform to compete with FFXIV.
---
Bit of a tinfoil hat theory but still...
---
will WoW Classic just be a server type, or a complete different thing from BFA WoW, with its own section in the Battle.net launcher?
---
You say that, without knowing anything how much the sharding will affect the starter zones. Furthermore, there have still been no limitations as to where or when they're going to use it. All they've said is that they'll probably use it in the starter zones. 
---
Somehow you along with the rest of this subreddit seems to have gotten the idea that they've specificed exactly how many days sharding will be active, how many levels, how many zones or anything of that sort. You're making assumptions based on what you want them to do. 
---
&gt; Yes, because it's tech they already have that'll ensure a smooth launch  for everyone and still give the "big" experience with loads of players  everywhere. 
---
We have no idea if the launch will be smooth, we have no idea how many shards each realm will have, how many players each shard will have. If anything, they're probably going to use similar sharding technology that they have in retail, which in my eyes at least does not equate to "loads of players".
---
Which brings me back to my original comment. You're calling someone an idiot because they're not making the same assumption as you.
---
And yet FF14 uses controllers just fine.
---
Aaah, yes that's right. Thank you!
---
Kaivax is going to start posting daily Lunch pictures.
---
No one on my vanilla realm did that at least. We always met in Kargath (horde) and would always see a bunch of other horde guilds doing it too. It seemed a lot of alliance guild would too or right outside BRM.
---
Thanks!
---
"I've dwelt among the humans. Their entire culture is based around the penis. It is funny to say they are large, it is funny to say that they are small."
---
I think it will be separate, since it's running on the Legion infrastructure, not BFA, right?
---
As much as I love The Office, would you mind expanding on your opposition to it?
---
I once made a bag full of water before a raid... and I only gave it to warriors.
---
My brother and I are 4 years apart, I‚Äôm the lil bro. During vanilla he was a higher level and I would watch him as he went through dungeons and zones that I had never seen, it was awesome, sometimes I‚Äôd even just watch him fish. When BC came around I caught up to him and we raided together through Kara Gruuls And Magtheridon until I eventually passed him. I had more free time since I was only in middle school, so after 3 hours of swim practice every night the roles reversed and he would watch me raid SSC, TK and Hyjal. Can‚Äôt wait to relive these moments but this time we‚Äôll be playing together too :)
---
Cast cast moonfire, melee to death, rujv cast cast...it‚Äôs not too bad when you can heal yourself even if it‚Äôs slow
---
As someone who really only raided in late MOP as a rogue, I actually enjoyed the tier 16 set. Granted it wasn‚Äôt better than a lot of the earlier sets it wasn‚Äôt bad looking. My all time favorite for rogue was the gladiators set from BC
---
I always loved thunderstorms in thunder bluff. So peaceful! Especially when it's raining outside irl nothing quite sets the mood.
---
It‚Äôs okay man. Getting ganked isn‚Äôt that bad. You‚Äôll get used to it. 
---
Seems like you‚Äôd be better off waiting for a server with a clear faction imbalance so you can play on the dominant side. 
---
Population imbalance comes first, then world pvp dominance. Not the other way around.
---
Man this is exactly what iv been looking for except I need to relive my glory days on alliance. Was Horde for the rest of retail iv already mentally committed to alliance. If anything changes please let me know!
---
I would't be too shocked if Retail WoW eventually made a shift/bridge over to consoles honestly. Many other MMO's have done so and it seems like a pretty big untapped market. With Blizzard getting their feet wet with Diablo on Consoles, I think it's only a matter of time before we start to see them at least think about it.
---
rEtAil, i mean the EA is right there so of course it's bad
---
That's exactly my argument; like exactly what I said. The part that I have a problem with is when you instead come up with arguments about how it's going to be abused or break the game. It just isn't, it's the deeper issue of what happens when they start to implement some.
---
But you do realize that this is exactly the slippery slope fallacy, right? We have good reason to think that they *would* start to implement other other if they implemented some QoL changes, but that doesn't mean it isn't a fallacy. That's why I don't care that it's a fallacy, but that doesn't change the facts.
---
I think they should put flying mounts in, but all they would do is re-skin the thing you used to fly on while you were on a designated flight path.
---
Could druids use the trinket in bear form?
---
I was agreeing with you.
---
You Playing Rogue again?
---
Same to you, if anything changes.
---
It's a vicious cycle man. Tbh I would give people the benefit of the doubt and not start shit unnecessarily but 99% of the time they turn around and get the first shot off.
---
Kill on sight mfs
---
This is just....wow
---
Awesome job man I would 100% buy one
---
 [http://classicdb.ch/](http://classicdb.ch/)  \- just search through one slot at a time, all of the items have 1.10 stats (I think/hope). If a item has a number (in the url) higher then about 18000, it was probably not in the game from the start. So possibly not at stage 1.  Can look up individual items at  [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/)  it will say what patch it was added in.
---
If you make your own lists like this, you get BiS, 2nd BiS, 3rd BiS etc. because you'll be browsing all similar gear at the same time.
---
You make some valid points that can stand on their own merit.  But still the vitriol?  Did I insult you somehow?  
---
$15/month as you say supports continued R&amp;D and server infrastructure.  But then all the loyal subscribers still have to pay full market rate for each expansion.  So we're paying twice for R&amp;D?
---
And let's also acknowledge that there is no R&amp;D going on here, they do have some work to take the new client and import Classic data, but they aren't brainstorming any new abilities or generating new content.  It's turning a previously square peg into a round peg, and then there will likely be nothing but bug fixes and maintenance moving forward.  Any computer game has tech support, tech support is not a reason to charge a monthly fee.  
---
I think the gaming industry as a whole has found new and creative ways to get the consumer to fork out more cash.  What ever happened to the companies in the 80s and 90s who made great games?  They were successful and bought by much larger companies, and now we see the introduction of microtransactions, recurring fees, and the like.  Blizzard is no different.  I bought Starcraft, Brood War, D2, D2 expac, etc.  One-time purchases for top tier games with no monthly fees.  Now magically, the industry can't support that pricing model.  
---
Or is it instead that they just have gradually managed to introduce these extra fees and ideas and now have generated a certain segment of the gaming population to say "Hey, makes sense, I need to pay this to get a top-quality game".  I say it's bullshit to some extent.  They could get by with a more reasonable monthly fee, but why would they do it at this point?  Now it's a publicly traded company, and they have earnings targets and shareholders to please instead of simply making a great game and counting on basic gameplay to generate profits.
---
I think it lines up with standard pricing. You get retail as well minus latest expac content w that sub.
---
This was not common, and isn't that common. On pservers more hardcore guilds do it but that's about it
---
They didn't originally plan to have flying in warlords, but the community bitched up a storm that they caved.
---
I'm looking for an NA-RP Guild that plans on Raiding but knows that Vanilla is going to need emergent content long-term. No hardcore Guilds, looking for something that caters to working adults (scheduled events, not pretending to be hardcore, etc.)
---
Oh man, that underwater one with what looks like the Ruins of Lordaeron in the background is fucking gold.
---
To be playable on a console, a game has to be simplified, in order to accomodate the pyhsically limited controlling options of a console.
---
This simplification needs to permeate the entire game, including menu and interface layout. If it doesn't, the game is shit to play on a console.
---
And if it does, it is shit to play as a PC game, because you end up with a piece of crap, dumbed down to need less than 4 buttons at a time, and an interface that is your constant enemy instead of a useful tool.
---
Prime example: Skyrim, and its **IDIOTIC** inventory system.
---
Except you said it isn't the slippery slope fallacy; my argument is that by definition it is.
---
Do you like going PEW PEW? Roll a mage, if you like going STAB STAB, roll a rogue.
---
You keep talking about names of weapons and I havn't made a counter-argument. I agree, weapons were much more memorable back then. Not only because of their name but also because of the way you would acquire them.
---
"Like what‚Äôs the point if your progress is effectively erased 12 months from now."
---
Well what's the point of anything then? What's the point of levelling, raiding, getting gear? It will all be shut down one day. What's the point of living? You'll be dead one day. You have to define your own points.
---
MMORPGs cannot stand still. There needs to be new rewards to hunt and seek for. The reason why retail WoW is in its state today is build on hundreds and hundreds of design mistakes made along the way. Each design decision made to try and fix a specific problem, only to create two new different problems.
---
Even if the team isn't ready to release that information, we shouldn't get too uppity about what communication and engagement we get in the mean time. Especially if it is just a CM doing his job of clarifying information for people who ask about it on the forums. It's not like he's actually limited to one post a week about Classic, and he chose this recent server info reply over releasing the opening day of Classic.
---
do you want to be the guy who tanks the raid, or be the guy who summons the tank to the raid?
---
What name? I played frostwolf vanilla
---
See my edit ^.

Y np here u go

Generic bot much ?

OP is correct.
---
Meeting Stones
---
&gt; Meeting Stones
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; * A number of miscellaneous improvements have been made that should allow for better group forming when using the meeting stones.
---
&gt; * You will no longer be kicked from the meeting stone queue when a player declines a group invite or when inviting someone that is already in a group.
---
&gt; * You will now be informed that you have left the meeting stone queue when the group leader logs out.
---
&gt; * Tanks and Healers will now be immediately added to the group by the meeting stone when they are the 5th member of the group.
---
&gt; * You can now be added to a group by the meeting stone when that group contains characters that have disconnected.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_1.7.0
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.1
---
&gt; Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell.
---
Players select party member to be summoned and right click the stone. A second party member then clicks the portal to summon.
---
neither of which are on his poll...
---
BRD, was surprised to see it so low. But my #2 was SFK, which is the average #2 also. Surprised to see Deadmines at #1 when it doesn‚Äôt even get its own first pick at an acronym :/
---
Any guild that is slightly serious will do it. Cause its optimal and why not? World buffs are a HUGE decrease to your clear speed.
---
1. I think you will have the option to pick between old and updated graphics. I am not 100% sure about that.
---
2. Vanilla WoW has a generally slower pace. and it also requires a bigger investment than Retail. Player interaction is necessary to get anything and everything done. All those elements combined are most likely to create emotional attachment to your character and therefore you caring for your character and it's progression. Every quest completed, gear upgrade and level up will feel that much stratifying because you are involved on so many levels. 
---
3. It's more or less the same. In my opinion, aim to play with your friends. Playing with them has a much higher fun factor than your options of racial spells and hair styles.
---
4. It is a big decision: PVE vs. PVP. Pvp can be brutal at times when you are on the receiving end but very fun when the tables are turned. PVE gives you more space to learn and less non-consensual PvP. Yet again, I would refer to point #3 on this one.
---
5. Leveling can be done solo no problem. It can be also done in duos and other group variants. When you try to do dungeons or raids, grouping in mandatory. Social interactions are one of the founding pillars of Classic WoW.
---
6. We don't know yet. As far as we know, only Classic has be announced yet.
---
7. Some parts of the world do follow a specific "story"or are very "story" oriented. Generally speaking, I would like to say that Retail WoW is much more story-driven than Classic WoW. Classic WoW tends to be closer to an RPG than the current version as it gives you much more room to craft your "own" story. Some parts of Classic WoW are related to the Warcraft 3 storyline: Stratholme for example.
---
8. If you intend to play Classic, be nice and kind to people and the game will reward you a thousand times over. 
---
See you this Summer!
---
From what I recall there was a timer that each dragon head was active, and you could not place another while one was up, so unless you were the first to raid that day it was unlikely that you would be able to pop the head buff when you wanted to.
---
It's based on 8.2 now and will be keeping pace with Retail.
---
Man he's so right.  The last part rings true especially when you look at crossrealm and LFG and how it basically obliterated the intimate social aspects of WoW.
---
You're deluded by the fact that you think that only "some" changes should or can be allowed. The amount of times i saw that argument from different people that said the exact same thing is staggering. Except everyone had their version of "some" changes. You are entitled in thinking that your opinion on what should be allowed and what "some" means in the grand scheme of things.
---
In the end you are nothing more but "my opinion won't change anything relevant, because its mine and i though about it". Welcome to everyone else that said the exact same thing.
---
Optimal does not equal slightly serious. Very serious guilds will, slightly serious guilds will do it sometimes.
---
Not everyone plays or makes 100% optimal decisions
---
Yeah, at least it's not Warrior where you have to make an investment in food/bandages.
---
I didn‚Äôt upload the videos to Warcraft Movies. I linked google videos.  Google converted them to YouTube when they bought YouTube.  I downloaded the videos then and only reuploaded this one.  I even paid the ‚Äúpremium‚Äù fee to get be able to download videos only to find out mine were only a link. I don‚Äôt think the premium features even work still.
---
Same. My max would be $500
---
Shadowfang keep is my favorite followed by Deadmines.

how does it know bis by class when you can spec so differently, like rogue going maces instead of swords, it should show talents and sim #s imo
---
Doublej - Troll Hunter. I was in the guild Destiny Fulfilled.  You?
---
How does this imply you like it for the wrong reasons? It‚Äôs purpose is to customize your look to what you like best. You like vanilla the best. So it is serving its proper function.
---
This is what a repost looked like when I browse reddit
---
I think you're worrying too much. think of this as a second chance to learn the dungeons. no point in stressing out about it, video games are supposed to be fun, not a job. plus there is plenty of guides out there on the internet. it will be ok I promise.
---
used to RP in Wetlands (Menethil guard, spent most of our time at Thandol Span). every now and again that place would see some horrific storms. like rain on steroids lol. rain, mist, limited view distance. was really cool.
---
The "20 vs 20 PvP raids" scenario happened to me like 1 or 2 times in vanilla. They were fun as hell, but not worth all the griefing that happens on PvP servers imo. I'll be going PVE this time too. Carebear squad.
---
Oh yeah man. I remember that shit
---
Y'all worry about the weirdest stuff in this sub. Why is everyone worried?
---
I was questing in Westfall and grouped up with some random people. I had been playing maybe 2 days at the time and never saw anything drop that gave me the need or greed menu. I clicked need on a piece of leather because it had better stats than my warriors white item. I got kicked from the group and was then gone off on in General for at least 5 minutes. I thought the server was just full of dicks so I created a character on a new one.
---
Deadmines or shadowfang keep for me! Awesome instances.
---
I personally think Tier 2 throughout all the classes is still the best Tier group in WoW.

**&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; \[A\] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP**
---
**Intro**
---
Frozen    Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we  are   targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post  is   completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything  that   is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
**Meist√§**
---
Frozen    Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu l√§hinn√§    MMO-pelej√§ pelaava suomikilta, joka sen j√§lkeen on muodostunut    massiiviseksi pelaajayhteis√∂ksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat    eritt√§in vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi    pienest√§ Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan    kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in,    Lotron, EVE Onlinen sek√§ monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista    n√§ist√§ peleist√§ pelataan viel√§, toisia enemm√§n ja toisia v√§hemm√§n, ja    tarkoituksenamme on my√∂s jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien    pelien pariin. T√§ll√§ hetkell√§ killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final    Fantasy XIV:ss√§, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons    Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu    Azerothiin ISOSTI, sill√§ WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteis√∂mme    isoista peleist√§, jossa pyrit√§√§n saavuttamaan merkitt√§v√§ status tulevan    Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja    menestyvin Suomikilta alkuper√§iseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean    MMORPG:n yhteis√∂llisyydest√§ ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni    my√∂s perheellisi√§, eik√§ meill√§ ole v√§ltt√§m√§tt√§ aikaa en√§√§ raidata    viitt√§ p√§iv√§√§ viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina    raideista PvP:hen sill√§ ajalla, joka meill√§ on k√§ytett√§viss√§.

I love druids for leveling I just hate them at 60. Always disappointed in cat damage, no Rez healing.  Bear form is always pretty good and if you like to frustrate people in PvP or flag carry it‚Äôs great, it just feels klunky. Leveling though, amazing
---
There are tons of things they CAN post about. We found that out last week. Well it wasn't an official blue post, but we found out they aren't opposed to answering questions about classic like "how many characters can we have?" LOL. 
---
Personally not sure why that is a relevant question someone would, but whatever floats some peoples boats. That guy was like the guy in everyones work place that at the end of a 3 hour long meeting when the lead of the meeting says "Are there any questions" that guy raises his hand. EVERYTIME.
---
My mom works for Blizzard and she said its coming next week!
---
This is obviously fake, so is your post.
---
I just wanted to spark discussion, never said I was undeniably right, just that I **thought** it wouldn't have much of a impact while giving a small convenience. 
---
No need to be so passive agressive about it., just say you disagree and state why like others did.
---
I don't remember dealing with "gank squads" but I definitely was killed many times when trying to get to an instance solo. I remember this mostly happening when heading to SM and whatever the instance was in Desolace (mara?) on Bloodhoof. Also in Blackrock Mountain, especially when ally and horde raids happened to show up around the same time. 
---
Also, if my memory serves, Bloodhoof was a high pop server back then but I definitely don't recall there being 10k+ online at a time. However, I can't find any concurrent-user stats from back then.
---
The only good thing about cataclysm was the guild bank, annoying that it took so many years to implement, and even then it was flawed with one person being able to loot the whole thing. At least there was some accountability.  
---
And no, we definitely won‚Äôt see it in classic. This was the main reason for why I was at least an officer in every guild I joined, they were all corrupt as fuck, and usually the only way to get anything out of it was to join in on the scheme. 
---
I pretty much only used it for zg and aq20 turn ins and coins.
---
You wore what you could get, same as when classic releases. RNG is fickle. So very few people are going to be rocking full bis of any sort for a long time
---
Buff mage damage with curse of the elements?
---
And a handful of soul shards!
---
I'm not afraid to admit that I played a lot during vanilla and had little to show for it. Only ever made it to the rank of Knight in pvp. Downed Rag once or twice with a friendly guild while people were pushing Nax. Never set foot in any raids further. But I had so much fun playing vanilla and I look forward to play classic as much as I can and possible seeing more this time.

Is this a quality post in a sub with nothing new to offer?
---
ü¶ã
---
Tard Chargers - total noobs. :)
---
You can be disappointed all you want, but different people can get different joy out of PvP servers for different reasons.  Acting as if there is only one right way to play on a PvP server is just silly.
---
Some people pvp because they want to prove their skill against others and they would lean to wards picking fair fights, or even watching a good matchup between two people in open world.  
---
Some, like yourself, play to prove the factions worth.  Yet at the same time, proving your factions worth can be measured with and without killing every person they see of the opposite faction as many times as possible at all times.  
---
Some will kill everyone that they see a few times, then let them continue on their own playing because they don't want to ruin another person's playtime.  
---
But guess what, many will also play in all of these fashions, either dependent or independent of whats going on in the world around them, because that's what they feel like doing at the time.  
---
PvP servers are great because they provide a thriving melting pot of different playstyles that enjoy the adrenaline or competition that comes with having the ability to directly oppose eachother.  As you said it is a fairly unique social experiment and in my opinion tends to build a very rich community... but, it wouldn't be much of a social experiment if everyone chose the play the exact same way as you wish to play.
---
Additionally, you claim you aren't telling people how to play, but that's exactly what you are doing for those who don't fit your mold of an ideal character within your favored setting.
---
What? Maybe if you're 22 and doing wc.  If you do it at the optimal level- like 18- you will die like 8 times to mobs before zoning in solo, unless another group has done the smart thing and fought their way through together.  Some dungeons you can zone solo as most classes (rfk, sm, zf), but wc... Deadmines... Uldaman- good luck, unless you're over leveled or get lucky.
---
Inb4 druid.
---
All my friends quit in bc because of flying. It made any sort of terrain design pointless and skippable, made any sort of effort getting to quest spot pointless and skippable, and neutered world pvp
---
The Chromie thing is what got me, just a little tacky but hey at least we got it!
---
Do you plan on playing a PvP server? Rogue has alot of good synergy with lock.  You keep targets still and CC'd while your boy dots up the world and pumps out shadowbolts.  Cripple poison keeps mobs off his D and you got alot of tools with blind fear sap and seduce.  Also you two wont have to fight over gear at all
---
Aren‚Äôt the words NEED and GREED enough to guide people? Ridiculous. The group should not need on a purple BOE just because it is purple. A cloth wearer should not need on a purple BOE just because he wears cloth. As others have stated, if its not something your will equip as soon you win it (or, if below required level/profession, as soon as you do reach it), then you should greed.
---
There‚Äôs no need to ask the group. If you know you need just need, if it is greed just greed.
---
That said, stating professions beforehand is good practice to avoid opportunists.
---
Holy shit. You are insufferable.
---
Never thought about it that way, even though I had skinning/lw back in tbc, it seems minor but a fair point nonetheless
---
And I love druids at 60 but kinda hate their leveling. I just remember like half my fucking attacks (abilities, not auto attacks) getting parried/dodged/miss.
---
Ok you clearly did not read my post, tell me where I said any change whatsoever should be allowed, let alone specifically said a change should be allowed.
---
I'm against changes *on principle*. I'm not going to try and say they'll break the game. Would an AH overhaul be a QoL improvement that would probably make the game better? Yeah. Would being able to mail multiple items at once make the game better, and auto-popup with the names of alts instead of just guild members? Yeah. Do I want those changes implemented? If you read literally any of my first response, you would know the answer is no.
---
&gt;In the end you are nothing more but "my opinion won't change anything relevant, because its mine and i though about it". Welcome to everyone else that said the exact same thing.
---
I don't even know what this is in reference to. Obviously not any part of my argument, because I don't see how it's even tangentially related to anything I said.
---
If you had two 60s, you played a lot more than a big chunk of the player base.  You'll be fine.
---
&gt; It sucks that people are so worried about how much this or that racial will MARGINALLY atfect their experience that they're not choosing what they would like to be, but what mechanically is 'best'.
---
See I'm a little different, if I wanted to play the best race, I'd play a human rogue for the obvious reasons, but I value getting out of snares and being able to play my character against classes that hit me with snares.
---
&gt; Im going to have to get used to seeing a Lot more dwarven priests than before. Back in vanilla it wasnt a big deal that fear ward was a thing, and now its the minmax standard.
---
One of my buddies rerolled to a dwarf priest from a human warrior back in 2005, because it was known how good fear ward was, and no one played a dwarf priest. He eliminated competition with other warriors for a guaranteed raid invite as a dwarf priest. That's pretty much exactly what he said on the matter.
---
Oh, thanks changed on the post
---
Man I would die for "pristine" retail servers that did not participate in sharding or crossrealm, and the LFG tools were limited to the realm only.
---
I'm talking about private servers. The most recent big private server had a playercap of 14k when it first launched, and even with 10-12k online, I never encountered "gank squads".
---
Retail vanilla had player caps of around 3-4k.
---
&gt; I don't get the Onyxia buff thing. They kill onyxia and then go raid BRM immediately after?  
---
&gt;Reply
---
No you would just save the head turn in till the next raid.  Then turn it in to get the big boi buff.
---
While I want to remain cautiously optimistic, my DnD group and a number of my friends are super hyped about classic, and none of them have played since BC.
---
Obviously we both have our own little slice of the grand picture, but from where I'm standing I can see a million subs sticking around.
---
lol yeah that‚Äôs everyone. I find cat form the worst for that!  I could pretty much moonfire pull abs bear kill nonstop so it‚Äôs was pretty easy. Not hunter easy but still nice
---
You're pretty much just gonna die sorry
---
Ah true. I never heard of a guild telling people they couldn't turn the head in though. I turned mine in immediately back in the day
---
I never actually played WOW till the midway point of Cataclysm, so as far as experiences in classic I have none. I‚Äôm really excited to play it though because I wanna see what I missed out on. I wouldn‚Äôt stress to much about the amount of experience you have since I‚Äôm sure there are going to be a decent number of players like me who have almost no knowledge of Classic. Just have fun with the experience.
---
Sorry, haven't seen it personally on r/classicwow. This is a place for throwbacks! Repost this thread like Blizzard is reposting Classic. Boiiii
---
Yep, pservers, or some of them at least, let you drop it whenever though. Going to be much harder to organise in classic.
---
It's definitely more of a Pserver thing, but ill assume this carries over to classic.  It really does help quite a bit.
---
Population cap? Don't know if theywill give this to us.
---
[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) integration. How will it work?
---
Frost Mage, maybe.
---
Just get good gear and this is a moot concern.
---
Druids are a bit more squishy because they cannot block or parry.  This alone makes them basically unsuitable for Main Tank in raids, however they are perfectly fine for Off Tank or any non-raid group content.
---
They of course have the other forms they can use, along with healing and damage spells, but this requires them to be out of bear form which is a death sentence when trying to offtank.
---
If we knew this sub would be blowing up :D
---
This is a great troll question to point out how much the bottom of the barrel is being scraped for sub content.
---
Hah, easier said than done. The first time around I was in college and didn't have time to raid and get good gear. Now I have a wife, 3 kids, a dog, a fulltime job and a business.
---
Loads of dailies, and wasn't there at least one Reputation that was gated behind another one?
---
Like I said I've played before and after this particular change happened, and **imo** having to loot corpse by corpse while farming was more of a nuisance than a gameplay dynamic/mechanic with any if at all depth. 
---
But some of the comments have pointed some valid points, and I'm far from saying it's undeniably necessary to add this, just wanted to see what others thought about it.
---
Yeah you lose progress.  
---
Trinket is BoP.
---
Thank you
---
Oh, yeah.. At this point I went to high school. Fucked up all my degrees. Thankfully Sweden got some good catch up mechanics(heh..) so I'm good today, but at that point it felt like I was fucked
---
Im not attacking you personally, im attacking your idea. There is no such thing as "some" changes. Don't explain this to me, explain it to the masses of crybabies that call themselves gamers today. 
---
Even if Mail changes might be good, many will see it as opportunity to cry because its "their" turn. This is what must be avoided at all costs. 
---
As for the Mail proposition itself, i often wondered if it wasn't some kind of engine limitation. Honestly i won't be surprised that to actually be a thing regardless.
---
Thank you for helping him meet his expectations, have an upvote.
---
Well, if they somehow managed to split the subscription to classic-only it might make sense to charge less for it, but you have to also realize that if you sub to play Classic you're also able to play the current version of the game as well. So that money does does go to R&amp;D still. They're unlikely to unlink the subscription from the modern version for the reason that it would cannibalize customers from the modern version of the game and hit their revenue harder because surely there's a lot of people who will be leaving current WoW for Classic.
---
It's not the ideal situation for those who just want to play Classic, but at least they don't have an upfront purchase. For those who want to maintain characters on both Classic and Modern WoW (like me), then it's just a bonus to what they're already paying. In addition to that, the servers aren't going to disappear any time soon like you have happen with private servers. Either by internal drama, burn-out, or legal trouble. You know those servers are going to be there (indefinitely until the game shuts down some many years in the future), going to be stable (relatively, this is Blizzard afterall XD), and the admins aren't going to be making a side-hustle with paid level 60s/gear/gold.
---
As for games of yesteryear you just purchased and played, those had/have very little to no infrastructure overhead by comparison to an MMO (of which majority of large MMOs have had and still have subscription models to this day to cover ongoing operational costs). There was no server-side simulation needed, and multiplayer was done peer-to-peer rather than through a server (minus the matchmaking/licensing authentication where applicable). Those types of games still exist in the thousands. People pretend that they don't, but they do. Just because the AAA publishers have all switched to the business model that makes their shareholders cream their undies, live services, microtransactions, season passes, loot boxes, etc; doesn't mean that the "buy once and that's it" type of games aren't being made/sold anymore. You just can't really look to the AAAs to be the ones selling them, because they want to make every conceivable dollar possible from a live service.
---
I'd personally take a nominal monthly fee any day to play a game not bloated with that AAA microtransaction pay-to-win garbage. It's probably what has kept that sort of thing to a minimum in WoW over the years.
---
Yeah thinking back on it, I wonder why it wasn't a bigger thing. I'm sure some guilds did it, because yeah those buffs were pretty insane.
---
I just remember specifically being hyped on the occasions I had the buffs right before a raid on accident thinking how good my dps was going to be that night lmao.
---
Well I'd love to have Thunderfury again because.. it's still the greatest ever looking weapon I've ever come across in an MMO.
---
I've been up and down this sub for months, boy. And this photo got uploaded by another Redditor a few hours ago. And then, you post it. Have your downvoted and move on.
---
I don‚Äôt know about live, but on a private server last year it started snowing in the Barrens. People were freaking out and you couldn‚Äôt see 5 feet in front of you. Was so cool.
---
Patch 2.0.1 (2006-12-05): Meeting Stones now function similar to a Warlock Summon spell. 
---
Must have done RFD after TBC released.
---
There are somewhere around 109 Gromsblood spawns in the entire classic world. 
---
Gromsblood is used in the following raid consumables: Elixir of Giants, Flask of the Titans, Elixir of Brute Force, Major Troll's Blood, Mighty Rage Pot.   
---
Lets say you hit every node once a day, 109 spawns, thats 36.3 potions, lets be generous and say 37. 
---
Thats only 18 fights a day. 
---
Maybe you use great rage potions? that requires a large fang that drops of mid 30s to low 40s beats....not exactly the best farming spawns at 60, so you farming them means youll need to farm elsewhere additionally for your gold.
---
What about rage potions? Sharp Claws off 20s-30s beasts, so even a more on dimensional farm. And you need Briarthorn for these, which is a pain to collect as its one of the few (if only herbs) useful for upping your alchemy/herbalism skill and is used in swiftness pots. 
---
To be able to consistently pop rage potions in premade pvp (presumably where you would like to be spending most of your time) is unrealistic without botting or buying gold.
---
If it‚Äôs a pug, roll need on anything that is an upgrade for you. Roll need on any recipe you can learn, and roll need for any BOE, then greed for all others.
---
If on a guild run, discuss it and follow that plan.
---
1) no, it surely won't.
---
2) who cares.
---
&lt;3 Maladath!
---
Do that, but also make sure your weapon skill of choice for your 1-hander is up to snuff so you can actually generate threat!
---
Everytime I see Nessingwary camp with skeletons littering the ground I get more hyped for Classic. Goddamnit Blizzard release the shit already before I piss meself.
---
Well, it was really awesome, but the reason I played that much wasn't that awesome. I won't put 4k hours in two years into classic this time around. I'll have my week's here and there where I play 12h a day but I'll try to keep it healthy this time.
---
But one thing I've grown to really appreciate about the old specializations was just that, they were specializations. A mage was a mage no matter which why you cut it, you were just better in one school than the other. A modern fire or frost make completely loses the other school of magic and you arent a mage anymore, you're a pyromancer or something. I like the way the Talents just leaned you in different directions rather than cut you off from everything that doesnt fit its mold.
---
Agreed, suddenly the rogue on the epic ground mount can only gank you a couple of times instead of griefing you for an hour.
---
I remember getting my 60% mount and loving it. It was comically slow, but it was awesome. Then the long and painful terrocone grind for my epic flying, I was so proud and happy when I finally got it. Then the nether drake, cmon those were awesome additions to the game. 
---
Everyone itt saying it was immersion breaking are just dumb and strawmaning the argument. It made sense for you to have a flying mount, you are this badass adventurer who is fixing to save the world but you cant borrow one of the griffins they use to taxi from goldshire to storm wind? Cmon that doesn't make sense. 
---
They do have a point about alts and mounts tho, that is immersion breaking. Flying mounts when they were introduced were really slow, or really expensive, and you only got one once you were max level. That system should have stayed in place.
---
Haha dont worry, I also raised my eyebrows reading "Uldaman". First I thought its a wotlk instance or the random place in tanaris. Now, I recall the instance with the bats and statue bosses. And ofc cant remember the difference between rfd and rfk (one has a pile of skeletons and a lich boss)
---
I remember when they implemented rain effects in the original wow.  I  loved it!
---
Kind of already did. They hinted that they wanted population caps to be as authentic as possible to the vanilla days.
---
Also [battle.net](https://battle.net) integration they kind of discussioned their vision for how it would work. You could only talk to people on the same faction on [battle.net](https://battle.net) while in game if you're on a PVP server. You could only have 1 faction if you were on a PVP server still and things of that nature. HOW they were going to enforce this wasn't addressed, but their overall vision for it was. 
---
I think both of those are good enough answers to not get clarified until launch personally. I'd rather hold out for good information like server lists, beta info, and release date. Sharding clarification MAYBE on what zones will be sharded, but even that I'm assuming based on what they said that the starting zones will be sharded for the first couple weeks and I'm okay with not knowing the specifics.   
---
I just want the game out and playable lol.
---
There aren't many abilities/CDs for bear tanks, but what they have is effective in tanking.  They are able to effectively tank, however don't have the big CDs and extra utility skills that warriors will have for tanking.  They can tank 5 mans, offtank raids while not having to compete directly with warrior gear, and they can be as/more valuable as a main tank for certain encounters, though they should not be used as MT for certain bosses as well.
---
We're all friends here.
---
Except hunters. Fuck those guys.
---
Lol sounds like me, I always played warrior but pretty gear dependant, rogue or hunter or mage imo would be best solo pvp.
---
Yeah druid is powerful too if you dont mind bouncing around forms to support your lock
---
No you don't, go get that degree! You'll have time to enjoy the game
---
He means meet at the meeting stone, not town.
---
That's actually good to know, thanks.
---
30 minutes?
---
I have seen some ultra lazy people on P-Servers.
---
Like one time we wanted to do Onyxia and everyone had more than enough time to travel. 
---
And some people still wanted a Teleport!!!
---
They didn't even start walking to the Liar. They were waiting for the Warlocks to travel to Onyxia and they just sat around in Stormwind, waiting for a Teleport.
---
This triggers me so much and I don't even play Warlock.
---
Also keep in mind that in vanilla you had to zone out of instances to warlock summon.  However in retail I know that is not the case.  I am curious If they intend on changing that or keeping it the same as vanilla.
---
I still remember questing around Tirisfal Glades for the very first time. It's an oppressive place to begin with, its dark, foreboding, and you just feel the area is tainted. Then up around Agamand Mills one time as a virgin level \~10 undead priest, whilst I'm farming Devlin's Remains and trying to avoid pulling a million skeletons... the heavens just open and it *buckets* it down.
---
A lot of those people have played private servers, so their memories are a lot fresher than yours.
---
people are just way too anxious for a release date. we all wanna play it now, RIGHT NOW, but can't. it'll come. nothing you do right now will make it come sooner, you can stress about race/class/spec/etc or what you should be doing to prepare all you want, it doesn't matter. we're all waiting on Blizzard Time. Soon‚Ñ¢
---
Might want to read the post before you say anything
---
Naw I like how I said it
---
Armor sets with set bonuses are underused :(
---
MWSRA!
---
Doing well isn't enough, there must be enough people not to split the community too thin. Expecting people to agree with expansions on top of each other would be a bad thing. Separate servers might be the answer but there must be enough people for all of them.
---
Rogue and Paladin Tier 2 were way ahead of their time. This set was my favorite rogue set for years (Deathmantle Tier 5 was close) and I still mog it a lot to this day. 
---
It also took me years to find a set worthy of succeeding Judgement Armor for Paladin. Bfa FINALLY gave me a set worthy with the warfront plate set for Alliance human. 
---
And even then blood elf male model still rocks Judgement Armor like a badass.
---
I'm currently playing on a pserv and raiding in all raids prior to AQ40 atm.  I play a 20/0/31 split and carry two sets of gear one for healing and one for ret/everything else.  I'll try to answer from my experiences over the last 2-3 months:
---
&gt; Do holy paladins have trouble lowering threat in dungeons? I've always had my trusty fade to lean back to
---
Not really.   Pallys honestly just don't have much healing aggro problems, and if we do we've got bubble and bop to fall back on.  I suppose if you *were* having major threat issues, you could salv yourself instead of wisdom...but you really don't wanna do that and shouldn't have to.
---
- Do holy paladins just sit around in dungeons when not healing? I'm used to wanding, etc.
---
You *can* just sit around doing nothing when not healing.  Generally you want to at least be judging SOMETHING on the mob to boost your group.  Generally light or wis if you're the healer.   You can also feel free to consecrate on aoe packs or even hit things with melee as long as you aren't letting people die and aren't draining your mana pool.  In dungeons with undead you can even sneak in excorcism/holy wrath/turn UD.  You also keep an eye out for opportunities to bop or sac other players (like that mage you know is about to open up with huge aoe way too soon and pull aggro).  A *good* pally is more than just spamming FoL.
---
- Is the 5 second rule still something to think about or do I not need to care as much since Flash of Light crits refund mana?
---
As a rule, Pallies do not worry about the 5s rule because generally we're casting constantly, FoL is fairly mana efficient, and Illumination (the crit refund you refer to) is *insanely* helpful.   That said, there are times esp at lower levels or extremely long raid bosses, where it helps to be aware of what the 5s rule is and how to leverage it....just not very often.
---
- Just confirming, are pallies fully viable for all 5 man content as the sole healer (deadmines all the way to scholo and strat live/dead)? I've seen on here that they struggle when damage is spread out due to no AOE
---
HPals are fully viable for all healing content.  Your hardest time will be when group wide damage is going out, as you've noted.  However, as I said above, you have more than FoL and should be using more than FoL.  BoP, Sac, and JoLight all help in this area.
---
- Anyone like to level as holy? I've read on here that folks prefer ret for Seal of Command and melee bonuses, and that you can still heal with those talents, but I kinda like the idea of getting some holy talents right away (making me better at dungeons and warsongs) and rushing Consecration/Holy Shock.
---
I do not level as straight ret.  That said, I am *always* in a duo with my wife (mage) when leveling up, so that does change the equation for me a bit.  Personally, I rush consecrate, then put points in ret until we're hitting dungeons where it becomes a strain to heal without Illumination (generally around ZF level), then I respec to 20 points in holy for illumination and fill out the ret tree as I finish up to 60.
---
-I have to go Engineering don't I. Yeah, I need to go Engineering.
---
Have to? No.  I haven't fooled with any crafting on this pserv...b/c it's a pserv that will be shutting down in a few months.   Would you absolutely benefit from doing so in basically all aspects of the game?  Absolutely, and I plan to do so for actual Classic.
---
Not just plans, it was in the game for a bit.
---
I‚Äôd recommend avoiding priest and mage just to avoid aiming for the same gear. 
---
Personally, rogue would be awesome. Your buddy can pick up aggro with the void walker while you backstab to your hearts content.

On the basis of recent private fun server exp: frost mage, shadow priest, sl warlock in 1v1. For BGs the three above (but dont expect to be the driving force in the BG) plus any healer if you can position well and the enemy does not have oneshot hungry rogues. Hunter is somewhat ok too in BGs (41 yard range and viper sting is still a thing).
---
Depends what you plan on doing end game. 
---
For end game I would highly advise against rolling double dps because it will make finding dungeon groups kind of a pain compared to one of you being able to tank/heal. 
---
Druid would be real good obviously or shaman.
---
Nothing hurts a Hordie's pride more than being killed by a gnome.
---
Frost mage but that's just so you can get away...hopefully. Anyone with T2+ gear and weapons WILL take a shit on anyone with blues. Particularly if they have the best possible enchants. It's literally like twinking but at level 60
---
Lot of streamers will actually play on PvE, from what I have heard :(
---
Mages do have the easiest time with frost nova + blink. This is back before every class had a dozen ways to break roots.
---
Practice for what? You have a 160 hour tutorial ahead of you until you hit 60.
---
What are you practicing? Line dancing?
---
I main a warrior now but used to play a holy paladin back in 2004. 
---
1) Do they ahve issues with threat? 
---
  \- Not really, sure they can have a few threat issues; however, they are tankier for the most part than a priest and can always bubble if needed.
---
2) Do we sit around? 
---
 \- You can melee if you want and do damage if you please. If your group is any good you're not going to be STRESSED for mana during pulls. 
---
3) 5 second rule 
---
 \-All of your crits at 60 refund mana. I would personally put blessing of light on everyone no matter what they wanted just so my rank 3 holy light did more and spammed the hell out of that. I never had to worry about mana in dungeon runs for the most part. You get that at 42 or 44 I believe so thats when you can really start down ranking. 
---
4) Sole healer?
---
 \- Sure, easily.
---
5) Leveling as holy 
---
 \- Sounds like a bad time, but I did it back in the day. I think I went some stupid main holy / ret spec. It allowed me to afk and kill mobs still. Seal of Command is really good for 2 hand leveling now after researching it. I think you need a weapon thats extremely slow, like 3.5 to make it worth it, but its really strong if you have a slow weapon for sure. Anything faster than that I think you're supposed to use SoRighteousness.
---
6) Engineering
---
 \- Thats the try hard prof for every single class. Do something you'll enjoy. You dont HAAAAAVE to go engineering. I would say the only people that HAVE to go engineering are Main tanks and try hard PVPers.  
---
Hope this helped.
---
That seems pretty excessive even for that level.  I'd make sure you're making the most out of CC and really strive to use the most mana effective heals (including downranking) and leveraging the 5sec rule for mana regen.  Also, helps to have a tank that is at least an even level for the highest mobs in the instance.
---
Knowing what your target was wearing died in Wrath lol.
---
The issue wasn't transmog, it was having only like 2 aesthetic sets for each expansion. Transmog was just the logical conclusion to that.
---
Warrior this time and only casual:)
---
I respect what people say but i don't respect their "well though out opinions, that everyone will like" and pretend that slippery slope can be avoided.
---
&gt; Good luck proposing any change.  No matter how small people will extrapolate it to it's worst possible effect. 
---
I misunderstood that, line. Sorry.
---
Nope:)
---
Thanks for clarifying your points.  It's depressing that many big developers (EA, Acti/Blizz, Bethesda) are turning into revenue extraction devices rather than honest to goodness game developers.  Still very cautiously optimistic for classic though, I mean I'll be subbing anyways just not sure for how long.
---
Divorce and quit your job or change your expectations
---
I had to play with nearly no weather effects back in the day due to my potato PC. Recent tests on pserver with maxed out graphics was breath taking. The rain in STV and sandstorms in Tanaris blew me away, too. I couldn‚Äôt believe such an old game could look so good.
---
The only problem with walking is it is so long for certain factions/dungeons such as SM or SFK for Alliance. Many people new to vanilla will likely skip these unfourunately since it is a huge walk before mounts.
---
Resto Druid
---
What a new and exciting thought, do you have a tumblr I can follow?
---
&gt;dungeons just got 30 min longer
---
Not really, someone still had to run there even with summoning stones, now it just means you all have to. Unless you have a warlock ofc.
---
I agree wholeheartedly with you, I think the fear of blizzard ruining the game by bundling "QoL" with truly impactful changes that fit their more recent design philosophy that the core fans disagree is what brings such a pushback on any small improvement to the game's systems. I didn't though that it would go so deeply as AoE looting since, like you said, it would affect such a small slice of the people/situations but get as much pushback as any game chaging suggestion.
---
Thanks for the input.
---
&gt; Aren‚Äôt the words NEED and GREED enough to guide people?
---
You would think it would be obvious but there's still people like you who are greedy and think you're entitled to a particular high value item just because of the class you happen to play, regardless of other people in your group that contributed towards obtaining it.
---
I‚Äôm so very appreciative of your time and comments here !! This was exactly what I needed!!
---
Dude its on the front page of this sub, c'mon maaaaaan
---
&gt;was more of a nuisance
---
A game mechanic that is a nuisance to you, is still a game mechanic.
---
Shame it was never turned on. Would have been cool to see the race distribution of Rank 15 players each week. I imagine it would inspire races to work together to get their race at the top as Overlords and Deathlords would probably be pretty common.
---
No, I think a lot of people here are on the Internet. **Meaning**: They played private servers recently and pretend it's an original memory.
---
I'm not that old and I can't remember half the shit from 15 years ago.
---
Or we both are in the early stages of alzheimer. We can't rule anything out.
---
I'm working through every single class, across every race 1-20 on a pserver just to remind myself of decent routes (although at launch it will be swarmed at launch ofc) and what levelling classes in Vanilla was/is/will be like.
---
But its true! When was the last time you saw someone in sw/og and went "daaamn"? None stands out these days maybe because transmog, maybe because nothing really is hard anymore.
---
Well, they shouldn't turn classic into retail just to cater to people that are new to vanilla.
---
It's entirely possible to re-configure a large amount of necessary actions into less buttons. It sounds like you are thinking about this in terms of "Press A to "Fireball, Press B to Frostbolt" but in reality, it could very easily be refined down to something similar to Monster Hunter World in terms of the Actions. 
---
Now yes, the inventory management and navigating the user interface in general would be a fairly big challenge, but other Console MMO's, and even other non-mmo games, succeed in this where many games fail. In WoW you have a finite amount of bag space. This is important because unlike games such as Skyrim which allow you to carry literally hundreds of different items at the same time, WoW limits you to a fraction of that. With some fairly simple changes to the UI as a whole, a player would have quick access to their character's equipment, Abilities, talents, and/or bags with just a few buttons. The most important thing here, then, would be a snappy UI that avoids things like an on-screen cursor (here's to looking at you, No Man's Sky) that artificially slow down how quickly people are able to navigate menus on console. 
---
None of this "Hold to open a context menu to decide what to do with the item" bullshit. Just "Press A to select/pick-up/move/swap", "Press X to drop/destroy/etc with a confirmation window." etc.
---
So. I just want to point out i have played pally (mostly holy/prot) my entire time of playing wow.
---
Extremely helpful - thank you!
---
I wish i had your worries:/ going again with many things forgotten. You shouldn't worry, you should be happy.
---
Same.
---
That's definitely the case now, but was that the case back in vanilla? I thought dungeon leveling (as tank/healer) was actually pretty effective
---
I upvoted you because you were expecting to be downvoted
---
They‚Äôre supposed to be hard. I played felmy5t until it shut down and really enjoyed the increase in difficulty. Trying to jump into them on a fresh 70 was nightmarish as a tank. Wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. That being said, with a little gear you definitely didnt need a picture perfect group to run them. Some Cc was definitely necessary but I think thats a really good way to make cc classes impactful and add difficulty.
---
The first edition was actually a licensed D&amp;D setting (the logo is on the core book). The second edition was a little more divergent, they made it into a more WoW-focused d20 game. It has been out of print for a long time, though.
---
Full run or gtfo. Okay maybe if you go in as lvl 52 you don't do the last boss. :D
---
I liked how TBC balances many more classes/specs for raiding.  Kara was fantastic, and the pre-nerfed heroics were also extremely fun (although less diverse than the Vanilla dungeons).
---
I agree that it's harder to express what was better about Vanilla.  A large part of it was that Vanilla felt like a bigger game because the players were unconstrained.  In vanilla, Blizzard had not yet figured out how to completely control the game so it had a "wild west" feel that hasn't been duplicated since.
---
This is the main reason im sad there will be no HKs/DKs at the start :(. I love to start ranking in STV the first week.
---
Love it - great video :).
---
when it's vanilla, it's "enjoyable, fun-expanding limitations"
---
when it's a future expansion, it's "fun-sucking, gated content"
---
We did it back in the days and we really weren't a serious guild, always had ~15-20 that didn't know what they were doing.
---
All it takes is 1 guy saying, don't turn in the head. You don't need to be hardcore for that.
---
Truly the pinnacle of human achievement.
---
if you roll "need" on every single item, you ARE that person.
---
Reminds me of the faction heroes in Archeage.
---
&gt;but in reality, it could very easily be refined 
---
Refine meaning: "Changing game mechanics to accomodate the controller" Because, there is no other way.
---
&gt;succeed in this where many games fail
---
Skyrim succeeded as a console game. It still sucked as a PC game.
---
Definitely not warrior or rogue because they won't do shit without a raid weapon.
---
Hunter can be somewhat decent with a Bloodseeker just harassing people via kiting but I would still advise against it. 
---
Paladin will be shit because their pvp set isn't set up to heal and non tier pve healing gear isn't plate so you'll get blown up. 
---
That leaves the casters like other people are already saying. Elemental shaman could be decent in spurts with their cooldowns but the blue set is kinda weak wasting stats on ap and physical crit.
---
Also shout out to druid if you want to be a one man carry in WSG but all you can do is flag run.
---
Np.
---
Most people don't like their helmet models
---
1% dodge already sounded stupid back then, also the 8pc set bonus, heal for 500(?) when you vanish, the fuck? :D. 
---
Gotta love crooked stat weights and itemization of classic!
---
will they be like that when classic comes out?
---
I've never played on a private server but did play in vanilla/tbc/wotlk/cata/mop ... bfa (skipped wod/legion due to wife agro - play much less now so she's not as bothered).
---
Looking forward to dabbling in Classic, don't think it will overtake my Retail playtime tho, not enough time for both, and retail is just faster for altoholics like me :)
---
I'll be honest - I *loved* Vanilla, but I would *love* even more knowing that TBC was coming out again, after a decent period of Naxx.
---
What is this even. Tell them you do not play retail because you do not enjoy the game. No need to /ignore them or make a new account lmao. Weak
---
Unless you buy it from the crooked PServer GMs
---
I agree, it is more a statement on what will happen than what should be changed. Although I don't look forward to the times when I am almost at the dungeon that is super far away and suddenly the tank decides he can't make it and the group falls apart when I am 20 minutes into my run to SM. I feel like people forget about memories like that when thinking of vanilla.
---
Really? When a buddy of mine told me about Nostalrius PvE server when it first released I didnt know what to think. After getting 3 characters to 60 and raiding with 2 of them I realized you really can come home sometimes. It definitely isnt for everyone but it can be a blast. 
---
With that said, good luck and Godspeed to anyone rolling dps and planning on being more of a PvE player. Times, they were tough for dps even on private servers. Instantly get into groups as a tank and healer. Anything else...well you better hope you have some CC or you're in a guild that runs stuff regularly
---
Better make friends with a Warlock
---
That said, I like all the crazy portal ways one can take to get around the world. It‚Äôs cool having engineering wormholes, previous expansion content portals, hs, garrison, etc. to get from place to place. I just don‚Äôt like that I can fly specifically where I want from there. 
---
Even in classic world. Knowing which zep/boat went where and when it made more sense to go to gromgol and north vs tirisfal and south, for example.
---
&gt; Personally I find gnome warriors far more memorable instead of humanWarrior123. 
---
I agree, but I still don't like playing a gnome, or even playing with gnomes to some extent (although that can't be helped, rather gnomes than undead). They have annoying fucking voices and are tiny enough that you can barely see the character. They also look really silly swinging huge two handed weapons around, which is what you would be using in PvP. 
---
Especially male gnomes, does anyone not hate them? At least the female ones can look a bit cute.
---
I've been interested in maybe pally healing too. I have a hang up on itemization; not being able to wear plate all the time with healer stats. 
---
Anyone have advice? Do I just need to swallow the sour pill?
---
Actually they probably should make us purchase the game because they probably put more work into it than what they put into BFA...
---
Removed per rule 1.
---
If you made an original game based on this concept, I‚Äôd buy it immediately.
---
I think they will do TBC for sure... Then depending maybe they will do WotLK
---
No.  All you have to have is a general WoW subscription.  You can play on WoW servers without buying the latest expansion (you just don't have access to new content) so it stands to reason that you'll be able to play Classic without having to be up to date on expansions.
---
The Achievement is broken into 2 parts. Most active players get the 1st part rep/quests/achv done well before part 2 is even added to the game. In BFA, part 2 will be released along with patch 8.2 which doesn't have a release date yet and that still has another small rep grind associated with it.
---
I'd rather it be painful in westfall than have shards, the removal of quality of life additions that made the game shallower is a big part of classic.
---
LONG time pally player (mostly prot/holy)
---
Paladins have the easiest time with threat, unless of course you crit like a monster. But even then...at a certain point...you do have bubble to drop aggro if needed...but you shouldnt have aggro longer than a taunt CD...i noticed the only time i ever pull aggro is massive holy shock crits. 
---
HolyPally is really slow utility healer. But in my opinion...has always been my favorite when it comes to saving the group/raid from a wipe lol.
---
because the flying cat has already been let out of the bag. pandoras box has been opened, and if you don't do the grind to get flying in modern WoW, you're gimping yourself. it should have never even have been an option.
---
The level 40 ground mount is SUCH a good reward at the perfect time. God what a game.
---
You will love the experience more if you go in fresh without trying a private server. The main draw for us private server nerds is the nostalgia you won't have that going into it. It'll be all FRRRRRRRRESSSSSSSSH
---
Siema from ≈Åom≈ºa
---
Niice!
---
I'm kinda glad these aren't the actual t1s lol
---
Awesome.  I dunno why i thiught theyd require you to be up to date, but i guess i just assumed the worst of actiblizz
---
Dang! Those are actually really good! You have a good eye for scenic settings. I'd totally make one of those my desktop background.
---
I played all of vanilla and quit about 3 months into TBC, many reasons why but main thing is I just didn't have as much fun in TBC as in vanilla. I was really angry at blizzard back then and thought they had ruined the game lol, I was even asking for "pre-tbc servers" on the forums in mid 2007. Just different tastes I guess, and I know TBC is probably the most popular iteration of WoW
---
The funniest thing is, you save what 10?15? Minutes in the raid from the buff tops. You spend 10 extra minutes running as a raid group and waiting around. Offsetting the time spent most of the time.
---
/wave
---
Ironic.
---
Indeed. World of Warcraft will definitely be the top game on twitch for a long time to come with the addition of Classic
---
yeah, I've got part 1 already.
---
and depending onwhether Classic is released before or after BFA 8.2, I may or may not get part 2.
---
I would agree that they can feel a little awkward to play if you're coming from one of the more *standard* races (human/orc).
---
Personally I love the aesthetics, silliness and all.  Sort of seems like one of those things where people either pick something similar to their own fantasy (strong human) or something totally different to really capture the fantasy aspect (gnome, female dwarf, female troll, etc).  I'm also the type to prefer lesser played roles/races (all else being relatively equal), so maybe i'm just hipster...
---
After so many positive replies I think I will have to seriously reconsider that!
---
right click reporting
---
...that requires a soulshard and 2 other people not too dumb to click AND THEN NOT MOVE.
---
:D
---
I totally fucked over ND on it's release when i was 32 on my hunter i kited him to Westfall and watched as he destroyed every npc and player for the next 45 minutes until one iq300 player kited him over to the flight master and he died after killing one of the birds he summons.
---
Same, I want to know what servers they're playing on so I don't play there. Then for an extra kick in the teeth I want to go claim the names of the top streamers across as many servers as I can the first minute of launch day, and sell them later for gold.
---
I wait until I see the inevitable "need" and then I need it. BoP are different story. Most people pass on what they can't use.
---
I agree with this, but on the other hand Gnomes have awesome run and attack animations in my opinion. And because their so small, it feels like they run super fast and jump really high.
---
I‚Äôve seen people talk about downranking, what exactly is downranking?
---
Paladins are the easiest healer to gear pre-raid.
---
No one else can use plate Int get in 5 mans, hunters rarely want the shaman int gear (especially if it has +heal or +SP), leather and cloth are also options if those classes aren't present/don't need as well!
---
You will look a little odd, but it was so fast to gear reasonably well at 60 that I was raid ready with my alt pally VERY quickly.
---
If the raid schedule allows, you do that.
---
If not, you don#t bother.
---
If you assume everyone is equally skilled, and is skilled by the standards of 2019 then things get tough.
---
But by the time t2 is being farmed to bis level, non raiders will have r10, AV and wsg exalted and all their blue gear. By then, mc will be pugged.
---
A bus warrior with a healer is gonna fuck your shit up, if he knows what he‚Äôs doing.
---
That said, most classes with players who have at least gotten their pvp items will be able to hold their own if equally skilled, and have a decent shot at winning if they are better.
---
Rogues, Frost mages, hunters will be very capable naked or with blues/pvp items. 
---
Druids will still be able to run just fine. Sham/priest/pala players will need to play smarter than their opponents‚Äîbut certainly won‚Äôt be ineffective (play the flag, use los, bait, etc.)
---
Warriors in r10 with unstoppable force will still fuck up t2 clothies if you let them get close‚Äîbut they will fall over quickly without heals.
---
Once aq40 and naxx show up the disparity gets quite noticeable. But p2/3 should be relatively well balanced, with an edge to those who invest more time and effort, but not unfun or unfair to those who put in less.
---
The way farming works in vanilla is...diferent (for now i will skip walls).
---
Mage and prot paladin are arguably the best AoE farmers. Every material no matter the level is valuable, farming dungeons is valuable.
---
You go, pull everything and loot it with one click, you move to the next spot (something that is heavily restricted by having to loot one by one). You do that with many spots, and dungeons. 
---
Adding, aoe loot isn't simply an "few seconds" of QoL, these few seconds stack over the course of a farming time you planed to spend doing, let alone the bots and the paid farmers. It's not something you really explain, you have to experience it. But that QoL in the long run adds up so heavily that Mages and prot paladins will skyrocket in profit.
---
Especially if you dont have good gear, killing a single mob takes time in this game, something a Mage or Paladin don't care about. Then there is world PvP, which is something that cant catch you off-guard while you don't have to check every monster one by one. 
---
Low level dungeons, and for example cloth farming. You go in, pull ALL the way to the end, Aoe&gt;Click once, port out repeat. Dungeon timer kicks in, you go out and for the next few hour you move from hot spot to hot spot. 
---
That is just an example of how the "small amount of time" you gain from AoE loot, heavily boosts the performance of ONLY 2 classes that area already best for the job anyway. That "small amount of time" stacks, and in 5 hours, it will be like you farmed for 8. This is why it's not a simple change, but even if it was, its still a deviation of a core mechanic. You do it once, good luck stopping the horde of "my turn" babies.
---
I have doubts that the big streamers like Asmon and Soda would roll PvE. Even if it would make sense to do so, they have their egos to maintain.
---
I cannot speak for the other classes but if you are considering rogue. 
---
Blues is a loosely defined term. Are you talking pre-raid BIS blues or the rank 10-ish blue pvp set? Depending on class, if you can muster the time, the blue pvp sets are very good for some classes and at least serviceable for most. 
---
I got my rogue to rank 10 or 11 in vanilla, high enough that I got the mount but no epic gear. So I had the blue set and although I had less AP than tier 1&amp;2 rogues due to not having as much agility, the gear had lots of health (for rogue gear) and decent amounts of crit. 
---
Going under the assumption that this a 1v1 encounter, you would be the rogue in blues, and generalizing as I am not going to be able to theory craft every variable. 
---
Against t2 opponents. From my personal experience on rogue in vanilla: VS rogue, opener wins as t2 doesn't give much health. 
---
VS paladin, priest, you'll never kill them, but rogue doesn't pick fights that aren't to its advantage. 
---
VS warrior, mage, druid, shaman, maybe. Probably not but in the blue pvp set it was mangable if you made the right plays which change VS each one and in some cases each spec. 
---
VS hunter, only if you are way better than the hunter and properly exploit the dead zone, frost reflect trap etc. Unlikely though. 
---
VS a t2 lock when you are in blues...lol the rogue should not have picked this fight. Maybe if you are really good, like perplexity levels of good, but doubtful. Especially if they are soul link or whatever its called. 
---
As well I know the set bonus for druid from the blue pvp set is really good. So you may be able to fight t2 players a rank 10 geared druid but I do not know for sure, and I doubt you'd be getting many killing blows.
---
Rolled need on corpsemaker this weekend. Shaman throws a hissy and disbands. Guess when asked I should have been more straight forward. But I did say I was not going to not need.
---
I like the chastity belt on the t16 lol
---
There are no Troll rogues
---
&gt; Cause its optimal and why not?
---
Because it's not required, simple as that. You don't have to play optimally. Optimally playing also means I need to dress in butt-ugly gear, instead of my awesomesauce tiersets, because the buttugly stuff is BiS.
---
My guild cleared the entire content in Vanilla. Not on a private server...in VANILLA. The real one.
---
We never once saved up on an Onyxia buff, or told someone to not turn in the head.
---
Poor gnomes, they already lost many to leprosy and now they have to deal with prejudice too.
---
Kinda like ranking up, but the exact opposite.
---
&gt; Refine meaning: "Changing game mechanics to accomodate the controller" Because, there is no other way.
---
Not at all. Mechanically speaking, Monster Hunter World on PC is exactly the same as it is on Console.
---
This isn't something like the discrepancy between Titanfall 2 (or CoD, or Overwatch, or any other FPS) on PC vs Console where the control scheme fundamentally alters the way people have to approach the game play, so much so that the game has to be balanced separately between Consoles and PC's. 
---
This is the UI we are talking about here, not the gameplay. I see 2 separate challenges here. Creating an intuitive, flexible, and quick method to select and use the desired ability. And create an inventory/character management system that is functional but not tedious to navigate.
---
Many, many games have achieved both on console. Not to sound like a broken record, but FFXIV, Monster Hunter World, hell to some extent even Dark Souls, Outward, and even (in some respects) Diablo 3 have managed to simplify some of these ideas into easy-to-use, quick-to-navigate options  that Blizzard could easily utilize to accomplish a solid Console UI that gives players freedom, flexibility, and function.
---
boats and flight paths are different than teleporting to any city you want, and not even having to walk to a portal to get into a dungeon.
---
nobody uses the Deeprun Tram anymore in BFA. nobody even goes in there unless they are going to fight at the Brawler's Guild. it's a shame.
---
A friend of mine played a Gnome rogue back during TBC and she had such an advantage during pvp, because she was such a small target.
---
I just picture a warlock running through the woods DOTing everything in sight with a druid healer keeping the HOTs up and going bear if he catches aggro from heals.
---
It would be nice if I knew a group willing to carry me. But as a mostly solo player, any pug on a challenging heroic only takes mage shaman and hunter or rogue.
---
My first thought is always "why?". You rarely kill things fast enough for it to be all that helpful.
---
Sure, I've AoE farmed as frost in vanilla and as a 'lock in TBC, but that was for specific purposes and not 'normal' gameplay.
---
Personally, I don't care much for it from an immersion point of view ‚Äî but will accept that it is mainly because it never was part of the game when I played retail (quit in Cata).
---
Honestly I quite disagree with this. Do you really want to convince me that say, Wrath warrior set looks better than things in BfA right now? Because that's a little bit ridiculous.
---
It did tho, some guy earlier showed the he had it.
---
All's well that ends well, so fuck you and have a nice day. Lol jk (8 mile quote), all good.
---
I'm a casual player (6-20 hours / week depending on work), 25 years old from Sweden that will be rolling Horde on a EU-PvP server.  
---
I'm gonna play the game to explore, socialize and kill alliance scum!  
---
I'm playing League of Legends (D3 on euw) and Apex if anyone want to play some before classic comes!  
---
PM on discord @ Skadarn#7775
---
If you want to play Mage, play Mage. As a duo you will stomp everything in your way no matter which class you pick, and while loot is an argument, I don't think it outweighs you having fun on the way to 60.
---
Mages and Warlocks are also preferred DPS classes in leveling dungeons, so I don't think you will have an issue forming groups. Maybe you can set stat priorities on loot, in the sense that the Warlock gets the stamina gear and the mage the Cloth drops with only int.
---
So the issue is not that flying made the world smaller and destroyed will PVP, it's that the subsequent gating of flying in each successive expansion does not work because players brains have been trained to get more and more rewards faster and faster with each expansion, and the idea of suddenly having to work again to re earn something they already had is the definition of anti fun.
---
Well if players have a problem with blizzard expecting them to find meaning in having to regrind for flying over and over again every single expansion, I wonder how on Earth players are going to find meaning in the endgame game of vanilla, while grinding for 3 hours might earn them one or two upgrades, which can be hard for them to accept if they are coming from Battle for Azeroth where grinding for 3 hours after hitting maximum level earns them a bucket full of upgrades.
---
Not everyone will have this problem. But it's definitely something a lot of people are not prepared for.
---
Guybrush made a similar (probably derivative) spread sheet for 1.12.1 that has all the appropriate 1.12 stats. You should  consider using that as a base instead since so much of the 1.2 stats are way low compared to what they will be.
---
I'm probably playing human, because I'm boring :P 
---
But mostly because I feel comfortable with the models. When I will be spending hundreds of hours looking at them they don't have to be super exciting, the important thing is that I don't get annoyed by them, which is why human is safest. 
---
I like dwarfs and orcs too though. So it's not that I hate more "interesting" races. Just going with the one i feel most comfortable with, at least for my main.
---
I mean a lot of people had that question during vanilla re: why get new gear at all, but that's not what I'm talking about.
---
You're acting like it's an individual decision that I made, I'm not talking about me, I'm talking about the WoW community as a whole at the time and the things people were doing and saying. All raiding, not just Naxx, was on the low because people wanted to enjoy their summer instead of worrying about a video game, especially before a highly anticipated xpac. I had connections that were already raiding Naxx because I had a good reputation on my server and they were willing to take me when my guild decided to take the summer off instead.
---
Furthermore, who needs a good excuse to not do a raid? The only excuse you need is that you don't want to do it, lol. I know you're trying really hard to make people feel bad about something that happened 13 years ago but I find it really hard to care.
---
If you as an individual would not make those same decisions then cool, but it does nothing to change what was actually going on at the time.
---
Flying was fine when it was locked to The Outlands
---
looks like a chastity belt
---
Yeah, the only good thing about gnomes is how they do special attacks like heroic strike. The rest is meh.
---
Fuck everything that came after the original game. One of the old heads that was done after hitting 70 here myself lol.
---
You would act as ninja looter then.
---
It doesn't matter if it's BoE or not. If it fits to your class or profession then need it. Otherwise greed.
---
Seems like a long-winded way to say you hate gnomes =).
---
Definitely get that, I know I tried Goblin on retail and actually started hating it for very similar reasons.  Both those races are the extremes so it's definitely less of a "safe" pick and can bite you if you're not fully into it.
---
Pretty sure they‚Äôre using 7.4 unless something changed.
---
You said this better than I could ever hope to.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how much anyone has played.
---
Unstoppable force is comparable to every raid wep until aq40 outside of Ashkandi and BRE.
---
Lobotomizer is from rep, there are two other blue daggers available from pvp rep. Further, felstriker is purchasable on the AH. 
---
And it isn‚Äôt as though ironfoe or krolblade are terribly hard to get. 
---
Rogues don‚Äôt even need good weps, just thistle tea and prep.
---
I don't care about AoE looting, but I sure as hell want one-click autoloot instead of holding shift to autoloot. For the sake of my pinky.
---
Ive been playing holy paladin on a pserver for a while now and can say for the most part you will not be using much plate if any at all. Tier 1, 2, and 2.5 are all sub-par for healing and most of the raid healing gear is either cloth or leather. Currently the only plate items I am using on the Naxxramas patch is Legplates of Blazing Light from AQ40 and Peacekeeper Gauntlets from ZG. Hope this helps. :)
---
Can I just say the Old Bloodfang set looks hilarious specifically because the Shoulders look like 3 pairs of shoulders all worn on-top of one another. 
---
It's like a Rogue was like "These shoulders are good, but I need more stats... how can I make that happen. I know! Wear another Pair! But wait, those druids are already doing that... I can't be unoriginal. OH! I got it! I'll wear **3** pairs of shoulders! PERFECT!"
---
If you can Need it. Need it.
---
If you can Greed it. Need it.
---
If you can't Need it, Greed it.
---
Ha! Weren‚Äôt we all back then? I miss those days.  I really hope Classic can bring back that feeling!
---
I hope classic even if they add new content never turns into tbc again. Most of the oldest players do not want tbc they want something entirely different than the direction history took the game..which is the only reason classic is comin out..people like that..the ogs
---
Thank you!
---
You know, you can just jump+charge. I jump so often I don't even see the difference.
---
I'll be doing this but with a sweet sweet tauren
---
PvP is fine, but the fact that player levels affect your hit chance makes it extremely tedious. Like a guy 5 levels above you attacks. You already know your chances are small if not even possible to fight back.
---
Or the fact that high level players camp lowbie areas.
---
But the first issue is my gripe with world PvP and always will be. It's bullshit and unnecessary.
---
&gt;Seems like a long-winded way to say you hate gnomes =).
---
Don't worry, I hate male night elves and undead even more.
---
The stoneform thing is debatable, and depends on the matchup. I def prefer escape artist, except maybe against a rogue or a shadow priest. The base stats however, nobody cares.
---
It did change, the beta is based on 8.2.
---
there are times where that still doesn't make you tall enough or if you are trying to snap charge a target that just ran around a corner.  It's more of an issue than you might think.
---
To add on to this, it makes finishing the dungeon and working with your group more important. You can‚Äôt just leave or kick someone and keep goong 5 mins later, it is a big investment to find people and get there.
---
&gt;Mechanically speaking, Monster Hunter World on PC is exactly the same as it is on Console.
---
Then this game is much simpler than a typical PC game in terms of mechanics, simple as that.
---
&gt;have managed to simplify some of these ideas into easy-to-use, quick-to-navigate options 
---
And did it occur to you that we don't WANT this simplification in our game?
---
Did it occur to you that things like seeing a bigger bag-frame when we equip a bigger bag is part of the game experience of WoW Classic, and that we LIKE that experience?
---
If it did occur to you, then you should understand why I strongly oppose any notion of adapting WoW on consoles.
---
Put this on Kickstarter and make millions.
---
Its simple.
---
WORST leveling class. But then...
---
If you tank and dedicate yourself in doing so, you will be God among lesser men.
---
PvP, same story but with gear, you will suck, but once you gather that gear, you are completely overpowered monstrosity. In group PvP or with a pocket healer, there is nothing in the game that gets even close to a geared warrior.
---
Also if you are horde, LITERALLY every plate piece goes to you.
---
If you want to DPS, you need to show some dedication first. You will be a tank most of the time, but if you push hard enough and eventually gear yourself to be a DPS, then you should know that Fury warrior is one if not the best DPS in the game.
---
I know i probably boosted you morale, but be prepared, this class requires IMMENSE dedication.
---
Flying mounts were dumb. Vanilla wins by default.
---
Do you want to tank raids? Play a warrior.
---
Ya I am thinking a pally in PVE blues supporting a team of HCs with heals, BoF, Cleanse, etc would still be effective even against HC players.
---
I don't remember it being turned on. Was it on for very long?
---
embarrass
---
Yeah you quickly learn to never give anybody the benefit of the doubt.  
---
I remember once just trotting along coming across a rogue fighting a mob, /wave, he /wave's back, i thought okay cool he's friendly.  
---
20 seconds later im questing/farming a little bit away from him, then get a ambush in the back. Fucking typical.
---
One of my raid members when we were progressing in hard mode Ulduar player with a DualShock controller.
---
He did bonkers dps, never missed an interrupt and I never witnessed keyboard turning. I think he is an exception, though. He played with a controller to make the game ‚Äúsomewhat hard‚Äù and is generally brilliant at every game I play with him in.
---
The rule that rules them all:
---
Talk to your group at the beginning of the dungeon. Example: If you're a Paladin healing, tell them that you will also need on twohanders because you need them to level efficiently.
---
The second important rule:
---
Need on every Boe. Gear, mats, recipes. Even if you don't have the profession yet. In Vanilla people often level a profession because of a dropped recipe (leveling to 300 is not such a big deal, getting that 1% recipe is).
---
However, this doesn't mean that you can't negotiate with your group after the loot is distributed. Ask the player who won the roll if he or she would like to give it to you, or offer to buy it for a reasonable price.
---
Rule number 3, and this is what some people will not immediately get in classic: Sometimes there aren't enough Quest-items dropped in a single dungeon run, which is a problem if more than one member is on the quest. Do not underestimate how pissed people can get if you grab all quest items for yourself.
---
Mage. Won't win fights but you can survive and control people for a solid 15 seconds before you are out of Mana.
---
For what its worth Rosewine isn't in until 1.10 which I think is phase 5.
---
If there were a way to make a new expansion without killing old content that would be amazing. The problem is they wouldn't be able to increase the level cap. So I have no clue what they would add. I've still had a great load of fun in other expansions but yea that feeling of all this gear I worked towards obtaining is now removed with greens immediately sucks. 
---
Catch up mechanics I feel the same way about, cause they do kill old content as well.
---
I don‚Äôt know that I can think of anything worse than someone pointing out a typo (of which you can obviously tell what the intended word was), then acting smugly superior to the kind of people that point out typos. Not to mention the fact that you think someone on the internet is somehow concerned with putting themselves in the ‚Äúcrosshairs‚Äù if someone like you.
---
I hope in time that you‚Äôll realize what an idiot you‚Äôve been.
---
Shoot this reminds me - Azeroth has TWO moons from 1.1 to 1.10, and then the smaller moon disappeared until pre-Pandaria patch.        
---
        
---
Will Classic WoW have two moons or one? This seems like something that's probably been answered somewhere by now. I hope it's two.
---
Witch blade is a dungeon item and better.
---
No, that's how you prevent ninja looting.
---
Also, let's say the item is worth ~100g.
---
If you actually need this item and you win it, then you've just made 100g by not having to buy it from AH.
---
If you have no use for it and win it, then you can make 100g by selling it on AH.
---
You're not needing on an item, you're needing on 100g. And ***everyone*** needs 100g.
---
How is this anything but fair?
---
Fuck the casual scum don't play an mmorpg and go play an action game. That's like me being like "bro the witcher 3 sucked too much talking and quest line nonsense can cyberpunk just be all fighting I'm so sick of having to interact with the world" and just because the idiotic masses join in on the opinion agreeing that the changes made sense. Yeah from a business standpoint but anyone who thinks video games haven't gotten shittier when the business overides the art (like currently compared to 96-08) is lying to themselves
---
There's no arguing with the brainless \#NoChanges kiddies. Quit while you're behind.
---
If they added AoE looting, even if they made it an opt-in feature in the settings menu, I doubt anyone except the truly reee-tastic among this community would actually care at the end of the day.
---
They don't like any opinion that isn't their own, and try to gatekeep you from being apart of those who wanted Classic to come back as if it's impossible for someone to have played Nostalrius, signed the petition, and also have some desire for a little bit of minor, optional QoL polishing. Like it's unfathomable to them that someone loves Classic just as much as they do, but might want to benefit from something trivial that doesn't affect core gameplay experience/nostalgia. These \#NoChanges people need to get over themselves.
---
No way
---
Why is mara split into "purple" and "orange" crystals? You might want to merge those two. My choice is Maraudon, not Maraudon Purple side or Orange side exclusively - it's the entirety of Maraudon. So, you can mark that down somehow perhaps. Mara is my favorite vanilla dungeon. I can see why Dire Maul would be split into North/East and what not, as it's actually different instances, but all of mara can be accessed and completed through either dungeon entrance, and it's awesome. 
---
I'm going to have to pick BRD since I can't pick Mara, with Mara coming in as 2/3/4.
---
100% okay. If there‚Äôs a rogue in your group it‚Äôd be polite to mention that you plan to roll but regardless it‚Äôs fine.
---
If there is gear you can wear and you benefit from it, roll.  Though there is better gear than shadowcraft.
---
In classic, as you level new ranks of spells become unlocked. They generally cost more mana but do more damage/heal more damage/give more stats.        
---
          
---
In some cases, the mana efficiency (i.e. healing per mana) decreases at higher levels. In other cases, especially in early levels, lower spell 'ranks' have a faster cast time  than higher ranks of the same spell (ie frostbolt).        
---
           
---
Downranking is the act of casting a spell at one of its lower,  cheaper, less effective levels. This can be done to preserve mana pools for a long fight, but apply on-hit effects without wasting a lot of mana, etc.
---
Sure, it's really blizzard's fault for not providing proper feral itemization.
---
I don't have to agree with a thing to respect it.
---
Warrior is the big dum no needum 5% int oogabooga
---
Flying sucks hard, it kills every outdoor pvp which is what makes this game so thrilling for my taste. I‚Äôve stopped playing tbc due to flying mounts.
---
Great game
---
I'm pretty sure the other dude is wrong. I tried PoM-sheeping people while slow falling and, mind you it was a long time ago, I do no think that it worked. 
---
You could fire blast and PoM Pyro them though. Got a few kills on AFKs when that combo would crit.
---
I believe Feral Druids typically got Wildheart instead for upgrade purposes, but if you need it, you need it. Besides, that armor won't even be in the game until phase 5 or so, so it's hardly a meaningful concern in terms of your teammates needing it. You'll all presumably have better gear by then, and if you don't and don't want to compete, just don't bring a Rogue in your group.
---
idk how law works.... but i have a feeling they wouldnt be so accepting.  
---
I feel like theyd just be like "sweet. this is ours now"
---
I was over 1,9k rating with almost every class in mop pvp and i raided most content from wotlk to bfa. Still when i played warrior on classic the stance only abilities are hard to get used to xD thats how i feel.. other thing is that i have no idea how does playing as a tank in classic feels like :)
---
Hey everyone I am just posting the results for the recent WoW Classic Survay MkII.

If you want to see more like this or want to see what I am up to in the future. Follow me on Twitch @MarkTatsu. If you want to join in the discord and play HoTS until Classic launches come on in. I am trying to stream on Thursday nights pacific standard time.
---
I can almost guarantee that Classic WoW will be it's own game on Twitch.
---
Hey, Atleast youll get boned?
---
why you ask?
---
The game will run using Intel HD graphics but you are talking pretty marginal framerates at the best of times. I wouldn't recommend it, there's a strong chance you won't find the experience enjoyable.
---
Amazing quality and skill. Absolutely incredible. Make your own version, Kickstarter it, *workyourassoff* , and retire!
---
Absolutely. The boots are even pre-raid for bear tanks.
---
Can't agree with that, alot of things that were introduced in TBC was a turn for the worse in terms of game design. Flying mounts and outland effectively killed world pvp and the life on Azeroth. Daily quests were introduced which is just boring and lazy game design encouraging people to go to the same places and do the same things every day. Resilience gear, a design choice i personally disagree with. Don't get me wrong i really enjoyed TBC and it had alot of good things too, but to say that it's better in terms of game design highly debatable.
---
Those people bothered me so much.
---
Shadowcraft will be in game day 1, its the dungeon 1 set. you are thinking of the "tier 0.5" dungeon 2 upgrade set. which was an amazing questline anyway.
---
Then don't. 
---
If you want sharding, retail wow is there waiting for you.
---
I mained a rogue during vanilla, and the answer is yes
---
I want to but i heard that the time that a raid takes in vanilla is an avarage 8-10 hour xD my raid times were limited to 6 hours and we did mythic progress too.
---
Character names are only server based, always have been. So all names will be available on each new classic server added presumably, just like retail.
---
I've played WoW Retail on a similar laptop, was pretty fine. But don't expect it to handle large battlegrounds and raids.
---
Fucking A.
---
Cracks me up how one of the biggest arguments for vanilla over the expansions was how it was about the whole experience, not just the endgame at max level, but in this subreddit everyone's going on about how they're going to burn their vacation time to poopsock their way to 60 in two and a half hours.  I am completely unable to relate to that mentality...
---
The world record for bwl speed clear is like 24 min.
---
Ah, okay. Neato. Definitely a brain fart there.
---
And that's fine. I was just expressing my take on the 2 games but I fully appreciate that not everyone feels the same.
---
Take enchanting and roll need on everything.
---
Most of the time the only thing you will have to do with stances (PvE) wise is to time it for berserker rage to prevent fear, without also getting hit. You will get used to it. And once you do, you will hate the fact blizzard removed them. Its IMO the most unique aspect in the whole vanilla.
---
I would recommend finding something with a dGPU even for low settings as this is using the newer WOW client still, not the old Vanilla setup that could run on a literal potato.
---
Either that or find a used Ryzen laptop with at least a 2500U or 2700U for much beefier iGPU graphics.
---
isn't dungeon set 1 in the game from the start?
---
I very much dislike flying mounts but they're not as big a deal to me as they are to some.
---
this probably sounds stupid since it's vanilla and i'm a druid, but since i'm probably never gonna get any tier sets i'd like to get some semblance of matching gear, even if not all of it is bis or pre raid bis
---
Of course it will be a boon. There are people who will not play Retail, ie me. I will pay to play Classic.
---
So in general, raids only benefit a select few...and the hope is that the guild is capable of doing enough raids to benefit the entire guild?
---
&gt; Unstoppable force is comparable to every raid wep until aq40 outside of Ashkandi and BRE.
---
Or Spinal Reaper or Zinrokh but regardless it puts a hard cap on the amount of damage you can do and warrior is too gear reliant to be the class of choice for a pvp casual. 
---
&gt; Further, felstriker is purchasable on the AH. 
---
No it's a bop that drops in UBRS and is very rare.
---
&gt;And it isn‚Äôt as though ironfoe or krolblade are terribly hard to get. 
---
Ironfoe is terribly hard to get as it's a 2% drop chance and it's usually reserved by the tank. Krol blade will only get you so far. 
---
Warrior and rogue are two of the worst classes objectively for what OP is trying to do for the exact reason I already mentioned.
---
People still don't seem to realize that "slippery slope" is a fallacy. The assumed extrapolation to the extreme of potential consequences of adding something on a single-case basis lacking any evidence that such would occur or would be causal by the initial condition.
---
Isn't it obvious? AoE looting would immediately lead to an LFD tool being implemented, clearly.
---
Yeah, I had a goof. I was thinking of the upgrades.
---
Please at least get something that doesn‚Äôt have integrated graphics. I don‚Äôt want to see anyone have to suffer that badly.
---
Definitely, some people will inevitably throw a fit but as long as you are upfront about what you are intending to roll on before going into a dungeon group its certainly not a faux pas.
---
oh man, could you imagine if they factored in weather effects into the game. 
---
Sandstorm is low DoT, -hit%, -range
---
Rain as -movespeed, -hit%, reduced fire dmg
---
Snow --movespeed, -attackspeed, +physical dmg
---
all sorts of possibilities with various weather combinations
---
95% of the people on your server will be in the same boat as you. It's just that alot of people on this sub have dabbled in private servers at some point, and have done the whole 1-60 process much more recently. That's not going to be the case on a classic server. 
---
So look at it as an opportunity to re-discover the old game. Honestly, I wish I was more in your shoes than mine. I've played the old game a lot in the past 2 years so Classic won't be as brand new to me. But it is brand new in the sense that it's permanent this time.
---
Honestly, you have no frame of reference before those things were adopted in the game if you started after TBC released.
---
i remember that! it was so awesome
---
You should collect them all and post it to each one of these threads. It's hilarious (and would get even more so, as it gets longer). :)
---
Damn I didn't think about the gear thing.  I want to stick to. Starting class in the same zone so undead only for tirisfall.  I Don't feel like running a tauren all the way to brill, as many have suggested a druid.  
---
A rogue would be fun.  Interesting no one said Warrior.  I guess because of lack of heals.
---
bro that's hunter gear
---
TBC released Jan 16th, 2007. Patch 2.0.1 was the pre-patch with the new talents etc. Still a month of vanilla to use stones to summon people.
---
Well its mostly the standard 3 hour of raiding. No one (except some ofc...) will go for full clears on progress runs. Later you will clear both MC and ZG in like a hour and then go to BWL for example. Haven't changed in that aspect. If you can raid now, you can raid in classic.
---
**&lt;Drive&gt;** is a North American guild focused on progressing through end-game PvE content at a reasonably quick pace. We are aiming to reach max level within 4-5 weeks of launch and will start progression rapidly after doing so.

I'm going to haze the shit out of some horde.
---
I don't agree with you. The vanilla grind is good and actually meaningful, something missing in Lfg, wow token retail
---
My bad, thanks for pointing that out :)
---
The stones themselves were there, they were just used for group finding rather than actually summoning people.
---
this.
---
"guys how do I make the gf/wife cool with me taking off work and poopsocking Classic for a month straight"
---
if that's even a question, you probably shouldn't have a girlfriend or wife in the first place. and God help your children if you have any.
---
The daily routine of farming Karma involves making sure the circlejerk is fed.
---
Then where's the evidence to support AoE looting leading to some further disliked change? What direct causal link to a change people dislike in the game is there to the introduction of AoE looting? I can't think of any.
---
You can't blanket apply the logic of "if they add any one QoL change they will then add all of these others!" because it's fallacious.
---
Same, alliance mage with HS set in Theramore.
---
Hey as long as you find meaning in it that's what matters
---
If you get stuck and we somehow end up on the same server... I'm in!
---
To be honest, i would be really sad if we live in a world where pointing out a mistake someone made is bad.
---
Even more sad if its bad eventho the person did it in a very non-confrontational way.
---
And even more sad if you think what i said was in some way ment to hurt anyone or make me sound "superior".
---
He fell for it.
---
No, it was yellow-gold. It was later made red before it was scrapped.
---
I was leveling my Paladin in STV and anytime I'd start attacking something, it would die instantly. It was a Night Elf Rogue that was just tailing me and killing things for me. His name was Keatonfox and he was just bored, he helped me level for like 6 hours in STV, and would gank anyone who tried to kill me, which was hilarious. 
---
We were really good friends all the way through to the mid of TBC when he just suddenly went offline and never came back. He was a badass dude. Was a very memorable day in my life of WoW when I met that rogue that was my "OP Paladin Pet." 
---
Another memorable moment was outside the entrance to ZF, my buddy Maezin, also a paladin, and my room mate at the time, we had just finished a ZF run and were gonna go do some other shit. We zone out, and there are some horde there. 
---
A 40 something Shaman, 60 Shaman, and 4x druid. I was level 48 I think, and Maezin was in his early 50s. We were able to kite them away from the entrance and kill them all, 2v3. Two paladins, vs 2 Shamans and a Druid. It was the most incredible PvP moment I can remember. Shortly after that a few more horde showed up and killed us, then we rallied the forces and had some more alliance show up, and for the next hour or so no one could get into or out of ZF without going through some PvP. Fucking love it.
---
This was the normal version, heroic was black and red.
---
Really? I did the same and am even *more* hooked now.
---
Gods be damned. I dont have time to no life this game again!
---
If it‚Äôs red it‚Äôs dead.
---
Each expansion was different than Vanilla, but I think the most harm to the game occurred with Cataclysm when the leveling process became simplified, and world flying made most of the world content irrelevant. 
---
At least TBC had expansion zone flying only and WOTLK's looking for dungeon was still with people from your own realm. TBC and WOTLK did provide some QOL changes that were positive with professions and class mechanics, spell rotations, and talent trees. The raiding in both expansions were also great story telling with fairly tuned mechanics. 
---
Once the Vanilla world content was diluted in Cataclysm and cross realm LFG activities made the community reputation irrelevant the game was over.
---
This post just reminds me of my choice of trying to stay horde as I have been for years or roll the paladin I truly want to main.
---
Form your own group amigo. This has always been my answer when I'm playing a less desirable role. Even while tanking I often form my own groups just so I get to pick and choose. Its easy peasy once you do it a few times.
---
You can't talk to the other faction to tell them you're better than they are so the only way to do that is wait for them to gank you and then melt their face off
---
Id rather have LFD than a million "non-essential game play changes"
---
You cant point to any evidence of how its a fallacy, since its impossible. You are dealing with lots of people here, you arent asking me only of whether the should or shouldn't be "insert small change". Also i like how you go from one extreme to another with your example. Ever heard of the phrase "Its the small stones that turn the car over"?
---
Who are you to tell me how i should define "single-case basis"? So come now, show me evidence that it wont go the slippery slope, are you blizzard to throw the glove and say "we are done after this small change,forever" or are you one of them "in my opinion, this is fine, so fuck Joe's opinion, mine is enough"?

Barrens isn't a PvP zone but ok
---
On a pserver a couple weeks ago I had someone saying something about summoning someone to Deadmines, but the warlock wasn't there yet, and then I realized the Warlock wasn't 20 yet. Turns out he wanted to summon using the meeting stone and I had to inform him that we weren't playing TBC.
---
You would have to travel anyway so it doesn't mather. Just start the raid 10min earlier at city instead of 10min later at the raid.
---
And if the buff prevents 1 whipe you gained more then 10min, plus the additional kill speed.
---
Also warlocks don't have to summon the lazy guys.
---
Im not trying to make you feel bad, you feeling how ever you feel about the truth is on you... Im just simply pointing out the truth that you're trying to hide... If someone doesn't do a raid its because they can't not because "oh i dont feel like it"... Legit thats the most casual thing iv ever heard anyone say ever... "im not gonna raid this because my gear will be obsolete in the future expansion."
---
Wintergrasp had no flying during the event, and that's where I spent most of my time. 
---
I never really understood the PVP complaints about flying. Any class can surprise you, if they're behind you. That's not unique to flying.
---
*Single target only
---
Shadowcraft is good as a placeholder for rogues at best, pre raid BiS doesn‚Äôt have a single piece of shadowcraft.
---
For pvp some pieces might be good though. Either way it would be polite to avoid rogues in your group, or inform them beforehand.
---
Or as a part two to your comment, *not* having everybody be on ground mounts. It takes a long time to get your 40 mount, even, as opposed to getting a motorcycle at level 1 in the modern game.
---
It's a hard line to walk, you need more content that is more difficult than current content without releasing items that make all the old items/content completely irrelevant. It's tricky to continue to advance in a game without having some kind of power creep
---
He said it's paid leave. I mean, I have like 4 times the paid leave of my SO due to the professional nature of my job. Could be a situation like that.
---
You could split the difference between priest and warrior and go shaman? Multiple rolls, grace of air for her. If you've never played one they are a blast. Lots of utility
---
Did they ever fix the blatant hacking and cheating. I uninstalled after me and my buds spent hours upon hours building and stockpiling only to have a guy floating through the air headshotting us from 100ft high then come in and take everything we'd worked for. He did this multiple times over the course of a week or two until we were as poor as brand new characters
---
And I'd also like to point out the hypocrisy in your statement... "It was wow community as a whole" then you said "I had connections that were already raiding naxx" So obviously people were raiding it but you say they also weren't??? Proving my point more...
---
Probably just the one since we're gonna be on patch 1.12
---
I'm close to rolling a rogue but torn between a mage and still even now a.... warrior.
---
Whatever class it'll be Undead though.
---
Yeah, even on PServers, (horde) we had our hearthstones SET to kargath for BWL/MC days, and for Ony resets, we met in Org for Ony head/nef buffs.
---
Traveling to instances doesn't take long if people are motivated.
---
I really feel like they designed Warrior to be leveled with another class. You start to feel like you can take on the world once you have a pocket healer. You can start pulling enough mobs to take enough damage to generate enough rage to use your abilities. It makes me wonder if leveling played any part in class designs or if they just designed them for max level play.
---
Link it, boy.
---
Without dungeon/raid finder I wouldn‚Äôt have experienced MoP. I came back to quest for the story, casually did the raids for the story and a little loot, and left after getting a few reps exalted. Had a really good time that wouldn‚Äôt have happened without those features. 
---
That being said, I‚Äôm excited for having to use chat to form a group and the idea that if someone is wearing the loot they earned it the hard way - not a different color version from LFR.

Will the set bonus restore energy for a cat too?
---
Spells in Vanilla have ranks. Downranking is when you use a lower rank of a spell for whatever reason (usually to save mana).
---
For example, Earth Shock Rank 1 costs 30 mana, deals 17 to 19 damage, and interrupts spellcasting. Earth Shock Rank 7 costs 450 mana, deals 517 to 545 damage, and interrupts spellcasting. The difference between the two is just mana cost and damage output. Both ranks interrupt spellcasting. This means you can use Earth Shock Rank 1 to interrupt spells instead of Rank 7, and by doing so you will save mana. (This has additional benefits in PvE. Earth Shock has a 2x threat modifier, meaning if you deal 100 damage you generate 200 threat. Since Rank 1 deals low damage, you generate less threat. TL;DR You can use Earth Shock Rank 1 to interrupt in dungeons without immediately pulling aggro.)
---
There are tons of spells, like Earth Shock, that you can choose to downrank for one reason or another. I play Shaman and have R1 Lightning Bolt (cheap way to fish for Clearcasting procs), Healing Wave (cheap way to fish for Ancestral Healing procs or stack Healing Way), Magma Totem (to get Rogues out of Stealth), Stoneclaw Totem (to get Rogues out of Stealth), Earth Shock (Interrupt), and Frost Shock (Slow) keybound in addition to their max rank counterparts, for example. I have both ranks bound because sometimes you want to use Rank 1 and sometimes you want to use the max rank.
---
Healers also downrank their healing spells to conserve mana, making up for the loss in raw healing output by stacking +Healing on their gear. The more +Healing you have, the lower ranks you can use (to a point - something something spell coefficients, not really relevant).
---
I don't approve of hazing. Terrible practice.
---
I *do* approve of ganking. All's fair in love and war. Lok'tar Ogar, Alliance scum!
---
Thought you couldn‚Äôt transfer back then
---
Don't worry, perdition blades glow enough
---
He has no idea what he's saying. His noob is showing.
---
My favourite one too!
---
&gt; Then this game is much simpler than a typical PC game in terms of mechanics, simple as that.
---
Simpler in what context? You were talking about game mechanics specifically? I interpreted that to mean gameplay mechanics. For WoW, this means positioning your character and selecting the appropriate ability at the appropriate time. For Monster Hunter, this means positioning your character and using the proper attack or item at the appropriate time. The only difference here is that Monster Hunter is a full real-time experience and WoW operates in a semi-real-time environment with a 'tick' system (I'm sure there is a more appropriate word or phrase to describe the system but it's slipping my mind for now) but imo that's a negligible difference in this conversation.
---
If you are talking Simpler in terms of something else, like stat depth or something, I'm not really sure if that applies to this specific concept I'm talking about.
---
&gt; And did it occur to you that we don't WANT this simplification in our game?
---
First off, you wouldn't be required to play the game on consoles, so how does this affect you if you wouldn't have already done so.
---
Secondly, the only simplification that would be needed would be in regards to button mapping, so to circle back to our previous part of the discussion, any 'simplification' for the console version wouldn't change the core gameplay mechanics at all.
---
&gt; Did it occur to you that things like seeing a bigger bag-frame when we equip a bigger bag is part of the game experience of WoW Classic, and that we LIKE that experience?
---
It is entirely possible to keep the inventory screen/interface this way. There is no reason to think that this wouldn't be viable honestly. I don't see any issues in leaving the "Bag" system as is, the only difference being that the Console players would probably not have the option of opening each bag individually. 
---
&gt; If it did occur to you, then you should understand why I strongly oppose any notion of adapting WoW on consoles.
---
Unfortunately, I still don't understand this. How would this directly affect you, specifically, in any way. 
---
It's fairly obvious that you would not play the console version, so I don't understand why it matters to you why a version of the game be adapted for consoles. I would think that most people would be glad to have more people to share the WoW experience with. I would think that more people playing WoW classic would bolster Blizzard's outlook on it as a whole and potentially lead to more positive developments such as progression servers and such.
---
The only "blatant" cheating now is aimbots / ESP. There is no flying allowed by character models. The solution for this is to stay off the Facepunch-official servers and instead play on other officials, like Rusty Moose and Rustified. These groups have servers all around the world and active admins that work to quickly ban any cheaters. That being said, I encounter one maybe 1 a wipe, and his reign of terror is usually over pretty quickly if you report them. Overall a pleasant experience on these servers.
---
So, then why stop people from wanting an option to enable AoE looting if it might serve as a potential detriment to the user as you've described? "Enable at your own peril". Seems fine to me.
---
AoE looting was added when killing a bajillion mobs at once was commonplace, and not an outlier. Frost mages could speed up their kill times if AOE looting existed, but is that really the change we want to push for? Make the most OP AOE class even more OP?
---
There really isn't a need for AoE looting in Classic. Plus, I like being able to know what mob dropped what.
---
My only experience in there is stealthing through to get to the enchanting trainer.
---
I get that you need to feel some sort of self-importance for having started playing this game before me... I do. It's very human.
---
But LFD (wrath), LFR (mop), and the talent tree changes (mop) all happened after TBC. So ... other than flying (and that was only added in old world in cata), **I obviously absolutely have a frame of reference**, and you are kind of negating your own credibility by claiming otherwise.
---
Plus, if we're comparing dicks (yours is probably bigger), I played EQ for 4 years before quitting video games in college (to avoid getting kicked off the baseball team because ADDICTION is real)... so, again, plenty of frame of reference. Almost too much frame of reference... I feel bad for hogging all the frame of reference.
---
TL;DR if you wanna make friends, get over yourself... people can have opinions on things they didn't experience firsthand.
---
There isn't, this is what I meant when I said:
---
&gt;the potential for future changes shouldn't have any bearing on &gt;discussions of current changes
---
I think the discussion about AoE Looting being a good change is a different point of contention than the discussion about changes as a whole. Personally, I don't really have a problem with AoE Looting, I could take it or leave it. 
---
The logic is not "if they add any one QoL change they will then add all of these others." That is misrepresenting my position. The logic is that creating a community and tone of the game that is okay with incremental changes is dangerous to the long term stability of Vanilla. The evidence for this claim is that retail wow is a community that is okay with incremental changes and it has led to what this community perceives as damage to the long term state of World of Warcraft.
---
This is a different argument than **is Aoe Looting Beneficial to the game?** which I don't really have an opinion on. Conflating the two is naive at best and deceptive at worst. We can argue either of these two points until the cows come home, but its only fallacious if you misrepresent them.
---
I don't see it. I can honestly say I googled old tier 2 set because I was thinking about it on my own free will. Got the picture from a post 2 years ago on WoW's main reddit page lol  
---
But if you've seen it before then this post isn't for you and you can literally not click on it and go to other reposts about a game where everyone is talking about things that have already been talked about before. Carry on.
---
Arms! It provides the best utility while leveling until 40-50, and as far as dungeons go you will have the upper hand with tactical mastery. You will hear many say level fury until 40, then go arms to 60. I find the inverse to be true. Arms until you get a few pieces of +hit gear (45-50), then fury will be that much better.
---
Oh god fuck off with this dude. The appearance of gear always mattered I don't know what game you used to play.
---
Yup. Horde got it easy while Alliance had tank central from Redridge to Duskwood.
---
I don't think you read his comment correctly.
---
Would have rolled Horde and Troll Shaman just to be a Voodoo Boss.  Would have changed my life.
---
It's not *hard,* it just required a good team, coordination (ie you needed to work out who would rank where for weeks on end) and *time*. We're talking hours a day at least. No I never hit r14, but I was part of a HWL farming team for months. We were lucky in that our server population was \~80% Alliance, so queue times were instant then obv with x-realm it became quick anyway.
---
What is your spending limit? I don't think you're going to find anything at that price point that will play WoW comfortably - more like marginally acceptable at best.
---
Show me the direct causal link between the introduction of AoE looting in MoP and some further negative QoL change since then?
---
I remember someone telling me about sniping cross faction auctions on the Booty Bay auction house. "Sweet! Maybe I can score some easy gold!" I thought. I asked how to get to Booty Bay, from Ironforge I was in.
---
"Just go south" they said. Boy, was I in for a fucking journey. I felt like Frodo on a quest to Mt Doom to dispose of the Ring of Power. 
---
I was like, level 20, so I aggroed every mob in the zone just by sheer scent alone going through Duskwood and STV, it took like 3 hours, and I wasn't able to get anything, but holy shit it as an incredible journey full of danger, mystery, excitement, intrigue, and loss.
---
Does the energy boost work with druid cat form?
---
You're wrong on both counts.
---
1) acknowledging that you were wrong about something is not the same as apologizing for it. Do I need to elaborate on that ? If I said you don't want ice cream even though you told me you did, and then later I acknowledged that fine, you do want ice cream. That's not apologizing for assuming your desires earlier.
---
2) he was wrong about people WANTING classic, that has nothing to do with if it will be a hit or not. He presumed what his audience wanted was contrary to what they were saying. And we know he was wrong because eventually the company gave in to the clear demand .
---
Not sure why I was downvoted earlier, acknowledging you were previously mistaken is not an apology for being arrogant and assuming.
---
You said you were on board with flying, yet never played the game without it... Therefore, no frame of reference.
---
As resto?
---
You're kind of doing the same thing they were doing though. You say because most people would be against an actual QoL change, they must also be against bugs being fixed, or gamebreaking exploits. 
---
IMO, things like mailbox and auction functionality are non game-changing. But you do change a little bit of the game when looting is probably the most "dopamine slot-machine" mechanic of the game, and it's the most prevalent. It's much less satisfying to have  a small horde of people you killed and have it all in one clump. I like the more RPG aspect of looting each one, and seeing what it has.
---
I second the Arms route. more utility, more survivability, just more reliable overall until you start building your pre BiS which begins around 45, at which point you may want to switch to fury depending on your playstyle and endgame goals.
---
Not trying to sound like an ass here... any vacation at a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job should be paid leave. So I‚Äôd always assume that‚Äôs the case.
---
Ya, I actually killed gnomes first when it wasn't a terrible option.... I don't know why but I hated gnomes. We'll see if that hatred comes back in round two here.
---
Hank squads were most common trying as Alliance to go to SM. The SS TM wars would have Hank squads all over the place, specifically to kill people getting off the flight path and camping them. 
---
That was the fun. Even as Alliance.
---
What wasn't fun was actually wanting to run the dungeon, getting gankers over and over with your group because there was a TM raid, and then you get someone who gets sick of it and leaves, then three of you go to SM, one goes back to IF to look for 1 more, and maybe the get someone, or maybe they get sick of looking for a healer/tank and just quit themselves, then you have 3 people sitting around SM cathedral that debate one of them going to IF while the others just watch Netflix and AFK.
---
I find the "another repost" comments to be way more tedious than the reposts themselves.
---
It wasn't in classic.
---
Show me evidence of how, "insert this change" definitely means that more wont follow.
---
OH MY GOD I CANT WAIT BLIZZARD GIVE US A RELEASE DATE
---
Good idea. I wonder if I could convince her to play an Orc...
---
Levelling sucks. Farming sucks. Repair costs *really suck*. I still had more fun main tanking for a server first guild than anything else. Buuuut I had alts to farm. 
---
It all boils down to what you want to do. Main tanking in a progression guild requires huge amounts of time, thats it. Tanking 5 mans - and you can legitimately just end game 5 mans in Vanilla - requires reasonable time but nothing serious if you're good at your class.
---
It would do fantastic imo. Ffxiv has more abilities then wow ever did at any point in time I use 35 active keybinds on my scholar rn and people play that with a controller. Plus macros work better in wow then they do in ffxiv so it would work even better.
---
Yup, honestly people give too much priority to racials. Does the sword/mace on a human warrior help? Definitely. But we're talking about a small % increase. I'm gunna be a full tryhard this time around and roll the best race/class combo on every character I level, but it's really not that big of a deal most of the time...
---
It's not a fallacy.
---
Starting a gigantic SS v TM war by accident.  
---
Me and a friend were just casually levelling together when a guy a few levels higher than us started ganking, so naturally we asked for help in chat, a 60 comes along and sorts the guy out for us, and then watches over us for a while to make sure we're okay.  
---
Well..a few minutes later a couple 60's come in and slaughter us all, so naturally, the 60 got some help from his guild.  
---
Before you know it, word's gotten out that shits going down, everyone in Hillsbrad (including the lowbies) start jumping in the fight, 60's and decent sized groups from various guilds start making their way to Hillsbrad from all over start making their way there, and it ended up in a huge SS v TM battle that lasted a few hours.  
---
All because i just asked for a little bit of help to escape a ganker.
---
Check out Skarm on Youtube for a verified raid tank. He is basically correct in everything he says and releases a lot of videos with regards to playing a warrior and tank.
---
I‚Äôd also look up Monkeynews, mostly for pvp videos, but he has also done some collaborations on leveling and general warrior videos with *shudders* tipsout. If you just ignore Tips and listen to what Monkeynews actually has to say, it‚Äôs really informative for new players. 
---
Also keep in mind that tanking as a druid is actually very viable, especially in five mans, and arguably easier to play (as a tank), way easier and faster to level up as well. Skarm also has a lot of videos on tanking as a druid.
---
Seems like a feral druid set to me then
---
Eh, warlock is looking to be *way* more popular this time around.
---
I don't remember exactly when it happened, but it was a point at which there was transferring but the server wasn't sharded and all that crap
---
i hope so?
---
While leveling Scarlet Monastery the best!
---
Sunken Temple LEAST ugh
---
Endgame i can easy say Stratholme... so much Lore, love and reference to WC3
---
You're worrying too much.
---
I have a precise memory of what Vanilla was: *to me*. Which invariably means I've forgotten a lot about it and will be in for a rude awakening :).
---
That's a fair enough argument, certainly. Though there has to be some point of compromise between blanket denial of any suggestion of improvement and the cherry-picking of minor, proof-positive improvements that can be made optional to those that want to benefit from them while simultaneously not altering the core gameplay experience for those who do not.
---
Yep I'm always like ah he's fighting like 3 mobs I'm not gonna take him out like that. Immediate regret.
---
Fair enough, your points seemsvalid, I don't think it would be what make or break anything for farming but I can see how it would be a small step towards making something that is already an outlier a little more efficient.
---
Thanks for the input
---
I realise I will get downvoted into oblivion for this but;
---
What you are describing is a very harmful phenomenon often encountered when studying young bullies. People who take out their anger on others only for them to pass it along in turn. It creat a a viscous cycle and it has been connected to all sorts of emotional issues including depression and suicidal behaviour. If this is the reason you gank then it's a really unhealthy one. 
---
It's just like saying 'My dad beat the shit out of my mom's and me so I'm going to beat the shit out of my significant other and my children. I'm sure they will do the same when they grow up and I'm fine with that.' It's destructive behaviour that is purposely cultivating more destructive behaviour.
---
Most of the posts on this and the justifications provided during the last few days really has me questioning the mental health of many on this subreddit. It's sad really.
---
Nope, you‚Äôre the one who is greedy because you want an item that you can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt use, but can sell for a substantial to humongous amount of money.
---
You want to talk about contributing to getting an item? How does the end user that ultimately buys and equips this purple BOE (because he does play a particular class) contribute to the acquisition of said item?
---
It makes being alive that much more appreciated. I don't like being in a safety bubble in a video game. That being said, I will avoid Stonetalon Mountains like the plague, because of the high density of gankers there, and the 10 minute runback. I also tend to avoid Ashenvale because of this, but still do a few quests.
---
So, really, it just makes you have to think about where to go even more.
---
I only remember it being Red first, but I guess it's possible that it was different prior and I wasn't exposed to those items until they made the change to Red.
---
For starters, your friend is horde scum (for the Alliance!)
---
2. No flying, more RP based gameplay, professions actually matter, and things take longer to kill. All of this combines to make a more social community as well
---
3. The only *real* difference between factions is Alliance has Paladins, horde have Shamans. Outside that it's really just preference.
---
4. Depends on what you want. I played on a PVP server back in the day and it definitely led to a lot of good memories encountering enemies in the wild
---
7. WoW takes place like 10 years after W3
---
8. Pick up fishing and first-aid
---
I am playing on the classless private server &lt;name redacted due to rules&gt;, and there's this thing called "wildcard" servers. Every 2 levels you get a random spell or ability from ANY class.
---
It's bonkers...
---
I am having a blast...
---
But at least it's holding me off my addiction for classic.
---
Generally not a bad assumption. :)
---
TBC was the best expansion they did, sure flying mounts ruined the dynamic of running into other people and Resilience was fucking stupid and I like Alliance had Pallies and Horde had Shamans but they fixed the class balance and made useless specs insanely sought after, Karazhan was hands down my favorite all time raid and as a Druid Tank I had a million times more fun in TBC then Vanilla.            
---
I'm totally on board for Classic TBC option.
---
Sorry, not trying to be one. Just read that as accusatory when you mentioned the fiance working while he used some of his leave.
---
I'm hopefully I'll be able to get a much higher rank than Senior Sergeant this time around, as I'll be at level cap (hopefully) on a class that I was able to do that before 50 on =)
---
The second edition specifically fixes errors in the first edition. I picked mine up a couple months ago
---
Yep! Same set for the most part
---
We've had this conversation a million times on this subreddit. A BoE has the same exact value to every single person in the group. Everyone can use money to buy their own upgrades. So to argue that ONE person out of a group deserves that money and/or upgrade more than all other members of the group is incredibly greedy.
---
No problem at all.  I'm a die hard paladin, and I love when I have the chance to point someone in the right direction or clear up misconceptions.
---
I'd like to see the portal open and you're free to go the BC and leveling to retail route if you wish. Or you can stay in Azeroth and continue vanilla style content.
---
Aww yiss
---
&gt; It wasn't in vanilla.
---
That's an unacceptable answer, you failed to demonstrate what further, negative change was made as a direct result of the introduction of AoE looting.
---
There is no evidence in either case, so it's impossible to say one way or another. That's the nature of a fallacy.
---
All look great, especially plate, mail, and cloth
---
You said "those things" plural and now you're backtracking. Also, I leveled from 1-70 without flying and liked the idea of getting a flying mount. Therefore, on board with flying.
---
Further, I had played several MMOs before wow, all without flying... So the concept was still new even if it was introduced to wow before I started playing.
---
Just give this one up, friend! Let's get a beer!!
---
Get off your high horse. If people understand what you're trying to say, who gives a fuck. How we spell words isn't some sacred proces. It changes and most of the rules when it comes to spelling are arbitrary and pedantic in a way that mainly complicates the proces. You're not smarter because you memorized arbitrary rules that some old pedantic fucks came up with before you were born.
---
Who has more interesting  gameplay priest or pally? will i be bored with pally? (i am thinking of lvl60 and pvp.... dont care about leveling since lvling is leveling either way)
---
Oh great, back to spam refreshing again...
---
Wow it gave me shivers
---
Accurate
---
Transfers were available mid 2006 about half a year before BC
---
People sure wouldn't call it vanilla.  It's more like an inbetween thing.
---
Are we specifically talking about AoE loot, or the idea of some QoL changes?
---
And if we are supposedly recreating vanilla, and there is no evidence in either case, why even change then? Why should this risk be taken?
---
Gnome warrior is also pretty great for PVP.
---
Break Frost Nova, Frost Shock kite, Concussive Shot, Wing Clip, Hamstring, Entangling Roots, etc with a low CD Escape Artist racial!
---
I bet you're the kind of person who thinks playing GTA makes people murderers, aren't you?
---
I wonder what could be
---
Nope. If someone can equip it for benefit and will equip it, while others cannot, then obviously value differs. Nothing can change this, the circumstances are not the same.
---
No idea, I just recall a guy proving that he achieved it.
---
&gt;  I wonder why it wasn't a bigger thing
---
Because Pservers are bugged and let people activate a world buff anytime they want instead of being on a 8h cooldown.
---
&gt; If people understand what you're trying to say, who gives a fuck. How we spell words isn't some sacred proces.
---
But thats just the thing, we understand what people say because we give a fuck about how to spell a word. Aif huveryone caulder hyoust chwell inithing kow dey wizzled then nobody would understand anyone.
---
Also, its process, not proces.
---
Wish I could figure out how to get the darn private servers to work on my macbook. I've tried a bunch of different options that way but nothing worked.
---
Technically, yes, Druids have less tools in their arsenal. As people have already pointed out, Druids can't Block or Parry, and they have low Defense (it's much harder to find +Defense on leather items than plate items), so they take a lot of damage, can be crit, and are susceptible to Crushing Blows. Additionally, they can't drink potions or use Healthstones/Engineering items (grenades etc) in Bear Form. They can't wield useful items like Thunderfury, Annihilator, or Force Reactive Disk. They have a longer CD on their Taunt (Growl), and have no back-up Taunt (Mocking Blow). They also have no inherent Disarm, Silence, or Fear immunity. Having said that, they are still decent tanks. Warriors are objectively better, but that doesn't mean Druids are bad. Both Druids and Warriors are A-Tier tanks imo.
---
In other words "BiS" is only best according to some arbitrary measure
---
Server size was definitely very important for how long it took. I played on a low pop server as alliance where the majority was horde by quite the margin (instant BG pops pretty much). Got rank 11 without even trying.
---
The rain in Desolace. My undead lock made the journey through the zone for the felhunter quest. The place was so dead, dry, and barren that I thought rainfall must never happen there. Then, it just came. Thunder boomed and rain trickled from the gray, overcast sky. I thought I was lucky to have witnessed it. I'm not sure how often rain comes to the zone in-game.
---
wait for it. its an old game, and you will need days and days and weeks to run out of things to do on your main. dont spoil it with practice, you dont even need. honestly, i find people are overplanning and practicing for realse way to much, they will just burn out that much faster
---
A good point of transmog was that we could ressurrect vanilla looks
---
Most of the times Rogues don‚Äôt need shadowcraft unless they are fresh 60s, don‚Äôt worry about it.
---
Stay on your quarantine servers please.
---
Totally right, I was thinking of heartseeker.
---
This was tweeted 3h ago and nothing else has come out. It's probably just an attention grab.
---
Watching someone else play an mmo is about the most boring thing you can be doing as far as consuming twitch content imo. So no I doubt it.
---
I want to believe.
---
&gt;Can I just say the Old Bloodfang set looks hilarious specifically because the Shoulders look like 3 pairs of shoulders all worn on-top of one another. 
---
Same model as [Shadowcraft Spaulders](https://www.wowhead.com/item=16708/shadowcraft-spaulders), just red.

Rationally speaking, I agree.  Irrationally, there's a chance...
---
We can try to help narrow down your healer choice, Pally vs Shaman, Priest or Druid. Depends on what you trying to focus on PvE/PvP. Anything else you are looking for, such as utility, buffing, raid healing, tank healing, or flexibility.

I'm gonna be that guy.

It turns the entire game into flyover country. There‚Äôs no random encounters between players when everybody can fly from A to B rather than traveling there.
---
Engineering it THE profession in classic, for both PvP and PvE.
---
Just ask. There's a long window of time before you have to make your decision. If no one need rolls, take it. If somebody does need roll, depending on how bad they need it, they might be fine with you rolling for offspec. Just ask.
---
Hey man if want to run through Blackrock mountain by yourself instead of waiting at Thorium Point for your group be my guest.
---
Usually the arbitrary measure is 'most damage throughout an average raid', which is the metric for the classic mage discord's prebis list by Infra.
---
Theyre not gonna make billions from classic. It wont have the store. Besides the community is tight and loyal, but won‚Äôt be as large as the initial wow launch obviously
---
WoW's open world but it's a survival game. Breath of the Wild style.
---
Northrend needs frost resist gear
---
Tanaris needsh heat resist gear
---
Burning steppes need burn resist
---
Well BACK IN MY DAY we used valor and Arcanite reapers ;) logging in now to see warriors roll on rogue gear is just not the same.
---
More importantly mounts were conservative in looks and made sense. Now every fucking moving object is given wings and made into a mount. Yeah it was cool the first time but now all of WoW looks like a circus.
---
I've definitely read more than a significant few people from the \#NoChanges crowd advocating for even the bugs/exploits to be implemented, such as the aforementioned Vanish animation bug, or wall jumping. It's not just a blanket assumption, there are people who truly want those things. Asmongold and Sodapoppin for example, have both said as much on their streams.
---
I don't care one way or another if they did or didn't add AoE looting, I simply hole the opinion that QoL features like making AoE looting an opt-in setting in the options menu isn't going to hurt the game.
---
Felt like a journey to do a full clear.
---
Spot on
---
The value *doesn't* differ though.
---
I can't believe I have to break this down into baby terms for you.
---
There's an item you want, it costs 100 gold on the auction house.
---
It drops in a group and you win it - you just made 100 gold because you don't have to spend that 100 gold in the AH.
---
It drops and the Warrior wins - he just made 100 gold
---
It drops and the Mage wins - he just made 100 gold.
---
The value of a BoE is the same for everyone. (There are fringe exceptions for items that are so rare that they're not often available in the AH and some of the item's value is attributed to finding the item but that's not really relevant to this conversation.)
---
Back in your day people didn't know any better.
---
Yeah. I think a full mc run nets around 20 epics give or take. So half the raid still doesn't get anything that week. It takes a while to gear up. People think they're all going to be BiS geared, but to a large extent you take whatever upgrade is available and you like it!
---
Ofc you can, if the rogue start to cry, then he's one of the people that will mostly likely end up having to make new character for being toxic lootwhore. 
---
Speaking of dungeons, if you benefit from gear in your current specialization, R O L L  N E E D.
---
If Hunters can roll on Hand of Justice I see no issue with this. iirc the druid tier 0 is more healing/hybrid focused
---
You'll get your chance. Just wait for the first few seasons of classic and they'll intermittently release tbc and wotlk servers.
---
While BRD is insanely cool for what it is - a massive city that feels genuinely alive and that you‚Äôre truly invading, with good loot to boot, I (and I think a lot of people) genuinely dreaded doing it in the early days of WoW.
---
Exact same thing I did on my mage when I first started. I was doing deadmines and that blue axe the drops off the shredder boss dropped, I needed it and won. I got quite the lashing from the group for that one.
---
Your DPS isn't as impactful as a tank's threat
---
The only sad thing is that we live in a world where you exist.
---
These are very nice \^.\^
---
I had 6 level 60s and have played on pservers for years and I still don't know my way around gnomer or sunken temple. 
---
When classic launches there are going to be tons of people who have zero or very limited knowledge about the game, it will be a great opportunity to refresh your memory.
---
Seems like a shitty system tbh. If you have a life hitting high pvp ranks seems impossible. Unlike raiding which you can dedicate a few hours per week to farm consumables, and then a few hours maybe twice a week and potentially clear all content.
---
Thats, really harsh man.
---
You think that its sad that i live because i correct someones misspelled word.
---
You on the other hand think that people that correct misspelled words should be dead, time to take a look in the mirror.
---
&gt;Most of the posts on this and the justifications provided during the last few days really has me questioning the mental health of many on this subreddit. It's sad really.
---
you know you are posting somewhere where guys are mad because Blizzard hasn't said a release date yet so they can't decide when to take a month off work to nolife a video game?
---
and asking in a serious manner about how to convince their gf or wife to let them do this?
---
and joking about how they will get their children to farm fishing for them when they have to sleep? (are they really joking though? are they?)
---
you wanna talk about mental health, this place is an insane asylum. I legitimately fear for the well being of many people posting here.
---
Just hope that after the release tiers of content they slowly keep going into BC and so on. As long as they keep updates coming and release small bits of content I think blizzard (ATVI) stock will go up.
---
At the start of PvP-ranks, rank 14 was also only obtainable by 1 player/faction/week.
---
From a PvP aspect, I can understand why flying mounts made WPvP a bit of an issue. However, overall I think flying mounts were a good decision for BC and even WotLK because the maps were designed pretty well for it as someone else said earlier. Being able to reach places only by flying (Netherwing Ledge and Tempest Keep), or traversing certain zones easier (Blade‚Äôs Edge and Netherstorm), made it a worthwhile goal even if the speed was only 60%. But like all things, when it became easier to obtain or when you were able to fly in zones while leveling (Book of Cold Weather Flying) it disrupted how you were supposed to experience certain parts of the game at certain times. 
---
Flying being turned into something you earned in expansions since Warlords, and being able to learn it again to fly in Cata/MoP, was a poor way to allow players to be able to make use of something they already earned. But it was a temporary fix that made the problem worse as new content has been added.
---
Absolutely not. I think acting out violence in games is probably more healthy than bad for you. I just think it's worth reflecting on what activities your engaging in and what behaviour you exhibit in these kinds of situations.
---
Ah lol that explains some stuff.
---
Agree on BFD, but I liked Mara. Wasn‚Äôt a fan of the fungus side, but demon side was fun, and post-waterfall is just epic. Plus you can get the portal scepter thingy to skip straight to the second half.
---
I hate speculating about these teaser tweets, but this was the guy who also broke the news about the alpha/beta CDN stuff so I doubt it's a straight up lie. It also sounds like some content creators have some info about the beta, the countdown to classic guy claims to at least.
---
Stop spouting ps bullshit, if you dont have to wait to fill group and run multiple times(make 4 friends(or 1 that dual boxes like me)) it shouldnt be off much, especially on PvP server. Plus you get gear and gold.
---
It‚Äôs funny that you all say x% of people in classic will roll rogues. During Vanilla i remember a lot of people(myself included) rolling Paladin or Lock for the free mount at level 40.
---
Never raided naxx in vanilla, but i DID raid naxx in wrath.
---
So I guess if you can raid naxx you can raid naxx
---
I feel like they scrapped it for the name. If I went from High Warlord. To City Protector.... That shit is a demotion.
---
I still think lfg did more damage... Especially on pve servers.
---
Interesting, I played on a US server and even my semi casual raiding guild were using threat and dps meters. Every group I was in had them too a few months after release.
---
That was one of the runs where i REALLY want to make sure the group composition is top notch. I want a priest, a solid tank, a solid healer, and 2 DPS that complement that group. Also, i prefer lower level runs, at 53-57, where you just do the first 80% of the run, and skip the lyceum and emperor. Thats still like 2 and a half hours of fun.
---
Fuck cosplays, they ruin subreddits.
---
I've seen many "Retail Bad" posts on here but never as far back as BC content... 
---
I suppose this IS a subreddit for classic wow. 
---
-A guy who likes classic and retail
---
It's interesting that you didn't answer the question I asked, you just repeated your post, but with more words...
---
You haven't lived until you've leveled a character through STV on a fresh start.
---
You mean the wolf mask helm? That wasn't the placeholder that was the actual look after the placeholders were replaced. https://www.wowhead.com/item=16667/coif-of-elements
---
The Elements set placeholder looked like what is posted in the OP except instead of red it was gold.
---
Counterpoint:   I actually do wear mostly plate as a healer, and I sit generally in the middle to upper of the healing pack on our logs.   I'm currently wearing one piece of cloth (dustwind turban) and one piece of mail (harmonious gauntlets b/c freaking peacekeeper wont' drop for me) and the rest plate.  The reason for this is I started out in mostly, but not full prebis and the rest alternate prebis stuff or freakin' lightforge.   The pieces I've gotten that are plate were better than what I was wearing even though they aren't BIS, so that's what I wear now.   I don't mind it, it doesn't hurt my performance in a massive way (as of yet), and this means I can let other people get their BIS first and just vacuum up stuff few, if any, people want.
---
Holy crap thats an annoying poll. Just make it one question which is worst and one which is best. Who the hell cba to rank them 1-28.
---
&gt; Are we specifically talking about AoE loot, or the idea of some QoL changes?
---
I specifically said: "... what further, negative change was made as a direct result of the introduction of **AoE looting.**"
---
Red is ded, it's pretty simple.
---
I'd honestly say it depends on the patch level. The weird thing about T0 gear is it's both mediocre gear, but once dungeon revamp comes out it's also quest item drops which are linked to class. 
---
Another thing to consider is, what role are you filling in the group. If you're healing, rolling shadowcraft over a rogue who needs it as an upgrade is a dick move, unless you clarify your intent to all before the run.
---
You have become what you swore to fight.

Nah dude, it's different this time because there's three of them this time, it's funny.
---
You mean the thing that hasn't influenced the world first race on live so will have no effect on the average guild?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0tdx0MVst that's how I would level to 40 if you really want the Moonkin form. 
---
Then finish it like https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0tpx0MEstZxxc.
---
But as much as I love balance druids I dont actually think crit chance is the way to build. Especially while leveling. I would go https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0tpx0MEstZxxc with that build you can heal dungeons if you have to and still play balance
---
Yeah, I remember that. Especially the people who bought store mounts, they were furious they couldn't fly the mounts they paid cash for.
---
I would absolutely buy one of these if available. Looks amazing
---
lol
---
flick and swish

why did you quit?
---
Heyy gais check out my sweet chastity belt ;)

Even though you‚Äôre an arrogant ass, I got what you‚Äôre saying and rest convinced.
---
No one understands that because it's completely different. Have you never read a book with lots of words you don't directly understand but do understand because of context? It's why it really doesn't matter which two you use because contextually you will likely intuitively understand. If I throw a few french words into an english sentence you'll likely figure out what I'm trying to get across, but if I replace the whole sentence with french you will likely struggle. The misspelling of "process" (and yes I know how to spell it, I was purposefully fucking with you) as proces was interpretable  because its basically the same word and the context of the word would only make sense if it was proces. Minor variations on words won't destroy the English language. It's why written language hasn't fallen under the weight of multiple variations of spellings for names. Calling Jaime Jamie isn't going to fuck with you because Jamie is obviously never Jam-y.
---
I like achievements and want them in classic (just don't let them be sharable for inspection). I want to know when I've got100% quests done in a zone.
---
Hell yeah
---
There are people like that, yes, but that doesnt make up the base of the "no changes" community. All of those bugs I won't miss, except for wall jumping. I would never vie for them to reinstate it into the game, but I did have lots of good times, getting to airstrip, beneath stormwind, etcetera.
---
A few people have made good points in this thread though against aoe looting, that even the OP has conceded make sense, like for skin stealing. But personally, I feel like the only people who would request AoE looting to be in Classic, havent played Classic. Thats not me trying to gatekeep. There just genuinely arent many instances in Classic where that would help, unlike the modern game, where things die en masse and ultra fast. Plus, it only serves to make the best Overpowered aoe-farmers even faster, like frost mages, which I will play.
---
It's kind of like the weather features. If they arent the same as they were in Vanilla, does it really "hurt" the game? No, but it does take away from what it used to be, in a sense.
---
 Either way, the no-changes movement has kind of evolved since 2017 November. We know 1.12 at launch isn't no-changes, loot trading in raids (technically) isn't no changes. And there will be many things that aren't identical, which is fine. But AoE looting just feels like an unnecessary vestigial organ of the modern game, that really servers little purpose in Classic.
---
Did he break the news? I recall many places had it before he did, plus it was public knowledge technically once it went up. The dude is just trolling for follows.
---
There aren't 40+ spells in FF14 and the GCD is 2 sec
---
We have the luxury of being able to look back at the history of the QoL changes made to WoW and see what lineage of changes came after as a result. Not all QoL changes are good or would have a place within Classic. Some are quite good and would fit into Classic without detriment. People just need to stop assuming that doing anything QoL related is going to lead to the sky falling.
---
It's their main game why would they
---
My spelling error sparked some discussion, lol. In Danish we say 'proces' but in English it's 'process'. The devil is as always in the detail!
---
Try scouring CeX website as you're from the UK they do pretty good deals on laptops and you may find one in a similar price range with a older dedicated GTX chip. Otherwise I would suggest going for a Ryzen laptop as the igpu is significantly more powerful than the Intel counterparts if you can find one for cheap.
---
I seem to recall the process for getting the first warlock mount requiring finding a high level with some object needed for the quest, a group of us paying them to use it, and traveling to some keep or dungeon to kill a boss and use the object to get that steed. It was a pain in the ass, but made that mount worth it.
---
Nooooo, please, stay untainted. Keep the game fresh. We've waited sooo damn long for this game, try to let your first experience be the real one.
---
Plus, what if you get invested in your private server toon, get them to 30-40 or so, when the game really starts picking up, and then, bam, server is gone, classic is out... time to do it all over again, every one of those 100 hours you spent getting there.
---
I didnt say it was, but I'm sure you can understand the salt.
---
Nice üò∏
---
hell ya I hate the whole keep putting detail on stuff mantra now.
---
Yes and i want to play with ton of people everywhere.
---
Sometimes less is more.
---
Shamans were never meant to tank actually, one of the vanilla devs said so in podcast.
---
You know that streamers have more viewers during an event or game launch right ?
---
You have no idea how much I hope I'm wrong.
---
I‚Äôd love to play a TBC redesign where that shit was all ground-accessible
---
You ask for me to give an example in a point of time "of this led to that" in a game that constantly changed. Patch by patch, expansion for expansion, in a span of 15 years. 
---
One decision fixes one problem and sometimes it creates 2 more, sometimes it simply... fixes it for good. Asking for direct relation between 1 change leading to another is ludicrous.
---
We have the luxury indeed, but i wont take the risk. In the end we may bicker our heads on what is enough, but its ultimately Blizzard that we have to put our trust into. And i don't have that trust.
---
I might not be able to answer you question now, but i will tell you how AoE loot is by IN ITSELF a change. I will simply copy this from my other post. 
---
And this IS a gameplay change, far bigger one than simple QoL.
---
The way farming works in vanilla is...diferent (for now i will skip walls on how farming works.).
---
You go, pull everything and loot it with one click, you move to the next spot (something that is heavily restricted by having to loot one by one). You do that with many spots, and dungeons.
---
Especially if you dont have good gear, killing a single mob takes time in this game, something a Mage or Paladin don't care about. Then there is world PvP, which is something that cant catch you off-guard while you don't have to check every monster one by one.
---
Low level dungeons, and for example cloth farming. You go in, pull ALL the way to the end, Aoe&gt;Click once, port out repeat. Dungeon timer kicks in, you go out and for the next few hour you move from hot spot to hot spot, with dungeons in between timers.
---
That is just an example of how the "small amount of time" you gain from AoE loot, heavily boosts the performance of ONLY 2 classes that are already best for the job anyway. That "small amount of time" stacks, and in 5 hours, it will be like you farmed for 8. This is why it's not a simple change, but even if it was, its still a deviation of a core mechanic. You do it once, good luck stopping the horde of "my turn" babies.
---
Thank you! Just made my choice between a Warrior and a Rogue a hell of a lot easier.
---
Do you remember a guild named MyElf? Hated those guys, alliance outnumbered us so bad. TonyP was the Bain if my existence in WSG

---
Worth for first quests at 50-52 and you keep going deeper and deeper as you gather keys and further quests in high 50s. Amazing place. Shortcuts were also great and kinda unique
---
If you already know what class you want to play. Log out of this forum and dont look her again until you are level 60. 
---
Go in as blind as possible. 
---
WoW was made for people who had never played mmos. It will be accessible. Don't the curiosity or us ruin your adventure. Im nearly certain all of us would love to be in your ignorant shoes. 
---
The adventure is finding it all out the first time.
---
If you are capable of killing any modern Mythic raid boss, then every encounter in Classic will be an absolute breeze for you.
---
But I literally think that when you sissy Mary's get what you want. You will end up destroying it anyway . people literally have no clue what they want. So there asking blizz to revive classic with #no changes. Y'all are wack
---
My guild in vanilla had a GKP system.
---
That's Gnome Killing Points.
---
It wasn't so much a system as it was genocide with a scoreboard.
---
I'm pretty sick of the "This sub is awful" threads that pop up every day. I get it, there are some shitty memes that are... well... shitty. But just browse by new like with any other fucking subreddit. And it's not like the news is going to pass you by. It will be the top post, youtube will flood your page with every content creator's 2 cents on the topic, and it will be in the sidebar. 
---
Let the discussions discuss and the memes meme, imo.
---
What class are you? Though Corpsemaker is great for enhancement shamans, it isn't strictly theirs
---
No, not at all. Personally I want TBC and Wrath (as separate servers).
---
I also think that Blizzard *will* release all expansions eventually. (It's just logical, after they start doing them. It's relatively low effort and high reward. That way everyone can play their favorite expansion(s). A lot of people will basically never unsubscribe.)
---
However I do agree with the mods (and I think most people on the subreddit) that it's very early and very tiresome to bring this up again and again, especially as Classic hasn't even been released.
---
They didnt say anything about ubrs/lbrs being raid dungeons. UBRS most likely will be 10 man as it was throughout all of vanilla. LBRS is possible to run as 10 but didnt really need it.
---
I remember this too, but it could have been from Warcraft 3. I definitely remember a time when artifacts were (planned to be) red.
---
The recently started on a Private Server and the best part so far is definitely the community. A lot of times you‚Äôll group up together to finish quests in an area, people regularly buff each other, actual talking during groups.
---
I kinda agree with you actually
---
Thanks for the laugh.
---
In the original system everything past 10 was a shit show. In the revamp it was far less so. I think we are getting the easy classic wow pvp
---
How could Stockades and Gnomeregan not be at the bottom?
---
Thank you, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking. Maybe I‚Äôm wrong, and I love Classic and am bored of retail for years, but I don‚Äôt see a way Classic beats out retail in subs. I don‚Äôt see if reaching a million active players.
---
Kripp won't come back. He goes where the sell out takes him.
---
Seems more people are aware we are not the mushrooms we once were!
---
Sure, and that's going to happen regardless. People seem to have this misconception that sharding means dividing everyone up so there's only a few people in each shard but that's just not accurate. It means instead of competing with literally 400 other people to kill kobolds in Northshire and getting nothing accomplished for hours, you'll instead be competing with something like 100 of the 400 total people in Northshire at any given time during launch week. That's still a hell of a lot of competition but makes it much more possible to actually play the game. And then as soon as your done in the start zone you go out and join the unsharded world.
---
And then a couple weeks later it's not going to matter whatsoever because people will be spread out enough by then that sharding won't be needed to make the starter zones anymore.
---
AFAIK he was the first person to get the news out there. I originally completely ignored the tweet for those same reasons, thinking it was a troll or an attention grab, then it got verified by muliple sources over the next few hours. He was talking about it on the classic discord as well. I don't know how trustworthy he is but I think it's safe to say he has some sources.
---
I always say priest just because Mind Control is OP and a lot of fun to use, and if you ever want to DPS, shadow is pretty good whereas ret isn‚Äôt all that viable.
---
You have to get a premade and take turns. Ideally start early because its a real burn out fest.
---
The paladin tho.
---
I‚Äôve read that there‚Äôs several late game quests where the rewards can be BiS or there‚Äôs a correct choice based on class etc. Anyone know if there‚Äôs a guide for them? I‚Äôll be rolling Holy Paly.
---
Think my record was 5.5 hours once and we went through good 12-13 people as they came and went. Good times.
---
Why wont you get tier sets? Druids are the least played class, and the easiest to get full t1 &amp; t2
---
RIP rogues wanting tier gear before ~8 warrior tanks.
---
Well I did if you would just read what I wrote but I'll make it painfully clear for you
---
Repeated questions and topics are not an issue. Banning memes, at least the low effort ones like this, would encourage more quality discussion posts
---
Ganking is part of the video game. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs unhealthy to plan on ganking others because you yourself have been ganked. That‚Äôs like saying, ‚ÄúGuys i don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs healthy to retaliate in a CoD team death match because we‚Äôre just passing aggression that has been passed on to us.‚Äù This is the equivalent of calling out people who fart at urinals. If i can‚Äôt fart in a fucking bathroom, where the hell am i supposed to. It‚Äôs a video game with the name ‚ÄúWarcraft‚Äù in it. It‚Äôs supposed to conjure feelings of war, battle, and retaliation.
---
Gnome Warriors have the lowest Base Stat for Stamina, which I figure is a pretty decent deterrent to pick them.
---
Sorry if I came off as bit of an ass. I've seen this conversation come up hundreds of times over a couple decades of playing MMOs, and there's always that guy arguing in bad faith trying to convince people that somehow distributing loot unfairly is somehow the more altruistic position.

You do realize that. Theres world firsts already set in stone already for all the raids. You do realize that people on private servers are speedrunning content. I really don't think you fucking realize how much of an upset this will be to people. Your righteous cause will be ultimatly turned upside down on your little commie head #nochanges

I can't remember if nights were dark in 1.12 - I do remember when I first started, 1.1 patch, Darkshore was dark, very dark, and then, at some point, they increased the gamma so nights were never really dark any more.  It was a shame.

**Intended raid/play times:** Flexible but primarily Weekend Nights.
---
**Priorities:** Raiding; PVP; strong community. Playing with Fiance, planning on leveling as Holy Priest/Rogue combo.
---
**Rules:** None, Just looking for Classic guild.

&gt;Felstriker drops in a group and you win it - you just made 7g 56s 24c gold because you don't have to spend that 7g 56s 24c gold in the AH.  
---
&gt;It drops and the Priest wins - he just made 7g 56s 24c gold  
---
&gt;It drops and the Mage wins - he just made 7g 56s 24c gold.  
---
&gt;The value of a item is the same for everyone.
---
Assuming the 39 other people your group can do the same...
---
x is cthun
---
I have never played WOW but I really want to experience it! Would you suggest playing the current game or should I wait for Classic? I would be a casual player able to play for 8-10 hrs a week....
---
Has anything been stated about cross-faction chat?  I remember originally you could use all sorts of leetspeak and it went through fine. At some point they cracked down on that and all that worked were certain phrases, I assume this is how it'll be?
---
Ive never really had many experiences like your huntard friend. Most people on private servers are pretty chilled out. I can count on one hand the number of times somebody even had to leave out of the blue, ragequit or just RL reasons.
---
If you can get the same 40 people to show up at consistent times each week, you can do naxx
---
It's funny how that comment applies to almost all of the additions to the game since TBC - Players were BEGGING for things like flying mounts (think how COOL it would be!).  They were complaining non stop about how inconvenient it was to get a dungeon group together.  They were jumping up and down to make sure 100% of the game was "available to everyone", including the final 5%.
---
We all thought we wanted that stuff... 
---
...but we didn't.
---
good joke
---
Wtf
---
bad joke
---
I played Alliance in vanilla, but was a druid and always regretted not being a pally.  Quit early in TBC and came back at the end of MOP....from then on I played horde (as a pally other than a brief stint as an spriest main for raid prog in early wod).   The minute Classic was announced I decided I'd be going alliance for paladin because it's a chance for a "do-over" and to main what I ACTUALLY wanted to main in vanilla back in the day.   I've been doing it on a pserv for the last few months as prep for Classic and do not regret my decision whatsoever.
---
I dunno if any of that helps at all, but I had to make the same decision.  Follow your gut.
---
Personally while I like the idea of everyone needing to make the journey to dungeons, I‚Äôll be pretty bummed if they aren‚Äôt added at some point down the line. What happens if a player d/c and you need to find a replacement? Someone has to hearth to a capital city and find another player, and then they both have to make their way back. I can see a lot of groups disbanding over losing a player just because of the hassle involved in having to run all the way back to the entrance.
---
So long as people can follow instructions, it's a blast. I love the sweeping city feel of the dungeon. BRD, LBRS, and Gnomer felt like they designed a city first, and then made it into a dungeon later.
---
But those moments when you see a wave of 50 troggs coming from below makes me wish I never ran that damn place.
---
Nothing in gaming was as fun for me as the moment i stepped in STV on any of my characters.  You just know that your merry adventures are over. Best feeling ever.
---
Sure  It boils down people to a number, for one. For two it fosters an elitist and exclusionary mentality among the community. For three, it always results in ridiculously high requirements above the content in the name of "wanting a smooth run" which, again, fosters a very selfish community rather than a helpful one. 
---
I remember people wanting ludicrously high Gearscore for content in Wrath. It got pretty ridiculous. There are much better ways to gauge somebody that don't involve being an elitist prick, especially in Classic where a helpful community is paramount. 
---
Something like Raider.io or Gearscore will completely ruin the classic mindset so many people seem to be wanting. These add-ons don't help foster communities, they help to segregate and isolate them.
---
Yup. I could see it being potentially useful that way as a means to combat inflation (granted, who knows what the side effects would be)
---
Yea but people will whine
---
Just make it clear you're rolling on feral gear....Anything else is on them
---
Damn.. why have we not thought of that?! Let's just go and ask them! :D
---
If the entire raid was in the instance at the time the entire raid was there for buff you save a fair amount of time. If you wipe early the buff is gone and you now wasted 15 minutes to save 5.
---
Good idea, why didn't we get that earlier?
---
At least you know you dont have claustrophobia.
---
Well since Xbox supports mods and keyboard and mouse is love for them to release it on console but with manufacturers wanting a cut of that subscription fee I don‚Äôt think it will happen though.
---
You mean you don‚Äôt have a strange fascination with spikes?
---
Warrior.
---
This is my concern, the finding a replacement part. The running to dungeon doesn't bother me because I'm already gonna sink a ton of time into this game..heh. But replacing a d/c'er or someone who is a total jackass is going to suck.  Apparently though the meeting stones are kinda of like a LFG system in a sense you basically put your name on a list advertising you want to do the dungeon. hopefully people use it and are close by.
---
Clear a bfa raid on heroic

Someone pointing out same image(s) that circle this sub every two weeks or so is just unthinkable.

You've never reposted anything or made a post with an extremely common topic? [Oh wait..](https://i.imgur.com/fDu58cx.png)
---
You'll find a Video of a Rogue back in vanilla killing GMs and high geared people in lvl1 white/grey gear. He did all the tricks and evis dmg was good even without gear.
---
Huh, I wold've never taken this concept so far, thank you for breaking it down, with this in mind, and other comment that brought up how some outliers like Frost mage would be even more efficient at farming than they already are, which I can agree would be a step in the wrong direction since it would impact the gameplay after all. 
---
&gt; I got my rogue to rank 10 or 11 in vanilla, high enough that I got the mount but no epic gear. So I had the blue set and although I had less AP than tier 1&amp;2 rogues due to not having as much agility, the gear had lots of health (for rogue gear) and decent amounts of crit.
---
If you had the mount, that's Rank 11.  Rank 10 completes the blue set.
---
So many alliance corpses at sm...
---
I am sure I remember it being announced prior to the patch. Coulda sworn a few guildies bought them without training in the week leading upto it since the mounts weren't too expensive it was just the training that coated a ton
---
I dont think you can count X as an individual. The hardest thing about vanilla was never 1 player effort, it was a team effort of 40.  
---
Sure X might be amazing, but that dont count for anything if rest is not living up to the standards needed.
---
get a pc , just for that.  any old thing you can buy for $50 or get for free if you ask around will do
---
I'd wager the time saved is probably much much less significant than the original poster of that argument asserted. Probably closer to 1 hour saved over the course of 12, even that might be generous but I haven't done the math. It's not something that's going to break the economy, and something everyone has equal access to anyway, not just mages and paladins by themselves.
---
The point of the matter is what negative consequence resulted from the introduction of AoE looting? I don't think there was any, and that's the point. Sure, you might not trust Blizzard, but again, it's fallacious to assume that any single change is going to lead to any other. It might be easy to think that it might, but people need to break themselves of their habitual over-worrying and deal with reality as it is. Not what it could be.
---
Priest tho
---
KT doesn't seem any harder than like 25 man lich king to me 
---
but also I never raided in vanilla
---
Sounds like an Orc power couple in the making! Those female models are fierce, especially the bald or pigtailed ones :3
---
Ah ok, weird because the comments on Amazon say things like ‚ÄúSuperb publication. Through cataclysm every area, every town, every flight point‚Äù, so I just presumed that it included that expansion. Although as I type this, I just realized that the date of the publication was before that expansion was released, doh ü§£
---
Thanks for the feedback, will order it now.
---
Nailed it!
---
$30. Which is what it wil probably be considering WC3 Reforged costs $30.
---
This picture is so old. I feel so old.
---
And writing 1 + 1 = 22 is understandable as well, you can understand that i probably ment 2 but you will also probably correct me to be completely sure.
---
Someone that knows that proces isnt a word might understand that he ment process, but someone less apt at english might not know that there isnt a difference between proces and process.
---
Also, and i cant fucking believe i have to say this. THERE IS A RIGHT WAY TO SPELL A WORD, AND ITS BETTER IF EVERYONE SPELLS IT THE SAME EVEN IF WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN PEOPLE DONT.
---
If you are unsure then ask or wait to see what everybody els rolled
---
Of course people were raiding it, I'm not saying there weren't people still raiding, I make that very clear. The only thing I'm saying is that one of the biggest reasons why few people saw Kel-Thuzad was because people were quitting the game or raiding until BC. Whether you think their reasons are bullshit or not has nothing to do with what actually was happening at the time.
---
Hit box was the issue. Gnomes had it too small and Tauren had it sized to 1/2 of the original Org.
---
Oh and gnomes would drown in Dustwallow Marsh off or on the mount. :)
---
Friends? lucky
---
If you don't know what's the difference between that and these threads and why would I find a growing list of them funny, I certainly won't try and enlighten you. Enjoy being you, I guess...
---
You quit during the best expansion
---
Well at the time at least it was rarely an issue.  You got gear envy sure, but I recognized players more than gear.  When my best items were Lobotomizer and the rep shoulders from AB I never had entire days where I felt like I was getting destroyed.  Individual matches or known premade groups, yes, but never all the time just due to raid gear.  
---
At least this time around with discord/reddit/forums there will definitely be pug 40 man‚Äôs for Ony and the first few MC bosses.  If you have a specific boss or upgrade to turn the tides of your pvp, its not unrealistic ti be able to just join for a specific boss, especially if you are helping that group/the leaders with potions and flasks or what have you.
---
And druids get insect swarm and moonfire, that would be a really good combo
---
The scorpidscale set from tanaris is quiet nice for huntress
---
Their main game is BfA, not classic. And Because it would be better off if they weren‚Äôt streaming it.
---
Unstoppable Force is really good, but that's a bit of an exaggeration.  It is basically an AQ20 weapon (compare it and Manslayer of the Qiraji side by side) with a short stun proc.   Off the top of my head Zin'rokh, Spinal Reaper, the Untamed Blade, and of course Hand of Rag are better.  As are asscandy and BRE like you mentioned.
---
Ok I keep explaining it because you are reiterating my points. That was exactly what I am saying. I agree with you that even IF changes make the game better, it opens the door for either people to whine about getting other QoL changes that DONT make the game better, or for blizz to think more changes are ok. 
---
That is what I've been saying this entire time. I don't know why you are arguing with me about it.
---
The part I disagree with you about is that we should be UPFRONT that that is our issue, not pretend that these changes are catastrophically game changing. This is a re-release of a 2004 game, not a remaster.
---
Okay I guess I‚Äôm open to raiding, but I never did it in vanilla and don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to get into groups. And I guess I need to go resto for that, I have little experience as a raid healer
---
Warrior could be good. You being able to tank would help getting groups and warrior‚Äôs can really use health stones.
---
Freshhhhhh 
---
Just roll alliance though
---
Do you think 2-3 hours a night sufficient to main a warrior with a priest healer following me around (wife)? I don't want to main tank, dont want that commitment. but im down for off tank/dps and running 5 mans with my guild.
---
Love it
---
Yes but no. I want those things but not in a #nochanges way. Let's have them but with the vanilla ethos. So "hardcore" versions or whatever. Fix the mistakes we're talking about.
---
Fair point
---
Then yeah I got rank 11 before giving up on trying to rank hard core. I just remember the last few ranks leading up the mount taking what seemed like forever so I stopped and did not pursue rank 14. I was going off of memory, it didn't seem like a prudent enough detail to look up since I was just trying give OP a vague idea of how much pvp I did on rogue.
---
You think you do, but sometimes you don't.
---
Flying mounts sound like a awesome idea, who doesn't want to ride a flying dragon? But let's be real, most of us aren't game developers, and game devs are people to. Hindsight is 20/20. 
---
I view MMOs as a big ol boiling pot, you might want to start adding all these things to it, different spices, vegetables and flavors, but once it's in you can't take it out, and the new stuff may clash with other new things or even old things. 
---
It's a hard and complicated recipe to get right, and the only way to truly know if it turned out right is after many years.
---
The exact one you want is ‚ÄúWorld of Warcraft Atlas, Second Edition‚Äù. That‚Äôs vanilla. The other expansions have the expansion name in the book title. 
---
Sure thing! üòä
---
Yeah it is, but I think it's productive to discuss why these mechanics are in place, and if their implementation have any depth or substance. 
---
Saying simply it shouldn't be changed without a reason why it would affect the gameplay, experience or even immersion is not productive. A lot of comments brought great points against it being changed, some that I thought were legit concerns and others overreaching, but they took the time to explain their opinions and make it a constructive discussion, and even change my mind about the whole issue.
---
üëç
---
Haha no pun intended?
---
Are they keeping Weapon skill-ups? That was present until WoLK.
---
I hope it is Classic with final patches before Burning Legion. Because I'd hate to have Wingclip as last tier talent for hunter...again.
---
Warriors aren‚Äôt great levelers and they don‚Äôt really synergize with warlocks. I mean warrior can perform decent solo or in a group but they don‚Äôt really add to a duo leveling. Now if your friend was playing a healer I‚Äôd be saying warrior just because being able to tank &gt;&gt; than waiting on an elusive tanks. I guess that still stands even with a lock having a tank is nice.
---
My raid group you either were at the entrance on time under your own steam or your DKP were top sliced.  Warlocks had better things to do with soul shards than summon lazy gits.
---
Uldaman should be at the bottom of this list IMO, shit loot, shit dungeon layout, shit bosses, shit to get to, and you're crawling through a cave network the whole time.  Fuck Uldaman.
---
The addition of the Salt Hardened Shell was mildly entertaining in MoP. It allowed you to dismount players on any mount. 
---
AFK on your flying mount in a safe place? Nope! Fall to your death. 
---
Leaving Sanctum of the Stars? Nope! Dismounted right at the drop off.
---
Fury warriors often tank in 5-mans because there otherwise wouldn't be enough tanks to fill runs. Lots of the best pre-raid fury gear is leather, the same stuff a rogue would want. Even for jewelry and trinkets, fury and rogues are looking for mostly the same stats, so a lot of those items are shared too.
---
I will not continue this discussion, as it is a waste of time.
---
Classic will not be on console.
---
And this is as it should be. End of Discussion.
---
TBH what makes it worse is that they're all orcs
---
To be more specific about modern-ish raids:  Tomb of Sargeras on heroic and mythic were fucking hard.  If you cleared that, Naxx shouldn't be an issue, especially if you were one of the tanks (by far the most individual responsibility).
---
Good catch - I didn‚Äôt even realize it was underwater!
---
Agreed, but let me introduce you to the Maiden encounter in ToS....aka find out how many of your guildies are colour blind or didn't learn their colours in kindergarten.

Pfff not even a 4 Strength 4 Stam Leather Belt.
---
Wat?
---
When it rained in Elwynn forest, hanging out in Goldshire felt so cozy.
---
I‚Äôve been on and off since Cata, dabbled in each xpac, but played very little WoD/Legion, and no BFA at all. Is this a thing? On one hand, what the actual fuck? But on the other hand, epics are already meaningless in that game, why not condition them to expect that instead.
---
Back in vanilla I was pushing for 11 for the cheap mount myself (while raiding)...then I got the AV ram and said fuck it and stopped trying to rank :P
---
It was a quest reward that RNG‚Äôd into an epic
---
Oh right weapon skill
---
Is that hard to level or just time consuming?
---
private server footage/discussion is not allowed.
---
Put hots on the tank and heal whatever dps decided to stand in the fire
---
Some of the tough BC stuff pre-nerf...sunwell, kael‚Äôthas, Etc.
---
Ask BEFORE you roll. Better yet, before you start the run.
---
Yes, I am dumb and [you are smart.](https://media.giphy.com/media/vLruErVSYGx8s/giphy.gif)
---
Mostly just time consuming.  Helps if you have any sort of Int buff though!
---
:scream:
---
&gt;Yeah it is, but I think it's productive to discuss why these mechanics are in place,
---
#No, it's not.
---
The entire reason behind Classic is to have the UNCHANGED, UNFILTERED, ORIGINAL game experience from 14 years ago. Including all the inconveniences which the gameplay of that era entailed. Minus the bugs that were never part of the gameplay-design, but technical mistakes.
---
&gt;Saying simply it shouldn't be changed without a reason why it would affect the gameplay, experience or even immersion is not productive.
---
I just gave you a reason. And if you are looking for an unproductive activity: Discussing changes to game mechanics when the developers stated specifically and repeatedly that no such changes will be introduced, is definitely one such.
---
&gt;and even change my mind about the whole issue.
---
I don't give a rats ass if you change your mind or not.
---
but they have the best talk animation of all
---
They're competing with shadowmeld, you can have a pvp trinket with a 1 min cooldown, or be a rogue in plate. It really is a tough choice, and many go with the taller one. Also, Alliance side you can often have BOF, so while escape artist is great, it's possible to get by without it if you have a pally friend.
---
Yeah. That was my favorite part of flying mounts in TBC: removing the frustration of being on the wrong side of a ridge, or dropping 10 feet down a hill and then needing 5 minutes to run back to where you just were.
---
Yeah that part‚Äôs easy but there‚Äôs also the downranking and shit, dunno how it works exactly
---
Random thing I noticed:
---
The lvl 45 mage was sheeping a 60 skull druid and his sheep was only resisted 1 out of 4 times. Something I noticed on private servers was that a skull enemy player seemed to resist almost all of my abilities. It'd be really awesome if private servers got that wrong and classic WoW is going to give lower level players a better chance at beating 60 gankers!
---
It'd be cool to have a similar survey, but give the dungeons two or three at a time and ask the user to order them in small chunks. Then you could ask each user ~20 questions in that format to get a good structure of their hierarchy. Then make a decision tree based on aggregate preferences across all the entries. Might provide you a cool graph and be more accurate. I went into the survey and was a little overwhelmed ordering them all together as a whole.
---
\*Stealth noises intensifies\*
---
This is incorrect. You are still limited far more by drinking time, instance resets, and waiting for respawns. In a hyper-ideal world where you aren't waiting on any of those things at all, then yes, AoE loot mages will get a slight bonus.
---
Let's assume for pulls like DME lashers that you take 20 seconds pulling, 30 seconds killing, 20 seconds eating/drinking, and it takes 5 seconds to auto loot each mob vs. 1 second AoE looting. These are really generous numbers on rotation, and it only gets you a little over 5% increase. Again, this is assuming you aren't instance locked (which you will be with DME lasher farm, one of the most profitable mage farms), waiting for respawns, or competing in the open world (again, unlikely).
---
That's a really far cry from 8hr farms turning into 5 hr farms... The only time you'll see better numbers are for things like whole dungeon pulls, but then you need to increase the time it takes to pull, which is going to put you at probably about the same numbers. It's just not that big of an impact.
---
As a druid, I was my own flying mount in TBC, and I did like my flight form, and I think that Outland was well designed for flight, there was a lot to see.
---
But in Azeroth itself, there's little need for flying - there are a lot of flight paths or boats, and a lot of the fun was the exploration, the searching - more so than in later releases, making your way to a new zone was always a revelation. 
---
I still remember my noob mistake in the south of Ashenvale, not realising that Barrens were horde and those guys up ahead with the ??? above their heads weren't friendly.
---
Well you cant have it all now, can you!? :)
---
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
---
As excited as I am for classic and as much as I love vanilla, I would play the fuck out of a Wrath server that leaves out the addition of cross-server dungeon finder from the end of the xpac. Wrath was so good before cross-server.
---
I agree with this. LFG turned trade chat from a scrolling storm of people looking for groups, to zombie cities where people stood and waited for queues to pop. It killed much of human interaction. Remember when blizzard had a poll after implementation asking what you do in your groups? Number 1 response was, ‚ÄúBe quiet and do my job.‚Äù
---
Flying didn‚Äôt dissociate people from the game, it just watered down the content. Why wait for pats to roll by, kill mobs in your way, or implement strategy when you can hop over from objective to objective?
---
It's good you pointed that out because everyone was confused.
---
i honestly still don't understand
---
I don't see how people do it without burning out. I spent a saturday just farming with the premade ranking group on a private server and it was fucking mind numbing.
---
If phase 2 doesn't last longer than the pre bg days, there is no way I'm going past rank 10. Before that I might be able to do my own pvp enough to keep up as a hunter without burning out on the most efficient grinding method
---
Bloodfang is still one of the coolest sets ever. No changing my mind that set was just perfect!
---
Cringe level 1000. I love it!
---
Good to know ty
---
There isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs such a vastly different game, even from BC. The formula *is* doomed from the start. I‚Äôd say, as other have said, X = C‚ÄôThun. There are easy and hard bosses in every raid, but the disparity is huge in Vanilla. You can likely clear most bosses in Molten Core with a non braindead team, but Garr, Shazzrah, and Ragnaros can be pretty tough. Same with AQ40, there are pushover bosses, and bosses that you could wipe on for weeks. 
---
Still, you are just one of 40. It takes a whole team to down a boss. Especially if everybody is just trying to pad damage and healing meters, then they‚Äôre not working as a team. You should strive to do good damage, but never at the detriment to the team.
---
While I agree with a lot of what LGW91 stated, MDiggity42069 is correct.   
---
This ain't "World of Can't We All Just Be Friends? Craft"
---
Oh yea.
---
Definitely bring it up beforehand, but yes, you can.  I mained a druid in early classic and later swapped over to rogue.  Regardless of who wins... make friends with the rogue!  There are a lot of bosses you can steath to and fight in a rogue/druid duo.  Just start off in bear, let the rogue pull aggro &amp; evade tank while you heal up, and go back to bear.  Hopefully the boss will be dead before you are.  I know a lot of shadowcraft pieces are on end bosses this wont work for, but I specifically remember doing this for rattlegore for the boots.
---
TBC was my favorite. It still felt a lot like vanilla, but the mechanics and class balance felt smoother, and the dungeons/raids were better designed overall.
---
The "Teddy Bear" comes from 1902 when U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt (a.k.a. Teddy) refused to shoot a bear cub that was brought to him. The act of kindness spread quickly and the name "Teddy Bear" became popular.
---
It's always a full moon? Is it everyday?
---
At level 23, when you get imp cleave 3/3, multitarget farming is high risk for runbacks (if mistakes are made or pvp happens) and potentially high amount of recovery time due to getting chunked. Also, cleave at that level only adds 5 damage so talented it does 11 instead. So you are spending 3 talent points to get 6 points of damage across two targets and only when you use that one ability with a slow two hander so not a lot of dps added.
---
I value stance dancing from arms tree. You can hop into defensive stance and do a 10 second disarm or shield wall. Stance dancing can lower your down time significantly. Overpower crits combo with impale and deep wounds is just the icing on the cake. In PvP, it is no contest I want arms. 
---
Stance dancing is what I will do at 60, but I don't want to play 100+ hours before I get to practice it some. That is why I think fury is lame. This is just one warrior's opinion though! If you have fun with 2H fury, more power to you.
---

---
KT might not even be the hardest boss in Classic Naxx. He was in Wrath Naxx, though. I‚Äôve never done Naxx either, but I know the disparity between Vanilla and Wrath Naxx is monstrous. Some of the HP pools and damage numbers in the 60 version are on par with the 80 version, which is *insane*.
---
&gt; First off, you wouldn't be required to play the game on consoles, so how does this affect you if you wouldn't have already done so.
---
you don't get it, do you?  please reread that other guys arguments carefully
---
One question to piggyback... what is the level range you can summon people? Isn‚Äôt there a bracket where it‚Äôs allowed, and past that bracket you‚Äôre too low or too high?
---
So I can roll need on say, Ironfoe, then DE it for the nexus crystal and get me a sweet enchantment, instead of buying it from the AH? I'm not rolling for an item, but enchanting mats. And everyone needs enchantments.
---
You *are* needing on an item. If you want it for money it is literally greed.
---
How is that fair for someone who actually needs the item? How does rolling need on a BoE for selling differ from rolling need on anything else for vendoring? Aside from the amount of money?
---
I don't understand that mentality. Being a ninja is ok if it gets you enough money?
---
&gt; every one of those 100 hours you spent getting there.
---
Oh I have NO problem with the idea of spending 100 hours on the game and then getting a BETTER version of it in just a couple months from now.
---
Yes please.
---
Please try to make this real I will buy 100 and 10% no matter the cost.
---
Maraudon, Gnomeragon, Wailing Caverns, Dire Maul.
---
Doubt it. If they were going to do that, they would have done it during their announcement. We will probably get the Chromie cinematic when we open up classic for the first time.
---
I thought diablo felt horrible on console. Gameplay for one, but the menus and interface was even worse. I‚Äôd try some off-shoot wow console game, but I don‚Äôt think WoW Is built well for console.
---
Ah, thank you for the info.
---
It's literally 10% spell hit.
---
Ill have to try stv out. I always avoided it because of pvp server while leveling. Sid dustwallow marsh, swamp of sorrows, arathi highland and desolace instead
---
Brah, I've been struggling with this myself; I'm stuck between a Mage and a Rogue.  
---
Mage Pros:
---
1. Don't have to buy Food/Drink
---
2. Mobs: Slows/Snares
---
3. Cloth gear = low repairs

4. Portals! Don't have to run everywhere &amp; Can turn a profit
---
5. AOE farming = Tons of Goldaronies
---
6. World PvP - Their match-ups aren't bad. Probably have a good time for the most part
---
7. Tier set bonuses are pretty good
---
8. Great DPS
---
Mage Cons:
---
1. Caster = Will have to Drink a lot
---
2. You'll spend a good amount of time pre-raid making stacks on stacks of water for everybody like 4 bottles at a time. Not too bad really, but kind of annoying
---
3. You're pretty much insta locked for Frost till the second half of Classic
---
4. Weaker early on, but after you gain Frost Nova things get a lot easier (so not sure if this is really a con)
---
Rogue Pros:
---
1. Stealth = Getting around easier; whether that's to avoid mobs or players - either way Stealth saves you time.
---
2. All Specs are viable = more fun; you can fiddle with the talent tree and explore new options 
---
3. Pretty low gear dependency. Can kill shit naked - we've already seen quite a few players do shit
---
4. Pick Pocketing! Can make a decent amount of money doing this whether it's early on in the game or later
---
5. Lock Picking! Money.
---
6. World PvP - You choose your encounters. Being in stealth allows you to avoid unfavorable match-ups
---
7. Poisons. You have access to poisons to help aid you along the road to 60 and thereon-after! 
---
8. See 4: Later on, you have the ability to one-shot people! Not to mention the ever so juicy stun-locking fuckery
---
9. Great DPS
---
Rogue Cons:
---
1. Competition. Unfortunately, A LOT of players are going to be rolling rogue and that means that you'll be fighting tooth and nail for a spot in raids
---
2. Lock Picking. Now, I know I have this as a pro, however I also believe it's annoying as balls to level up the skill, so I'm also putting it as a con. Not to mention the amount of people that are going to be bombarding your DMs whenever you step into a major city
---
3. Poisons. Also have this as a pro, however it can be a con too. Poisons are a bit annoying to deal with what with having to re-apply them over and over and over. You only get about 200 stacks??? I believe, so you def. have to be on your shit in PvP and honestly just in general
---
Hopefully this helps (kinda helping me, it's why I wrote this) and see you on the battlefield
---
Bite me 
---
-signed, rogue
---
Oh man, that's intense!
---
Downranking simply means using a lower level of a specific spell. In retail, you train a spell once, and it automatically grows in power as you do. But you used to have to learn improved ranks of your spells, which meant that you ended up with several different prefers of your spells in your spell book. So, for instance, you could cast a rank one healing spell to try to conserve mana OR to try to proc a clearcasting state. Procs weren't dependent on the rank of spell cast, just that a spell was cast, so using a lower rank of the spell instead of the highest rack you had raised could be an effective way to try to tease out a proc in PvE content, or a less mana intense way to eat up a defensive buff against an enemy.
---
let them play Mario...
---
&gt; And there will be many things that aren't identical, which is fine. But AoE looting just feels like an unnecessary vestigial organ of the modern game...
---
Sure, and I've stated and I'll state again, I couldn't care less if AoE looting was added or not. It's the principle of the matter that there are some things that could be changed in Classic, cherry-picked from modern WoW, that would only serve as a benefit to the players that opt-in to those changes. To have a group of people so dedicated to blatantly shutting down discussions about them is an asinine development.
---
I played Classic, I was in the Open beta in 2004 even. I am not naive enough to think that Classic was 100% good as-is. It's better in some sense than modern WoW in terms of there being true sense of progression, progression that doesn't become completely worthless months after you've achieved it, RPG elements, community elements, class diversity and uniqueness, etc. However, stuff that wasn't so great (aside from straight-up bugs): Some classes/specs being effectively dogshit in terms of their usefulness in high-tier endgame (paladin/druid tanks anyone?). BG Queue dodging. Dishonorable kill penalty. Holding shift to perform autoloot (not AoE loot mind you) was stupid and pain-inducing. Opening mail messages one-by-one. 1 hour mail wait time when mailing items to alts on the same account. 
---
As well as some ways that modern WoW is improved over Classic in a way that wouldn't hurt the experience for anyone if they were back-ported to Classic: Option in graphics settings to use the updated character models/animations. Mount/pet journal (not account-wide, just to get the things out of my bags, and the mount journal didn't start out as being account-wide either). Guild bank. Barber shop. And more.
---
Shhhhhhh
---
I will say flying around Outlands with the floating islands, giant mushrooms and into Netherstorm was extremely badass. Some of the visuals were jaw-dropping.
---
It just did bad things to game mechanics, especially PvP.
---
But it still looked damn cool.
---
So angsty.
---
Always ready to serve the community
---
shut up and take my money!
---
Unlike the modern game of today - there are only so many items in classic and most people know the BiS for classes.  There are many different types of personalities that get hosted on a game of this scale.  Some people don't want to play with elitists.  Some people just don't have the time or energy or even the desire to take a video game that seriously and that's perfectly fine.  There is no problem in that at all.  At the same time though - some people DO want to take it seriously and rather only play with like minded individuals.  You wouldn't want to play with an elitist right?  I mean they get completely demonized on this subreddit - but why is it wrong for them to not want to play with people who are far more casual then?  Why is okay to exclude one group from your desired player pool but not the other way around?
---
If all the addon does is tell someone where you stand on that casual to hardcore spectrum then what is the harm?  If anything it should theoretically prevent headaches from both of these groups and everyone in-between.  There's nothing stopping anyone from doing anything.  If I'm starting a group and I want to steam roll BWL real quick - well guess what - it's totally within my right to start my own group and come up with whatever requirements I want.  Just as you do.  
---
It won't be a big deal in classic because you are realm locked.  There's no cross realms - and you can only play with those on your server for raiding.  This means your reputation and attitude will carry far more weight than any silly addon.  It is one of the most beautiful things about classic.  Gearscore and [Raider.io](https://Raider.io) are obviously far more useful in today's settings when you have literally hundreds of realms of players that you don't know and have never met before.  You HAVE to reduce them to a number because there's simply not enough time to do it another way.
---
Classic won't require this.  People will know who you are - esp if you get into the raiding scene at all because even then it's a small amount of people.  
---
I understand your concerns because I understand the treatment of players people get when the community dissolved around Wrath.  
---
But bitching about something like that now is either a lack of critical thinking in the vastly different dynamics between retail and classic - or you're just trash and want to be carried by others who put in the work and you want to throw a tantrum if they tell you no.
---
Haha!
---
Druids are the preferred 5-man tanks. Great damage, better aggro and tank survivability in a 5-man is a non-issue. Lack of Defense makes them rough for MTing raids unless they overgear the tier. Good offtank still.
---
Bop/Bubble &gt; fade by miles. Just be careful cuz bop doesn't stop spell casting so they won't stop targeting u if they wanna cast. Beauty of bop is you can save your dps as well if they do something stupid. Mages/locks can be very aggressive in a group with a paladin. 
---
Bubble is the ultimate oh shit button. Will save you from just about anything but a few raid mechanics
---
Paladins have seals...Much better than wanding especially if you have a caster heavy group
---
5 second rule isnt something you should be considering unless you fuck up, or have to Lay on Hands and have ur rune/potion cds burned. You should have been down ranking earlier to avoid ever having to see the 5 second rule as a paladin. As the patches roll on and you get more int/spell crit your mana becomes infinite if you're not overhealing and in a good raid.  Paladins have an excellent int/spell crit ratio relative to other classes and due to talents get fully refunded mana on crit heals. 
---
All classes have to engineering in any decent guild. A group of 15 engineer mages and paladins can easily wipe a group of 40 non engis. Goblin sapper charges, dynamite, and other things like battle chicken and dragonling are very good in raid as well.
---
I wont pretend that i struck the timing on the head, but it's still significant gameplay change.
---
&gt; and something everyone has equal access to anyway, not just mages and paladins by themselves. 
---
Can't agree here, esp. without good gear. You run over and pick up 20 mobs and aoe them down together, something no other class ever comes close to in speed, there is a reason Mages are kings of AoE and you can pretty much see only them doing it. Thing is once mobs die they die stacking themselves up, boy... looting these one by one isn't fun.
---
Anyway, i will specifically try to give you an answer for the AoE loot and your question about what it could have led to.
---
FIrst of all i skiped MoP. Played WoD and Legion, these games were at this point pretty much new games compared to vanilla.
---
AoE loot (and god knows how much more) changes were product of that point of time, a point of time that came because people asked for changes and over time they received them.
---
So i can't apply that logic when it comes to vanilla. Go ahead and ask a more easily to discuss question. 
---
What change do you think wont affect vanilla experience, but will be a simple QoL? And if neither of us can prove the "fallacy" part, why even change anything and take the risk? 
---
I can't give you satisfying answer for a mechanic that came in a time where WoW pretty much had nothing to do with its Vanilla counter part
---
If we two come to agreement that it is possible to actually put QoL that makes sense, like mass mail sending, what do we achieve other than the 2 of us coming to agreement? Its like we fight on the street, became friends and suddenly there are 100k people that might or might not attack us.
---
They need the files to do that, which is probably questionable given that they don't have much before 1.12. If they do it wouldn't be hard to just change a couple settings to render at a higher resolution, assuming they could even open the project and things didn't break (which is likely given that it's a decade and a half old or so).
---
That Chromie cinematic probably took 2 hours to finish. There‚Äôs nothing new in it. It‚Äôs just a mashup of everything.
---
They redid the opening cinematic for Warcraft III Reforged.
---
But to be honest, it was a different thing. The one for WoW is still amazing. Just export a Full HD version of it and done.
---
Mods, can he get a flair up in here `Community Servant`?
---
Pretty much every single Raidboss from and including Ulduar onward.

I would rather wait for a finished game and long release train. By looking on a market I see that there is no strong competitor to it. So it must be top mmorpg game until someone release a next-gen mmorpg. Retail is bullshit, a game which feels like a cheap arcade mobile game.
---
Old people suck!
---
When we were doing it, we would be playing another game together in another window, like unreal or eve or anything really.
---
Changing up the second game every few days is how we kept our sanity
---
That was only because of the server populations.  Rank gains were percentage-based on the population that hit a certain level of honor in a given week.  On almost every server, that meant one person was HWL/GM at a time, but a lot of the higher pop servers had 2-3 hit rank 14 at any given time.
---
I'd buy this IMMEDIATELY.
---
It was a bit cheesy, but I thought it was a cute way to reveal the game. Not sure how else they would do it lol, cinematic is out of the question, way too much money. Showing all the large events undoing themselves was neat.
---
Hmm. Just had an interesting idea. Has the advantage of the speed of a warlock summon as well as incentive for people to run anyway.... Which instances have a "deadly summon feature" nearby? Say like on the chain heading towards BRD aimed so that a summon falls to their death in the lava below? Want a summon because you're too damn lazy to run? Sure, I'll give it to you. The corpse run will be much shorter after all....
---
And it's totally in line from a RP perspective for a warlock....
---
&gt;That weapon you assert is a PVP weapon purely is the best weapon for arms warriors, ret paladins
---
What? Its not even close to being the best weapon for any class. It's an incredibly expensive, fancy glowing stick that give you bragging rights.
---
How is it helpful to spend 8000g from the guildbank so some guy can sit in Ironforge showing off the mace?

In my dreams i still think about that moment theyll release it without telling us a exact date and suddenly its there &lt;3

We are looking to have a fun time in classic and do everything there is to do. We plan on doing pre-made PvP and fun world PvP events.

Our guild culture will develop as more people join but with the small core that we have right now we‚Äôre all looking to have fun and help each other out. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll quickly see that we like to be silly and I hope you‚Äôll join us on our classic adventure.

Welcome to Azeroth
---
I remember playing a rogue back in the day and HATING the slow stealth speed. Also, since I have never played one before, I'm not sure what I'll be doing in WPvP - and I'm definitely playing on a PvP server. However, rogue really appeals to me so I guess I'm asking how hard is it to pick up playing a rogue in Classic?
---
I'll make one but he won't get a lot of priority playtime.  Jayne one day he'll be a Hugh enough level for Barman Shanker runs.
---
I really want to discuss this but i simply can't take you seriosly... 
---
Maybe i pulled some numbers that aren't really legit, i mean they arent...
---
But 5% gain? And why one farming example, simply because its good isn't enough. There is gear and a progressive game, you aren't starting a new char in a Pserver.
---
Lets step out of the lasher part, AoE farm is wide and it's applied for many things and purposes, not only gold.
---
You say mana drinking will be a deterrent, how exactly? You will go out of resource on pretty much any class every time you kill 3 mobs. With average gear and a mage, you got crystals, evocation etc. If you start killing mobs one by one you will be forced to drink at the fourth mob, like everyone else.
---
But no, thats not how it works. You won't pull 4 mobs, you will pull 20, and aoe them down with the exact mana cost.
---
Then there are item farms, reputation farm etc etc. You don't just slap AoE loot and call it 5% increase, you know very well that is not true.
---
Also you do know that mobs that die in the masses tend to stak their corpses right? You aren't looting these mop in 3 seconds, not even close.
---
Ahhh shoot, I gotchya. Well fuuuuuuck, haha
---
Sure, obviously not if you're healing or god forbid owling the instance, but you're gonna be feralin so thats cool.

Flying is just a small issue, there are a lot more bigger underlying problems that screwed up retail wow
---
My casualcore guild did this back in vanilla. We needed all the help we could get.
---
No. I dont get it. And re-reading it didn't help. It seems you understand him more than I do. Perhaps you might be able to explain it in a way I better grasp.
---
 \&gt; So I can roll need on say, Ironfoe 
---
Can you buy Ironfoe from the AH??
---
No you cant, so don't roll need on it, unless you can actually use it. It really is that simple...
---
\&gt;  How is that fair for someone who actually needs the item? 
---
If you actually NEED a BoE, you should already have it, since you can just buy it from AH.
---
\&gt;  How does rolling need on a BoE for selling differ from rolling need on anything else for vendoring?  Aside from the amount of money? 
---
Again, if it can be bought and sold on AH, you should need.
---
If it's BoP then only need if you can use it.
---
\&gt;  Being a ninja is ok if it gets you enough money? 
---
The whole point of this is that it completely prevents ninjas, while also being fair to everyone in the group.
---
If people are greeding on BoEs, there's absolutely nothing stopping someone from ninjaing the valuable stuff.
---
And no, no one is going to give a shit that some random lvl 36 hunter ninja'd a purple BoE from your group.
---
Gnomer had potential to be a great dungeon, but the maze-like layout kinda ruins the experience. It's the same with basically all the dungeons in vanilla that I dislike: Gnomer, Uldaman, Sunken Temple, and (gulp)... BRD.
---
There's a happy medium between the streamlined 1-way hallway of modern dungeons and the so-convoluted-I-need-a-walkthrough design of some vanilla dungeons.
---
&gt; aka find out how many of your guildies are colour blind or didn't learn their colours in kindergarten.
---
Mekkatorque is the same tbh. We had a lot of fun with our colorblinds and how one of them started to refer to the colours as "chicken" and "gear thingy" 8)
---
Youre going to do more than 1 raid. I did BWL for about 8 months on my Paladin and managed 6/8 T2
---
If the private server community is anything to go by, it won‚Äôt be that high. But not everyone has stayed up to date on server meta.
---
It was only supposed to be for the standing 1 person and the title only last a week along with a teleport spell for the race specific capital. You would not see more than one person at a time per faction.
---
In retail there is no rare and there's barely a real "elite".
---
Why is he a sellout?
---
Then explain the popularity of Soda, Asmongold, TipsOut, Strafecro, Esfand, etc
---
I don't know rogues, but I wanted to point out that you're ~14 years older now. Everything will be easier to understand. You can learn any class reasonably well.
---
Hell, quest blues will turn epic on occasion, even when low-level.
---
Honestly man I played EU back during lich king because I‚Äôm American and worked nights and I had a ton of great friendships started on those servers.
---
On p servers the solution to this is raid weekends
---
Early afternoon for us (americans), early night for them
---
I've done it in reverse. Wasn't terrible as they had it set up. So sunday or saturday night would be raid day for the euros, generally sunday.
---
Its very obvious when it comes to those quests. The rewards are generally choices of, BiS melee DPS piece, good Caster piece or BiS healing piece. The stats make it very apparent which one youll want.
---
Raided on a pserver and was in a NA guild. We had 3-5 Europeans raiding with us. It was always around 4am their time lol. If you can make it work on your end it‚Äôs possible. Had 2 of them over sleep once but that‚Äôs part of life lol. I have a NA friend who plans on playing on EU servers because he met so many close friends that he wants to continue playing with.
---
Because in Vanilla you could not trigger the buff if Onyxia's head was already displayed, and the head stayed up for like 6 hours. So if someone else turned in the head 3 hours before your raid then you your plans went out the window.
---
A cat is smoking a pipe.
---
&gt; The entire reason behind Classic is to have the UNCHANGED, UNFILTERED, ORIGINAL game experience from 14 years ago. Including all the inconveniences which the gameplay of that era entailed. Minus the bugs that were never part of the gameplay-design, but technical mistakes.
---
It's your opinion and you are entitled to it, but don't say that like it's gospel, when even the devs are willing to discuss stuff like implementing loot trading in raids, items being their 1.12 version since phase 1, etc. But your point is valid if you are looking for a crystalline version of classic just without the bugs, and that's great that you took the time to explain now, thank you!
---
 &gt; I don't give a rats ass if you change your mind or not. Your opinion on this matter is inconsequential. The looting system will be exactly as it was in Vanilla, period. No matter what you want, think, feel or wish for.
---
You know that internet forums and boards are made for discussion right? If it's not your thing just don't engage in it, no need to be defensive about it, my individual opinion might not matter on the grand scheme of things, but it's good to have a community discussing even if disagreeing in points so we can have a better understanding of the topic, no need to be aggressive, condescending or vile, just chill dude.
---
It's not too hard as any race to run to the org zeppelin and get to the undead starting area and level with your friend there just so you know. It's only like a 30 minute commitment at most.
---
Warlock v Druid:
---
Can be bear?

Can be sea beast?

Can be feathered antler-bear?
---
Druid: Sorta
---
Has many friends?
---
Druid: also no.
---
Yeah. My casual raiding guild did this regularly, and it wasn't because we were badass or wanted to clear faster. It was because we were stuck on XYZ boss for a month, and half the raid hadn't farmed consumables, but maybe the Onyxia buff could help our sorry asses.
---
Well where was he with you think you want it but you don‚Äôt when we asked for quality of life improvements way back when!!
---
Super good point here. 
---
Repair costs are greater for heavier armor.
---
sick! I was named Fearz for both my rogue and warrior on frostwolf. Gnome's that is. I got 1 guy banned and recreated the same name the next time lol... I can't remember if I fought you a few times.
---
"you think you want to book vacation time, but you don't"
---
I'm so looking forward to actually raiding in a proper 40 man for the first time.
---
Both
---
There is just the issue of licensing. I don‚Äôt think Blizzard would appreciate you turning a profit using their brand.
---
Nobody is going to see the gear though, you are gonna be shredding their face in kitty form.
---
Well yeah but who would do that intentionally? Nobody wants to be that one dude rolling around with a mismatched outfit. It's different when everybody is in it together, otherwise you just look like a noob or a moron.
---
Green is beautiful.
---
the macarana
---
The healthier outlook is ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt wait to get to 60 so I can defend the lowbies from the gankers‚Äù
---
Yup!
---
Yerp. I think riiiight after the demo they had playable, there was a massive boost in a certain servers population...the starting zones were absolute madhouses. When there's literally several hundred humans level 1-6...its rough
---
With the exception of soda who doesn‚Äôt even just play mmos or at all for the longest time now. Those guys are a drop in the bucket compared to summit,shroud,ninja,tfue and daquan or drdisrrspect. Tipsout,straf,esfand.......uhhh who?
---
nice
---
And in that period you had to first find out the strats for the bosses, then get to 4HM and discover you need 8 tanks, so you have to gear those up.
---
When the boss finally dies you figure out the entire raid need frost res, so you have to farm that too. Not to mention all the resistance pots etc you need.
---
Guilds know all this now. They can prepare enough tanks with Nat's Broken Reel, and they can farm all the resistance gear and consumables in advance. I fully expect a day one clear by multiple guilds when it finally opens in Classic.
---
Why are you refreshing on your work computers? Don't you guys have phones?
---
This is a great response
---
oh the howls of "vanilla elitist" rang for weeks
---
Was going to say yea, reforged is a whole different ball game than the cinematic. 
---
There's really not a need to re do the opening cinematic, nor would it be a good use of funds to do. Like I said, I bet we get the chromie cinematic as a first time launch for classic just because... Theres not much new, but it is a good representation of what classic is.
---
I know but i prefer a launch with 400 people and no sharing and all the bullshit like people disappearing in midair, not being able to see friends that are at the same place and not being able to do multiple lvl 1 raids racing to get hogger before the other.
---
An orc stands between their allies and death, a gnome cuts it off at the knees.
---
Blizzard designs them for ground mounts. The problem is they are afraid to make the zones feel empty so pack so much into a small number of zones. Obviously parts are for flying but 90% of the zones are made so you ground mount on them through the quest lines. The zones fall apart once you get flying.
---
Gold can be excanged for goods and services outside of the AH as well
---
If you really *need* an item, you should already have it, since you can hire 4 other people to farm the instance with you for the item.
---
Your system won't stop ninjas, as ninjas will still ninja. All it does is create more ninjas by giving greedy people justification to ninja.
---
Why can't it just be "need if you need, greed if greed"?
---
Awww yes, that's the stuff.
---
As the other commenter said, only a handful of people get any gear for each raid. Given how many slots you have to gear up, that's a *lot* of clears for each raid to get close to fully geared for that tier. It's a little easier in later phases when there are multiple raids each group can clear in a week, so catch-up gear is not as hard to get. But it's still really time consuming. That's a big reason for the longevity of the game. It simply takes a long time to "complete".
---
A quicker release date.
---
High school student here, I got all summer vacation. Dont have to worry about submitting vacation time forms or whatever. What I **do** have to worry about is Classic not releasing early enough for me to really sink my teeth into when I have all the time in the world to do it.
---
Agreed, it's not my least favorite, but it certainly sucks.  Also most of the quests for the instance are just the area outside the instance and it's hard to get people to help with that.  Also has some of the worst level scaling from start to finish of any instance especially at that level bracket since level 40 is a massive power increase for many classes.
---
Downranking is super easy.  usually only done with healing touch and rejuv as regrowth is too mana inefficient regardless.  You just have another 2 or 3 keybinds in case your heal isn't urgently needed to top someone off.  
---
I healed plenty of 5-mans as a vanilla druid, and I had a pretty low ranked (about level 40) healing touch that I'd use along with a lower ranked rejuv- if a DPS took a few hits but was otherwise "out of danger" I'd use the downranked HT on them, and then the rejuv when it finished casting, and the DPS would be fine as long as they didn't aggressively pull aggro somehow.  
---
If you just set it up on your action bar, you'll find it's very intuitive to know when someone needs a heal but they don't need as much heal as you can possibly give.  Especially as a druid when you don't have a flash heal- since regrowth is such an awful rate of health per mana you very rarely will use it in pve.
---
Percentage was increased for ranks 6 to 14 in patch 1.8. Due to the small percentage before 1.8 only one player could get rank 14 in one faction.
---
Most/all of the T0 sets are not preraid BIS anyways so nobody should really care if you're rolling on them. It's just as useful for feral as rogue.
---
You have to have a good grasp of Vanilla to understand what he is doing and why he is doing it though. I did try, but vanilla, unlike retail can't just be emulated by watching scripted play.
---
My main was a Warrior in Vanilla. Levelliing I had several advantages that we won't have on classic (at launch, at least)
---
Had friends help me get the Whirlwind Axe at level 30. EXTREMELY op weapon at level 30; you have to kill a level 40? elite at the end of the quest. Pretty sure that weapon lasted 10-15 levels before needing to upgrade.
---
I was on a high pop  server so low level BOE blues were cheap on the AH.
---
My irl friend was a rich raider (let's be honest, he probably just bought gold haha) so I got a free mount at both 40 and 60.
---
All of these things made levelling a lot easer, but you know what? Levelling a warrior was still PLENTY painful at times. 
---
It'll be interesting  having to do it with the crap gear you find along the way just doing quests, and hoping for a lucky drop during a dungeon run. 
---
All that being said, I'm still considering maining a warrior again in classic because I still think it was the most rewarding class to play in the game.
---
#GOOD BOT
---
Yeah. 40 man raiding is actually fun. It just isn't that mess anymore, which a lot of people think and/or make it out to be. People are not DC'ing left and right, while also having FPS issues anymore and finding 39+ people for a guild isn't that hard, because everybody and their mother have time for raiding these days. Since clear times have been halved, so you're cutting day(s) off your normal raid schedule.
---
All in all, 40 man raiding is cool, but don't expect it to be the same as back then.
---
Discussion is discussion, can't change people's minds in a vacuum. Someone might eventually read our discussion and come to the same conclusions. Who knows?
---
&gt; What change do you think wont affect vanilla experience, but will be a simple QoL?
---
Several: Barber Shop. Guild Bank. Mount/pet journal (not account-wide). Instant-mail to alts. Open-all mail button (they're doing that already). One-click autoloot (no holding shift, which I think is already in and staying). Options in graphics settings to use WoD character models and/or Legion combat animations. Options in graphics settings to use fancy water/shadow visuals (which I also think is staying in). In-game calendar with guild event scheduling/signup.
---
You might want to consider one of the less powerful builds for a class (elemental shaman or balance druid). If this is her first time, she'll want to experience the game and if you're there powering through everything, it'd be pretty easy for her to feel a little less excited about her own game. An experienced player playing a moderately powerful build is about the same as a new player playing a strong one.
---
Thanks! You can ask me for more facts any time. Beep boop.
---
Oh I don't. But it's still exciting. It will certainly be way more efficient.
---
I wish they kept pally t1 like that. Couldn't stand being captain banana shoulders back in the day.

I leveled to about 25 a couple times on a shaman to get the early route down and whatnot. And to see how difficult certain dungeons were to heal and what lvl I should attempt to complete them. And honestly it made such a small difference. Sure Ill level a bit faster but in the grand scheme of things it changes nothing. Imo doing some practice wont really make that much of a difference. If I were you I would just check out some instant level 60 servers and mess around to check out class/race combos. I was torn between tauren and orc sham for a whole before I played with them a bit. I also spent some time messing with keybinds. I forgot just how many damn buttons shaman needs.

[This doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10IV_3NEmZdhh8iQXrs2Ek77YyUJbjBMWO5UxIWLlZl0/edit?usp=sharing) under the equipment page has all prebis gear for each class both by phase and situational encounters.
---
About 3 fiddy
---
Heroic Ulduar I suppose
---
Worth noting that a paladin's heals draw half as much threat as a priests just by default, so fade not being there isnt AS much of a worry
---
I'm excited as well! I wish you the best when Classic launches!
---
Understandable. I had been trying to get rank 14 back then, but once I hit where I got and realized the time commitment was only getting worse I gave gave up on that real quick
---
One cool work around that I remember doing if you're in a dungeon with a warlock and you need to get something out of a bank or repair (I think this was in vanilla, correct me if I'm wrong):
---
1. While still in the dungeon, have the warlock summon you, but don't click accept or decline on the pop-up window.
---
2. Hearth or jump through a mage portal, do your business in town quickly without touching the summon pop-up.
---
3. Within 2 minutes of the summon, click accept. You will be brought back into the instance.
---
Obviously we don't know if this will work in Classic, but it was a useful trick. It worked because when the summon went through, you were both in the dungeon together.
---
Huh. This is what Tier 2 looked like when I started WoW
---
September 2019
---
You can stop refreshing now
---
Can you elaborate more on what being a Horse player entails?
---
Up to them if they wanna lose money honestly. Yeah the hardcore will play no matter when it launches, but the passive crowd, the people just going to give it a go have too many options this summer with other mmo's releasing or releasing new expansions. If theyre gambling that they can release it alongside one of these other games and steal their thunder, I think they'll be surprised when they lose the casual crowd to something shiny and new vs a 15 year old game that has no communication with their community. I mean put yourself as someone just discovering this community because there hasnt been alot of advertisements for classic. You come here and near every post is practically begging for any information on a supposed launch within the next couple of months? It doesnt inspire the passerby to hang about.
---
Yeah, the one on the left looks more realistic, the one on the right just looks retarded. For one thing I was never a fan of those massive wrestler looking belts.

***\*moonfire spamming backpedal noises intensify\****
---
Why not both. Lol
---
Worked on yourself too, though at least some of the private servers didn‚Äôt have self-summoning functional. One of the many class utilities that‚Äôs long dead on retail thanks to every group having a repair bot or mount.
---
\*after the wipe\* 
---
Haha sorry guys, no ankh I could've sworn I bought some before I left town
---
setnetjer's post explains the mechanic, but I want to add what is largely the point of downranking as a healer: most spells have a fairly similar heal-per-mana ratio regardless of which rank, but the addition of +healing gear breaks this wide open. Paladin flash of light is one of the only spells with such good hpm (and low hps) that you're fine spamming it. The other healing classes will have multiple ranks of primary spells on their bars, and this is especially true of druids - who have a comparatively more narrow toolkit in vanilla. Rejuv doesn't stack with that of other druids, regrowth is appalling hpm even if the hot isn't overheal, and druids lack an inspiration/ancestral fortitude effect (i.e. reason to fish for crits). A considerable amount of your time will be spent on various ranks of healing touch.
---
who cares about Backlash.   the people who still play modern WoW are going to play it regardless if their is flying or not.  they are sunken cost fallacy gamers
---
Thank you, good info. A bit odd to navigate but very useful lol
---
I didnt like BC cause of the zones. Immediately dissapointed me. Did not have that magic. And the space thing kind of turned me off cause it felt like no room for exploration. I like the zones to have oceans so you can explore maybe find some islands. 
---
I would however love to play BC again as I barely played that expansion. Hopefully they eventually allow you to transfer classic wow characters over to a BC server so I can truly experience it. The little I played was so much better than current retail and I think I would have more appreciation for it this time around because of that. And because it would be fairly new experience for me since a lot of content I did not do
---
A lot of guilds will need warm bodies to fill 40 raid slots. We had 2 kitties that raided with us regularly in vanilla.
---
The 20-man raids are also pretty kitty friendly and casual-raider friendly.
---
Warlock set is sexy af.
---
Just be a clicker?? If you're serious about playing buy an MMO mouse, they have multiple thumb buttons you can bind to your spells, then use the mouse to walk forward (holding down both buttons same time) and turn (just the right mouse button) etc. Nbd.
---
I use an add-on called Immersion  which breaks down quest dialogue into smaller snippets and shows a 3d picture of the quest giver talking. It makes it a lot easier to take the time to read the quest text.
---
Yea, at least when you're about to get ganked you can see it running at you instead of death from above.
---
yeehaw
---
If you're willing to go through so much trouble to get an item that vendors for 5g, then need on everything, see where that will get you.
---
&gt; Your system won't stop ninjas, as ninjas will still ninja.  All it does is create more ninjas by giving greedy people justification to ninja. 
---
\- The item is worth significant amount of gold on the Auction House.
---
\- Everyone NEEDS significant amount of gold.
---
\- Therefore everyone needs the item.
---
\- If everyone needs the item, then there cannot be any ninjas.
---
I don't know how to break this down any simpler for you.
---
Just because you refuse to listen to logic, doesn't make it any less logical.
---
&gt;  Why can't it just be "need if you need, greed if greed"? 
---
BECAUSE THAT IS WHAT ENABLES NINJAS! 
---
There will always be an asshole that waits until everyone hits Greed just so he can press Need.

You cast chain heal, keep your totems up, and get invited to every group on the server

wat
---
&gt; As someone who never got to experience the game when flying was available, this makes sense, but is also pretty disappointing to hear. 
---
You have to remember that a *lot* of the pirate server babies circlejerking here (a) never played retail vanilla or TBC and (b) think PvP servers are the entire universe.
---
From a PvE perspective, flying in TBC was fine. The 70 zones were designed with flying in mind, and being able to skip trash you didn't want to fight in lowbie zones was a straight quality of life improvement and not really much different to what epic mounts did in vanilla.
---
The world PvP objectives in TBC couldn't safely be captured while flying IIRC. If you wanted to claim one you had to be in range of defenders on the ground, so you had to dismount and fight.
---
It's a fair complaint that flying mounts changed world ganking in ways people didn't like, but I don't think PvP server issues should totally dictate how Normal servers play. PvP players should adapt to the new meta and deal with it, instead of demanding awesome PvE features be taken away to placate their hurt feelings.
---
You may be thinking of the summoning stones outside instances. Believe those had a level bracket appropriate for their respective dungeons when the function was implemented. Warlock summons could be used on any party member regardless of level.
---
This is more what I was looking for, but there's some issues with it as well. For instance on Phase 1, looking at a mage, there's NO WAY i'm going to be able to get 2 Freezing Bands (boe epic).  And idk if i have the time to run Strat 100 times to get a 'random enchantment' cape to roll frost damage haha. But otherwise very useful. Thank you!
---
Warriors don‚Äôt use leather tho
---
Never played horse, i mean shaman, in vanilla. But from what ive understood theyre brought to raids mainy for the totem support as their healing is a little weaker than priests.
---
July 16th.
---
They're going to tell us the release date on July 16th. We figured out the clues, but the meaning was wrong ;)
---
I need like 5,000 posts when that happens
---
I hope your wrong, watching guilds race for world first kills that lasted weeks was a blast. If they measure it in hours that kills all of the hype. I guess if nothing else we have server firsts assuming you don't have a top world guild on your server.
---
You could do a fair chunk of damage with a shadow priest's SW:P and SW:D and then Levitate to safety. Usually not enough to kill a decently geared toon with full health, but if someone was wounded and tried to fly to safety it could finish them off. I imagine that a gank squad of four or five shadow priests could kill most people that way.
---
Looks  a hell of alot like mine till i broke and wanted to play him again...
---
then quit him again when i realized they killed rogues and made a fucking pirate class...
---
That fight is actually really cool. It's where the Darkmoon flying ring game comes from.
---
I think that would be more than fine. The problem warrior runs into while out in the world is maintaining HP and dealing damage. You are a sponge, and as a sponge, you soak that damage up!
---
With a healer behind you, you'll have enough vitality to slice through mobs, and the added damage that comes from shadow word and smite.
---
From an algebraic standpoint, you'll need to kill twice as fast to maintain 100% EXP from mobs, right? Also, and this is important, a lot of EXP comes from questing which scales perfectly fine for tandem leveling tactics - in fact, you'll be able to burn through quests faster than normal, without the hassle of dying or needing additional members for elite quests.
---
Not only would it be sufficient, it would be sensical and wise. Anymore seems unnecessary. I think the sweet spot is two.
---
Such a gnome thing to do, amazing.
---
Really tho...
---
Flying didn't make its way into EK/Kalimdor until Cataclysm
---
I should be capitalized. I can barely understand what you‚Äôre trying to say with it not capitalized.
---
J. Allen Black, I've come to bargain!
---
Sounds tough. Wasn't dishonour eventually removed?
---
I will admit that i can agree with some of these, even though using the shitty water of old, could actually hide you from a ganker.
---
Lets assume we shake hands, and call it OK. But then i remember the instanity of current gen kids that want medals for being the losers, and i fear the amount of resolve blizzard has to say "stop". I think we had a good run. Lets call it a night for now, i guarantee you that we will do this again, these threads pop by the hour, and sometimes the proposed changes are insane.
---
I mained a holy Pally on a private server and beat KT there
---
1. Threat problems? No, Pally's have 0.5 threat modifier to their heals and you can wear a healing shield for bonus armor if you do pull threat in a dungeon and you have bubble
---
2. Sitting around while not healing? In dungeons you can auto attack mobs when you don't need to heal for a bit of bonus damage, auto attacking is good because it can refresh a judgement you have on a mob or boss, if you have a weapon like Nightfall you can auto with that + SoR to apply the proc and you can put on Seal of Wisdom to refresh your mana for faster pulls.
---
3. Can you solo heal all 5 man content? Yes but if you're not very well geared just have your tank pull smaller packs in harder dungeons like Scholo.
---
4. Can you level as holy? You can but Consecration costs a ton of mana and isn't very efficient for just one mob so you'll spend a lot of time drinking between mobs, I leveled as Ret because of the reasons you stated.
---
5. Is Engineering required? Not really unless you plan on tanking dungeons or doing PvP, I stuck with Enchanting and Herbs because my gold grinding method required them but engineering is very useful if you can fit it in.
---
We had a gnome warrior main tank in BWL. We had to swap to a non-gnome tank for a few fights. He was so damn short that he'd lose LoS on one of the drakes because the moulding was taller than he was.
---
Not moving at full speed in stealth is part of the class, but you can sprint in stealth too.. I'd suggest taking a look at playing warrior also
---
So generally..they plant buffs and exist. That doesn't sound terribly enjoyable. Do they level easily at least?
---
Why not Stromshroud set??
---
No more belves taking up 60% of horde. Woohoo
---
This question gets asked at least 5 times a day. Nobody knows and we're tired of speculating.
---
Everytime someone asks for the release date, it gets delayed by a week.
---
This topic has been discussed a thousand times my dude. Enjoy the downvotes lol üòÇ
---
You asked for best in slot, not easy to get good items
---
/handshake
---
It‚Äôs been asked since Classic was announced. Would make the most sense if they went with BC if Classic is successful but it‚Äôs so far away it‚Äôs not worth really worrying about now. 
---
Let‚Äôs focus on making sure Classic is a great experience for as many people as possible. Don‚Äôt be a toxic asshat and help the community be the kind of community that new players want to be a part of.
---
Once the game gets to Naxx, we can start talking about what happens next.
---
Of course. That's how the game got to the state it was in. All the things we want from class were stripped away because we played classic to death and they became annoyances.
---
I want a long intricate leveling experience. After I had played the game for 2 years and leveling a 6th alt, a long level grind was not something I found enjoyable.
---
Write a similar title in google and add reddit at the end. You will get 1500 threads like these from today alone. Not trying to be an ass but this reddit appears toxic for the simple reason that people got tired to have this debate 10 times a day.
---
I certainly am.
---
Hey im gonna pick your brain if you dont mind.
---
I played priest pretty much exclusively in vanilla, but a dwarf in Judgement is my favorite look in all of vanilla, and hearing you explain things, as well as doing some research of my own on paladins, Im interested in going pally, because I know they're definitely good endgame healers.
---
That said, I will (hopefully) be levelling with 3 others (a warrior, priest and mage/hunter (he's undecided)) would you say that ret is probably the most useful way for me to level if Im going to fill a dps/supporting heals role
---
I loved BFD. It had such a cool feel, and for being linear it was still entertaining!
---
&gt;I probably should just enjoy the moment though and not worry about it.
---
This right here. Enjoy the ride. Nobody knows what Blizz is planning after Naxx, and we can speculate till our brains are mush. 
---
Better to just slow down and savor the moment.
---
As a tank my groups always have 3 things...
---
-Me tanking (warrior)
---
-Mage (I need food for questing after the group, healer water... no more accidental oops I have to go to town or does anyone have water, also for a town portal after...I create groups based around my hearthstone cooldown...by the time its over its off CD and I can turn quest in org / train then hearth back to UC / STV and get questing fast)
---
-Warlock- Speeds the dungeon run up..both to start and while inside...if players leave or get kicked.
---
The last two go to whoever..I always friend up mages and warlocks first...and help them with quests in the field so they like me &lt;3
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8U7TdpZcI0
---
I'm curious, are there any specs that ACTUALLY want their tier set bonuses? I was looking forward to going back and collecting those sets in Classic because I loved the idea of set bonuses, but at least when it comes to Druids they seem to be completely avoided in most BiS discussion.
---
.....#nochanges?
---
Sarcasm aside, I would not mind. I will be hyped regardless
---
If you can figure the answer to this question you deserve to be lead developer on the next top mmo.
---
Same to you! Maybe we'll meet up in game! :D
---
Quicker announcement, so people can plan their vacations and such.
---
The best part is the reputation.
---
You can build up a reputation that will have people add you to friends because they remember seeing you in dungeons quite a lot and actually being decent.
---
By level 60 you will most likely have a small list of people if you were running as a healer/tank and you might even get a few new friends from that.
---
That shit does not really happen in retail anymore, at least not on the level that Vanilla had.
---
Apparently I'm a fucking weirdo for liking Scholo and hating BRD
---
its not just about being committed to the dungeon, it makes World of Warcraft seem like ya'know a "world".  The people who always want instant gratification are ones that ruin it for everyone else
---
I agree, I‚Äôm getting gables ruthlessly at lvl 38, but you just have to take it in stride.... and then return the favour!
---
I doubt it? The cinematic still look great.
---
I would like to see mini cinematics for each content phase though that would be dope.
---
And when does 8.2 come out? June? I'd assume they want to let it breath alittle before classic.
---
they don't play BFA at all dude they are only waiting for classic, Soda never plays WoW and Asmongold only uses it as a background and is just farming old raids
---
I stopped playing a troll because it felt slow.
---
Don't act like you don't know his name Mr. Cool guy.
---
There are all sorts of spreadsheets form private servers out there
---
Google and look for patch 1.12
---
You level fast as enhancement since you dont have to eat to restore health and ghost Wolf means sorter travelling times
---
You can heal anything pre-60 as ret as long as you keep a second set of gear with int/spi/sp on it.
---
If you remember leveling as shadow and still healing dungeons it will be just like that.
---
Between 1 and 100
---
You can't fix stupid. :P That reminds me of the warriors/rogues that rolled on Ancient Bone Bow because of the agility.
---
**Wow this is perfect. Thank you!!**
---
It's all easy
---
The bosses are tuned in a way empty raid slots are viable, one of the flaws of 40 man
---
From what I've seen of retail and how teh difficulty/size works I would find it hard to imagine you would struggle after understanding the mechanics.....And that's before you abuse the countless ways to buff yourself in vanilla
---
I would say so yes.   Couple of caveats:  Is the warrior willing to tank all the way up at least until you guys are fairly deep into prebis territory?  If the warrior is flat out unwilling to tank, you might actually consider prot since your group will have plenty of damage.  Is the priest ok with healing the whole time, or would they rather be shadow?   Those are the things I'd take into consideration.
---
If the warrior is going to tank for sure and the priest is going to heal for sure, I personally might consider rushing BoKings and then going down ret at least for leveling that way you have kings for the group.
---
That has nothing to do with enhancement shaman lol
---
They'd just better get rid of it for all the fresh realms when tourism is finished... I'm not starting classic again without an authentic opening week/early economy.
---
LOL
---
But they could remove it from BC if they really wanted to.
---
It's debatable whether KT or 4HM is the hardest boss fight in Naxx. IMO 4HM is more iconic as the guild breaker because of the 8 tanks needed while KT is harder.
---
...Rogue tier and warrior tier are separate....?
---
BoE items can be bought from the AH, BoP items can not. 
---
If you need on a BoE item to equip it, all you are doing is saving money from not buying it.
---
I doubt any person doing high-key M+ or raiding successfully in Heroic or Mythic raid content today would have any significant trouble with Naxx on an individual skill level. The main issue of concern is going to be having sufficient consumables and appropriate gear/resistances. People forget that the mechanical aspects of older WoW content was so much more simple/trivial than that of today in many cases.
---
Same - our guild most definitely had DPS meters.  People would link that shit like it was going out of style lol
---
&gt; - You can melee if you want and do damage if you please. If your group is any good you're not going to be STRESSED for mana during pulls.
---
If you put up seal of wisdom you can actually gain mana from melee hits. I've done that a few times when I forgot to bring water to a dungeon...
---
This is why making friends with ppl was so important in vanilla, so you could gather a friend list full of dependable ppl to run instances with\^^ and to also whisper to come if one in ur group dced. Guilds were also mega important to avoid having to go bk to city.
---
TBC without flying would be the greatest game ever created.
---
Totes dude. I guarantee this screenshot isn't complete bs and his vanilla guild was so woke that they were handing parry swords to their rogues
---
Eh, I'll wait for release.
---
Leveling up with somebody else always helped pass the time, especially when it came down to the strict grinding parts in later levels. Who knows, maybe he'll come back for the re-release and you'll find him again in darkshore? That'd be quite the reunion!
---
An interesting choice lol...probably the LEAST casual friendly class in the game imo
---
I‚Äôll run them all once. Some more than once.
---
As a high school teacher... Yeah we're both going to just say "to he'll with school" and neglect our responsibilities.
---
Hi, /u/Robster17
---
Hes everywhere, of course i know his name.  Doesnt mean i respect him enough to say it.
---
Dude's obnoxious AF
---
The current game might as well be an entirely different game.  You could certainly do a fair amount in the current game with only 8-10 hours a week.
---
8-10 hours a week in classic can still be a shit load of fun and you could reasonably end up with something to do for the next 6 months at that rate...but, it would basically be impossible to do anything like OP did on such a short amount of time.
---
Well, I think dungeon finder and cross realm PvE did 100 times more to ruin the social aspect but sure.
---
Keep in mind you will need to buy one NA License, because u can not play on US Servers with the EU License
---
&gt;being able to skip trash you didn't want to fight in lowbie zones was a straight quality of life improvement and not really much different to what epic mounts did in vanilla
---
You're not just skipping mobs, you're also skipping literally any possibility of interaction with players. Straight-line AFK flying is also a lot more boring than weaving between mobs to avoid getting dismounted. There's also a lot of problems with calling just anything that "removes an annoying part of the game" as "quality of life". The game consists of thousands upon thousands of annoying parts and that's what makes it feel worthwhile.
---
&gt;The world PvP objectives in TBC couldn't safely be captured while flying IIRC
---
You had plenty of pricks in Hellfire that'd just fly from point to point and avoid a fight. A few even tried that in Halaa but at least you could just wait for them to get back from the stupid bombing run (good PvP content right there btw).
---
&gt;PvP players should adapt to the new meta and deal with it, instead of demanding awesome PvE features be taken away to placate their hurt feelings.
---
Let me give you something equivalent: lets say player damage was reduced by 75% for "PvP balance", but Blizzard forget to adjust NPC health. Then the PvE players should adapt to the new meta and deal with it, instead of demanding awesome PvP balance to be taken away to placate their hurt feelings.
---
Flying mounts was never a problem that the players could solve. Also, it's good to see that anyone whose interests do not align with you just gets a "screw you, deal with it" because you just cannot deal with not flying yourself.
---
Warrior is 100% our tank.  He lives to get hit in the face in every mmo we play.
---
Priest loves healing, its her jam and shes never played vanilla whereas i have so I wanna let her take the reins

Considering how cinematics take and therefor cost it is very unlikely they will relocate their resources from the retail team to work on a project they will try to make as cheap as possible.
---
Our priest will be the healer is the thing.  I just figure i'd be spot healing if/when she is in trouble
---
I *assume* this is related to either the guy who leaked alleged screenshots from the "alpha" and from an alleged testing Discord channel where alpha testers were reporting bugs. Or it's the "leaks" about how testing will be continuing past July 16th, and we're looking at a late August release.

That's a pretty sweet exchange with someone from the opposing faction. I wonder if he sat back and smiled as he watched you rip apart unsuspecting victims. :P

Also, thank you for your service!

We've advanced alliance leveling well beyond the historical guides.
---
He could definitely take it to them as a pitch to get licensing. As long as he isn't selling it to people without their consent they'd have no right to just up and take it from him. On the other hand, there'd be nothing to stop them from taking any ideas he pitched to them and using them to create their own game to sell under their IP, though.
---
They'll give us the release date but it'll cost a raid tier
---
RIP Naxx
---
Flying in Outland and Northrend didn‚Äôt really bother me, as their zones were designed for it.
---
Cataclysm introducing flying to Azeroth did not sit right with me at all.
---
Pretty easy: TBC!
---
the myth that flying mount killed wpvp is pretty funny. Do people think there were still massive tarren mill fights near the end of vanilla?
---
Hahaha dang, that blows. :P STV is one of the zones I avoid like the plague unless I'm desperate for some quests, or until I'm high enough to enjoy some fun in the gurubashi arena. ;)
---
Ye. Same with "we want release date". Tired of seeing those those two questions posted several times a day...
---
Well, if they do a bc classic... they could
---
I thought cross server pvp was s good addition
---
Yes, please make friends with rogues, stealth runs are on another level.
---
I just hearthed lol
---
You chain heal and drop totems
---
This, so much this. I legit rolled classes that buffed just so I could do this to people lol I always felt bad when someone buffed me and I couldn‚Äôt give them anything in return
---
If it was Alpha testing there's 0% chance it was done on Discord. Blizzard has an internal bug reporting tool that routes player reports through QA for verification/validation and from then on to the dev team based on QA triage
---
Not really, their raid healing is actually better than priests as chain heal is the only smart heal in the game :)
---
This is what im hoping
---
Nice! That walk really was short! :P For the longest time, I didn't even know where SW was when I played a dwarf. I found it by accident when I stumbled onto the tram in IF.
---
Where would we be without those veteran players lending us a hand? ...probably tucked away in the back of some inn with rez sickness. :P
---
Which is how *the community* consistently had its way with Blizzard for the past 10 years and how *the community* turned the game into a hot pile of garbage, intentionally and willingly.
---
Let's just up Blizzard learn from their mistakes and don't cave again with this reboot.
---
June 21st is when summer officially starts.
---
I can chime in here and say that priests have a much more diverse and varied kit. With healing alone you‚Äôll have flash and greater heal, Renew, shield, and prayer of healing.
---
whenever someone says vanilla isn't pretty, show them this.
---
Yeah that was the general consensus when the guy was showing off his screenshots of the Discord. People did seem to be using it for chatting about the alpha as well, so maybe the bug reporting was just coincidental like "oh hey did you guys also see this bug?" but it seems pretty dubious

---
I know it isn't raid friendly, but could you add BiS maces for rogues? There's tons of competition on swords, and it might be nice for people to know which clobbering machine they want to get.
---
Is it because he's a gamer who makes lots of money and he acts like himself and doesn't care what ppl think about him?
---
Could do that too, but it's rather expensive and I think only four pieces
---
Dang that's lucky! Those trinkets would backfire on me all the time...
---
Really? Hmmm I will try that out then
---
Love it. Thanks for the advice. Forgot about the move speed bonus in ret!!
---
As someone who casually plays retail every expansion, I have never done the rep grind for flying. I have run around since before WoD. All the zones are traverse-able and there are flight points everywhere and there is no need for flying.
---
&gt;they can't take it away
---
Why not? Seriously. Just don't allow it on the new continent. I did not get why they added it after WoD launched. I enjoyed the beginning of WoD before everyone stopped questing. The world was alive and WPVP actually happened. Once everyone got flying it became empty again combined with garrisons.
---
Actually they can and I think it's now obvious that they have no interest in making any significant changes to genuinely improve retail. For ONCE tell everyone YOU THINK YOU DO BUT YOU DON'T and just do what is right for retail and take away the features that make nothing feel special. We have said it for years now. Retail has so many QoL "improvements" that nothing you do feels rewarding and it has ruined the game. They could just make an expansion that is build on all the original philosophies of Vanilla, but they won't.
---
inb4 BFA2.0 and 3.0 and so on. Just man up and take away the bad features. Keep mythic dungeons and the obvious positives but for FUCK sake just do something bold because a significant change is needed and everyone knows it.
---
Yes. They. Can.
---
I mean, you can sorta keep to yourself if you wish, but RPers expect everyone to RP. They're a lot more insular than PvE or PvP realm players in that regard, so if you aren't planning on RPing yourself, you may well expect to come across several people chastising you for it.
---
Random 5k gold? That's pretty fortunate!
---
Wow. Didn‚Äôt know that. #wow
---
That might be, but there's a reason that people like him are the stereotype and source of stigmata for our community.  Dude is weird, and not personable IMO.
---
We've put together a full alliance guide building significantly off the best of what's out there. Full guide to be released before classic launch. In the mean time, you can get an early access and see if you like our format. Checkout the preview video.
---
Eh.. when I want a casual experience I‚Äôll play retail, and when I want a more challenging/slower pace of play I‚Äôll play classic. 
---
Nothing really got ‚Äúruined‚Äù IMHO
---
I‚Äôve played wow since 2008, and to be completely honest I love BFA and I‚Äôm enjoying the casual feel.
---
However, I‚Äôm looking forward to classic because I truly do miss the old feel of the game, old quests, old zones, everything old cities finally being full again, queuing in the keep for bgs.. everything!
---
Problem was having a hunter in your group...
---
I felt the same about it as I saw it
---
I just respond, "what happens after bfa"?
---
Haha never a dull moment by that fountain. Every once in a while, I'd see a infernal appear and wipe out a few of the bank alts. :P
---
/Thanks
---
Totally agree. I made a character on a RP realm just to try it out, and the community was SO MUCH LESS ANNOYING. I wound up transferring my main over, too. I had previously played on two PVE realms and two PVP realms.
---
I won't say I've role played a lot - the extent is typically a few sentences. But even little stuff, like how nobody RUNS when they're by the cathedral in Stormwind, just makes it seem more immersive. Everybody seems friendlier and more willing to go out of their way to help.
---
(I'm not saying there aren't any friendly players on other realms - just that I personally haven't had to LOOK for any on RP realms, because they're everywhere.)
---
One day i will build a house modeled after sfk
---
The perfect spot for vengeance &gt;:]
---
Ah. In that case just go nuts as ret and remember to put wis/might/salv on everyone.
---
buuuuuut. There will inevitably be times when you want to do a dungeon and your friends aren't on. In that case having a healing set and knowing how to use it could help get you into groups faster.
---
I'm enjoying reading through all the stories - glad you are too!
---
I was going to RP-PVP.  Now I'll probably just go to a PVP server.
---
Yeah, i know,i really enjoyed priest. But I am tempted by paladin.... soI am more interested how they compare in other ascpects (beside main healing spells)
---
It might be time to take a break from reddit if these are the things you‚Äôre commenting, mate.
---
Unless your hearth is set in a major city like mine always is
---
Then you're fucked
---
April fools day next year.
---
Retail hunters suddenly need ammo
---
Assuming they make threat work the same as it used to, if a warrior gains 125 threat from doing 100 damage in defensive stance, a priest's heal of 100 hp will generate 50 threat, but a paladin's heal of 100 hp will generate 25 threat.
---
Also a rogue's 100 damage will generate 50 threat.  Lots of weird stuff they never told players.
---
&gt; If you actually NEED a BoE, you should already have it, since you can just buy it from AH.
---
Nice try, Mr. NotAWarrior.
---
Gotcha ! I‚Äôll let the experienced pallies here handle that :)
---
The latter.
---
X = get attuned.
---
If you can do X, you can do Naxx.
---
This does not mean you do it well but that was not the question.
---
Best thing is... community, big world, our characters are nobodies, the economy won't be borked, gear won't be completely useless every three months, sheep moon, talent trees, old av, no flying, class flavor, mankirks wife.
---
Did I get them all?
---
[Not in Naxx. Naxx used a token system and Warrior and Rogue shared tokens.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Tier_3)
---
Honestly, a lot of the people I know are like that, they all want to rush to sixty and start raiding. I am so excited to level, I wanna take it slow and do everything I can, to the point where I might not even play with my real life friends cause they are doing their best to drain the fun out it by rushing things and min-maxing every little thing.
---
This is great advice for those times.
---
I am going to do my damndest not to level without them and just make a hunter for the afkdps lulz, but we'll see.
---
I will keep a healing set on me in the case that my will is weak and I am drawn by the temptation to heal when friends are offline.
---
I love that nearly 1/4 of the video had black screen at the end. Bravo. üòÇüòÇ
---
It sounds like you won much more than just the T0 legs that day. =] Your bit about the shaman made me think of Unbreakable and his video. I'm sure you've seen it, but in case you haven't: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxT7nN31W3s
---
I'm hoping they design a TBC/WOTLK 2.0, with the vanilla design philosophy behind it.
---
That would be incredible. A lot of the same content but just minor changes to what a lot of people considered to be mistakes in the long run. We could go the OSRS route and allow people to vote on what should be included, requiring a super majority (70% or so).
---
So people could vote if they want flying mounts, dungeon finder, etc to be added to the game.
---
He did not break the news. Other people do the datamining, he said it himself he's just kinda tweeting news he finds elsewhere.
---
Preferred for 5 mans? I think that's a bit of a stretch. With no block/defensive stance they take a lot more damage in many 5 man situations. If you have an under-geared healer this can be a real problem. Warrior is more complicated, but as long as the person knows what they're doing the warrior's extra tools will help out a lot in 5 mans. Shield bash, last stand, mocking blow, shield wall, shield slam, disarm, potions, grenades. All these things warrior has that druid can't and it makes a big difference if you know how to use them. Sunder armour is also an amazing dps buff for physical dps on bosses. Rogues/hunters/dps warriors will do far less dps in a boss fight with a druid tank than a warrior tank.
---
&gt; Offspec gear that no one else in the group needs for their main spec.
---
A Warrior should be able to roll against a Hunter on any 2hander, even if the hunter ‚Äúneeds‚Äù it. It‚Äôs the Tank‚Äôs discretion if they choose to not need. And, if it‚Äôs a guildie, give BiS priority to main spec.
---
Smash your face onto your keyboard
---
It's about Heroic Ulduar level imo. They main hangup is that organizing 40 people is harder than 25 or 20 no matter what the fights are like.
---
&gt; KT might not even be the hardest boss in Classic Naxx. He was in Wrath Naxx, though.
---
KT in Wrath was easier than virtually every boss that came after him and some that came before him. This included Malygos and virtually every boss in Ulduar but also Thaddius and Heigan.
---
To add to this there were times when I would heal a dungeon on my pally but would specifically say I was there for ret gear while the group was forming.
---
It's always ok to roll on something if the party is ok with it. Communication is key.
---
except when you buff someone and they could buff you, they even target you but then they just run away.
---
The server was Kel Thuzad. This rogue was shamed by our entire server for this, even though he was a Grand Marshal.

Was it a fairly even exchange of kills? It was fun having rivals from time to time, until they started grabbing all the mineral veins. T_T
---
Reminder: Every single "leak" we've had so far has been fake. Literally every single one. Don't fall for this shit _again_ please.
---
There also hasn't been a beta patch this week so it's not like there's anything new to datamine.
---
Haha, the feeling is mutual!
---
I kinda wish all the servers were RP servers, cause I'd love to RP but not get yelled at for falling out of character
---
Flying was the most requested feature from the community. It wasnt a mistake
---
While it maybe made sense for the Warcraft 3 Cinematic to be re-rendered because at this point even modern real-time graphics look better, the OG Classic Cinematic still looks pretty great/timeless. Though I wouldn't fuss about seeing an even better one with all of the goodness of the modern Blizzard Cinematics department's capabilities.
---
And those grey shoulders.
---
Fair enough man :)
---
It‚Äôs a mistake because they got fucking Lazy.
---
They don‚Äôt want to design around flying anymore so they stopped and tried to strip flying only for an outcry to happen. 
---
Every fucking thing lately has been so the devs can be lazy. And it‚Äôs the main thing pissing me off about retail WoW. Nothing is done for the players now, it‚Äôs only for the ‚ÄúRockstar‚Äù devs.
---
This is where I spent the majority of vanilla.
---
This isn't necessarily true.
---
I've always played on RP realms because I like the immersion and being around others who are aware of the story/lore and also like to be immersed in the game is something I enjoy. People on RP realms have never bothered me about whether or not I choose to participate, or looked down on me for not participating. If they ask, I just tell them I like the environment and would prefer to observe than participate and they're cool with it.
---
I don't think there's an expectation that everyone RP's, but there is an expectation that you are respectful of those who choose to do so.
---
I'm really curious about the 'everyone will be a rogue' trope as applies to pvp/pve servers. I'm thinking the composition will be significantly different on a carebear server, but there just aren't real PvE private servers to support this belief with. Anyone have any experience with or thoughts on this?
---
Shamans is one of the most fun classes to play in vanilla you are a Jack of all trades. When levelling you normally play as enhancement atleast until level 40. This means you fight in mele whit some extra help from spells and healing. In this phase you have great interrupts you are among the best kiter in the game you level super efficient and get travel form at 20. You can do dungeons as healer or dps (save a int set). After 40 you can if you want change to elemental this plays more like a mage (remember to bring plenty of water) or stay enhancement. At 60 in pve you normally play as healer your group healing is the best in game, and your single heal is pretty good (lack of hots hurts some). Any 5-15 man dungeons you have a pretty easy jobb healing. Any 40 man raid wants 8 of you so easy to get in to guilds. In pvp you get to play elemental for the burst (you are still a healer) you get to play the way the class was intended and use all your kit. 
---
Pros while levelling
---
Mail and shield makes you sturdy
---
Travel form 
---
Interrupts on a 8 sec cooldown 
---
Kiting is easy
---
Easy to get dungeon groups (healing)
---
Cons while levelling 
---
No real aoe spells
---
Pros at 60
---
Easy to get in to groups (healing)
---
Easy to get into guilds (healing)
---
One of the highest skill sealing in pvp
---
Cons at 60
---
You are stuck as a healer 
---
You rarely gets to wear mail in pve
---
Herbalism or dungeon runs is your only good way to make gold unless you respec (not counting playing the ah)
---
Sorry for long post. And a probably missed alot
---
I mean the other dude sounds like the epitome of "old man yells at cloud". If you don't like whats popular, you don't need to shit on everyone else who does, simple as that.
---
An epic battle for sure...
---
I found a nice RP lite guild and am very much looking forward to the RP server experience.
---
That would also make it harder to hit you. You can use stuff to LoS that others can't. It does make more of a different at closer ranges tho so I feel like it's a small disadvantage for melee but am advantage for range classes. It's also not head height it's mid body.
---
Is she the leader of a Cult in the Sims?
---
Do you practice watching bootlegged movies before going to see them in the Theater?
---
What happens after Naxx?
---
We all get Snaxx.
---
To me WPVP didn‚Äôt change much from flying, it changed from BGs. The second those came out Rogue Gankers were all that existed anymore. 
---
Once flying came out it went from Rogues to anyone with a flying mount.
---
I may be interested. I've been mulling over whether I'm going to play Classic (because it's a terrible life choice for me to do such a thing), but if I do, almost everything you said is exactly what I'm looking for down to the server location. Though I do slightly prefer hybrid loot council over pure DKP.
---
Anyway, my brother and I would both be playing. I have extensive raid experience from Vanilla up through most of Naxx, and his experience there is at least somewhat similar. We were both Gladiator-level PvPers in BC and Wrath as well. He intends on playing a standard Frost Mage spec with a Warlock alt, and my alt would be a Warrior that I can gear for tanking if requested, or even potentially fill your Fury slot. He has minor quibbles about the timeframe of the raids, since he'd prefer weekend slots and may have to miss out on weekday raids due to prior commitments with his theater hobby, but he said it was fine for me to contact you anyway just to put out feelers.
---
Here's my ask: When I started the game, I wanted to play SPriest, but the only competent raid guild on my server refused to allow me to do this, partially because we didn't have a lot of Warlocks and partially because the leadership just really disliked hybrids. So I had to play Disc/Holy instead.
---
I want to fulfill that dream of a decade past and play SPriest not only in PvP but in high-level PvE. Knowing full well that it's a one-per-raid sort of arrangement, my best chance to achieve this goal is to find a guild early and lock that position in. Has your guild already filled the token SPriest slot, and if not, would you be interested in acquiring one who can also provide you with a Mage, both of whom are highly skilled PvPers?
---
Oh, so you get all your expensive BoE items from drops?
---
That is incredibly lucky!
---
Every warrior that I've known had to farm out the gold to buy those items from the AH.
---
Let's jump straight to BfA instead. It was Blizzard's end-game all along...
---
Lol, world pvp is a joke.
---
Glad your experience was different than mine, at least. ;)
---
I've chased people down to buff them hahaha. YOU WILL TAKE MY FORT!
---
How many topics is it a day now? 3 Retail bashing threads a day with people posting who obviously have never touched Retail.
---
Haha I wish you still had the screenshot too! I'd sometimes come back to another player who set up a campfire between me and them. That was always a refreshing surprise; a much better alternative to being dead. :P
---
Rez and frost shock legend
---
#NoChanges
---
Bring them back at Classic launch!
---
Priest quicker than pally, wut?  Pally isn‚Äôt exactly fast but priest is terrible, just sanding 24/7
---
By all means roll for it, it might even be better for druids
---
I just describe it by calling it the Vietnam of WoW. Welcome to Hell, GI.
---
Apparently im the only one who had it so once BGs came out Rogues were the only ones in WPVP. All flying mounts did for me was make it so any class could be that rogue.
---
This entire server must be purged
---
No you don‚Äôt, they are addons
---
Damn, hard to beat that! Best friend and wife? You practically hit the jackpot. :P
---
holy shit all mounts can water walk next patch? jesus christ that is like one of the softest things I've ever heard fucking kobesoft.gif my god that is just sad how much they are holding hands now in retail
---
I think they may have learned that lesson by nax lol
---
BC release is probably the safest bet to anyone that is actually asking that. They will either open new servers for BC or they will continue on wards from the classic vanilla.
---
I'm almost 70 on a tbc private server and I had such a good time leveling. I don't even care for the tbc endgame too much tbh, I just wanted the leveling experience (and to prepare me for classic)
---
One of my biggest disappointments when I first played on a private server is that hit mechanics in pvp vs higher/lower level characters worked the same as mobs making it so beating someone 3+ levels higher than you was just about impossible.
---
I remember going to the night elf starting area on my mage in vanilla and having 10+ level 1-5 players whaling on me while i danced and kept ice barrier up
---
Well, my experiences were different than yours.  It doesn't happen often, but when it does it can be a really fun time.
---
They won't wait for a low. They want to get more playtime out of their subs. They want people that are bored with BFA to tour Classic before they cancel their subs since tourists have a lower chance of subbing just to try a game they probably aren't super interested in. Better get them while they are still there.
---
If he wasnt personable, he wouldn't be a very good streamer. What stigma? all i see is you not liking him because of his personality that doesnt affect you what so ever. Actually, it does because hes a major private server advocate and has helped  spread the word about Vanilla, a game you probably enjoy.
---
You are woefully mistaken on how threat actually worked on vanilla. In order to pull aggro at range you need to out threaten the tank by 30% so a skilled player could manipulate immunity effects to prevent a moving agro holder from being chased by a boss, thereby allowing the person next in line for threat to build and overcome at melee range.
---
This is not easy, it is not optimal, but it is possible and it is how it was done when you didn't have 8 warriors.
---
You realize Greed is literally a picture of gold, right? As in you press that if you want it for gold?
---
Mages, please give int buff to warriors and rogues!
---
It helps with leveling weapon skills.
---
And we need all the help we can get
---
oh yeah, I meant 'lull' and not 'low'. Like immediately after the last content patch of the xpac
---
It'll probably be 1.5 - 2 years before we even have to think about what happens after naxx
---
It's litterally the lowest priority for blizzard right now.
---
That's like asking what happens after BFA when it hadn't even released yet. Nobody knows and nobody cares.
---
Doesnt mean I cant find him obnlxious.
---
I am super hyped for Borderlands 3, but Randy Pitchford is a garbage fire of a human being.
---
No reason there has to be any kind of correlation there.
---
Asmon is an annoying guy to watch for me.  You like him? Great!  I dont have to.
---
I could see how flying has an impact on the social meta but there's more to it than flying, the game is empty everywhere except end game zones, flying has nothing to do with the world being one big ghost town. 
---
If they would give us a daily and weekly to go back to old zones to do certain activities it would certainly bring some much needed activity and traffic to those areas and it would be awesome, I can't be the only one who loves the different zones/ continents while leveling.
---
That being said I would be fine if flying didnt exist in the game if it actually affected the game positively and not just for pvp folks which I think dislike flying more than others for obvious reasons. 
---
Also you can do some pretty fantastic exploring in the sky you can't get on the ground, losing that would be a bummer but not the end of the world.
---
OHYUCKIE, DEATHLORD OF UNDERCITY
---
For me, my favorites will always be the Scarlet Monastery instances.  Four great instances, all close by, with tons of quests, lore, and cool fights.  I, no joke, literally leveled from 30 to 40 on my first max toon by just chain running those instances.
---
The thing that makes me a little sad about this poll is that it doesn't really depict how good/bad I feel an instance is.  I put RFD and RFK pretty low, but not because I think they are bad instances.  I just had so many others that I prefer/like more.
---
I'm going to kill so many jaguars. By sheer force of will I will sell their teeth and hair for a silver and ride a glorious tiger into combat
---
The amount of druids that got their Shadowcraft cap before me in my groups....
---
These sort of politics are the type of stuff you consider when getting invited to groups hinges on reputation.
---
After i get full  bis on my character i will just... create another character lol
---
Prior to bgs I think it would be really easy to rank on a pve server
---
The new sets look so trashy.  
---
I canceled my subscription out of disgust with BFA, but even before I canceled my Rogue was almost mogged to Bloodfang or Bonescythe.
---
Blizzard releases an expansion in retail that copies Classic!
---
I dont really like him, i just dont buy into your reasoning. Either way i really dont care, i just find it counter productive to mindlessly hate some streamer that nobody is forcing you to watch.
---
ugh darkshore was so beautiful I can't wait to go back to the way it was
---
Once again art team carries üòÇ
---
Its really ironic because I always thought RPers were annoying until I played on a PvEand PvP realms on my alts with friends. 
---
Everyones arguing with each other over the pettiest shit like not having an achievement or a certain talent/armour piece/title. Trade chat is a war-zone. 
---
Thats just from my experience on Area52, Illidan and Zul‚Äôjin though
---
Too bad, TBC was the best iteration of the game to date. You missed out on some amazing Raids, World PvP in daily areas, Arena, Class optimization, and completely optional cosmetic grinds.
---
This is how I remember them. And the molten core trash.. XD
---
Because it‚Äôs fun and Blizzard sucks at designing terrain that isn‚Äôt cancer to travel over. They tried to remove it in WoD and it caused a shit storm.
---
Blizzard is ran by lazy chucklefucks and like 10 good interns. And the Lazy devs only want to make things easier on them, even if it hurts players. They don‚Äôt want flying removed to ‚Äúfix‚Äù PvP or world engagement. They want to remove it so they don‚Äôt have to design around it anymore. Look at MoP, WOTLK, and TBC and you will see that those had care put into them for flying. And those also weren‚Äôt cancer for if you were on the ground. 
---
Zuldazar IS cancer on the ground. 
---
Hell removing flying won‚Äôt ‚Äúfix‚Äù WPVP, because it‚Äôs a mess as it is. What‚Äôs making ANY wpvp happen is the incursions and alliance free feat. As it is without those nothing really happens. People see an opponent and bail. No one really chooses to fight unless they outnumber, but then their opponents leave via ground mount, nitro or Darkmoon cannon. BGs and Arenas are better for PVP so it can be balanced but THEY are the ones who killed the world for PVP. LFR and LFD just double tapped it. Now most people can only be spotted running to dungeons for M+ and raid. But people usually turn off WM if the enemy faction is there.
---
Its not mindless, and you dont have to buy anything.  And how is it counterproductive?  WHAT is it counterproductive /to/?  Im allowed not to like stuff.
---
F‚Äô you! That‚Äôs my mana and I‚Äôm not using it on you!
---
Looks like someone took an action figure and stood it up then proceeded to dip a paint brush into mixed paint and flung it at the action figure.
---
You must be young, you'll figure out what im talking about one day, hopefully.
---
MWSRG
---
That's the epic warlock mount.  Pretty sure the regular mount was just "go talk to the guy in Ratchet and he gives you the skill".
---
The epic mount quest was a huge pain in the ass though.
---
Id rather (given there are enough people to not split the community too thin)Give optional servers with TBC, than adding anything to the game post naxx, trusting blizzard in 2019 to modify a 15 year old game is insanity.
---
&gt; for the best gear to show off your commitment
---
Tmog defeats this aspect. Along with the fact that gear is super easy to get.
---
At least he'll have chicken.
---
best ding done
---
hehe we all make mistakes
---
Fuckoff.
---
Priest and warlock duo is fantastic together. The shadow weaving is great, and big dots from both classes, plus heals.  Most gear comes from quest rewards, not random drops, so fighting for gear doesn't really happen outside of dungeons.  Even inside of dungeons, all caster gear will go to one of you two so your duo 'power level' gear score is still improving.  You can also target quests that give great caster rewards so you both get upgrades, and can skip over some bad quests that would not give good rewards for either.
---
It's in the game, but with terrible stats until the 1.10 update
---
This is... not true.
---
Should rename this post to "group of level 29 twinks kill rank 11 rogue once"
---
When I raided in vanilla we did like 3 hours twice a week. Started out two nights of MC and not finishing and eventually clearing MC BWL and Onyxia in that time easily. It will get easier and faster over time as 40 people learn and aquire gear etc
---
It is if you aren't ahead of the curve and  have a good group. Maybe not BFD for horde but certainly a run of RFC, WFC, RFK, SM, SFK, ULDA
---
Did you guys really hate flying that much at the time?  Or is this just a hindsight thing. Because as much as I get your complaints now, I was beyond geeked to get my flier for the first time in TBC years ago.
---
God please no.
---
Interesting survey
---
Not all that surprised that Deadmines is on top
---
I saw a druid video from the classic demo in Blizzcon 2018 and the druid back was tall, not hunched. is that a visual bug that's getting removed? are they gonna be rat-shaped bears again? or were vanilla models tall like that?
---
I would love to see them do something with Grim Batol
---
Damn i love this game...anyway, did that guy deserved this? I mean i highly doubt he had fun showing up in front of people after this. Then again different, swarm of twinks could fuck you up. In fact, it doesn't even need to be a swarm...
---
Twinks with an S. You lose your rank in vanilla if you don't keep it up.
---
Yep. Or felwood if I need felcloth
---
This is probably going to be the biggest thing for me, in retail outside of guilds you are nothing more than a number, nobody knows you and you don't know anyone. You never see the same person twice, the community just doesn't exist anymore.  
---
   
---
I want to see the same people over and over, I want to know who the best on the realm is, who the PvP monsters are, who to group with, who not to group with.   
---
There is so much value in this and it's not even a gameplay mechanic. This alone will make classic more appealing than anything they could do in retail.  
---
PS: I do not hate retail, I played hardcore during Legion, wracking up over 200 days /played throughout the xpac, I do however dislike BfA. But I'm not saying all this to bash on the state of retail, it's a different game.
---
Pug raids would be great. Having to make a job with spesific schedules for a guild doesn't seem all that fun for a video game, and all the loot council/dragon killer points shenanigans are very unappealing. Pugs for the easier raids would be great to get some useful items.
---
That‚Äôs every expansion. They all either require a lot of gold or achievements.
---
So what if the community requested it? After implementing, we realized it as a community and Blizzard that it was a mistake.
---
that list has issues
---
u do not take crit items on pally if u can take +healing
---
u dont take shroud of nethrazim if u can take living shoulders
---
or maradon 1h just because it has 1 crit when u can take hammer of grace
---
also healer rings are wrong since they dont list the new and upgraded rosewine circle
---
also there is a question of how good weapon specialization truly is - if weapon spec is as it is on private servers than for warrior edgamsters will be bis no matter the race
---
following those lists can lock u up from gear progression as well - if u take the crit quest plate belt and not voons u might mess up some gear options - i would take voon gloves and take ubrs +1 hit plate belt from ubrs - than try to get edgemasters + cloudkeeper - this choice would also give me ability to make very decent tps tank set before i get t1 gloves
---
for the most part the list is correct except for some items so dont follow it blindly
---
as a hunter do not roll need on dalrends unless you want to be known as a noob on your server
---
Fuckin radical, dude
---
Old God Expansion.
---
Gonna have to disagree with you. I like uldaman, easily in my top 10 personally.
---
I'm not saying he discovered it or did the datamining himself, but he tweeted about it before anyone else was talking about it (discord/reddit/wow forums, etc.) which makes me believe he has reliable sources.
---
But that ore noded needed...
---
FISHING HOLE!!!! =DDDDDD
---
Yeah I had a premium Warcraft movies back then too since I was in charge of guild boss videos but they‚Äôre gone from my account now. Who knows, I mean it was forever ago.
---
In that case, I'd definitely level as ret.  Other than pvp the leveling process will be the most you get to actually play ret as ret.
---
It's a great set. Really sad to see people bitch about it
---
You can always just put some talents in sub. You aren't forced to be super slow in stealth.
---
If you're healing during the dungeon, then no.
---
If you're dpsing during the dungeon as feral, then yes
---
Just like the gold that you save from not having to buy that item from AH???
---
I guess everyone should greed BoEs then...
---
Except that opens you up to someone actually ninjaing the item...
---
We are relevant in retail. What are you talking about? Everyone demands we summon from inside the raid. I will literally be summoned via the stone walk into the raid and summon people through my portal.
---
Just think of it as 10% spell hit. It's an amazing talent, especially when levelling.
---
Shamans are for high intellegence people, that enjoy juggling multiple things, having options, and nuanced gameplay. if you are a simple minded and don't like to be bothered with things and variety of possibilties and choices overwhelm you - more than likely you wont enjoy it. They are a helpful type of a class, so you need to enjoy helping people, but they also can hold their own, and in many ways self sufficient. they are also the class with the most buttons and a very diverse abilities pull, melee/casting/healing/utility all mixed up.
---
in groups their prime role is healing, in pvp you can do different things. but healing here and there involved in all specs.
---
in a groups you gonna heal with direct casts and set totems that buff ppl in radius from them.
---
Anytime I hear anything from the album Drunken Lullabies by Flogging Molly, it's straight back to an AV turtle for me.
---
Ah, my happy place...
---
Depends on how successful Classic actually is. If it's a hit and we see 1,000,000+ players then I think Blizzard will have to put a lot of thought into this question.
---
They make good off tanks cause they can generate threat without having to be taking damage. You can also hybrid spec to heal some fights and tank another.
---
Do what you want to do
---
You're going to get geared in dungeon loot, and you're going to get geared fast. As a druid you get the luxury of tanking (hardest role to fill), healing (second hardest role to fill), or if the stars align DPS. Feral tanks are IMO better than warriors in dungeons as their utility is nuts, they do way more damage, and generate way more threat (hold aggro).
---
There's a culture of group lead/organizer reserving items on private servers before a run, and I would be surprised if this is not the norm in classic as well. Since you're Druid, King of Dungeons you get your pick of litter when organizing a group and if someone doesn't like it then they're free to find another group. Frankly, I wouldn't even bother inviting a rogue to your group as all they offer is dps and maybe sap if they're specced for it. Grab that mage instead and start picking up your loot! 
---
This might sound harsh but it's one of the benefits of being a druid and people that have an issue with it can find another group. Just make your intentions known beforehand to keep it on the up and up.
---
Condescending remark and deflection of questions.
---
Way to go üí™
---
Why don‚Äôt you make one of these for retail, since you like changes so much?
---
Nah, keep Lock summon unique.
---
In some species of turtle, the temperature determines if the egg will develop into a male or female. Lower temperatures lead to a male while higher temperatures lead to a female.
---
Classic has heaps to do even after 60, the social HAS to be strong in classic. I think you will enjoy it, just be aware it's a much slower pace than retail.
---
I skipped around and watched maybe 4 seconds of it. Even that much made me sick to my stomach. good job
---
Cat lives matter bro
---
I imagine it's because flying lets you optimal drop in/drop out and allows for better skirting around issues.  That and once you take to the air, you're basically going to get away from most any situation, because all you need to do is climb high enough to be out of range, then after climbing, start heading towards Shattrah, and dive down once you're in the safe zone.
---
I said twinks with an S?? Look at that rogues gear, he has Flamescarred Shoulders and one of the Dal'Rend swords.. unless you're trying to tell me this was from a patch before the grand marshal gear/weapons were skinned?
---
Think of it likes this...it was the first expansion...it‚Äôs the easiest for new players to get into.
---
I was the little brother watching at home, but i was 13/14 when my big brother had driver license class i was raiding instead of him, one time we killed nefarian and the t2 bp of wrath droped twice and they gave one for my brother warrior for free due to being the most active player in the guild(easy when you are 2 playing on the same char when needed) he was so proud his stupid(üòõ) brother was able to not fuck everything and even get loot. One time i watched my brother blow all his dkp on the tier 2.5 shoulder it was a magic moment.
---
Sadly my brother wont play classic due to work and university, im one sad little brother i have spend more time on his side watching him play with his school friends than my own friends.
---
Ok.
---
Every expansion?

Depends on how depressed/angry/excited/annoyed I am that day. If someone‚Äôs annoying me and my days not going good, I will be the last one there.
---
From my experience, nobody FORCES you to roleplay on RP realms. I would occasionally get someone walking up to me and saying something, I'd respond, and we'd go about our business. I'd walk in cities, and typically use flying mounts less often. (I didn't try out RP realms until WotLK.)
---
But absolutely. Nobody ever shooed me away because of my talents or achievements, or kicked me from a group if I hadn't memorized that dungeon yet. There were a lot more people willing to help with a quest, show you how to do something, or even hand you some items. Maybe I have a better opinion of them because I'm a more casual player. But they seem to foster a friendlier group of people.
---
If you don't like that there's no social interaction in modern wow then you'll at the very least enjoy that part of classic.
---
It's hard to say if you'll like it or not, it's an entirely different game now after 14 years of expansions. I personally enjoy the old design philosophy over the current one, so I don't enjoy modern wow at all and am just waiting on classic. Some people do actually enjoy BFA, and if you're having fun then keep playing.
---
Look up information about what classic entails, there's tons of videos that talk about it. It should give you some idea of its a game for you.
---
In general it's much slower paced, and the leveling is a good deal more difficult. The leveling is actually enjoyable to me, and many consider it a key feature of classic.
---
Well they have to shift out to heal, and if the gear is awful enough, you might proc fear so there is some use in looking like you fell down the ugly tree and hit every single leaf, twig, and branch on the way down.
