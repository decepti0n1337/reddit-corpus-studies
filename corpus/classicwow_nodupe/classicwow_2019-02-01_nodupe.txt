It’s wrong all normalization’s outside of attack speeds were done in [1.9](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.9.0).
---

---
So pets with faster movement, shadow damage, higher resists things like that.
---
I was off it’s [patch 2.0.3](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_2.0.3_(undocumented_changes)).
---
Edit: which really has me worried that maybe blizzard won’t undo pet attack speeds.

I wonder if it’s a streamer who created that avoid streamers video
---
Ah, I see, neato. TIL I guess 
---
But here is the thing: Only 1-5 people need the skill set necessary. You can herd a big flock of sheep with one Shepherd. I built a guild, from scratch, in late vanilla because my guild sucked and I got tired of it. I led everyone through MC, BWL, and AQ40, passing up my original guild pretty handily. The rule of 10 suggests you'd want 4-5 people to run the raid cohesively, but 1 person can absolutely do it for the 39 others. It took basically all of my time outside of work, WoW became a second full-time job, but it is doable. 
---
*laughs in oceanic*
---
&gt; Making things forgiving and 'meta-gaming' breaks immersion
---
"Sorry High Overlord Saurfang, I must have, er, slipped, and this breastplate just flew off Nefarian's corpse and flew across the room and glued itself to me, nothing we can do about it now, guess I have to keep it and there's nothing you can do about it. So yeah."
---
\*immersion intensifies*
---
I only started playing WoW after my BF2 addiction wore off, so two or three months before TBC. I played the shit out of that game. Sharqi Peninsula for life. 
---
The private server that rhymes with Tightsrope has done a decent job at combatting sellers. I do understand that it’s nearly impossible to terminate all gold sellers, but Blizzard must have good technology to combat gold spam, if not they should get some. 
---
As for the Classic WoW token, please elaborate on some of these points. Are you only allowed to purchase the WoW token with in game gold, not cash? Would you be able to sell the Classic WoW tokens on the in game ah? I’m just interested in your idea, but of course I don’t want changes or anymore additionally implementations into Classic for fear of the slippery slope. I don’t want to see any token of any kind in classic, I just want to see where you’re going with this idea.
---
Blizzard doesn’t care that you were 15, you cheated, you should’ve been banned. 
---
I only know cause that change is what got me to play hunter. The uniqueness of pets was cool but really made it so you only wanted certain pets. The attack speed change made it so it was about pet family not specifically this or that pet. Opened up what you could tame.
---
It would be a PITA to run back to the boss to execute the trade, especially if people had hearthed out to the corners of the world and there was respawn. I can see some merit in the idea but without guaranteed access to the corpse it might not solve the problem its meant to solve.
---
I honestly love this dudes videos. 
---
I read that like 5 times before I realized what was wrong. Jesus lol
---
You can’t even form a coherent sentence. Take a breather. 
---
[removed]
---
Memories.  Back then ppl were actually "hanging" around in goldshire. People always tried to get up there.
---
some people actually play wow to fight enemies and explore areas and prefer to do that instead of staring at the AH... lol 
---
Centaurs is definitely worse. I've done Bloodsail and BB - it's slow, but you can do it by yourself and it's uninvolved enough that you can just play something else while you're waiting. I gave up on Centaurs before I even recovered both to neutral.
---
Objectively the worst loot system. remember being a warrior and having to ask your group to trade you leather attack power pieces because for some reason blizzard thought it would be smart to lock your need roll by armor type. Or being a Druid and being unable to need on cloth and watching it get DE'd before you can ask your group to pass it to you.
---
Kara was my first true raid and I absolutely loved it. Especially the Opera and rogue fight! Soo fun. Whatever happens with Classic I hope we see Kara again. Wether itd be TBC or through (preferred) patch content. 
---
It adds some more to the community aspect of the game if everyone who wanted to could fish and chat... it's an MMO for a reason...
---
Im a kewl guy
---
I have no clue. In the dozen of years I have been playing, it only happened that one time.
---
Instead of sharding and dynamic respawn just make all quest items group lootable. Suddenly you're grouping up and making friends for everything. Win-win.
---
Yeah she was pretty distraught about it. It was an older lady, not exactly unbelievable that she made a stupid mistake on a computer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you play hunter you get a run bonus anyway so just buy your first mount at level 60... maybe get a boots enchant to give an extra small speed boost.
---
Ageist 
---
This is why (even though it was the entry level and was only 10-man) Kara was my favorite TBC raid. I may be bias though, simply because I was only lvl 55 when TBC dropped and so Kara was also my first raid experience on my main. 
---
I paid to use an application call glider back in the day that levelled for you whilst AFK. You set a route and it kills everything. I'd wake up 3 or 4 levels higher with broken gear and tonnes of money and full bags. But you got to go to a quiet spot or you could get reported if noticed and BANNED! Well because of this I would grind the Timbermaw bears and get hated with them. No one wants to kill those sacred guys except me 😂
---
What problem are you trying to solve? If the parties involved only decided to redistribute the loot after they had left, it wasn’t a misloot in the first place. 
---
&gt; How often are you allowed to spend a debuff slot with SW:P on fights longer than 72 seconds?
---
I think it's a safe assumption that we're talking about levelling, soloing and PvP more so than raiding which is the only place where debuff slots matter.
---
If you die you lost a level and some good etc might be an interesting punishment.
---
Cloth on its own is generally cheaper to buy than a completed bag and the vendor price. Crafted bags are still generally cheaper than vendor bags.  Just buying raw materials and turning them into the finished product. 
---
Except that in the real world WF is a relatively garbage ability that happens to be able to one shot once in a blue moon, if you are in perfect gear.
---
As far as wanting to face a Shaman in Naxx gear. No you would not want to face one. Every class in Naxx gear is like that. All that being said only one class in the game can say. Hey regardless of gear or your spells. I'm gonna be right here fucking up all your plans because I am immune to damage.
---
To be clear I am not saying that Paladins are god and, Shamans suck. That being said. Your view as Shamans as this terror class and, paladins as bad. Is very warped and, completely untrue. 
---
Not to forget that raids like MC got indirectly nerfed over time with gear, buffs to classes like pallies not having to buff all the time so they can heal more which gives more room for dps players, buff to threat generation of warriors which increases raid dps, etc.
---
2h fury until 40, then respec arms for mortal strike
---
Ah, thanks.
---
100% agree. I've never once even *considered* contacting Blizzard support to have them intervene.
---
If me, you, and pretty much anyone I've ever met, never considered ever reaching out to Blizzard, then no one gives a shit if Blizzard says "sorry we will no longer intervene in loot issues"
---
Simple fix, NEEDS to be taken by Blizzard.
---
Exactly.
---
It already requires two clicks.  You click "need" once. Then you get a popup saying, "this is for real dawg dont play"
---
if you are fucking up two clicks, then either you're a ninja or you deserve to be booted for incompetence.
---
the games been out 15 years, we don't need Blizz to parent players and introduce this garbage new sytem
---
I'm just gonna run BRD and end game dungeons from around 57 all the way to 60.
---
A 45MIN VIDEO ABOUT TOTEMS?!?!?!?
---
I remember when BGs were 21-30, 31-40, etc and Druids absolutely annihilated the 21-30 bracket. 
---
Yeah, why not?
---
you're confused on what we're talking about
---
Let's say a Bind on Pickup item drops in a 5-man dungeon run.
---
In vanilla, everyone would roll Need or Greed, with Need rolls taking priority, item was distributed, and it was not allowed to be traded thereafter.  It was permanent once looted. To need roll, you had to click two times. Once for Need, once for confirming a popup that it was permanent.
---
THAT's true Vanilla.
---
Now, in Classic, Blizzard is introducing a new system. The system that was in place for Cata/Wotlk.
---
This 'new' system allows you to trade any items that were supposedly Bind on Pickup. So not really Bind on Pickup anymore. They let you trade that item with anyone who was in the group with you when you won it. 
---
All throughout Cata and Wotlk, small groups of friends would need on anything their buddies needed. They would take off their equipped items to even make it appear like they needed it. And other members of the group would have no idea this guy didn't need it, and wouldn't be able to tell he was going to give it to his friend, because people didn't KNOW those guys were on discord together or something.
---
It's a terrible, flawed system that is NOT vanilla, it gives power to guilds, small friend groups, and even allows ninjas to blackmail resell you items too.
---
Menthol harbour is like life 15+ though
---
No. The system they are artificially imposing on Classic allows trading of Needed, Bind on Pickup items, to members of the group you ran the dungeon with, for multiple hours after the dungeon run is over.
---
It allows ninjas to steal and then blackmail resell the loot, it allows small groups of friends power to unfairly horde loot and trade amongst each other, same for guilds.
---
milf face
---
None of us ever knew it was a thing nor did we care about it.
---
Which is exactly why Blizzard can just say "our support team isn't going to help with loot issues this time around" and no one will give a fuck, and things will progress smoothly with no controversy.
---
Instead, they are introducing a loot system used in Cata/Wotlk, that people fucking hate, because in 2019 Blizzard is so out-of-touch with players they've turned into a joke company
---
That was my point, you can look through my other comments here, I went into a lot more detail about it, I gave up talking to this guy though, he was just being an ass.
---
Well, popular streamers will attract a lot of players just for the laughs/fun - so a realm will have some of the population locked to streamer fandom. If it's a more organized and well behaving fandom then cool. Could be a fun guild. If it's more "whatever" then it can be less fun, especially if it's like a PvP server (unlikely for popular streamers) and noticeable amount of your faction are streamer related "troll" accounts that don't do much.
---
por que no dos, amigo?
---
You could absolutely contact a GM to trade BoP items that were need-rolled accidentally in dungeons. 
---
The loot trading system they are bringing in is from Cata/Wotlk, it is NOT vanilla.
---
GM intervention was in vanilla, and it was an extremely rare occurrence, and things were different right when the game dropped because no one knew how things worked.
---
It's been out for 15 years.  Blizzard can just say "our support team isn't going to help with loot issues this time around" and no one will give a fuck, and things will progress smoothly with no controversy.
---
Bringing in the loot system used in Cata/Wotlk, that people fucking hate, is NOT a good solution.
---
N64 Smash, Age III and WoW Classic, the true OGs
---
Players cannot stack their rolls if the item is Bind on Pickup currently, so, no.
---
I guess it depends on whether those countries consider vanilla wow and classic wow to be the same product, as technically they arent.
---
I dont have the ise of arms and am on a breathing machine. I ise text to speach and its not perfect.
---
My first was a priest. My guild helped me kill Borelgore in EPL. When the mob died, I dinged. I was...very happy.
---
My second was a warrior. I was grinding troll undead in EPL. I remember discussing the ideal amount of +hit I'd need. I was...very happy to finish leveling a warrior.
---
My third was a rogue. I was grinding fire elementals in Un'Goro. I was...very happy to finish dinging this one.
---
My fourth was a warlock. I was also grinding fire elementals in Un'Goro. I was...very happy to finish leveling the warlock.
---
My fifth was another priest. I was farming DME lashers. I remember shouting in world chat because I was....very happy.
---
My sixth will be tonight...another rogue and probably in the next 3 or so hours. I will finish in Silithus, probably from quest turn-ins but it could be anywhere in that zone.
---
Jazzrik only gave 1 exp until WOTLK (and there was no way to hit 999!). It was so so much worse in vanilla/TBC. I started in TBC but gave up pretty quickly and finished after it was buffed. 
---
But if you get the flight path at level 5, once you hit level 15 you can avoid a 15 minute run to get there, and just fly.
---
I understand why you’re so mentally unstable now. 😂😂
---
yeah 30-40 in Arathi. Good luck sir.
---
There are maybe 2 zones that you could push out for 10 levels. Barrens and STV. No other zone will last more than 5 really, most (especially higher) go 2-4.
---
Insert comment here of someone posting a proper, polite row of 18 people standing in line waiting for a timed object spawn and "I made so many friends standing around waiting for shit to happen" note.
---
I like the idea of bear asses being a group loot mechanic, or at least having bear asses being 100% drop from bears with asses.
---
BUT if that were the case - then groups would be insanely OP. Group tagging kill quests, AND group tags dropping quest drops? It'd be crazy.
---
Yeah pretty sure that you have to do almost every zone 1-60 if you want to level without grinding (can probably skip a couple zones, or a couple shit quests in each zone). Not an expert though, since most of my experience with that is playing vanilla post TBC, so its not a true representation.
---
And then you have noobs that cant stack on lava surgers and your healer gets kicked into the lava and dies, because the warlock couldnt be bothered to summon him out fast enough. Now he lost consumes and world buffs worth half an hour of collecting and 20g. 
---
requires you to leave a few times. Cant go 33-45 purely in STV. Kind of like... 33-35, 37-40. 43-45 (just pulling levels out of my ass)
---
This still does not solve the "Loot in-game object" type of quests issue.
---
To be honest I don't agree how Dynamic Respawn "ruins" the game. 
---
If you take it to the extreme, like 20 second respawn timer then of course it will, but I would be really glad to hear how reduction of 10 minute spawn to 5 minutes is going to "ruin" something. While it keeps the whole integrity of the world and is a solution to different types of quests quests.
---
They're going to turn all the chat channels into twitch chat with all the spam, it'll be unbearable. Avoid at all costs
---
he is talking about 10k+ streamers here tbh. Smaller/medium streamers it won't matter at all. For NA there might be 5-15 streamers of this type (most will go PVE if not all) in EU i think we have 1-3 i guess they all go PVE aswell.
---
I'm doing that right now on retail, have every class rolled, 2 max and 3rd is 116, the rest are only played when at full rest XP, makes them pretty chill and fast.
---
Aside: mage = expendable gold? Do you mean not having to buy food and less gold on flight paths (but you need consumables for portals right)? Or people paying you for ports?
---
10 days maximum rested gives you 1.5 levels of double-XP (in retail anyway, not sure if its always been that way since vanilla?)
---
&gt;... but let's not be facetious. 
---
Sorry for going word nazi on you, but i don't think anyone was trying to make a joke.
---
Yes, you do need a very cheap consumable for ports, but it's common courtesy for people to pay far more than the mat for the portal costs. Mages are just the best class for farming gold at level 60(hunter also contends). So I'll level my mage and farm gold on it, then use that gold to gear all my other characters while leveling. 
---
I personally have no issue with dynamic respawn however I have seen others voice their concern. For the "loot in-game object" type quest where you have to click a doo-dad on the ground you could maybe make these work like herbs on retail where an infinite amount of players can click for x amount of time before it despawns.
---
Not all casuals suck dude, some of us have lives (job, wife, kids) so LFR is the only way we'll realistically see raids. Generalizations are bad m'kay.
---
The reason I like retail more than vanilla is that I have 2 (almost 3) level 120 chars on retail. In vanilla (hell even in TBC and Wratch) I never managed to 60 on any char, just got so slow as you moved up.
---
So?
---
&gt; maybe make these work like herbs on retail where an infinite amount of players can click for x amount of time before it despawns.
---
I... I haven't heard that as an option yet. I like it.
---
Current retail has a 10 second timer on 1st click for herbs, etc. So instead of 1 click, then 60 second respawn, maybe a 15 second clickable window every  / 2 minutes... 
---
\#senorchangi'llallowit.gif
---
If quests had 100% droprate you'd finish your 30 bear ass quest in 30 kills and you'd need to grind extra kills to finish your level up. Because it took you 50 bear kills to get those 30 asses you got a full level from the quest and seemingly didn't have to grind any extra (even tho you did). At the end of the day you're gonna have to grind a bit anyway is it a big deal if the quest portion got completed quicker?
---

I suppose it's not the perfect word, but I honestly don't know what else to call it.
---
Cast in a different direction than the other people. turn your camera so you are looking at your char, and the bobble is right in the cameras face. Your bobble will be super loud.
---
Ah OK, thanks for the clarification 😄
---
lots of audiobooks =P
---
Shadow priest and warlock do well against them. Well geared hunters can do some dumb shit to them as well. 
---
We're talking about a completely different kind of difficulty.. Retail leveling is literally braindead, vanilla leveling is easy, but you have to still actually respect mobs, usually pull one of a time, not pull with low hp/mana. 
---
You can't compare something as simple to actual raiding, be it vanilla or retail.
---
But this would be a change from classic where you could trade loot through GM's.
---
I don't understand some times. Its #NoChanges right up until someone doesn't like something.... then its #OhButChangeThat...
---
Ele shamans is very good in pvp. Most will run 30/0/21 for 
---
&gt; So maybe it is easiest to just say loot trading is not allowed ever
---
But this is a change though. Its a change from classic. Wouldnt the actual best way to be to leave it how it was originally? Items xferred through GM's? Why do some changes get passes and others dont.
---
&gt; but that wouldn't be vanilla-like, since GMs could and did redistribute loot back in vanilla
---
Exactly. I find these excuses for changes to be.... unimpressive.
---
&gt; That's how it was in Vanilla. GMs didn't trade loot back then, despite all the rumors floating around.
---
Yes they did. I had it done 3/4 times in Vanilla personally. Stop making claims on stuff you don't know about.
---
&gt; imply that it was common to trick GMs into taking dungeon loot from a rightful winner and giving it to a scammer. 
---
No, thats never been whats claimed. Whats claimed is that if there was a run with two warriors, two rogues and a healer, and the two warriors knew each other, that both warrs would roll on a sword (for example). If warrior 1 won the sword, neither rogue would complain or even know that Warrior didnt want the sword.... they would have no way of knowing that. So they wouldnt protest.
---
But after the raid Warrior 1 tickets a GM to give his sword to Warrior 2. Because GMs granted these requests without checking the 90 minute logs of long-ass instance runs, it meant those two warriors could work together to get Warrior #2 the sword he wants unfairly against those two Rogues who never knew they got robbed...
---
This is the same thing that would happen with loot sharing except it wouldnt require a GM.
---
&gt; long ass-instance runs

I've seen all of the drama on every major private vanilla server. I've hand to deal with vanilla streamers and dominant guilds constantly. I've seen all kinds of meme players who embody all of the stereotypes we've come to know.
---
This is why it is my number 1 top priority to find some obscure and balanced server if one does indeed exist. If it's loaded with players who have no idea what Classic is, more the better. I'll play dumb along with the rest of them and enjoy it all the more.
---
Whenever I'd queue for a BG Id always go right over to the glitch to get underneath org cause it was right next to it lol
---
I think it would be easier to argue that Classic WoW and traditional WoW are more similar than traditional WoW and retail WoW

---
Very useful! Totems have always been that sticking point for me to enjoy playing a Shaman. I just can't find that rhythm of combat that I can for every other class. But it's always great to see guides for all the classes, especially such in-depth ones!
---
*laughs in europe* we just have to avoid forsen thats pretty much it. Rip NA though. Just hope that all the big streamers will play on 1 server
---
I think it lived up to the hype when it was opened. Still one of the raids with most memorable atmosphere. Might just be poor old scrub me who spent most of the expansion raiding that place and Gruul's, though.
---
Indeed, it isn't your business. 
---
&gt; and that the private servers will be even better because they’ll have accurate data values now.
---
Not really. Serverside data is still server side data. Its still not going to tell you the correct armor for that mob, or the correct resist tables for THAT mob. And stuff like accurate proc rates and pathing and decent pings for those in NA, and worthwhile moderation and viable PvE servers, and reliability that your chat wont be wiped and the lack of shady ass gold selling GMs and the like wont ever be equalled.
---
Private servers may as well not exist for me once Classic launches. Due to no fault of their own, they cant match Blizzards actual code and internal data. And they certainly cant be as reliable. Besides, I hate pirating. I literally only stoop to that when absolutely forced. I feel with classic Im no longer forced to do that.
---
On the bright side, the immersion will return next week when they kill Nefarian again and the same breastplate drops again and they give it to the person who was meant to get it.
---
Exactly. Majority of us are going to official classic. All this does is expose the servers that were doing it for the money and not for the classic scene the way Nostalrius always claimed. We got what we asked for and we are happy to pay for it. Not everyone who was playing on Private Servers were just videogame pirates. We had no choice. But now we do.
---
I didn't say you couldn't.
---
That was extremely rare, and since they no longer want to waste money on that option, they need to have the balls to just tell players that GM's can no longer intervene in your trading issues.  Instead they're introducing this dumbass system
---
I really want the classic world map filled out with all the "incomplete" map zones and raids that were meant for vanilla, like level 60 verisons of karazhan, dragon isles, caversn of time, uldum, hyjal, etc. etc...
---
...just not right away. I truly think the Golden Era of WoW was during BWL/ZG... the 6 months before AQ
---
Logistical challenges, not boss mechanical ones.
---
Vanilla had different types of difficulty, and usually far less forgiving.
---
Y'know, I'm *really* excited for Classic, but posts like this make me think it might be a good idea to wait a month or so after launch to start playing.
---
I really don't want to get caught up in the whole "server first/power levelling" ordeal. I just want to play the game the way I like it. I'm pretty worried that these kind of players will ruin my experience.
---
Hopefully there are some servers out there that aren't full of super elitist gamers trying to finish the game as soon as possible.
---
Just wait 2.5 years. Guaranteed they do a TBC server too. Im thinking thats why they called the entire project "Classic Server option" instead of "Vanilla Server Option".
---
TBC is unchanged pretty much since launch. Its going to be even cheaper to emulate it after they finish Vanilla. Free money for them. And Ill be there too.
---
I see what you did there
---
Thanks so much. In honesty, totems actually scared me away from shaman door years. But then o learned lol!
---
Exactly. Dot em up, fear/kite and throw insta shadowbolts when you can. 
---
God forbid you get two nightfall procs in a row, then its over.

---
I still don't fear it. It's exaggerated as hell. Streamers are not that interesting to a huge majority of people, especially not in an active way. I literally know people who don't want to play games, but want to watch people playing them. 
---
The cult on celebrities has always been too much, but streamers haven't reached the level to really be celebrities on that scale yet. 
---
&gt; With what money?
---
How cheap are you? You can get the lesser one for like 30s and the big one for like 80s and you hardly never need them...
---
&gt; Some people are simply assholes.
---
I have played A LOT on VERY active populated servers. I was ally on K3 and horde on ND (heavily outnumbered pvp realms) and never really had any issues. Once I was camped a little by a rogue, had forgot me potions, he killed me like 4 times, no big deal. That happened once and I have 8 lvl 60...
---
Only huge streamers like Sodapoppin, Asmongold, Mitch, Reckful, hell even variety streamers like Greek and Destiny might join in the fun.
---
They will undoubtedly attract a massive audience and their guilds will quickly fill up. Yes, guilds. Back in vanilla the max guild size was 400 I think. And that will fill up VERY quickly, you might see anywhere between 6-10 or more guilds just dedicated to one streamer!
---
But thankfully there aren't that many huge streamers and after a few months most of them will get bored and quit. And only a few will stick around, mostly the hardcore vanilla fans like Soda and Asmon.
---
The medium to small streamers like Tipsout, Esfand, Staysafe and Preach will have their own guilds, some might have 2-3 but no more than that. These guys won't affect the server as much and I'd argue would attract more people to join it but not too much, giving it a healthy population and thus a good raiding and PvP scene.
---
So overall I'd say this video is mostly right but it failed to take into account the smaller streamers, who vastly outnumber the huge streamers.
---
Probably how I am going to do it. I love modern wow more, so I'll just be playing every few days in classic. Guess a lot of people would too. 
---
Yeah they're completely out of control. A catchup should get you the bare minimum gear needed, today they give so much gear that regular progression feels pointless. 
---
A few will remain open. A big reason for people going to private servers is them being free of cost, not them not wanting to play the latest expansion. 
---
Because they're not willing to staff enough GMs to support that anymore. They hired way more CSRs back then than they do for the live game today, let alone the side project.
---
In WoW, not other games. I can totally see the appeal of a dark souls game but this has no place in WoW, it's supposed to be easy!

For someone like me who advocates class balance as one of the only changes I want to see, loot trading is pretty ridiculous to be considered. I understand that for the betterment of the whole we must remain nochanges as much as we can. I still believe loot trading is more dangerous than class balance tweaking but I hope for everyone that neither make it
---
Nice job shutting down this stupid talking point!

It's been said a million times but, blizzard is really out of touch with fanbase, for some reason keep doing thing they dont want. So that's what you get. It's almost a phenomenon I know, but it's true. You say, "but why man, why?" And I gotta shrug my shoulders and look to the  left and say "I dont know"
---
This entire time ppl have been playing on pservers with the vanilla system and it's fine lol. Like why do they need to fuck with it? Cause Ion says it on camera and thinks it's good idea. He comes off as a shitbag to me. Everytime I see him speak I just think. What a shitbag. I cant help it.
---
Twitch. Should be one of the top wow streams 
---
PFui FTW!
---
The token works the same way. A player needs to farm the gold ingame, it's not magically created out of thun air. 
---
I was okay with heirlooms (in the context of an entirely different game at this point), but heirlooms were way to strong.

Entirety of trisfal can be explored in ~10 minutes from spawn. Can take the blimp to durotar and explore that in about 12 minutes. Several fedex quests along the way. Can then explore most of barrens and mulgore. Will get you to level 4 or so within about a half an hour. Smart move from there is to grind levels 4-6 in mulgore and then hearth all the way back to trisfal. I practiced this a lot until I heard there may be sharding...
---
GMs didn't generally intervene with ninjas. They would help occasionally when guild raids would mis-assign or the boss would bug out and not allow loot. And there already was a confirm button.
---
I think the only downside to allowing the BoP trade window is that it lets you reorder boss drops during the run. Make the window stricter than 2hrs and that becomes less of an issue.
---
Kara raids were honestly the most PVE fun I had in the game.  
---
Well leveling has been completely pointless and broken after wrath with or without heirlooms. It's the catch-ups within the current expansion that fuck the game up. 
---
Fellow Alliance here.  You may want to add in other zones to bounce between of the equivalent level so you can level efficiently. Eg at level 12/13 go to Loch Modan and then back to westfall.
---
i just realized if they choose sharding i'll just not play the first week and then i have no problem i'm a goddamn genius
---
It was common place. Your feelings are simply feels over reals and everyone here is a biased sample group. If you were to poll the majority of Vanilla players you’d see most of them used the loot trading service at least once.
---
Furthermore, we have modern data: The Nost devs admitted that a full 1/4th of all GM tickets were about loot trading issues. That’s 25% of all tickets. 
---
That’s huge. 
---
Only thing I can add is that if Classic has Wrath gear (elemental spell damage gear) at release, I in fact find leveling Elemental right from level 10 the easiest.
---
If Wrath greens aren't available, I can easily see sticking with Enhancement early.
---
This is great! I'd love to see one for horde as well some day.
---
It's kind of natural for the game - and really any game - to go that way. Pre-release of WoW had all these additional zones and stories planned, all the models and many of the in-game locations were easily done but were ultimately scrapped because they couldn't complete them. 
---
It's an unavoidable path in development. You can plan and prepare the world for all this content and have it exist as teasers, as interesting places but eventually you're going to surpass it. Unless development of new content begins considerably sooner, there simply isn't a way for there to be these mysterious places locked off from players for a long time to build the same interest old Kara, the Dark Portal, Grim Batol etc had in Vanilla.
---
closest thing to current ElvUI - it's nice.
---
Thanks! That helps!

[I actually recorded it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKAYn0QIu9w)

Elder Scrolls Online does something more like this. A "Flat-Progression" if you will. Just some of the new instances/raids might, situationally, be better than the old stuff, but not always.
---
Glad you enjoyed it. Always cool to go back and read it every now then and see how things changed.
---
Chukc norris likes 2 eat noobz. Lawl 
---
Streamers need to be exiled to their own Server so they can just talk to each other and not bother the rest of us 
---
The solution is stop bitching about sharding, they aren’t going to change their mind. So we unfortunately have to move on and debate other topics. 
---
Is forsen playing classicwow? 
---
War is war.
---
Me and a patrol, taking our usual route out of Grom'gol, like any other ordinary day.
---
We catch word of a Night Elf not too far from base. Nothing new, we hear it everyday, so we dont pay too much attention to it.
---
A few hours into our patrol, I hear the sound of a shadow bolt pierce through the Jungle. Morty is hit. I call for the healer and no response. I turn back and he's stun-locked by some gnome. As the squad leader I keep my composure but these guys are rookies and they haven't experienced STVietnam like I have yet.
---
Next thing I know, we're surrounded by Alliance scum. Our tank is under a volley of spells and arrows, so I make the call to retreat into the tree-line. We all scramble, with me trying to keep order the best I can given the circumstance. 
---
We make it two paces into the jungle and I order the remainder of my squad to cross the bridge while I trap the bridge to buy them time. Next thing I know, three mages are AOEing the other side of the bridge and we're pinched. It was a trap. I make the call to jump off
---
We all take some fall damage and my off-tank breaks his legs on the way down. It's too late, I have to run off. As I'm running through the jungle brush for my sheer life, I hear his cow-like screams as the Alliance scum takes his life. We're all separated now, and from every corner of the jungle I hear my patrol's screams of agony as they're hunted down one by one. I feign death because its my only chance to survive.
---
Three days pass as I lay wait in the jungle in fear for my life. A battalion of Orcs makes their way to the ridge I was hiding under. I asked them "Did anyone else make it?" And they looked down with sadness in their eyes. They took me back to base and stitched me up; twelve hours under the care of a priest to get me back.
---
The next day, my commander offered me to be discharged to some random base in the Stonetalon Mountains after what I endured. I declined, grabbed my bow and headed back into the jungle. There was no way I was going to take some guard-duty after what the Alliance did to my brothers-in-arms.
---
The next three months I spent in the Northern STVietnam, laying in wait for the new recruits to join the enemy forces. Whole battalions went missing under my watch. I was a legend, a nightmare that kept the Alliance up at night. They knew if they stepped foot in that jungle, that I could be around any corner with my arrow pointed at their head.
---
BWL is so so good.  My favorite raid.
---
&gt; posts like this make me think it might be a good idea to wait a month or so after launch to start playing.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I really don't want to get caught up in the whole "server first/power levelling" ordeal.
---
Powerlevelers will be far gone quickly. Wait a few hours and you won't be "caught up" no need for a month or so.
---
Well, which is a bigger change though, not having loot trading in any way, or having it built in on a 2hr timer? I would argue the second is a much bigger change
---
he played the demo so he will most likely check it out
---
I remember being a stupid kid and trying to figure out how to get to the swamp of sorrows and going through Deadwind Pass for the first time and being absolutely awestruck.  I ended up running around the zone for a few hours at a really low lvl trying to not to die just so I could explore the entire zone, even though I had no quests there.
---
Camp Taurajo ;_;
---
What spec was that, looks like a lot of fun!
---
In classic it takes multiple swings and loots to fully clear a deposit so with mining you'll often end so sharing the node.
---
Love it thanks guys. I'm thinking of running a tauren female shaman on launch. Never played sham but the class seems so interesting.
---
everyone will. Not only wow streamer.
---
One of my favorites was wall climbing the giant vertical cliff near the pirate ship at the end of Deadmines. After you get to the top you have to run for quite a while until you find a giant chasm, with floating rocks and some arcane magic stuff floatin around iirc.
---
Wow, people will legitimately complain about anything. How is this an issue?
---
Ah, stuff liked this kind of makes me hope that they'll implement vanilla-esque content after Naxx
---
Grind for the Crusader enchant, off Scarlet enchanters. 
---
God, i mustve put in over 200 hours working on it. Never did.
---
Did confuse the fuck out of gankers though with my Retnub Gnomish engineering ass.
---
Or you could play a game of patience and stay in the loot window after mining it.
---
I love seeing all this vanilla content getting released and not some garbage video record2er with a toaster in 2005. Thanks for all the hard work, meld!
---
I was born with green hair.

I’m upset that this game doesn’t cater to my wishes of wanting green hair.

Dibs on the Blackhawk!

Or you could take Herbalism instead so you don't have to deal with that BS.
---
Great video keep it up!  Unrelated to the video but something I've been debating on another thread is which race to play (can't make up my mind between Tauren and Orc), do @melderon have it narrowed down to a race?  If yes, why?  I'm sure you've already answered in another video of yours but generally curious.
---
Personally I think Kara should be around the same difficulty as Naxx, given Naxx's Legendary.
---
I don't think new raids and raid gear need to be tacked onto the end of the existing progression. If a new raid comes out I don't think Naxx should be a prerequisite for it.
---
It might've been because I was young when vanilla was out, but just the aspect of the unknown made the experience so great. I think it was the first orc I made where I walked up the mountain in the Valley of Trials and from there I could see an odd looking town in the distance that I'd later know to be Ratchet...I thought when will I venture there? How strong will I need to be? And I could click on the creatures in the water near ratchet and and they were Level ??, which was so cool for me because at that point I had never seen a skull as the level
---
&gt; The implementation of a WoW token will immediately result in masses of players quitting 
---
This pretty much sums up my sentiment. I don't currently play WoW but I'll be returning for Classic. If there's even a hint of there being any kind of cash shop I'll be quitting immediately. Don't care how much I want to play classic, I refuse to support games that have that shit.
---
Most of them are hosted in France via OVH but it's still the same reasons. 
---
Is that going to be an option? 
---
Activision nowadays is adding new cash shop mounts and pets pretty much every month. 
---
I do believe that Classic will start off clean at start, but a month or two down the line, when players are already invested into their characters, I really can't see such company not being greedy and implementing not cashshops.
---
The two bigger vanilla servers (the one that rhymes with boss and the one that's a location in Eastern Plaguelands) are both hosted with OVH in France. In fact, nearly every single big/popular pserver is hosted by this company, regardless of expansion.
---
&gt; None of those changes are going to happen.
---
[citation needed]
---
Only time will tell if ActiBlizz stay true to their word.
---
Almost a fair point **but** tickets and GM-actions are, I would argue, not a part of the game, but rather an intervention onto the game. Redistributing loot like this was also more of an exception than a rule.
---
That's called [Soulbound](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Soulbound)^^

I was killing some boars 🐗 in order to get to 60. Live to win!

Orc seems to be the best preferably as its racials are good for both pvp and pve if you're going enhancement.  
---
Oh my bad, I thought Kermit was drinking a Thistle Tea.

Ur the man! Might do a shaman alt after I hit cap in classic

Doesn't Preach play on EU?
---
The level to quest in southshore tend to be more towards 30+ at least for me doing those northern hillsbrad/soithern alterac quests where as wetlands are like 24+ so I would put wetlands a stage earlier.
---
And, why is the western side of duskwood rated so highly?
---
wetlands is a nice 2.5 if you do all the 2 zones,  i usually would finish wetlands off after duskwood was done
---
For Alliance, be sure to hit up Desolace in the 30+ range as well as the shimmering flats.
---
Also, Alterac Mountains quests, picked up in Southshore for the high 30s.
---
I start reading this half way through. Which is what I usually do. Usually the middle is the best part so I get right to it. I thought you were talking about druids being loot masters. Or looting loot from bears asses. It didn't make sense.
---
legend of stalvan and i guess morbent fel questlines? possibly stitches but dont think its that high.
---
Why....why would trading BOUND items ever be a thing ? It literally defeats the purpose of binding an item at all. If u lose the roll, tough luck, have an item ninjad from u? Tougher luck. Games are meant to be played, play more of ur unlucky and you'll eventually get ur set. 
---
So... they would print out articles on paper then sell them in stores?
---
Gonna have to double back alot. I remember getting to 10 in elwynn forest and you get a few levels in westfall... but then they jump up pretty quick and you gotta go to redridge to catch up then go back and do Deadmines too. It's a good time though and lots of chances to group up and add people to your friends list. Really want to start networking early and finding new friends!
---
I just wanna see people breeze thru the core hound groups in MC (assuming they aren't all super knowledged ). That shit right there will drive ant raid to a halt for the night 
---
He just means manually controlling the felhubter in every way possible. Not having any abilities on auto cast and casting them manually. Knowing when to sick your pet on a target and when to pull it back. And also knowing when to keep your pet still so he doesn’t get sniped while your ccd. 
---
In the 10th anniversary MC that window actually gave you a cutscene showing Rag! I was very surprised, and then dead, and couldn't convince anyone else to try
---
Why on earth would wrath greens be available.
---
Warlock is fantastic. 
---
A good chunk of the community says stuff like "Hey bruh Mage DPS is waaay better. Play Mage." And sure, in the early game Mages are noticeably better. But you're not competing with Mages in classic - you're competing with Warlocks. And you're gonna be the *best* warlock.
---
Warlocks provide a bunch to a group. Soulstones, Healthstones, Summons. Every 10man+ is going to go out of their way to get a Warlock -- for the summons at the very least. 
---
Scrub: "Hey, uh, the tank is getting hit pretty hard on this boss"
---
Warlock: "No problem chief, I'll pull out my Imp."
---
Scrub: "Hey, uh, i forgot reagents. I need to hearth."
---
Warlock: "No problem chief, I make my reagents from dead people. I'll summon you back."
---
~~Scrub: "Hey, uh, we need a succubus for our erp."~~
---
~~Warlock: "np bb ;)"~~
---
Warlocks are super fun -- in PVP and PVE. Warlocks are usually underpopulated, too - so you'll get into groups easier than most dps.
---
I disagree. Especially if they go with the 2.5k-3k concurrent player server cap for classic, which is likely. You could easily see how this would be a problem when some of these streamers have tens of thousands of subscribers... I played on Stormreaver during Classic/TBC which had the Paladin Hobbs and this was pre youtube or when it was in it's infancy and it was still a fucking nightmare...
---
As someone who may be transitioning over from priest main to shaman I cannot wait to watch this. Totems are definitely the most daunting thing about be a effective shaman. Already got my keybinds laid out, just need utilize and remember them better
---
And if you play elemental / hybrid resto do you still think orc over Tauren? Not considering troll. 
---
Tauren have herbalist, which is good to consider when getting gold/ herbs. Orc have that nice 25% stun resist and one less racial button to worry about. I'm itching towards troll for beserk and being an uncommon race but I may want less buttons and go orc.

WoW, Half Life 2, Riddick, Halo 2 and so many more
---
2004 was an amazing year
---
Liking cats was a big reason for me to play druid too, not gonna lie. Which race druid are you planning on?
---
Nightelf. I don't like how the tauren cat can't close its mouth.
---
It sounds like you're really into them, and that gives me some hope, but even here... a lot of the things you talked about are some of the concerns I have.
---
&gt;Warlocks provide a bunch to a group. Soulstones, Healthstones, Summons. Every 10man+ is going to go out of their way to get a Warlock -- for the summons at the very least. 
---
I get all these things but one of the big things I outline above is the time spent just... farming shards.  Any time I want to get into a ten man it's my understanding that I'll need to be packing at least 30 or so to cover the groups needs, which in Vanilla seems to be screwing around the plague lands because you still have to hit 55 mobs to get them, which is a lot of useless murder. Not that murder is ever *truly* useless to a warlock but it seems... hyper time consuming and not something to look forward to 2-3 times a week and falls under the category of "I'm playing this game for other people, not me" problem that I hit at the end of WOTLK.
---
&gt; But you're not competing with Mages in classic - you're competing with Warlocks. And you're gonna be the best warlock.
---
I... can you clarify this? Particularly at endgame? I'm a DPS class, I should be gauged against DPS classes. Healthy competition is what makes raid groups great.  Are locks actually able to compete in that arena or are they mostly just brought for the utility?  The latter is what I've been told for a long, long time with the actual numbers running well below most of the other flat DPS classes.
---
Grinding from 58-60 Owlkins in Winterspring :X
---
I find your post pretty erratic. Are you asking if you should play classic at all? Anyway people should just play what they want to play. Warlock is as good as you are playing it.
---
Being a tauren hunter won't prevent you from getting into raids. I full cleared naxx on pservers as a tauren hunter. Hunter is the one class that barely has any racial advantage for PVE no matter the faction. 
---
On alliance, NElves get slightly higher base agility. Horde side, trolls get berserking, which is basically 1-2 more autoshots over a boss fight. The only racial worth noting is Orc racial for PVP because 25% bonus chance to resist stuns is broken OP, and that's obviously for PVP only.
---
Just be good at your class with a good handle on weaving your different shots, pet management and trinket swapping if you want to get the most out of hunter DPS.
---
That being said, taurens do get a bigger model which makes for a bigger deadzone (kindof). Read [this](https://web.archive.org/web/20080319141926/http://tkasomething.com/deadzone.php), it will give you better information than anyone on this sub can. Especially point #2 in regards to tauren deadzone. The TL;DR is that Taurens have a bigger model, which means their deadzone is moved outwards as well, which means taurens have a larger range at which they are unable to shoot. This will give you an advantage against mages in PVP but will suck balls on fights where you need to be as close to melee as possible, like Fankriss or Thaddius.
---
Exactly, that would be considered an exploit because you can easily add a mouseclicker bot after that.
---
The thing that has helped me the most is playing various classes on a couple of different private servers. The thing is, vanilla wow is fun, regardless of class. So I chose based on three factors.
---
1) class mechanics: I ultimately settled on maining a tauren warrior because I like how big and beefy the tauren is, and I like the hulk smash playstyle of warriors. I chose horde because windfury is too fun, and also horde. I will have 1 main alt - either an undead mage or an undead rogue. Currently leaning towards the rogue because I enjoy melee, always have in any game.
---
2) RP possibilities: obviously this can mean any number of different things to different people, but I will be rolling on an rppvp server, and I want to be able to craft a juicy narrative for my tormented tauren warrior. Already have in fact.
---
3) the long term potential: basically how does the class scale with more gear. In fairness, a part of what appeals to me about warrior is if you dump enough time and effort into it, you become a demigod. This is appealing. With rogue and mage it's a bit different, I enjoy them for theit ability to control the opponent. Toying with your prey before you eat them is satisfying. 
---
I was planning on playing a paladin, but played up to around 40 on a pserver and decided healing is not my thing. That would be the class I would suggest for pvp healing though - they are so disgustingly broken it's laughable. 
---
Shout out to anyone rolling US Rppvp hordeside. 
---
Do you smith your weapons out of flowers? :D
---
Getting to IF Airstrip back in the day was AMAZING. All that exploration was so fun back when wallclimbing was a thing and flying wasn't.
---
Then you'll feel like a bank alt when you first go to Orgrimmar. 
---
I think it leads to some pretty weird places if you think "soulbound" and "account bound" are actual things in the fictional world as opposed to game mechanics which the fictional world pretends don't exist.
---
Watch a recent video on youtube by TipsOut. He shows parses of dps for all classes through different raids in Vanilla. Warlock starts out low (in MC), but actually climbs the charts over the course of the raids. By BWL, AQ40 and Naxx you are pretty close to mages. 
---
Actually you've convinced me, now you've pointed it out the overwhelming majority of disputes will arise and be settled one way or another at the site and time of the kill. So this seems like a pretty good solution.
---
A 40-man raid will *always* be bringing warlocks. Both for their utility (stam buff &amp; summons, notably) and their class specific tier loot. As long as you're beating the other warlocks on damage, you're golden. I'm sure Raid Leads would agree with this sentiment. 
---
Shard farming does suck. Especially in areas that have grey mobs (which don't give shards) -- like around Ony.
---
But mages have to make water for 20 hours a week. I'd rather shard farm than spam food/water summons, honestly. And people appreciate summons way more than free water.
---
There are ways to deal with shards, too. To make the experience (slightly) less inconvenient. 
---
I like to go shard farming while I'm farming mats - fill up like three bags full of shards. Then deposit the shards in the bank (just drop the whole bag in the bank). If you run out in a raid (at a bad time), just summon yourself - hearth - grab a new bag - accept summon. 
---
Understood. I have a lot of... issues with wow past.
---
&gt; Are you asking if you should play classic at all?
---
A little. Some of the conversations I've skimmed through regarding trying to rebalance classes seemed... chaotic, to say the least with a violent reaction to any type of balancing.  If I was *going* to play vanilla, I'd make a lock because they're my favorite class. I gave the background to kind of give an idea of what my expectations are going into it and if those expectations are correct.
---
To be more specific -
---
&gt; Warlock is as good as you are playing it.
---
See that's kind of where I'm trying to figure things out, because I've heard locks *aren't* as good as you are playing it. I've hard they require hours of farming shards before each and every single raid and are largely there for their curse, the imp buff, and baking soul-cookies and soulstones.  I've heard their DPS in vanilla has never been competitive, and the debuff limits pretty much throw out entire playstiles in PvE.
---
A real part of me wants to take this nostalgia walk because it seems fun and I always wanted to experience Vanilla content... but I also want to be competitive within whatever playgroup I get in.
---
If I'm just going to be a glorified party buff who does "ok dps for a lock" then I'm probably going to hard pass. I'm trying to figure out if the stories are as bad as I've been told or if these are just exaggerations.
---
It's some random guy that's been spamming his videos on the official forums. It's the pot calling the kettle black at this point.
---
So excited to have windwall totem again. It was the G.O.A.T.  Of vanilla. 
---
I actually made a topic a few months back asking if there is any popular EU streamer so I can join his server (which there isn't aside from HeelsVSBabyface). But after watching this video I am glad to play on a non streamer server.
---
If you want your hand held, go play the current version of wow. If you can chew gum and walk without tripping, come log into classic.
---
Forsen will quit very quickly. He is a variety streamer. (Too much aurochess these days tho)
---
That's sad. What a lonely way to play a social game
---
You are very welcome
---
Farming shards shouldn't be too much of an issue because you'll be farming anyways for gold/rep/mats, and if I remember correctly you could get bags to help out with inventory space to mitigate that a little. As for dps wise mages could do some pretty nice dps, but if you get a healer friend and know when to life tap you can keep slinging spells forever while mages will be oom.
---
How do you know that ? Do you know something I don't ? They said they looking into it, and consider use it as an option. It has never been confirmed to be implemented in classic as far as I know.
---
I'm very torn between tauren and orc. Racial fantasy is tauren all the way but orc shaman is just so horde. I'm prolly gonna flip a coin come classic lol
---
The only downside to this, is that while you are leveling more per hour played and using time wisely, you won’t earn as much gold. 
---
If you figure that you’re going to level around 50-80% faster (since quests are still only 100% xp), you will spend that much less time leveling, and you will find yourself more strapped for cash for gear and spells. Whereas playing with almost no rested will give you as much money to spend at 60 as possible.
---
But in the end, it’s still so worth it to just take your time, not stress it, and save time by waiting for rested.
---
i took me forever to teach myself how to use cheat engine but man wall climbing and making myself super fast was awesome. Used it for months, leveled like crazy (due to being 8-9x faster then everyone else) and got into epic spots other players can only dream of getting into. You could turn the speed up too like 100x and jet across zones. My 13 year old self though I was a genius. lol. Best part was - never got banned.
---
I see. The problem with you not rolling a warlock and making a mage instead for example, is that you might start regretting your decision because what you really wanted to play is warlock.
---
Mages are great and fun to play though :D You must really get your head around this thing and make a choice. The game isn't just the few raids either. Warlocks have a bunch of things they bring into dungeons and questing, world pvp, battlegrounds that for example mages don't have. In raids you have the two talent specs which dish out good damage. Your damage may not be the best, but neither is it the rogue's, shaman's, hunter's. 
---
I myself would never compromise the fun with "the best".
---
He means like 'Ring of Wrath' with + X nature damage. All those types of items were added in a particular vanilla patch fairly early on. 99% sure they'll be in a 1.12 itemised version of the game.
---
Yes, but his target demographic is a bit older, likely to have less of a mindless drone following.
---
Sounds like your want to have a negatively biased outlook on the situation to be honest. Here is the honest truth my dude...
---
Locks are mediocre damage t1, better in t2, competing with other top DPS classes by tier 2.5, and have potential to be top 5 DPS by tier 3. 
---
Lock pve DPS is curse and shadow bolt spam. If you are lucky your guild will let 1 lock cast a damaging dot (coa I believe but it could be corruption, my memory fails me). Occasionally you will be asked to keep a target banished. That's about it.
---
Locks do have some farming ability when I'm is released. Herbalism pairs great with this.
---
You absolutely will have to farm shards, but not for hours at a time. Twenty minutes or so of actual farming and you're good. Just remember to drain soul on team to pick up a few in the raid.
---
You will be expected to provide soul stones on CD in both partys and raids. You will be expected to give everyone member in parties a health some. Tanks and other key players in raids.
---
Locks have probably the highest skill cap in vanilla for pvp. A great lock is something to appreciate. They can beat every single class handily if they are more skilled than their opponent. It is a game of micro management, fast reactions, positioning, and preparation ( knowing the opponents abilities). They are great in group pvp for their cc and damage. They make great anchors / defense when specced soul link.
---
If that sounds appealing, roll one. If not, don't. That is the actual life of a warlock at 60.
---
Each portal could be its own zone. New quests, a dungeon or two and a raid. Would be pretty wild 
---
see this is why I don't comment on things. Thankyou for telling me about that - I reckon its safe to assume they would be in
---
I remember in BC putting in tickets over mis-looting. They almost always reassigned it, after a day of waiting.  
---
I am on the fence in terms of even the best changes, but this one I could accept. The fewer changes the better though.
---
Speaking of cata and battlegrounds, Battle of Gilneas uses copypasted code from AB so there is a fourth capture point somewhere in the sky out of bounds. 
---
Understandable. The tauren cat is pretty bad, looks like an ugly wyvern lol. I do prefer horde but the nelf cat and racial mounts are way better. I guess I'll see if most of my friends play horde or ally before I choose. 
---
if you want to be competitive why not just try to be the best lock in your guild? early on you won't be able to beat rogues and mage damage in raids but you should be right behind them. you are still more useful than both of them. mages just hand out food and decurse. you provide soulstone, healthstones, increase in damage for other classes with your curses, bit of stam to your party, banish. people aren't really going to think less of you because of a higher dps mage that can spam his frostbolt button  
---
In vanilla you could roll for anything that could be put into your bag.
---
Yup. Do yourself a favor and only level with rested XP and in zones your level or two lower.
---
Saves so much headache and makes the grind faster
---
&gt; Sounds like you just want to have a negatively biased outlook on the situation to be honest. Here is the honest truth my dude...
---
I really don't understand how that's the case if literally all of my fears except for maybe the turn around on soul shard farming would be are indeed true.
---
But thanks! I'd heard pretty much everything you'd mentioned above and just wanted to know if it was really as bad. Probably will be passing on this one. Glad you guys are having fun though!
---
I've leveled and raided with 3 warlocks over the years, 1 during retail Vanilla.
---
Every warlock I've been friends with has mage envy, including myself.
---
Unless you really like something about locks in particular, if you want to be a caster dps, mage is the choice.
---
It is absolutely *not* easy to get groups as a lock outside of 40 mans, because your spot usually is much better served by a mage in dungeons.
---
&gt; people aren't really going to think less of you 
---
See the problem is *I* will think less of me.  If I'm being brought on board because of just the flat buffs I get and not the ability to fully customize my character or be a competitive part of DPS, the thing my class is supposed to be doing, then I will not be having fun.  This doesn't seem like the mindset you guys have and more power to you but... I don't like feeling like a fifth wheel only brought along for candies.
---
&gt; spam his frostbolt button 
---
Er... shadowbolt... nevermind &gt;.&gt;
---
&gt; I myself would never compromise the fun with "the best".
---
That's because you shouldn't *have to*.  
---
People who say ele can’t raid never played it. I raided up to Nef in Bwl as ele and it wasn’t hard to keep up. I used a lot of cloth gear, stacked mp/5 and used pots as needed. I kept up dps with the locks and hunters most fights. 
---
But that was back when people weren't as entitled as they are today.
---
Look at newer games, everywhere people complaining about mistakes they make in-game. It's crazy.
---
&gt; Er... shadowbolt... nevermind &gt;.&gt;
---
well you curse, and use corruption as well for the nightfall procs assuming you are that spec. 
---
Lol
---
You can boost this further with a multibox or a second group of players who don't want xp.
---
Bring in 10(or more) warm bodies to do the killing and give all the xp to a single player just running and tagging mobs. You can kill as fast as you can tag with enough boxes. 
---
It won't solve the server performance issues though and that's the most important part. 
---
Do they allow you to use corruption? I assumed that anything worth killing would have 8-16 more important debuffs on it than anything that dealt damage.
---
In the current state of things, WoW is **already** a forevergame, so what changes?  
---
At least make it an elegant forevergame...
---
This had me pumped for a sec. I loved Karazhan but always remembered it as BC content. For a moment you had me thinking it was actually playable in vanilla. My hopes are at some point they go beyond classic back into BC. Perhaps you could just move characters over if they’ve really done all they can I’m vanilla. Would love to play Karazhan again. 
---
Shard farming wasn’t a huge deal. Get a big ol’ soul bag and plan on filling it up for 10 minutes prior to raid time. 
---
Rip na. You already know all your scarab lords. 
---
&gt; Do they allow you to use corruption?
---
depends on if there are 8 or 16 debuff slots. with 16 certainly with 8 no
---
See, and that's my jam. Part of me getting into this would be for nostalgia, and locks are *my* nostalgia. If all the horror stories I've heard about vanilla locks are true (and it seems like they are) then as much as I'd like to do a wind up and hit barrens chat... it doesn't feel like this is the one I'm looking for.  Thanks for the honesty.
---
Who ever said wow is supposed to be easy?
---
Certainly no one in vanilla. That is against the original design philosophy. 
---
come over and play on netherwing then, its fantastic.
---
FOR-SAAAAAAN
---
Our Tank once got banned for prostitution in goldshire.
---
Classic will be diffrent when it comes to scarab lord. Basically every guild that is commited will have one, there will be dozens per server.
---
Too much effort; have to like
---
98% of even this crowd doesn't comprehend lol
---
what's your name from it sounds so familiar
---
Vanilla is my all time favourite iteration of wow, but Karazhan is my all time favourite raid. The atmosphere, the design, the encounters, it was simply....perfect.
---
40man Naxxramas comes in as a close 2nd.
---
This is smart. You are good.
---
I never had an issue, but I don't see a problem why having it available is an issue.
---
Blizzard is doing it for a reason. They know we want little to no changes. This must have been an issue and they are preventing mistakes from the past. 
---
It was built with the intention of being easier, more accessible and straight forward than it's predecessors. I think that's what made it such a successful game, anyone with enough time could complete all the content. Put in the hours and reap the rewards, not like today where you have to have the APM of a starcraft pro in order to complete the hardest content. It's just not fun. 
---
I see you, you Rogue 
---
They 100% confirmed it was something they were going to implement. They specifically said this at the panel along with the loot sharing change.
---
It was never about server performance issues. You should rewatch Ion's statement at Blizzcon.
---
Yeah I don't see anyone else making this point. There are like maybe 5 or 6 streamers that would actually have a noticeable impact on a server. If they're not in your zone you'd never even notice. Your average streamer under 100 viewers would not have this problem for the most part.
---
Thing is with classic starting out with 1.12 items and 16 debuff slots the dps diff vs mages will be less than those parsed for bwl or mc show. Just a headsup.
---
Yeah, shard farming is *way* exaggerated by pretty much everyone from YouTubers to commenters. I raided as a Warlock in vanilla for a long time and only had a problem if I was logged out for awhile and hadn't been farming my normal gold and/or rep.
---
Perhaps people realised that loot trading would end up into loot-selling and loot-blackmail.
---
People can change opinions when presentet with new facts.
---
If I was you, which I'm not. I am me, and I'm gonna play vanilla. But if I was you I wouldn't play at all. You sound like a bitch. It's not for you.
---
We in the #nochanges crowd are fully aware that GMs some rare occations stepped in to redistribute loot. We still dont want the automatic loot trade system implemented because its RIPE for abuse.
---
On dps: stage 1 and 2 you will be slightly bellow mages most likely. However less than on pservers as we start with 16 debuff and 1.12 items which boost our personal dps more than it does frostmages. Come stage 3 and 4 we are as good as on par.
---
  
---
On soulshards: If you use Drainsoul as a regular finishes you will never run out. And gathering a full bag of shards if you somehow ran out of them takes a whopping 15 mins and that is with travel time included. This is something that wont happen to often. So far from as bad as it is made out to be on average aswell.
---
Ontop of that: warlocks can use the same spec for pve and pvp and do good farming gold and soloing some dung content for pre raid gear aswell. The leveling journey is great aswell.
---
Lock also has a bit of a more interactive pve "rotation" than mages imo. Having to put up your curse, keep up corr and managing health as a secondary resource. It is still mostly spamming shadowbolts but beats only spamming frostbolts :p
---
It's nicknamed STVietnam for a reason
---
Have fun!
---
GMs in vanilla had pretty free reins to handle many situations as they saw fit. That being said, I believe I remember maybe once a GM helped us with a loot situation in an MC raid regarding epic loot. I cant for the life of me think any GMs would step in on loot drama in a 5man run.
---
You will have to zone-hop waaaaaaay more then that my dude, 2-3 lvls in a zone, go to next and do 2-3 lvls then go back to previous zone that had orange quests. Rinse and repeat
---
Alternative: play a warlock/paladin
---
You sound like you are so full of shit dood.
---
Before Elysium merged, I found a huge exploit with hunters. 
---
Use Eye of the Beast
---
Using your pet, jump then hit “Stay”
---
Your pet will be stuck in the air
---
Right after Eye of the Beast runs out, log out
---
When you logged back in, you’re ported to where your pet was in the air. 
---
I got to the top of Nef’s room, Ally Bank and AH, camped on top of Tarren Mill church, over the arches at SW bridge, on top of the Bear above Darnassus bank. Was so much fun but they patched it after they merged to LH. What was cool is if you used a cat with Prowl, no one would see you exploiting. 
---
How long does CoE last in vanilla anyway?  My assumption was 2m but my first google says 5.
---
Anyway, if you're not the lock using that do you even get to use COE/COD or is that debuff slot too good for anything but corruption?
---
My assumption is no but for the sake of argument, lets say yeah. I'll admit that I have no idea what the shape of CoA vs CoD is in vanilla - they've had weird balance against each other at different times. CoA is the harder to manage of the two, so we'll go with that.
---
We're still talking about a rotation that revolves around two insta cast dots with spaced out clip times and one nuke.  Legit the only concern I can think of is getting an oddball nightfall proc during the preapply window so you don't clip corruption. It feels like agony can wait the extra second for reapplciation, but you'd want to skip the proc to keep corruption up at 100% for more procs. That's assuming there wasn't an internal CD for Nightfall and I can't recall. It feels like there wasn't one until TBC but it's entirely possible I'm out of my mind.
---
... I miss thottbotting.
---
&gt; Ontop of that: warlocks can use the same spec for pve and pvp 
---
Should they though? I was still mostly afflic leveling back in the day, but it feels like demonology would have serious edge in PvP.
---
wau, you must have spend days of work on this, kappa :)
---
These guides are why classic will fail. The games already been played for you. You dont get to discover things for your self. 
---
Completely unrelated to this thread, but it breaks my heart to see Fry being referenced as "that meme guy".
---
The whole stated point of N**talrius was to put classic wow on blizzards agenda. To grab their attention. It was literally stated by the Nost team at launch. When they finally got their attention in the form of that CnD letter and with the invitation to blizzard HQ they had reached the goal they set out to achieve.
---
We have nost to thank for getting classic. Without them it wouldnt have happend. And if it would have, it wouldnt be as soon as summer 2019.
---
I would pay a dangerously high amount of money per month to experience tbc properly again.
---
I've been there for a while. A really good server !
---
I play on private servers because there is no current viable alternative and thats enough for me, and evidently alot of other players aswell.
---
Potential ways in which blizzard can screw up classic:
---
- Loot trading
---
- Sharding
---
- [insert other random "QoL" casual pleb changes]
---
Any of the above will severely lower the quality of classic.
---
Alright, who pissed in this guy's Cheerios?
---
Avoid streamers? That’s a bannable offense!
---
The tricks to get into hyjal zone. Where you had to get though the demon zone in north of winter spring etc. 
---
that was one of the best feelings running around in this zone and seeing under construction signs  and all that. 
---
If they would do that. I also hope they do not change the map. Uldum, for instance, was supposed to be underground.
---
Yeah I am thinking and hoping for it too. And yes you are right the copy of TBC to Classic should be easy to implement as it eas not changed very much since launch.
---
fuck em
---
Almost every MMO has a grace period where you can trade items you win within the instance.
---
There are very few cons to this and there's a reason most games have turned to this.
---
The main reason wow turned into the mess it has become is because of these guides. People crunching the numbers and setting the builds and everyone saying "this is how you play this class..."  it lost the "rp" element of the game.
---
AV exalted has the first epic 2h and shield that you can get outside raids; they’re pretty decent.
---
Rank 14 is the hardest because it requires the most sacrifice.
---
Other than that reputation grinds that make you go out of your way to get them and are costly so ravenholdt, shendralar and darkmoon faire. Could add the centaurs in Desolace, too, since you need someone to help you.
---
That being said:
---
Hunter.
---
No, it was at the same place. When they reworked zones in Cata, they took eastern portion of Wetlands and incorporated it into newly created Twilight Highlands.
---
Leveling is the best in Vanilla, idk why someone would want to rush it. 
---
Pst! Hey, kid. Want some level boosters? - Blizzard 2 months after classic release, probably
---
People need to realize no WoW token means the game will be flooded by farmers.
---
It's a hard decision to make... WoW token does mean people with RL money will have funds available that don't come through the grind.
---
But it also means very limited influence by farmers.
---
(private servers are basically controlled by farmers, it's makes the game much less enjoyable)
---
As for cosmetic items in the shop...
---
Bring it. There's no downside to this. As long as it doesn't effect gameplay, I don't see why I would be offended or care that someone has a different mount because they payed for it.
---
Any extra revenue classic WoW brings in means a healthier game long term.
---
And cosmetic items in the shop are the perfect way to go.
---
What I don't understand, and never did, is people getting upset over other people's cosmetic items... It doesn't hurt you, it makes the game more enjoyable for them.
---
/shrug
---
If I was his I’d probably learn to construct a sentence before wasting time on a video game.
---
Anyway, I’d recommend doing like a pros/cons T chart of what you want to do and what you value in vanilla 
---
The more gear you have, the better war stomp can be. 
---
Warstomp in a 1v1 is pretty much another chain lightning or lesser healing wave or forces the enemy to trinket because he cant afford to take 2k damage in the next seconds.
---
As tauren in wPvP you can easily pull off: fire nova totem -&gt; warstomp -&gt; chain lightning -&gt; shock -&gt; natures swiftness lightning bolt. 
---
When I was leveling elemental from lvl 39-60 I could wombocombo most classes this way. Then you need some gear and around late MC you will be able to do it again
---
But didn't you hear? Blizzard is *cracking down HARD on pservers* after Classic release. Because up till now they've been merciful.
---
lul
---
In dungeons warstomp is really good too. I use it pretty much on cooldown as warrior tank. Get aggro from all, warstomp when 3 casters start casting, shield bash when they try again, silent fang the 2nd, Concussion Blow the 3rd. 
---
It's seriously amazing. As elemental you can warstomp runners or stun the mobs that aggroed your healer. 
---
If all you want to do is be top DPS then you should  play warrior, there is no other class on the table. But...
---
I don't know if this is a retail mindset on that all DPS classes should be able to perform the same but in classic/vanilla you can't compare classes by pure DPS. Warlocks add so much more that can't be measured but is essential. Classes in vanilla enables eachother.
---
Having a chance on killing world bosses requires warlocks, raid group movement in the world when suspecting PvP ambushes requires warlocks. Your players needs healthstones for when healers mess up, tanks need blood pact to safe up against burst damage, you are the best tank on twins  in AQ40, Youe an essential part of a raid, the candies are required.
---
I'm sorry what? Blizzard doesn't offer WoW anymore?
---
I'm sure these countries you talk about don't see vanilla WoW and current WoW as different products. That's just the mental hoop that pserver players who can't abide piracy jump through.
---
Most beautifull with the worst quests from all three horde starting zones
---
Yes it is. 
---
The drama on private servers made me rethink my plan being an officer. 
---
We probably need a psychiatrist at this point. 
---
is is the best version BITCH so stfu ur mouth and GTFO my house
---
Glitching of flypoints, when you get control of the mount and fly around lakeshire. 
---
True. The quests are a bit more annoying than the other starting zones...
---
It's only 5 and 10men. Just bring 10 for summoning stragglers, the rest can be siphoned off mobs in the dungeons. All dungeons start considerably easier than the end, so in the beginning its no problem when you stop casting at 30% to channel the soulshard spell.
---
You are a DPS class, yes. But you bring crucial, essential spells to the raid that you need especially in the early progression. 
---
Garr minions can be banished, the elementals that pull with 5 before Geddon can be banished. Something a mage simply can not do. Casters are not just casters for DPS, they bring crucial abilities.
---
I think only rogues are really the only ones who bring zero utility to the raid. Even warriors have their role outside of DPSing as they need to tank once in a while.
---
That is why I rethink joining a guild early.
---
I would miss the Ding. 
---
I kinda agree that its sad some people just want to find the ultimately optimal spec gear class race combo instead of playing it for the fantasy, but I dont think these videos contribute much to the minmaxing or turning the game into a mess
---
The GM/loot master of my guild back in vanilla simply misclicked loot every now and then. It's basic human error. It doesn't come down to lack of experience with an MMO. 
---
"Because they're not willing to staff enough GMs to support that anymore."
---
What are you basing this on? They haven't said anything about this, as far as I'm aware. 
---
Blizzard would have closed all private servers down, if they could have. So its not up to them if private servers will live on.
---
&gt;I don't know if this is a retail mindset on that all DPS classes should be able to perform the same but in classic/vanilla you can't compare classes by pure DPS. Warlocks add so much more that can't be measured but is essential. Classes in vanilla enables eachother.
---
I can respect this opinion, especially since I've seen it so often going through a few different threads but... I can't help but wholeheartedly disagree. For the record, I haven't played retail since Cata, and even then not for long because I didn't like the path I saw the game going down which... seems to be a problem that a lot of people excited about vanilla have: everything becoming homogeneous/dumbed down.  Nothing's unique when everything plays the same and has similar counters.  I'm on board with you guys there.
---
The problem I run into a lot when I read people's opinion about the "retail mindset" is that while I believe that classes need to be unique, there needs to be *some* semblance of parity. In this case, we're not even talking about the fantasy design problems that people bring up a lot with hybrid classes, which could fill other books... 
---
Locks are a DPS class. Yes, it has a lot of very useful utility, but it is a straightforward DPS class. It can't heal outside of health stones. (In vanilla &gt;.&gt;) It can't tank. Murder is it's business. It's the primary goal of what should be happening with it, and is it's only viable goal so to me... it should be on par with other murderers.
---
If a hunter outplays me and just rocks out his rotation and I fumble hard by falling down a crack in a boss fight, I can handle that.  If a mage gets a crazy awesome hot streak proc and destroys the meters, I can handle that. If the priest drops power infusion on the boomkin and he rocks face that's fine.
---
But if I am playing a class that I love, and even on paper with me doing my absolute hypothetical best there is no way I touch those other classes - I'm probably not going to have a very good time.  That's not a "retail mindset" it's just... a thing that a lot of gamers across a lot of platforms have. No amount of having the "role" of handing out healthstones or keeping soulstone on a healer is going to make up for it, because at that point my character is bad at it's job and unless my guild *specifically* needs that class to progress... if I were playing I would absolutely stop playing that character to find a character that *is* good at it.  If I was in that position where I was playing a mediocre character because my guild needed one... well, it wouldn't be fun to me.
---
Now it seems *overwhelmingly* that people going into this do not have that mindset and good on you guys. It's a really important thing for me though for me to give this an opportunity, and the idea of slogging all the way to T3 to finally almost reach parity... it's not appealing to me.  I sincerely hope you guys have a great time and I hope this takes off, because I'm *super* hoping that blizzard continues this with a TBC or WOTLK throwback but.. as stated, it's important.
---
Thanks for that !
---
&gt;Its still not going to tell you the correct armor for that mob, or the correct resist tables for THAT mob.
---
New chance to record and get accurate data, given time and enough repetition, you can make pretty good guestimations. Now they had to rely on old forums posts if someone had done the testing or try to find videos etc...
---
Its 110% sure happening, but you have to wait for classic to get there first.
---
Blizzard would sell it. It's buying a sub with in game gold. It wouldn't be an intermediary between two players. 
---
Tyfys.
---
I levelled as elemental from 30-60. It was fun if you don’t mind playing the conservation-game. There’s 2 phases you go through. 
---
Pre-fight) drop mana spring, always good for keeping mana regen somewhat active.
---
1) Ranged phase. You Pew-Pew with LB and searing totem, and try to get the mob as low as you can.
---
2) melee phase. The mob is close to you, so you flametongue him in the face with your dagger, and try to recap some of the mana spent.
---
Following this I would usually end each fight with full health and 50-65% mana left.
---
Natural problem with ele shamans is the low mana pool and no/low benefit from spirit mana regen wise. So you rely on mp5 to sorta help you through the always having to drink phase.
---
The more I get into this, more I think I just don't have the mindset for this. Yes, I have utility. In my mind, that shouldn't automatically be justification for my class doing sub tier damage when that class is allegedly built to do damage.  That seems to be the accepted norm for vanilla, which is part of what I wanted to gauge in this thread aand... I just can't slice it.  If I was to try this role, there wouldn't be a *second* at end game where the thought "If I wasn't such a buff bot with a cc that actually hits demons, then my slot would be mage #4" wasn't in my mind.
---
“Hey what’s up guys, MadSeason here with another video.”
---
I love the guy, it always sounds like he’s worried he’s inconveniencing me with the video, it’s like, dude, I clicked it, no one put a gun to my head!
---
Catering to people like you has put the game into the abysmal state it is in now.
---
Cookies over this way ———&gt;
---
There are three metrics for DPSers to get a raid spot:   
---
Utility
---
Handing out class specific loot
---
Damage
---
You would only ever invite enough melee DPS into raids (especially warriors) to let them soak up the melee gear. DPS warriors dont even benefit from their tier gear.
---
If both mages and warlocks do the same damage as warriors and rogues there is simply no role left for melees.
---
They have next to no utility, their DPS would be the same of the ranged, they are subjected to a lot more mechanics like moving in and out at Ragnaros, moving from fire constantly at Magmadar, chasing adds hiding from Geddon blast waves. 
---
Warriors and rogues need to do more DPS in order to stay competitive. Else you'd get 2 rogues, 2 warrs to soak up gear and  fill the rest with ranged. 
---
You can see that creep into Ahn'Qiraj. Serious raiding guilds tweak their roster for AQ40 progression raiding towards ranged, because melees become a liability.
---
What about international copypasta? I feel it might be allowed in Italy at least.
---
The people need to know. Please, Mr Lawyer.
---
Karazhan with equivalent to aq gear but focusing on lots of cool offspec and gimmicky stuff would have been baller!
---
it depends on the law of the countries you are hosting in.  
---
the servers itself, and I only mean the source code, are not illegal as they are not blizzards property. the code was build from scratch.    
---
now to the gray areas. at least for germany.  
---
the database contains names that could be considered intelectual property. that an some other stuff could be used for a lawsuit.  
---
in reality C&amp;D letters are send out even when there is no legal ground to enforce anything just because most hosters would cave in even before the case was brought to court.
---
EDIT: am so much a lawyer like wth, not even lying to seem like my post is more credible then anyone elses, like for real and so. true lawyer here.  
---
no wait, I just studied IT law in germany. nvm
---
&gt; I hope to find a guild of 39 other raiders who have the same mentality.
---
That;s the dream, but I've been araound WoW since 2004 and I am yet to find a guild where EVERYONE does their best. There's always a few dudes getting carried.
---
If you're planning on level lots of toons to 60 it's certainly something to consider!
---
Yep. Play this game waaay too much to care about fifteen bucks a month. For me, p server never has been and never will be about the money.
---
&gt; More than half of people will fail the test. They'll whisper "invite" or "summon me" or will say in the public chat channel "invite me".
---
You're not gonna pug AQ40 anyway
---
Winning a black lotus on a 10k pop server felt like winning the lotto!
---
&gt; Pservers will always be around for many reasons. 
---
Money. Thata's the main reason. People used " But Vanilla isn't available anymore! " to play for free, now they'll just find a new excuse like " Paying 15$ for a 2004 game is unacceptable I will play on TurtleWoW "
---
&gt; Free money for them
---
If Vanilla does well, yes. if it does poorly, no.
---
Being that subs will be linked you'll have Tokens it just will be harder to sell. 
---
Step 1: Sell X epic ( let's say Lionheart ) to Bob.
---
Step 2: Bob goes to BFA Retail with you and gives you a WoW Token
---
Step 3: Congrats you just bought a Token with gold
---
What's your point? You don't have to.
---
&gt; I very much doubt it would ever reach 1k.
---
Considering you'll be able to make 60-70 gold an hour as a hunter doing Tribute, people from poor countries with a low $/hour exchange might be tempted to pay that money.
---
&gt; Most of the big servers still host in France.

There is a difference between server being hosted in France and owners being in France.
---
&gt; Tokens have been at most 120k since Legion ended
---
When I joined Retail in about July they were close to 280K. The price went down because WoW had a shitton of new subs ( went from 2M to 6-7M ish for a while ).
---
It'll go back up in time, provided the same amount of people buy it.
---
&gt; How could it be possible to trade retail gold for classic gold using the token?
---
You get a Lionheart Helmet and want to sell it.
---
Instead of Retail Gold, we go to BFA Retail and I give you a WoW Token bought with my own $$, which gives you 30 days of gametime.
---
You just bought $$/retail gold using vanilla gold.
---
&gt; Classic WoW economy is so perfectly balanced.
---
Yeah totally, the mafias on LH were such a great economy.
---
I've said it before in a couple of thread ends but I'm glad I made this because it's clear I don't have the mindset for vanilla that you guys have. I hope you guys have fun!
---
&gt; token
---
Token will be on Retail so same thing.
---
And the BoP Loot Change is here to stay. You can already ninja using a GM.
---
You are wrong. There is no currently legal way to play vanilla WoW, effectively making it abandonware. 
---
Vanilla wow and Bfa shares some DNA but they are in essence two very different games that fall under the same trademark. 
---
Soulbound does however make sense. The magic of the item is bound to your soul so only you can use it. Account bound doesnt make sense at all.
---
They have said they dont want to run 2 mmos aka the supportstaff for classic will be minimal
---
We PUG Naxx on my server.
---
Naxx doesn't require the positioning of C'thun so I guess that's more feasible with 40 randoms that at least know tacts.
---
Difference is if you pull that shit in a world WITHOUT cross server dungeon finder your reputation is going to catch up with you. Like have you played vanilla at all, ninjas gets known all throughout the server and blacklisted from joining groups
---
Leveling is a bit painful but definitely doable. I’ve enjoyed it more than Enh, the randomness of WF procs really frustrated me. Ele has more downtime but is more stable in return.
---
Dungeons are fine, you can heal or DPS while leveling as needed.
---
PvP is quite viable (30/0/21 ftw), with the caveat that you need good gear from raids, and there is no chance to get a raid spot in a decent guild as an Ele. On the other hand, Resto shammies are always in a huge demand and they are one of the most fun classes for PvE imo. 
---
If you have the time to farm gold or play the AH to cover the ever-growing respec costs and you are willing to go Resto for serious PvE then Ele as a PvP+open world offspec is definitely great. If that is not the case, then I don’t recommend it, you will be disappointed once you reach 60 (which will be quite a slog compared to most other classes) and you will wish that you rolled a Mage or a Warlock instead.
---
I was in a similar situation when I played on ED, leveled a Shaman to 60, switched to Resto, had a great fun raiding but got sick of the respec costs and ended up quitting before AQ. Then a few years later I leveled a lock on LH, reached 60 and realized that lock PvE is utter boredom compared to healing as a shaman.
---
Ye but everything in vanilla except maybe protection paladins are viable for all content
---
Wondering what was behind the gates of Uldum... I was so disappointed after Cataclysm dropped when it turned into Nazi goblins and all the pirate areas were an "illusion".  
---
&gt; Would you have as much fun in TBC if all the dungeons and raids gave gear equal in power to the gear available in vanilla?
---
I would.  Gear was a means to an end.  Wearing T5 for the set bonus and looking badass would've been enough for me.  The class sets were there to show that you had kicked X bosses ass and got the loot.  I raid for the challenge and the social aspect of teamplay, downing hard bosses is what makes it interesting, not what stats are on the items.
---
I think most have said they will go PVE, although I think that's a mistake if you are a big streamer. Sure you might get ganked or trolled, but in the end you will probably have a lot more followers on your side than people that are coming after you. If you have a big following you can more or less run a PvP server.
---
I'd even say: Automatically roll need on all BoE blues/purples with no chance to skip. Saves all the discussions about someone's purple sword 5dps increase is someone else's insta-epic mount as well.
---
But what I dont get is iv been going over these exact points and every single time its been no shut up you're dumb loot trading is blizzlike and saves GM time. 
---
I dunno what ever just glad to see that maybe we can stop it. Loot trading was actually a point that would have me not playing classic at all.
---
Remember that warlocks stomp on mages in PvP. 
---
Then again you can see people like Forsen and Shroud totally get annoyed by the stream snipers in PuBG. Imagine having to deal with 50 people tailing you every step you take as your personal bodyguards. It's fun for the average youtube insanity video, but I can imagine its getting old fast, if you cant even see your character anymore.
---
On PvP servers you will pretty much be forced to have such a big bodyguard as the enemy side will try to harrass you too. 
---
I mained shaman only from tbc till bfa. Never had one max level in vanilla but will roll one for sure.
---
At work right now but when I'm home I'll watch it for sure.
---
People will follow you anyways, on a PvP server you can at least kill the other faction.
---
But I want cloth healing gear on my shaman.
---
That was my role :D
---
Mostly I was the eldest guildmember (on the wrong side of the 40s now), so I nicknamed myself uncle &lt;insert char name&gt;, so everybody did so and became the lighthearted friendly advisor that solved all the guild drama. And since everybody told me their shit, I knew a lot of the inner personal guild shit that happens.
---
Main reason was that I got freebies passed over to me of course, but apparently I was good at my job. We had some people hating each other initially ending up as friends. 
---
Duskwood. None other zone has so many interesting quest lines imo. And the atmosphere is great.
---
I really liked Duskwood. The town is such a crazy quest hub where you venture forth and do a gazillion number of kill quests and on top of that there's this amazing story line. 
---
We answered at the same time :D
---
I got ganked outside of Uldaman, because the server ganker was foraging the vanilla twitchers looking to streamsnipe. We just did the chest outside the dungeon and he rolled up with 4 buds and ganked incessantly. I had to kick the streamer, because he refused to close the stream. 
---
And that was a lvl 42 nobody and he still impacted the players in his group negatively.
---
&gt;No amount of having the "role" of handing out healthstones or keeping soulstone on a healer is going to make up for it, because at that point my character is bad at it's job and unless my guild   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;specifically  
---
&gt; needs that class to progress... if I were playing I would absolutely stop playing that character to find a character that   
---
&gt;is  
---
&gt; good at it.  If I was in that position where I was playing a mediocre character because my guild needed one... well I'd do it, it wouldn't be fun to me.
---
But that IS the retail mindset. 
---
When I started I did not know how good priests are at healing. Or how bad at leveling. I got my role and I wanted to be the priest, the helping hand. Never touched shadow apart from a week of farming when we had no raid. I leveled healing all the way and always looked for parties to participate.
---
Later I played a Mage for the burst and the CC. Loved to kite 3 Level above me elite dinosaurs in Un'Goro to death just because I can. If you fear the warlocks stuff just leave the warlock but to me it's more like you don't want to play a RPG but a Idle Clicker / Wack -a-mole hybrid. 
---
Duskwood by far.
---
Quit retail after AQ and started on my first private server in November.  Duskwood was easily the zone I remembered most eg mobs and appearance.
---
Duskwood was also the zone I enjoyed the most - very atmospheric and great vibe.
---
Class channels were definitely a thing, and even if everyone knows what they're doing they're good for sorting out loot ahead of time if nothing else.
---
Lol, 3 first comments are all about Duskwood :D
---
Having raided with a hardcore guild before, you definitely feel that! Everyone is on point, and bosses just drop.
---
["WPL Target: X"](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5216) quests have always been the most satisfying quest chain for me.
---
I love Ashenvale and Teldrassil even though they're not objectively great.
---
Un'goro is an incredibly satisfying experience if done right - so many quests to hand in at once!
---
That would suck though, as it deminishes the value of the title / mount. I know it happens on pservers though, so i guess Classic could get the same thing. But it still sucks.
---
I've been doing a bit of dabbling on a private server and played AV earlier today.  In this AV there was warlock defending the horde capture of stormpike GY who would also summon people up north as needed after we'd broken the primary alliance rush on Frost Wolf.  He single-handedly turned our 20 man defense into an unstoppable offensive push that won us the day while leaving the alliance to disorganized to take FW.  Without his aid, we might have ended up fighting a long stalemate for hours.  I can't think of another class that had a bigger impact on the outcome of that game.
---
.. there he was, just standing there. Regenerating 5, Health,
---
per
---
second.
---
I glared at the Troll.
---
The Troll glared back at me.
---
Silence flooded the world.
---
"And there's nothing you can do about it" the Troll whispered.
---
I played a mage in Vanillia wow.  Loved him in dungons, hated him in PvE quest running and raids.  I'd spent 30 minutes before every raid summoning water 2 bottles at a time for the raid.  One raid I was the only mage and I spent 50 minutes summoning water and food.   Then during the raid all I did was cast frost bolt over and over again.  I will never, ever raid with a mage again.  Also, drinking all the time sucks donkey balls.
---
Except for when master looting. Should keep the loot trade system _only if master looter was used_.
---
I'm gonna kind of steal your analogy to throw another at you.
---
Warlock was my very first class. I got super excited about it, talked with my friends and was SOOOOOOOOO glad that they were playing horde so I could go undead. I had seen the trailers, I'd played a bit of WCII. I was going to be it, this scraggly, zombie death dealer dealing in dark magic.  I don't know anything about your history but do you remember the old trailer where the infernal was coming out of the background? Hooo boy I was geeked up.
---
And I got *really* lucky because before I hit end game the pre-tbc patch hit and I got a felguard and I got play sl/sl lock and basically tank as a clothie which I never thought was possible at the time in an RPG and loved loved loved everything.
---
What I didn't see or even think about in those trailers is handing someone a green rock and going "No, no. You need to eat this so you stay healthy. You do more damage than I do with my fel dark demonic magics. My imp will even give you more health! I'm glad we're both equally contributing."
---
The real problem I'm having here -
---
&gt; But that IS the retail mindset. 
---
&gt; you don't want to play a RPG but a Idle Clicker / Wack -a-mole hybrid. 
---
Yes. Wanting tangible parity means I love mobile games. I am clearly satan and have never seen an RPG.
---
&gt; I agree with you in theory but they already have two pop ups saying “are you sure”
---
The same popup for both need and greed though, is the problem.
---
I guess we could allow trading greed-rolled loot?
---
I have played Lock from 1.6 to present.
---
Vanilla was amazing, leveling is easy but enjoyable, dungeon damage can feel a little low at times but with pet control and our spammable CC (fear/reckless, banish, seduce) we are imo one of the stronger classes with a high skill ceiling if you want to push it.
---
PvP is great fun, some of my most enjoyable times PvPing have been in vanilla and we are strong.
---
For raiding lock offers lots of options. For the broke player Dark Pact and an imp means no mana issues fine for early raiding, for the more dedicated player a warlock has decent dps and lots of utility. There is always a space in the raid.
---
Locks also get unique quests, Felsteed, Dreadsteed, Infernal and Doomguard, all those chains are fun. Doomguard and Dreadsteed quests in particular.
---
Basically I love my warlock and will be re-rolling one
---
Fun fact the title "Scarab lord" came with the patch 2.0.3 so in vanilla you just get the mount.
---
Hillsbrad Foothills, I love the way this region was created: there is a constant threat due to proximity of horde and alliance villages.  
---
Also the fact that the area was separated in two zones: a lower valley and upper snowy mountains.
---
loch modan. beautiful area, nice quests and a horde patrol :D
---
That does sound like a nightmare. I plan on rolling a Mage but only for PVP as I wont have time to raid. Do you think ill be able to enjoy it more?
---
I used to farm for 10mins before the raid if that. People can walk to the damn raid and I get shards on the trash for HS's and SS's.
---
If your only interest is high damage on the metres go mage or rogue, imo that is meaningless at the end of the day if the boss dies. Warlocks are dps/utility, our dps is good but you will be behind equal skill mages/rogues. You buff their damage, keep them alive with HS and SS and locks have one of the few spamable CC in game.
---
God I can't wait to play resto druid.
---
Played hunter in vanilla up to aq40 but my dream and true calling was always to heal.
---
Played shadow and then disc (PvP) in tbc and arcane mage in wotlk.
---
Gonna go PvP/Pve 1 11 39 with furor.
---
Tier 2 shoulders and helm 😍
---
I plan to play a Dwarf Priest.
---
Is it more or less a requirement to go with Tailoring? (usually I go with Alch/Herb). I'm going to play casually, so won't have time to spend doing collection runs, etc. Would be pretty neat crafting things for myself, and maybe some enchanting on the side that I'll slowly level up.
---
I would like to play a Lock but wont have time to raid. Do you think I can still do well in PVP without getting gear from raids? My plan is to craft gear from Tailoring and buy whatever comes up on the AH.
---
Idk if you are mad season or the guy who scanned the article for him, if you are respect. If not you could have put a link from mad season show last vid. The album was from his vid and its in the description box. Its nice to give people source and credit to the people who made this.
---
Yes, we have strong CC options in classic. Personally I got the r10 gear and some MC/ZG gear. Any class will be at a disadvantage in just dungeon blues but Warlocks imo are one of the sturdier options.
---
Fears, deathcoil, void sarifice, you can often escape if you need to and with soullink, high stam and our healing spells we can stand toe to toe with most classes.
---
I was never very good at mage PvP.  I played a fire mage so I was always going for big fire crits which were fun, but I found that mages work much better when well integrated with a group rather than the solo gameplay I preferred.  I later rolled a hunter and that suited my play style much better.  If you like working with groups, being disruptive and using your toolset to max, mages are very, very good at PvP.
---
Greatest of all Totems? 
---
These mags were a good read... but the ads. So many ads.
---
Balance world pvp is the only reason to roll druid. 
---
This is my dream perfect-scenario og classic's future after naxx patch.
---
Maybe some new fun boss mechanics could be designed around having these hybrid specs present in the raid group (that are otherwise meme-specs in the traditional raids)
---
My first WoW character was a Druid in BC. Only character that’s still on my live account too, though I haven’t played in years.  
---
It was always such a unique and “special” feeling class until the Great Fun Purge Blizz started with WoD.  
---
If I enjoyed Druid in BC should I enjoy it in vanilla?
---
&gt;They know what we want but can't do that because there's too many different interests from other players
---
That is EXACTLY the issue. You cant appeal to everyone. You cant tell jokes about european politics to a crowd who's there to hear jokes about the sex life of gandhi (of course this is absurd, but thats how it works). You cant make jokes about your skin color to people who are easily offended by it. If you want to appeal to everyone, you wont appeal to anyone. You have to pick a target audience. That target audience changed in wotlk from "mmorpg players who want to play in a "simulation" of a huge fantasy world filled with their friends" to "heyyy, ik you have only been playing call of duty your entire life and we know thats the only game u like but it doesnt matter u can play too cuz we simplified our game and it is neither an mmo or rpg anymore XD!" 
---
&gt;Like I said, in reality buyers very rarely if ever got banned for buying gold 
---
really? can you prove that? because my memory is that plenty of people got perma'd for buying gold, even people i knew irl. I used to play on private servers too around 2015-2017, the biggest most popular ones, and they were catching gold buyers ALL the time. With their limited resources, they caught nearly everyone. It got to the point where forums where usually spammed every day by people who claimed they had been unfairly banned for gold buying, only to be ousted by an admin with proof of what they did through logs. 
---
The main difference is when a ninja ninja, everyone see it.
---
When someone need on something to give it to his friend, nobody else will know.
---
Loot trading also make ninja more profitable. If you manage to ninja let say ironfoe for example, you could only vendor it in vanilla for example. Now if you can trade it to the war in your group, you can be sure to sell it for a few hundred if not thousand.
---
Question for those who PvPed/duelled at high level.
---
Assuming similar gear and skills, do Druids have a hard counter? Think warrior Vs frost Mage?
---
In general, what's the hardest class to fight as a druid?
---
Darkshore is actually really, really nice.
---
I adored all the snowy zones, especially Winter spring. 
---
"We have to go back!"
---
Same plan. Farm that pre-raid bis.
---
And then you will be known as a scummy ninja for taking loot and trying to sell it. And i think there is an exception is the loot rules that if you equip the item it will no longer be tradeable so you can simply check and see if they guy who just needed actually equips the item or not.
---
I was the ultimate asshole. Spending more time thinking of tricks to screw people instead of accomplishing anything myself.
---
Going under stormwind with some friends. Do /who 25-30 and ask if they want a free stockade boost. Once they accepted our lock stood on the edge of the world and summoned him. If we accepted he felt down for hours and no chance to heartstone because he was falling. Once we reached fatique he would die. But we aimed his fall north so we was falling from stormwind to eastern plaguelands. Ruining his whole day since that fall took some hours. We did this in such a well toughtout manner we were the best assholes on the realm. Had forums posts madd about us to never accept frse stockade boosts.
---
Warsong flag hiding was also a fun thing to do. Walljumping out of the map so you are unreachable.
---
Mindcontrolling people into the "gate" in warsong so they left the battleground with deserter.
---
And in general alot of walljumping so you can target players without them being able to fight back.
---
Yea I was that kind of guy.. But I reformed..
---
What spec
---
Now everything is horde vs alliance. The game used to be you vs the world.
---
I miss that.
---
Don't worry, really. Nobody dies by themselves to polarity shift, you'll always take about half the raid with you. 
---
My adventure was legitimately cutting a path across the entire Eastern Kingdom. Still have no idea how it happened.  
---
I got glitched leaping behind someone as a feral druid from the booty bay boat to the dock. I glitched under the map and "Flew" north/slightly east until i ended up in the Eastern plague lands. I can't remember how i eventually stopped. I had a path of discovery in a straight line cutting straight across the entire eastern kingdoms. It was pretty cool as i got all the discovery experience as well! Took about 10 minutes of just watching in awe as my druid moved at ridiculous speed across the map.
---
To not have goals.
---
Literally just going to make a character and go on an adventure with zero clue what will happen, who I'll meet and where i'll go.
---
The fact that every day could be something new is exciting and awesome to me.
---
Go Ret + Persuit till level 36 and then respec to Reckoning+Sanc Buff . You then go to Ret again for persuit after you get Reckoning.
---
Druid really is great though. All the tired advice of them being only useful for healing and innervate come for a place of truth for raiding (though I would make a very strong case for bear off tanking and taking one is actually optimal raid setup), the leveling experience is amazing.    
---
You can Tank/Heal/DPS from 1 - 60 in Feral DPS spec.  Hell you could even get away with Ony / MC in the same spec if your guild is good.  You get the good feeling of getting more upgrade drops more often as you maintain 3 roles (I understand this can also be seen as a negative).  Cat DPS is broken from +40 plus when you learn how to power shift.  The druid is the only true reliable hybrid in Vanilla and will always be my main.  
---
On top of this druid pre-BiS is somewhat easier to obtain and when you do raid, you pretty much get free Feral epics because no one wants it.  
---
The only thing I hope is that druid is not overpopulated from retail players.  From TBC onward their popularity exploded and today they are one of the highest rolled class
---
I've never played WoW. I once booted up the new game and played for an hour and then gave up as I found it not cool.
---
Last week, so after a few years, I started playing the Classic vanilla because my colleague at work told me about it. I was hesitant to play it. Since it didn't look really good to me. But I started to play anyway. Now I can't stop playing. It's like one of the greatest games ever. So far I love every aspect of it. The quests are really good. I read everything those people say to me. It really got me into the world. So much to explore and see. I'm really taking the time to play and explore everything.
---
I never thought this game would get me so much as it did. It wasn't appealing, but now it's calling me every day.
---
What I want to get out of Classic WoW is the experience all those people had with the game back in the days. I want to feel this magic of WoW. It really feels like something special. Something I rarely felt with a game.
---
I have to really thank my colleague for getting me into it. I love it.
---
&gt;If I enjoyed Druid in BC should I enjoy it in vanilla?
---
BC was the golden age of druids, they were pretty much straight overpowered in that expansion. Can't say whether you'll enjoy vanilla druid or not really, just know that it's in a weaker state than it was in BC. Personally i still find vanilla druid to be insanely fun to play, especially in pvp. 
---
Sometimes I may just be retail cucks that get a kick out of fucking with us, or maybe they want to sabotage.
---
I have memories, but I don't give a flying cock about nostalgia. Just want to play thought, social, community-driven game again. Vanilla shapes proportionally better communities than any other game I know, and that factor is what I look for.
---
Bit boring maybe but I don't really have any goals, any more than I did 1st time round. Just going to play it, have fun getting to 60 and see where it goes from there. Only thing I will do differently is start with my favourite class (druid) instead of trying hunter first. 
---
Stv, tanaris, badlands, epl, wpl, blasted lands, searing gorge..
---
Every 30+ zone is filled with wpvp.
---
Really happy to hear this, thanks for sharing your story.   
---
 King's honor, friend. 
---
A non sharded adventure without any micro transactions or shitty gimmicks to get people to pay for their virtual items.
---
I am not as sentimental as a lot of people here, but i just like the game. Ive been leveling on and off for the last couple of months when my friends arnt online to team up on other games. 
---
The quests are fun and the game is rewarding. Also the zones are beautiful.
---
U're regulair cool, thats not enough.
---
You sounds like a fun guy to be around.
---
Warlocks are notoriously hard for druids
---
From what I remember you only need to going Tailoring to get your first spellcasters robe and then you can ditch it.
---
Having fun with friends, reaching some meaningful (in mmo-terms) longterm goals &amp; reliving the adventure of classic wow as a different class.
---
Says you. You are entitled to your opinion, but you are not entitled to thinking you opinion is better than mine.
---
An alternative to sharding would be to just do nothing.  Vanilla was the wild west and chaos ruled supreme.    
---
That is the best alternative to sharding.... to do nothing at all.  
---
In all honesty I understand why they are doing it and they have their pragmatic reasons.  That said the situation doesn't need any alternatives.  Either go with sharding for a very limited time or leave it how it was
---
Honestly, no. I don't feel like Classic is for you.
---
Individual characters are simply tools or units of capability. They exist only to provide utility to the group.
---
I hope to forget how terrible life is for at least 60 days

A mid life crisis 
---
Well, you could always see that ingame. When you are AFK sometimes your Troll "stretches" his shoulders and hold a straight posture for some time. 
---
If you have a Tauren by your side you can see that yes, Trolls were always taller.
---
This is impossible, depression is the strongest raid boss.  Brain chemistry is OP and certainly overtuned
---
Boring description for a boring race.
---
My goal will be to be the best cat dps on the server.

My goal is to become BIS geared and absolutely shit on any red name out in world PvP. Even if they are low levels.

Classic is months away, end of classic is years away. I really dont care just yet..

Heck yeah Western Plaguelands! That questline feels so satisfying to finish, as if you were making actual progress against the Scourge.
---
Be involved in the race to 60 knowing full well I won't win, join a fun guild, do some raids together and have a laugh, do some pvp. That's about it tbh.
---
If it goes well I'd like to get a 60 of 4 or 5 classes.

Night Elf or Tauren?
---
I'd like to level to 60 with a strict aggression policy towards the other faction where I start a fight with anyone I see, whether they be currently mauled by tigers or level ?? or with a group of 4 others.
---
I was a huge pacifist in the decade or so that I played WoW despite being on a PvP server the whole time so it's going to be very different and likely cause trouble more than not.
---
wow. just. wow...
---
Or when he apologizes about rambling too/making video too long. I prefer the longer videos and the rambling is fun to listen to.
---
Honestly if you have the time off work and roll one of the big three there is no reason that you cant win it.  Even if you don't win it being in the first 50 or so is very doable.  All you need is time, patience and a little luck.  Getting some lucky drops on some stubborn quests, and not dying is all you need to win it.  Along with the ability to spend that time in game of course
---
Im hoping to get out of BFA Lmao
---
[ey you little shit don't take my 44s!](https://youtu.be/ty2nVp3vWc0?t=97)
---
My goal is to have fun.
---
That's it, nothing fancy, just have fun. Retail keeps the game from being fun. Retail forces me to do unfun things (i.e. island expeditions, insane daily farming, etc..). I just want to play the game the way that I want to play it - just like i did back in the day.
---
home
---
Def going with Tauren Shaman 
---
All you have to do is turn your camera so the bobble is right in your face, and it makes the sound of your bobble really loud.
---
I always take both when being an early bird at 60. Riding around having detect herbs on mouse wheel up and detect nodes on mouse wheel down. 
---
Double the money!
---
Mc, BWL and the 20 man raids are basically training wheels though. Most guilds aren't gonna ask anyone to min/max until AQ/Naxx
---
Totally this. People tend to think that RP-ing in WoW means pretending to be in-character the whole time, speaking in fantasy tropes or working as a tavern wench. But RP can just as much mean taking the game at face value - you're an adventurer, going on quests and fighting monsters. Ignore the min-maxing and YouTube guides and just go out there and discover the world and the people in it.
---
Damn, I wish trolls could be dr00ds. I just cannot stand tauren or night elves... Still stuck between Troll shaman or Tauren druid choice. If I go Troll Shaman, my gf will play Orc Warlock, if I go Tauren Druid, she will go Orc Shaman. Both combos seem OP for leveling together, dungeons, etc... Druid is my spirit animal, trolls are my spirit race. Fuck. :/
---
Your list is way too simple. Just compare to joanas levelling guide: you jump between zones a lot more in vanilla. Overall you'll do nearly all quests in all zones if you level mainly by questing.  
---
If you grind or do nearly all dungeons you can skip certain zones. For example I usually don't quest in hillsbrad or stv at all because I do all dungeons and most dungeon quests instead.
---
Was it really like that in WOTLK? I remember having a lot of mail pieces as a holy paladin
---
Rush to 60. Make sure I'll be good for raids and everything ASAP and then wander the world as a warlock protecting low level characters around Azeroth's contented zones. Light have mercy on any Alliance scum I see pushing around my less strong Horde brothers. Stonetalon Peak, Ashenvale, Stranglethorn Vale and Hillsbrad Foothills will be mainly where I watch after my growing faction. I'll make sure general/world chat knows that all they have to do is feel uncomfortable around Alliance for me to come out to wherever they are and completely destroy them. I will protect the Horde!
---
Fun, primarily, same reason as most leisure activities.  No need to overthink it.
---
One of my favorite video's.
---
I can't wait to see guilds and streamers stuggling to get kills in the elite hives. I saw 6 Black Lotus' while farming for my guild master. Got one.
---
Loot-trading should only be allowed by GMs in raid environment and the only one who could start a ticket like that is GuildM or RL. 
---
Missclicks happen, get over it. 
---
Isn’t the north part Alterac Mountains back in Vanilla? I remember the Ogre quests up there being pretty limited-as Alliance you would get a quest from Stormwind Keep really early (like level 25) for an almost level 40 quest for the Ogres. I always remember seeing the red quest level text for at least ten levels haha
---
Here's my tip. When you make your first character, make all of your characters. Level them all to \~5 and get them to the first inn. Log out here.
---
Now whenever you want to play any character, you'll pretty much always have full rested. I level all my alts like this and I'm usually under 5 days played to 60.
---
I rolled a Druid in vanilla and was forced into ape ING healing for raid purpose and being in the best guild of the server. I always had this remorse of not playing what I wanted to play, a caster (and boomkin to be precise). Since BC, I played feral and it fit my expectations. I rolled multiple alt after that including warrior and DK and learn to love to tank.
---
The real question I still can’t answer is, will I roll warrior, or should I persist into trying to roll a feral druid, to be able to off tank 5 man dungeons and raids.
---
I’m quite afraid not finding my place as a feral tank in classic. Will people be more opened to this, this time?
---
No goals, just getting a character started and have adventures with my friends. Hopefully make more friends on they way and have even greater adventures. For me it's un unwritten book that hopefully will get filled over time. 
---
I liked Felwood because the quest lines were pretty linear-you start South, by Ashenvale, and continue up with the quests until you hit the Furbolg tunnel. Also it was the first zone that was mostly Demon.   
---
Side note: Did anyone else while questing as a level 27 or so in Ashenvale do the death run to that first flight point in Felwood? I would always try and grab it early and remember the wolves were all “???” to me. 
---
I know it will be more difficult, but I just can't make myself play alliance, I'm one of those people that is loyal to death, so I'm gonna go with Tauren.
---
I never watch Steamers. I hate Streamers! And even if I watched Streams I could not think of anything more boring than watch someone play WoW!
---
Exalted with Thorium Brotherhood is almost Required for early level Armor/Weapon makers of all types.
---
I'd pay more sub just to avoid the fuckers lol.
---
Adventure Zone (start from the oldest episodes) is a podcast where 3 funny idiots and their Dad play Dungeons and Dragons.
---
My Brother, My Brother, and Me is a podcast where those same 3 funny idiots answer stupid Yahoo questions.
---
Pretty much any podcast on maximum fun.com is amazing.
---
Go Druid. Naturally you'll become "sensory blind" to your tauren model anyways, and you'll be focusing on the mobs / players you're fighting so it's not a big deal. I feel you though, I'm stuck on Troll Shadow Priest or Tauren Druid... I just really don't like the thought of having mana issues as a Spriest, or the mindnumbingly boring leveling they have 1-44.
---
The Hobbit is a great adventure to listen to while you are on your own.
---
I tried to speedrun Mulgore recently and it was hilariously fun. There was so many points where I could improve as I died so many times to just dumb stuff.
---
They implemented it in later stages
---
 
---
I'm looking forward to being part of a server community again, recognizing the top guilds and getting to know the different personalities. The jokers, the ninjas, the terrible players, the PvP gods, the enchanter that never leaves ironforge bridge.
---
I'm hoping to find my own niche in there as well. My plan is to play my warrior again, I've done the grind twice before so I know what im getting myself in for. I'd like to be known as a reliable tank and would hope to find a guild to progress with. My plan is to play a human but level through nightelf zones to hit exalted early on for the saber mounts. I'd love a thunderfury as well but I see that as something that may come about from being a raid tank rather than something to aim for. I haven't settled on professions yet although ill probably go skinning/herb or skinning/mining for leveling.
---
I'm hoping classic releases early this summer, I'm finishing my degree in June so I'm hoping I get the full summer to spend leveling and grinding before I have to start working. Already getting my battlestation prepped for a marathon levelling session, got my coffee maker and a mini fridge setup so now I just need a 2nd monitor for netflix. Can't wait !!!
---
We actually have really high dps the problem we have is threat... so in the early raids you basically have to play with the breaks on, so gearing up doesn’t feel as fulfilling because we don’t get don’t go all out but once the later raids are out in we get to go all out enjoy full paced dps
---
This, this, this. And a little bit of this.
---
I find his voice very soothing, it gives me peace.
---
Never thought of doing that. May do that at 29 for a bit.
---
The race to 60 isn't a lottery, it's a 4 day speedrun and the winner will be someone who optimises their playtime the best. Thanks for the motivation either way!
---
They gave Orcs the ability to stand upright in BFA the problem is I am not sure if it alters there height.
---
I know for a fact Zandalari Trolls stand upright but they're not taller, same size model as hunched trolls which is a real bummer.
---
Afaik there wasn't a model at all. Went there a couple of times because of the Smiley. 
---
Else you would have seen it from inside of zg, wasn't that far away and this alpha karazhan tower was massive
---
Break up with gf, getting fired at my job, trow away my phone, stack up on supplies and lock the door.
---
Go outside once I'm 60.
---
Maybe, subscription with WoW Token doesn't allow you play with Classic, only the normal sub.
---
Always enjoy Westfall and the Defias questline. Duskwood has the best atmosphere but is kind of let down by having to trek across the zone 10000000 times. Even using the fly to Westfall life hack.
---
Hillsbrad is another great one with some good grinding spots too.
---
Favourite zone is Hinterlands though, even if it has almost no quests. It's just beautiful and secluded
---
Grinding ogres in Deadwind Pass for three levels since there were no more quests.
---
Least rolled class in vanilla and that is understandable. Good flag carriers, mediocre flag dps at best. Great offtanks and okay healing. Jack of all trades master of none. Their utility only warrants 1 perhaps 2 resto and feral.
---
Retail wow is a money machine with the gold flows, one half buys tokens for boost and the other half sells boosts.
---
Same amound of months got payed for but they cost 20 instead of 13.
---
Its somewhat pay to "win". If you consider gear and achievments winning.
---
Warlocks are great but they have some major drawbacks.
---
For raiding you aren't going to be that great of DPS until AQ/Naxx you have no built in hit talents for shadow bolt, This really isn't a huge deal though because there will be at bare minimum 3 warlocks in every 40 man for debuffs/buffs (COE/COS/COR/BP/HS/SS) and the occasional banish. You will end up farming probably 20-30 shards for a raid. Rotation kinda sucks, you spam SB and keep curses up, you might be afforded a corruption slot but don't count on it.
---
In naxx you will start putting out insane numbers and earning a tier 1 dps spot, rubbing shoulders with fury warriors/mages/rogues, but you will always be threat capped, so you have to play a very careful threat balancing game. Rotation still sucks.
---
Leveling locks are second best levelers in the game and you get a free mount
---
5-10 mans, you might need to seduce a mob occasionally or learn to fear juggle with COR, you usually aren't required to CC more than 1 or maybe 2 if your with a bad group, your gonna need probably 15-20 soulshards (you can farm some off trash in the dungeons, you wont always get one but your usually not trying to tryhard dps trash mobs so SS fishing isn't gonna hurt anything)
---
PVP locks are tier 1 for sure, they have at least 3 tier 1 specs for whatever your focus is, SM/Ruin which is squishy but the preferred premade spec (and also a top tier raid spec so no respeccing yay!), SL which is a great anchor/ very hard to kill 1v1. and NF/Conflag which is just an insane bursty spec with very little survive.
---
Farming is pretty good, top 3 solo farmers at least, behind hunter/mage.
---
Back when I played in Vanilla, I was very directionless -- playing tons of alts and never even making it to 60. I still had a blast.
---
This time, I'm planning to be very focused on leveling a paladin and getting geared and into raiding early. I may even try to run a guild.
---
I first played wow on a private server. There, they always put a green dragon in the middle of dusk wood next to a portal. That became one of the most mysterious areas for me when I moved into official wow. I think it was a place where a world boss would pop up.. Right? I never truly knew. Gonna do some research. 
---
This will be my take on vanilla too, ill take my time with leveling and everything. 
---
Holy hell, thats crazy.  I remember taking 12 hours to level in the higher levels... With quests!! Grinding 3 levels must of taken soooo much time
---
The old world is one of the things I miss most about classic. 
---
IIRC most of the HFP quest gear was roughly T2 equivalent. Naxx stuff was relevant into T4 and even T5 because T4 was so undertuned on release. Granted part of it was because KT had higher ilevel drops than the rest of Naxx.
---
I'll be switching factions but sticking to tanking as my role. My wife will be joining me and that's what I'm most looking forward to. Exploring the world together will be awesome and I can show her all the cool shit I found bad in the day.
---
Thats true yeah, i think thats actually the case for a lot of titles that were added retroactive that they were all added in TBC or later. Now i think of it, i think you only had the PVP titles during Vanilla and you couldn't even pick the title to display as that system only came in the TBC prepatch iirc. 
---
This
---
I'll one day re-do my main mage, but in classic i am moving over to play a druid because I like hybrids and healers more now. I also plan on doing both raiding and pvp, just like in other MMOs. To me classic is less about nostalgia and re-playing an old game, more like playing a good MMO on a fresh server.
---
Azshara... controversial to say I guess, but just loved it.
---
I can't wait. Im very pumped for the event. 
---
No he doesnt. Run speed,resistances/physical damage was all normalized  in vanilla ! 
---
Not attack speed :)
---
Isnt Hobbs a  heartstone streamer / youtuber now? 
---
gank stv 24/7
---
i want to enjoy world PVP as how it should be, socialise with a proper community and participate in some classic raids. I will be casual as I work shifts but I can still accomplish what I want in my own time.
---
People are way too focused on the meta-game and lose track of the actual game. You aren't just leveling in a 20-30 zone, you are defeating the Defias, you are uncovering a secret plot, you are helping a farm against wolves, you are on a mission from your druidic enclave, etc.
---
I think Trolls are the coolest mages.
---
Great totem guide! 
---
Darkshore is insane if you know all the quests, the beached sea creatures alone give you a full level of xp on their own.
---
Realistically I'll be happy to clear all the PVE content with a Healer, DPS, and Tank. Hopefully experience the best the community has to offer along the way.
---
I know it's unlikely but a pipe dream goal would be  getting Atiesh, Greatstaff of the Guardian. I'm not sure which of the caster classes would have the most likely chance to get it. My assumption is it wouldn't matter as long as raid attendance and raid dedication were perfect/i was a slobbing knob as an officer.  
---
Yeah thanks for the scans! If you have any more you should definitely post them in this subreddit, they are really cool to see
---
You will not stay in the same zone for 10 levels in vanilla. Quest chains usually involved going to different zones. For my leveling route, I looked up interesting quest rewards to up my power level (warlock) and make sure to tailor a leveling route to that, as I will save every damn silver I get. I came up with something like this - some of it might not be clear as it is from a working document, some levels need slight tweaking (i.e. Uldaman will probably need 2 runs to complete all quests). I am currently revisiting level 1-60 on a certain TBC private server and I notice that these things are off sometimes even with the 30% extra exp compared to 1.12 so I will continue tweaking as I go.

you underestimate how annoying it will be as a streamer. They will legit just get poly/sapped permanently, people will die on purpose just to annoy the streamers
---
So much feedback i will need to update my list but i guess it can probably include everything from my old and new list which is good as now i won't miss out on any old zones i enjoyed in favor is a whole new experience.
---
I do plan to grind a bit as traveling every 2-3 levels sounds tedious but i suppose that could be like 5+ hours so maybe not as bad as it sounds.
---
Right now I dont think I will care about endgame but who knows. In vanilla i got 3 classes to 60 and got up to halfway AQ40. My first plan is to level all classes to 60. Ill start with a hunter and see what I feel like next when I get there. For me the most fun is meeting people when leveling and making new friends. In vanilla this felt way easier then in current because you were more dependent on others. Hopefully find a nice and active social guild with nice peeps to do leveling and dungeons with.
---
How is it piracy to host a server for a game that hasn't been supported by the developer for 10 years?
---
I wanna make a char and progress through Elwynn Forest to enter Westfall and feel dissapointed that I'm not 14 years old and reliving all this glorious shit is impossible
---
...but in all honesty I still hope it will feel amazing to get back to most immersive gaming experience of my life
---
I played priest during classic, was part of a bg premade, and even the best pallys wouldn't inspire fear as much as annoyance. That's all I'm saying, and you're kind of confirming it. Paladins are... annoying in PvP because they're hard to kill. A Shaman is much more of an offensive threat in PvP. It's pretty true!
---
Because people mis-click and then post a support ticket then a GameMaster moves the item. All of this work can be avoided with this feature.
---
Who ever said that it was the intention to be easier and more accessible? 
---
Honest misclicks and mistakes are trivially and completely solved by undo button, but I guess a decade ago that wasn't known.
---
&gt; Token will be on Retail so same thing.
---
not at all, Classic's economy is still insulated
---
&gt; And the BoP Loot Change is here to stay.
---
clearly still up for debate
---
&gt; You can already ninja using a GM.
---
Lol. doesn't even sound like you know what you're talking about 
---
completely different issue.
---
is all you do troll these forums to post negativity that's not even constructive?
---
I'd agree, but as other users pointed out, Blizzard is clearly seeking alternatives that don't rely on their human support staff.
---
So if this is the route they choose, they need to just tell players support won't help with loot problems.
---
No one would give a fuck if they said that anyway.
---
Loot trading will only ruin PUGs. Classic is specifically catered towards guild runs and non-PUGs, so I don't see the issue. People won't raid with random players, they will use guilds to do so. In that environment loot-trading won't be a thing.
---
Dragon is part of vanilla.
---
A problem is that many zones lie between those ranges. For example, Redridge is 15 to 25.
---
Have no goals. Play just for fun. Play whatever build I like and not that "choice was an illusion" thing. Hoping to find a guild that doesn't mind the way you play your class and just want to have fun.
---
&gt;Even just looking into Duskwood from Westfall
---
I raise you: With my first char I swimmed across the River from Jerod's landing and was really creeped out by the dark forest. Then got eaten by a wolf.
---
Wowsen LULW
---
A MMO that'll last me for a long time. I have a lot of long-term goals I want to achieve in Classic, such as every class possible at 60, well-geared, along with rolling a few characters on PVP servers to enjoy WPVP.
---
Damn, nearly all of them
---
Obvious ones are Duskwood, Dun Morogh, Mulgore or Westfall
---
But I love other ones too - Badlands for certain mood of the zone and very cool exploration theme. Uldaman rocks!
---
Also Feralas is so godlike when it comes to diversity of terrain and whole mystic design
---
Un'goro is totally different than any other zone, mind blowing when I've entered for the first time
---
STV is a little bad designed when it comes to length of time needed to progress through, but man that fuckin jungle is so lovely ♥
---
And why would a warrior or paladin in late wotlk/cata want to use leather at all? You could have it if no one else needed it, but druids and rogues  had loot prio because it would benefit them more. Same thing with druids and cloth healing gear. Obviously itemization was weird in vanilla, but hybrid classes being harder to gear is fine by me if it stops new players (who don’t know better), and greedy lootwhores from needing on everything just because the game let them do it...
---
cataclysm was a mistake. they should just update the zones dustallow marsh style instead of completely revamping them. that would leave them more resources to focus on the 80+ content.
---
I'm hoping to get about 100 days played...on my first toon. With alts added in skys the limit
---
My point was if you do not know whether you clicked greed or need, you're not engaged enough.
---
Gotcha. I remember a 49 Orc Warrior wrecking an Arathi Basin match with these shoulders:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13066/wyrmslayer-spaulders
---
Man they looked so cool. 
---
Easy fix, make it soulbound if you roll need or equip it?
---
Don't worry. The first few hours in 1-5 zone may be total chaos, but it will be something you will not encounter ever again, so add it to your memories of Classic. After a few days everyone will slowly spread out.
---
The power levelers will be way ahead, providing greens for you lowbies and the normal rushers (not following guides, but playing 18h a day) will also be in different zones than you. 
---
Make some friends in the early zone to level with, so tagging also goes easier. 
---
All will be fine :-)
---
Entertainment before Pantheon drops.
---
Give this guy a production budget and let him make a movie about it!
---
Tanaris hands down!
---
The tower quest in Azshara is amazing for exp. You have to go pick up 4 stones and then deliver them to the major cities and then come back to the tower. Since you are likely to go to the major cities for something anyways its a free quest that gives full exp.
---
He's working for blizz now
---
Imagine trailers like this for every raid release? The hype would be palpable. 
---
when you are sat there discussing loot for like 5mins before passing out one piece i dont mind waiting an extra 10secs for a "Are you Sure" box to pop up
---
Elwynn Forest.  It's pure nostalgia; I remember looking around for the first time and thinking "holy hell, games look beautiful now."
---
2-3 levels at 30+ take roughly 3-5 hours, yes. And you'll want to pass by a trainer for your most important spells every few levels anyway. I am currently level 46 on that private server and I enjoy the running around for quests as much as doing them oddly
---
I wouldn’t be so sure of that, that’s how they fixed these issues when they used this system in retail. All loot (including rare/epic boe items) would BoP and be untradable if you rolled need, why the hell wouldn’t they do it that way?
---
I played a druid in vanilla and am thinking of playing one again in classic, but let me tell you, it is NOT an easy class. The class definition used to be “jack of all trades, master of none” and it was true. You will never top charts of any kind, and you will be an off-tank at best in raids (i was one in MC) but you bring a lot to the raid with Innervate and combat ress. In 5-man dungeons you can tank no problem and can even heal decently, however a lack of normal ress means any screw up and someone will be corpse running so always get a sham/priest dps in the group if you heal.
---
Your main challenge when going HotW/NS is finding gear. As a hybrid, you need str, agi, sta and int. Basically everything. The first and arguably easiest set you can get for this is the pvp blue set. It has everything you want and then some. 
---
After that, a lot of BiS items are from raids and usually raiding guilds have priority bidding on loot so that the class that will help the most with raid progress gets the first X items. This means you can expect a few rogues/warrs to take your BiS before you even get allowed to bid. On the plus side, as many people here said, raids usually don’t have more than 2-3 druids so you will have a lot of unused DKP and good healing gear if you have patience. It’s all about the patience.
---
AQ is the first raid with a proper druid set as well as weapon. And dat weapon, DAYUM. We’re talking specific to druid, 300 AP in cat/bear weapon. The next best thing is a similar 1hander that drops from the world dragon bosses that has about 195.
---
Now after all this, when you finally get good gear... feral is a blast. You can easily crit 1.5k on clothes in pvp and your mix of cat, bear and healer means you are one tough SoB to kill. In 1v1 you will out-live almost everything unless you get burst down. It will take a while, in fact some fights will be damn long (versus, say, a paladin) but you will win. 1v2 is a hard maybe, depending if you get the element of surprise or not and what classes. Druids are invaluable in WG as well, being the best class for flag carrying.
---
Druid is imo the hardest class in vanilla but played right and geared well, pretty rewarding. I have seen r13 druids back in the day and they were awesome.
---
Make a mage and become a millionaire from selling portals
---
Love Elwynn and Redridge :) Fantastic music and atmosphere. Not a big fan of Duskwood, requires too many mobs per quest for many quests xD
---
awesome work
---
I wish more people played on TurtleWoW :(
---
However, to be fair, TurtleWoW is one of the servers where most people WILL pay if they can. All adult casual PvEers ;-)
---
Not exactly one zone, but the Missing Diplomat chain is my all-time favourit one,  I've done it with every character I leveled.
---
Stranglethorn!
---
Add to that lvl-ing in eastern plaguelands at 53. Have fun killing mobs 56-58 at snail pace.
---
Well, AV exalted has rings, offhands etc that even raiders will use, for quite a while in fact.
---
Feral druids supposedly have an edge in tanking 5 mans in classic.  Raids we are probably relegated to OTing though (which I would still be happy with) and healing.  Not sure if we will see dps feral in raids.
---
My playing time is going to be irregular. I might be able to play a lot but I can't commit to a regular raid schedule. I think Druid will be perfect for me.
---
My intention is to find a raiding guild that want a jack-of-all-trades bench player. So if someone's not turned up and at the last minute you need to fill the last raid spot then I can be that, regardless of if it's tank, heal or kitty. If someone has to drop out half-way through tonight's raid then I if I'm online I can jump in.
---
I'll never clear Naxx, I'll never top the meters, or main tank, but I'll have a varied playstyle, I'll not let the team down, I'll be a valuable asset on a guild roster, and I'll have fun doing that.
---
I was around 15 when I played vanilla and played pretty hardcore.  I raided through BWL and started AQ40/cleared AQ20.  I played a decent amount of pvp.
---
Now I want to switch to the horde and play Shaman because it's the class I know the least about.  I want to focus on the things I didn't experience and make a bunch of new friends in a new guild.  I didn't get to play through AQ40 nor Naxx (not included WotLK).  I want to experience those and get really good at pvp as a Shaman. 
---
Someone can be here for the journey and still rush to 60. People take journeys in different ways.
---
It's what I will do. At 17, I will probably be in Loch Modan, Westfall and Redridge at the same time. More fun as well. Not bothering with bank alts either. Flying between the zones land me in SW or IF and I will have a quick visit at the AH and trainers.
---
"Kept up dps with the hunters" isn't really a great accomplishment in more serious guilds, to be fair. Cookie cutter mages and warlocks should be doing better.
---
Well, I know this sounds rough, but what I imagine would happen is he’d eventually just learn to slow down and confirm. If it became a continuous issue, maybe he’d put someone else in charge of loot mastering (while he’d still be GM).
---
I know that’d suck to adjust to, but I really think that it’s in everyone’s best interest to slow down and treat looting seriously.
---
Yesss!! All those amazing hunting chain quests and your first taste of world pvp all in one breathtaking  jungle.
---
After reading through comments and your post, you need to change classes, you'd be much happier. 
---
A rogue seems like it is right up your ally.  You never have to do much for anyone else and get to enjoy all the perks of raiding.  No mana to worry about, not summoning, no picking pets for other people.  Just do you, dps and dps.
---
Even in PVP, you can be as selfish as you want, if you don't want to help anyone, go stealth away.
---
I see people buying / selling portals quite often, and it confuses me since I’ve not paid for one for a very long time. Being polite and friendly goes a long way!
---
To be an elitist! and be a prick to every1 while spending 12 hours a day moaning about the game
---
Flat out wrong and a quick google search would show it. 
---
Aside from the obvious (no crossrealm, no cash shop, etc) I’m really hoping for flexible talent specs. Leveling a 2h warrior tank or backstab-specced dagger rogue is great fun and it’s very interesting to experiment with different specs and playstyles. 
---
I remember someone skinned my tiger one time, OH MAN.
---
I followed him around for an hour, he would polymorph a mob so he can kill another one, nope!, attacking that sheep and vanishing.
---
He would kill a wolf, I would spam my mouse until I skinned it first. 
---
Do not take my loot.
---
I guess not (for feral dps) appart for dedicated hardcore feral dps. Only issue I see in tanking 5 men is not having potion, but we bring other useful tricks like hibernate or roots (only in dm). Good point is that we also will be able to run maraudon with my rogue friend, as soon as we get 60, which will be great. I’m just really afraid of not finding my place in raid as an off tank
---
My first goal is to relive my old UD Rogue but as a NE this time. My rogue was fairly accomplished but there were some items I just couldn't seem to get from "on-farm" raids. So I want to get those this time around, and then of course since I'm there I want to finish AQ 40 and go to naxx.
---
Concurrently, I'll be leveling a human warlock as I've never played lock past level 20 or so. I think I'd like to raid with him too and experience vanilla end game content as a caster.
---
Other goals include maxing professions and trying to earn sufficient gold from it, and really ultimately keep leveling alts.
---
Taxation is theft
---
I need to get my fix of a slow-paced, grindy mmo.
---
Same. I dont know why people bother playing classic if they dont like leveling. As if life at 60 is not dull. It's running the same dungeons over and over and over and over and over and over again. And raiding is wiping over and over and over and over again. For what? An epic here and there marginally increasing your dps.
---
(reality check: I do like endgame as well, just wanted to make a comparison)
---
Horde or alliance? Once you level a character to 60, which legit takes months, try rolling the other faction.
---
Completely different experiences, different environments, even musically they are different
---
And on a side note the audio/music of vanilla needs serious acknowledgement. Everything has a theme. Did you know if you pop into the gnome house in dun morough, the gnome music starts playing, same as when you enter the gnome enclave in IF. They perfectly placed those triggers and designed thematic music everywhere. It honestly is an unrivalled game
---
Thanks 
---
I upvote this every time I see it. It’s so well made and gets me over the top excited for classic.
---
Lol I think that distinction goes to Windfury Totem
---
Fetch an owl in Teldrassil when you leveled your horde hunter to 10...an amazing adventure and every player asks where you got one (and yes it takes a couple of hours of traveling &amp; dying) ;-)
---
List of things I've done over the years!
---
1. Dual monitor -&gt; Watching tv series or movies. Really good if it's something you've seen before and don't need to pay much attention.
---
2. Podcasts -&gt; Many great podcasts exist. I've already started compiling a playlist.
---
3. Take a break from the grind -&gt; Many people will be leveling. If you're getting bored, take some time to run dungeons or pick herbs. Nothing wrong with hitting level 20 and doing WC 6 times in a row if you'll enjoy yourself.
---
4. Set small goals -&gt; Hit a certain level in x amount of time played. Or you could set a goal to get all your professions to 75 before level 20.
---
5. -&gt; If you're playing a class with other little objectives. Rogue, take some time to go and level lockpicking, or as a hunter tame some beasts that have pet abilities you need to learn. If you're a tailor you could go back to a lower level zone and make linen bags for people.
---
6. -&gt; Join a guild and talk to people in guild chat while doing stuff.
---
Clear Blackrock Mountain and slay Onyxia. I was lvl 52 and 15 year old when TBC hit so my focus went towards Hellfire and I ended up doing first two bosses of BT until Wrath. I have never seen Upper Blackrock Spire or experienced the madness of BRD full run.
---
Thanks so much
---
Melderon + DC  
---
Thank you so much for these videos, from the shaman leveling guide along with the countdown to classic episodes you guys have single handedly convinced me to play a shaman. I played a pally back in Vanilla but now Tauren/Orc Shaman is where my heart is. Feel like you guys have the most in depth guides out there and cant thank you enough, keep up the good work!
---
First I'll say that I'm a WoD baby, and I've never played classic wow before.
---
One of the things that I love in retail is RP, and being able to do things in the old world is something that I'm looking forward to. I'm also really interested in a harder experience, and getting some items that I was never able to get post-Cata.
---
Thanks so much! Wow that means a ton. I hope you enjoy your shaman experience
---
That's the thing, I wasn't banned nor were a lot of people, it's too epidemic to ban everyone who bought gold, as I remember they had to ask people nicely to not buy it because of the damage it did to the economy of the servers. 
---
As for the classic token i mention, it's your basic WoW token, someone earns the gold, the gold is taken by blizzard in exchange for game time, the gold is then sold to another player for real money, it's not like this gold is being magicked up by blizzard it still must be earned by someone and i'd rather it be a single player than an army of bots. The token does no damage to the economy as it's all legitimate and prevents the worst of the chinese gold sellers.
---
Or you can have shamans use Tranquil Air Totem?
---
With the way gear and gear checks worked you had to start raiding pretty early on in order to even mathematically get through Naxxramas in time, you had to not suffer too many players taking that gear with them and leaving the guild and on top of that you had to have 8 warriors willing to tank in order to get past the four horsemen.
---
That on top of keeping the guild motivated with TBC around the corner means that a lot of pieces had to fit in order for you to clear the raid, things that had nothing to do with the difficulty of the encounters.
---
I just want to get going this weekend. Why so long to wait! 😿
---
unluckly also streamers like forsen shroud lirik summit will turn servers into meme servers
---
Is he really?
---
I've done it a handful of times, it's a pretty shitty piece of content if you can call it that.
---
All those fossils lying around...
---
So interestingly I experienced this sort of hivemind mentality in original vanilla because I played on the same server as the Penny-Arcade comic creators.  You are absolutely right that there were many guilds dedicated to them, but honestly I never knew their character names.  I only saw their cult following and it had some effect on the server.  Generally it wasn’t that bad and, aside from hating on the guilds for being stupid conceptually, there were good and bad players in the guilds just like any other.
---
Bottom line: it does have an impact, and maybe more so now that the characters aren’t anonymous.  I’m not sure I’d say it ruins a server though.
---
Portals used to cost a reagent in vanilla so tipping is recommend.  
---
Both. I have a character on alliance which I play with my colleague. And on the horde side I have my mage which I level up solo. I like that it takea so long, means I’ll have much fun with it.
---
My goal is to play every faction with all the races and and different classes.
---
Yesterday I was playing with my headset and I really have to say the audio is perfectly done. I felt like I was actually in the game traveling around hearing stuff. It’s really immersive with a headset.
---
I’m a bit down today, since I can’t play at all today. This game really has some magic to it.
---
It wont be as bad as people are painting it.  Private servers have pretty much no throttle on lowbie zones and just let everyone in.  Blizzard is either using sharding (controversial) or a queue system like they did on original vanilla launch.  Original vanilla launch had a lot of people in queue but once you got in you were able to do quests with only a small amount of waiting for mobs in most areas(a few quests are bottlenecked but you can just skip those).  People are getting PTSD from private servers and overblowing the whole thing.  I would be more worried that server queues will stall or the servers will blow and the game is down for several hours or more on launch day.
---
Yup. That’s why we’re all hoping they modify nothing at all! And it’s also why I’m pretty bummed out they’re making this loot change.
---
In my opinion, keep Classic exactly how it is. It’s a masterpiece already
---
Actually Blizzard did hire him after he made this (and a few other trailers for private servers) 
---
yes
---
Just be in a guild with some bag crafters, send them the cloth and they return you a bag :P
---
Why skip ungoro? Thats like one of the best questing zones
---
Crusader will not give you much money when everybody is saving for their epic. Crusader enchants become a thing when everybody HAS his or her epic mount and are saving up for the enchants ;-)
---
Yeah. It’s not necessary to change anything at all.
---
Like Assassins Creed 2, which to me is a masterpiece of a single-player game. They rarely make these kinds of games today which are made as they should and stay the way they should be.
---
I mean I’m all in for change if the change is actually good. But we rarely see that. So I’m happier if some things stay the same.
---
no
---
Damn, that was a super impressive trailer. I didn't even have audio on and I could tell it was probably epic. 
---
I just want to play my favorite game again without "god mode" turned on because that's what retail feels like.  You effectively can't die in the open world, you can fly, unlimited gold if you try at all.
---
I'd say 80%-20% in its first months, then 90%-10% or 95%-5% afterward. In favor of retail. Not because it's the better game (since that's just an opinion), but because Classic is a niche market. 
---
A challenge.
---
I look forward to groups wiping in low level raids because people don't know their role.  I look forward to grinding to achieve something if not by myself than also with others.  planning my leveling instead of just hitting an area and being guided along.  I look forward to world PVP making my leveling all the harder because i have to watch my back consistantly and finding rivals in an area because we are trying to get the same mobs.  Random strangletorn raids.
---
Actually he also made these for BWL  and AQ, but I  won't link them here as they were especially made for a still active private server.
---
anybody who hasn't seen them yet, just follow his  youtube channel -&gt; videos and you will find them 
---
In order to do this for difficult content, you will need to accumulate 3 different gearsets. This is a fine plan for MC, though. 
---
Melderon, you're a legend. I always love your Shaman guides!
---
You'd find it very hard to provide satisfactory raid level performance without the appropriate gear/experience, especially as a cat.
---
Cat dps can work but you need tremendous effort, plus the right gear and consumables to make it work.  The notion that a bench cat is valuable is probably best abandoned here
---
Awesome work. So all people can get a glimpse of the content for the hyper 1%. Do not get me wrong, I hope Naxx will be as hard as it has been 14 years ago. Wrarh of the lich king was a shame for naxx.
---
This seems the realistic ratio. No clue why everybody thinks otherwise. It's just not happening. You will have 100k-200k classic players TOPS and still a couple of million retail players.
---
Get ur main to 60 first, u can farm gold by herbing if you need it.
---
With ur spare time after raids lvl mage
---
PvP and Community. 
---
Warriors best stat in wotlk was armor pen. For whatever reason blizzard made lots of leather gear with armor pen I think they wanted to make it a rogue stat? But anyways it ended up being your best stat as warrior but they didn't put a lot of it on plate gear so in a lot cases your best piece was leather also they didn't add the 5% main stat boost until cata. Most healers vanilla-wotlk had cloth in their bis.
---
Think ur gonna get preyed on more as a pala than warrior tbh
---
Warrior is a really strong class even 1v1 situations, but you should choose a class that suits you
---
Maybe druid is better for you, it's the most slippery class with a lot of utility and escapes, as well as good 1v1 potential
---
and you can tank raids as well
---
yea, your weakness is being interrupted. War stomp might save you, but out-right resisting a stun allows you to get your casts off while throwing a rogue off his rotation is huge for your survival, so resisting 1 of his 2 stuns can mean life or death. You're most likely going to sacrifice the advantage of tauren's hp trying to get a stomp off instead of just going for a heal. If a crit lands during the stomp cast from an enemy, the advantage is all but gone and now you're struggling even more to get a heal in to survive.
---
Depends how they are going to do enrage, in vanilla it did not proc when you /sit
---
But it works that way on private servers, which makes fury better for permanent 25% dmg
---
So if enrage doesnt work like that then arms is the way to go, get 5% crit first tho, then respec at 40 for ms
---
That's awesome! Got a source?
---
This. 
---
It’s true! I’ve not had a lv60 char for quite some time, though, so I think there’s some empathy for levellers who’re unable to afford such costs.
---
If you can’t tip, be respectful and appreciative. 
---
Thanks for putting in so much effort! 
---
I tried out the Human guide but hit a bunch of problems @ Shadowglen that kinda leaves you stuck at that point. 
---
Killing mobs for quests at that stage will have the exact same bottlenecks that all starting zones have and it seems like all the good xp moonwell quests are locked behind that.
---
You can use a very unscientific but probably accurate method: Just look at the subreddit subscriber numbers. Of course they don't show the full interest but they are a decent gauge of *relative* interest.
---
As I never played cow/Rastafarian/thrall cosplay back in Vanilla I don’t know how good it is - can’t wait to find out though!! 
---
I used to hang around on top of the Goldshire buildings, went there a few times as a Horde hunter too.
---
Was pretty funny watching people try to get to me.
---
Holy crap this is amazing.
---
I too am curious about the source! 
---
But players can collude to obtain items, then submit GM tickets saying they got an item by accident and need to be transferred to someone else.
---
Also true, lots of factors went into the naxx clear rate other than just difficulty
---
I just want to re-experience it. But not in the rose-tinted goggles, just for nostalgia kind of way.
---
Vanilla was one of my favorite games ever, but at the time I played it on a laptop with 512mb of ram (eventually slightly upgraded). Yeah. It was a toaster. WITH satellite internet. I don't know if you've ever played anything on satellite, but it doesn't work. Easily 800+ ping on a GOOD day.
---
So now that I have a beastly gaming computer and awesome internet, I'm eager to experience the game the way it's meant to be.
---
And another reason, something a lot of people aren't acknowledging - it's not going to be the same as when we first played it. Most of us are internet and game/mmo veterans now, unlike before. We know this game, it's not going to be like "old times" where we're all confused and just having fun. But THATS what I want to experience, the game from a seasoned gamers perspective. 
---
It's not just that, but that's a large part of it. That and just wanting to play the game again because it was great then, here's to hoping it's great now too. 
---
I’d say the problem with the old system is that it let people roll on stuff they shouldn’t at all, people can’t be trusted imho.
---
I wouldn't say Warlock is sub tier damage, they're perfectly fine early game and are S tier in end game.
---
Mage is S tier the whole game and has more quality of life aspects but I find Warlock to be a lot more interesting  to actually play. 
---
You gotta watch it with audio as soon as you can.
---
Have a look at this warrior guide, it's pretty extensive
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gtxX1WQILnM&amp;t=919s
---
Well we have 3 months until PvP ranking and BWL is released from what I gather. So I won't be in a rush. 
---
Will take that time to pick a class. Probably druid or warrior. Anything I level to 35 I can use for a daily transmute, so it won't be a complete waste of time, and I can play whatever I decide suits me best.
---
i want the old mmorpg game mantra where i just grind and run into people and talk to people
---
Posted 11 years ago. The maker of this video did a great job shooting this scene, especially for 2005.
---
Or look at the total number of players on vanilla pservers (or close-to-vanilla) vs non-vanilla pservers. And those numbers do not do classic any favour. Classic fans live in a bubble and think the interest is actually bigger than it is. Sure, the interest IS big, but not that big.
---
fun
---
stun resist is just too good
---
I want the same thing, but the problem with that is that you can't please everyone.  Some people are going to hate the changes.  It's much less controversial and safe to just release the expansions as they were than to make changes.  I sure would love to see all the older zones that weren't filled up or ret-conned.
---
Digital suffering
---
Very useful, been thinking of maining a troll Shaman. Thanks!
---
You are, really only "brought along" for the first few months, by the endgame you can hit #1 dps on some fights and stay top 5 for almost all of them
---
I had the original CGW with the preview article for World of Warcraft.  I was very young and was awestruck by the Warcraft universe.  I went onto the WoW website and read all I could about the races and factions.  In that article (from around 2003) they even mentioned the potential to open the dark portal.
---
In casual guilds nobody cares. Imo, (struggling) casual guilds fare better with a kitty druid that provides 50dps-100 less but can snap-heal, battle-res and innervate a priest than a pure dps.
---
Google, he made a reddit post about it
---
I don't know....care to explain what you mean by this?
---
When I was around ten years old during vanilla there was a human rogue in my guild who would show off his model changing exploits to me.
---
I think he just started talking to me in vent one day, I didn't have a mic so I would just follow him around and watch him run through the air which he told me he was doing by changing his campfires model into a staircase.
---
After that got boring he had me buy some noggenfoggers and started showing me all of the different more popular explorations.
---
Hoping to get an hour or two per night of solid fun. Something that I can look forward to coming home to after shit days at work. 
---
Not going to worry about how fast I'm leveling or gearing up. Just gonna try to complete as many quests as possible and do every dungeon on my way up.
---
But he left quite early.
---
And they drive me fucking nuts.
---
You're welcome
---
Reading all of the comments from OP I find myself thinking something along the same lines lol.
---
He never said casual guild, he said "a raiding guild that want a jack-of-all-trades bench player."
---
The reality is if he wants to be a bench player then he'd be better off picking a specific druid role and gearing/speccing for that class accordingly.
---
&gt; If it's a more organized and well behaving fandom then cool.
---
You will be disappointed.
---
I was raid leading in my guild during Naxx progress and most encounters was really easy as long as you had the gear. But I think the ratio of bad players in any given guild was a lot higher. I remember us having at least 10 people on any given night that were just god awful.
---
If you accidentally click attack on someone in a city and you die, should blizzard set up some system where you are prompted “confirm”?
---
You already have to click twice to Need roll.
---
We no longer need GMs to baby people’s mistakes. Just tell people they won’t intervene and keep it simple.
---
No one expects them to intervene anyway.
---
30/0/21 shaman, is pretty much the go to healer/dps bg spec,  you spam purge, drop important totems, throw impactful heals and obliterate people with lightning. 
---
Nostalgia. I replay all games at some point and it always made me sad that I could not replay the greatest of them all.
---
If I don't make scrub nerds cry themselves to sleep because they have failed yet again to be successful in Vanilla, then I have failed.  If I don't force private server losers off of the game by ridiculing their shit mentality, then I have failed.  If I don't make people quit PvP servers because they are camped into a state of anxiety and need to be put on suicide watch, then I have failed.
---
This is one of the best WoW trailers ever.
---
Don't hype it up too much, it's not all that great.
---
It's the single biggest thing that goes against everything Classic should stand for.  Vanilla was infinitely better for not having virtual pan handlers.
---
they had to do a server roleback.  
---
and quickly after that a patch made sure, this wasnt possible anymore :D  
---
Super nice to see a NPC stomped an Alliance town :D
---
i loled.
---
Yep, your name was preceded by your rank and seeing someone without a rank was extremely rare at 60 because you only needed 15 HKs or so for Private. Still it was kinda awesome to see a Lieutenant Commander or even Marshal/Grand Marshal ride past you. In Naxx though it was just a sea of privates and a few corporals or sergea ts.
---
That was incredible.
---
What I thought was funnier was kiting the unkillable troll NPC (you needed a certain quest item) into Stormwind from Blasted Lands. Just a whole bunch of people wailing on a mob at 1 HP, but never killing it. A GM had to come in and remove it. 
---
It wouldn't work on a normal server. 
---
First of all you would need like 20 other people minimum to actually lock it down full time. But even if you did, there wouldn't be the same demand for it as on private servers. There wouldn't be 2-3k people hitting 60 in the first 2 months all prepping to min-max raid. 
---
People would just wait it out for you guys to stop camping them for that month and then as soon as your not controlling the mobs come in and farm their leather in like 2 hour time.  
---
No. All of your problems in WotlK are amplified in vanilla. There is even less room for doing things on your own in your way and youll have to fit into whatever mold the classic community wants you to if you want to do end game raiding. The debuff limit, having to summon cause no summon stones or lfg/lfr, etc.
---
i hope that classic's release will make blizzard realize that retail wow is garbage compared to how it was back in vanilla
---
I love the authenticity of these videos from vanilla where even a majority of geared players never decided to use their '1' key for anything.
---
by far stranglethorn valley mostly due to the random world pvp 
---
To be a filthy fucking casual.
---
I'll probably regret this on Classic but I have to say Ganklethorn Vale is so epic and for most people it's the first time you really start brawling with the other faction. I have so many great memories of doing a quest in STV, getting ganked, posting in /1 to get a gank group and exacting furious revenge on the evil rogue! One kill turned into two kills and then a duo got killed and pretty soon we venture to Newingwary's camp and an all out battle starts. 
---
The quests are also great fun, tracking down rare animals and killing them, the pirate questline and if you accidentally venture too close to ZG and get smashed into troll guano balls.
---
It’s like a Godzilla movie. Watching everyone flee in terror as shadow bolts 1 shot the citizens by the dozens. Frickin hilarious.
---
This hyped me up for WOTLK tbh. If the game actually progresses that far I can honestly quit gaming with no regrets 
---
Rather than redesigning bosses which would make less sense from Blizzard point of view, simply a few spec redesign, not to homogenize them, but to make sure having 2-3 players of each spec can be an advantage in some situations or others.
---
Personally the more buttons I have to press the better.
---
When I started playing WoW in early 2006 I was terrible, no idea what I was doing, never had any gold and I couldn't kill another player to save my life. I want to relive classic as a better player who knows what he's doing, earn some gold and go pvping.
---
EU? US hasn't had a token above 250k in years. 
---
Played a lock, soulshard farming for raids could be a pain for sure, no argument there.  When my guild was new to MC we would kill Garr, then they'd all leave and the locks would logout where we killed him to then SUMMON THE ENTIRE RAID the next day...
---
As far as my priest bubble-dot-wand leveling is surprisingly relaxing.  Only farming I had to regularly do for my priest in end-game was go kill birds for Light Feathers #floorislava.
---
Nope. He never was hired. 
---
I think it's a little hard to determine what exactly gets classified as a chore. If eating, drinking, and bandaging aren't chores then rogue/warrior would look pretty good. Warrior just needs to reapply battle shout, but other than that it's all combat. However if you include eating and drinking, which I definitely would, then it becomes one of the most "chore" intensive classes because of all that downtime.
---
At the same time, you could argue travel is a "chore", and you should recognize hunter/shaman/druid have chore *reducers* in the form of extremely good movement speed buffs.
---
World PVP ganking lowbie players. That is all.
---
And the retards at blizzard remove every fun thing

Just spamming so everybody gets the notifcation for his feed :)  
---
I hope you guys dont mind.
---
Best Battlefield to this day for me.
---
Just casual leveling to 60. Feels nice to have a big open world where we meet people and are forced to socialize.
---
I am looking forward to the actual WORLD of Warcraft and level at a relaxed pace to 60 and then do PvP, probably raiding and just find a great guild to chill in.
---
Fun
---
I agree with this list. Id insert warrior in between paladin and warlock. They have a slow leveling experience that requires lots of food. They have long and or expensive class quests. At 60 they are extra gear dependant. If youre a tank you have to manage defense gear, and any warrior is going to want to buy/craft/farm gear more than others. Keeping up battle shout isnt thst bad, and theres some stance dancing you have to do if you want to be more effective. Besides all that their combat is pretty simple.
---
This isn’t retail. You don’t have a rotation in raids. You don’t have anything DPS rotation to “succeed” or do well at. You just spam shadowbolt. Stfu and accept it.
---
Your entire focus is around topping the DPS meters as if that’s all that matters. If it is, to you, then roll another class. You’ve got your answers stop writing this woe is me shit and public crying, it’s annoying
---
Rogue has poison levelling and making, lockpick levelling, thistle tea, vanishing/blinding powder. 
---
AOE grinding dire maul for me, get a step up on that epic mount.
---
For me, the best part of Vanilla was the social aspect. Loved being a part of a guild and make New friends.
---
I am so hyped for classic! I Hope the keep it as close to the original as possible. 
---
What they need to do Is make it so 1 piece of gear isn't strictly better in all cases and scenarios than another. 
---
For example, FFXI handles this very well. First off, the end game content is extremely different as in there is no raids, and bosses dont just poop out a set of gear automatically, theres always some sort of item/ currency grind, which might be a part of the whole great horizontal progression thing. 
---
But anyways, in that game you set up in game macros that instantly swap gear sets back and forth in battle, depending on the situation. For Ranged classes there are Precast gear that you use when you are about to fire off your shot or cast a spell. Then there is certain sets for TP gain. TP is a universal resource to build up to cast Weapon skills, which are huge burst damage abilities. So you have your TP gain if you when you need to get Weapon skills fast.
---
You have like 15 Weapon Skills for each weapon, so depending on the fight, you will have a certain gear set for a certain weapon skill you will switch to when activating your WS.  Then you have a set for when you need to use a class ability. Like a support class using a certain buff. You will have like 8 or so gear sets pre set up per class for a certain fight.
---
Now, these sets arent just soemthing like a "full Naxx" set. For your TP gain set, you might use the headgear from Nax 40, the gloves from AQ, the boots from Molten Core, etc. Its all mix and matching, a ton of research and theory crafting and testing. 
---
Now lets sat Burning Crusade comes out. Inevitably there needs to be some sort of vertical progression. So that ultimate weapon you got in the last expac? Well now there is a Ultimate Weapon +1 you can use to keep up in the new expac. And guess what, you are actually required to trade the old Ultimate Weapon to the NPC to actually upgrade it to get the +1 version.
---
If you want to look to how horizontal progression is done, look to FFXI
---
It's sorta subjective of course. I did count eating and drinking, but only with mage I felt like it's getting on my nerves, possibly because my stinginess prevents me from doing that too often when I have to actually pay for the food.
---
Travel is an interesting thought. I didn't count that however, because a) the class disparity gets eliminated with a mount and b) even for the 'slow' classes, travel doesn't require you to do anything extra. You do the same amount of actions, they just take a bit more time.
---
You're a normie.  
---
There are plenty of other streamers that are not playing mainstream games and will stream wow, with a hefty audience  
---
Love this scene.
---
Single greatest moment tho? Debatable. 
---
Another great video [u/Melderon](https://www.reddit.com/user/Melderon), love all all of the content you guys are putting out.
---
Nope, he quit shortly after. He made a couple of scenes in the bfa cinematic though. 
---
Haha. My friend used to speedhack in vanilla. He one day told me "first one to reach stormwind keep gets 1 gold" he got there in a few secs.
---
Getting to level 60 without doing a single Quest (except class quests).
---
I stopped at 47 because I was bored out.
---
False. There is no such thing as "vanilla WoW".  
---
There is a game World of Warcraft and its still available.  
---
I guess it was really funny for you guys :D
---
So the only one you know of is single vanilla private server  
---
gj  
---
What fears were reaffirmed? They are a top ranged DPS class, with raids bringing anywhere from 3-6. They're just below mages, with a much smaller percentage of players playing them. They're the 2nd easiest leveler behind hunters. They are monsters in PvP. Soul shard farming is only a problem if you aren't using DS on every mob when you're out farming/grinding, and even then you can usually farm for 10 mins and get a handful of shards to top you off if you're low. They bring high utility, making them desirable for 5 mans, and can even tank twin emperors because of their high shadow resist and sacrifice. They have multiple viable DPS and PvP specs, something that very few other classes can claim. Their tier sets are amazing. They get a free level 40 mount. They get a battle rez that is invaluable while leveling. They make their own very strong healing potions. Health is a resource for locks, so they have insane recovery. Their downside in DPS is that they do TOO MUCH damage and pull threat, without any threat mitigation abilities. A major reason why they are lower DPS than mages early is because warriors are limited on threat generation till they get very geared. They're one of the three best farming classes, behind only hunters and mages.
---
If that doesn't sound good to you, then I guess you want to play mage. However, you'll find that they will be just as hard (or harder) to find a DPS spot, since so many people play mage. On top of that, you'll be a worse leveler, have more downtime, an even simpler raid rotation, fewer viable specs, etc.
---
Every class has some tradeoffs. You won't find any class that is THE BEST across the board. In the past few months, I've leveled a hunter to 60, and another hunter to 30, a lock to 40, and a druid to 35; and I still can't decide which one I want to main because it's impossible to objectively say any of them are better than another. It's just what you prefer as a playstyle honestly.
---
cant wait to laugh at you  
---
what will happen in 1 year anyway? :)  
---
A full BRD run is literally one of the things I'm looking forward to the most. Never gotten to do it, not even on private servers.
---
Community. Be part of a guild, chasing rare patterns pooling raid resources, giving away stuff I get from skilling profs to lowbies.  
---
Making a name for myself, really. 
---
These trailers are amazing, especially this and the Ahn’Qiraj one. 
---
You need to be able to play 3 different skill bars as a druid if you want to be good. You need reagents for buffs/ress. I love it, but I can't see why you've put it at the top of the list.
---
Many more people will see it this time around if it’s any consolation.  
---
Nice! Me too! I missed the launch of it, but I came in about 10 days late, its been fantastic!
---
It's easier to say no changes rather than "maybe fix a few things like bugs, exploits, addon exploitation, ect" 
---
With greater blessings it doesn't take much effort to buff as a paladin.  When the buffs were only five minutes and you had to buff each player individually, that's when it was a chore.
---
I'm 41. I've already warned my family. See you in Deathknell.
---
Thank you!
---
Grind in greener pastures. Group up when you have no other option. 
---
I’ve never really played a shaman, this will be really helpful. 
---
In master looter if you choose the wrong person you'd need to make a ticket to correct. Same as accidentally pressing need
---
It just takes a lot of weight off GM's and removes the inconvenience of players having to wait almost arbitrarily 
---
I wrote in the post that I only got druid to level 19, so I didn't encounter reagents. (However I did with my 60 priest, and I had to stock them perhaps once a week, definitely nothing to bother me.) Additionally, having lots of 'buttons to push' or overall difficulty isn't the point of the list, the point is comparing repetitive, non-combat tasks the classes have to do. 
---
True
---
If you live in NA you don't really have a choice. Latency sucks.
---
Great. Made this guide for people like yourself. Check out my other guides for more general shaman knowledge
---
Just FYI if you're on a PvP server, in vanilla you couldn't have a character on both factions on the same server. If you rolled horde you were stuck horde for all your characters on that account.
---
I'm not 100% sure but I believe PvE servers didn't have this limitation. I know PvP servers (the only way to play!) did. No clue if this will hold true with the re-release of classic, but if they are being completely authentic, it will.
---
Hi,
---
I need some help deciding between Warrior (DPS), Rogue and Mage.
---
I am interested in pvp, especially word pvp, but i also would like to experience every raid and possibly clear them.
---
----
---
**Regarding leveling:**
---
I will most likely start with a group of friends, but a lot of them are not committed as i am. Which means:
---
* They are not interested in min-maxing.
---
* Everybody will most likey choose the class they want. 
---
* I will have more time to play than them.
---
* They maybe even stop playing after a few weeks or months. 
---
If i end up solo leveling in the higher levels i am not too worried about the fact that Warriors and Rogues have a harder time solo leveling. I am wondering more about what should i do with my time when my friends can't play but i can?! Should i already start a second character, just doing professions or maybe farming gold? 
---
**Regarding lvl60 content:**
---
I am normally a pretty competitive person, but i don't have much time these days (only around 20-25hrs/week), so i won't push for rank 14 or anything too hardcore. But i still would like to win most of my encounters and be a threat in group pvp. Which of these three classes would be best suited for this? And what about the other two classes?
---
At the moment i am considering to just play with two characters. But after researching this seems to be just a waste of time?!
---
Anyways it would be nice to have some answers to all these questions considering each of the three classes (warrior, rogue, mage).
---
Also if you think that another class would fit better for me please feel free to explain me why.
---
The thrill of adventure. I haven’t played since cata ended but vanilla was so focused on the journey and not just the end game. It seems like now WOW is all about raiding with the leveling aspect just a necessary annoyance in order to get there. I miss being fully immersed in areas such as Westfall, STV, and the Wetlands. The journey and sense of adventure is what I want. 
---
If you feel like healing could be a nuisance, it really will be. You gotta have the calling for it, otherwise it just gets more and more annoying, and will start to bother you in a bad way. so reconsider before choosing a healing class. 
---
omg, incredible, the whole story of the guy hired by blizzard...
---
Why the rollback?  Was he unkillable or something?
---
Well to be honest i wouls not recommend classic wow as a game for you because chores are a vital part of the essence of the game. There's probably less tedious video games or mmo out there that would better suits your desires.
---
I don’t really have any set goals. I’ll be playing with my wife so I guess my goal is to just enjoy the game with her. To be honest I don’t even know if we’ll make it to 60. I like to think we will, but considering how busy life is these days it might not happen, or at least not for 6+ months. Considering this game is coming out in the summer (winters where I live are cold and long, so I spend as much time as I can outside in the summer) and that we’ll be out of the country for a month in the fall, we certainly won’t be rushing things. We both really loved the leveling experience in WoW, so that’s ok by us. If we get a chance to experience end game content that will be an added bonus.
---
Find a priest friend Asap, they'll make life so much easier for you in Pve and PvP. Like you say, Soloing at lvs 33+ are going to be brutal unless you're the one getting the jump on the enemy.
---
Tanaris. You just got your mount and are ready to venture into the desert. Plus, a great instance close to the main city and tons of good quests to do.
---
I don't think you understand or respect the mindset of the no-changes team.
---
Especially since you want us to leave your post alone so you only get people who will validate it for you.
---
&gt;But how do you survive out in the open on a pvp server?
---
You don't. You get countered by pretty much every class. Bring consumes/engi and you can level the playing field, but will still lose 1v1s to other players that bring the same. Warrior is arguably OP in vanilla, but one of their weaknesses is 1v1 pvp where they are the worst class. 
---
This is where he comes out of left field in June with a classic trailer
---
I would say, probably, to be the equal, of the, maybe dustwallow marsh, because from there to go its equal outland maybe, for levels to be 9-22, boom fast.
---
ONLY PEOPLE WHO AGREE CAN REPLY
---
lol
---
That fucking Hydra island man.
---
Yep, then you're right. I didn't find it repetitive, although there might be times where you would do bear form - hit - heal - bear form - hit - heal stuff for tougher situations :)
---
Upvote for effort. I would be more inclined to join a community if there were players actively looking to ThinkTank some things. Fed Ex routes / exp break downs, mats farm guides, etc- 
---
I think finding a group of players is much easier to do nowadays, but finding some dedicating players to theorycraft (and reliable) is much harder.
---
Yeah it shouldn't be a race. That's not why you go back. You go back to for a fresh start and enjoy the economy. But not to rush through it, oh lord no.
---
At least not live.  I'll watch a video of someone taking down a raid boss so I can get an idea of the fight, but the idea of just watching someone running around in the game seems completely pointless.
---
Play an MMORPG that good and not essentially single player
---
different people different goals
---
I played on the current most popular private server. I can tell you beyond the shadow of any doubt that +x fire/frost/healing/nature/shadow drops far too often. It simply was not this way in retail vanilla. Especially at lower levels. 
---
I dont want to become sensory blind though, I gotta connect with my character. Connecting with a tauren is hard...
---
Yep, shadow priests have INSANE mana issues. :/
---
Just because I have a fascination with seeing who hits 60 first doesn't mean I can't enjoy the game for what it is :p
---
Private server 
---
A 20 second death run is not the same thing as waiting a month for an item to drop again.
---
As someone who didn't spend much time in Kalimdor post-cataclysm, I gotta say that some of the updates and changes to the world are visually appealing.  The problem is that new players from cataclysm on didn't get to experience the world as it was before.  But if you had already played through all the content a few times, then the change of scenery is pretty cool and welcome.
---
The dustwallow marsh revamp is terrible. Dustwallow marsh was this inhospitable, dangerous, lost land outside of nowhere. There was the mage quest where you had to find the hermit Tabetha which, for its level, was a dangerous trip and it took some time to find her.
---
With the revamp you still quest with that hermit. Who now conveniently lives right next to a fucking highway and even runs a shop or something.
---
They completely changed a zone which was awesome for it's exploration aspect into a disneyworld attraction.
---
I like change... but... obviously I don't want what we have now, otherwise I'd still be playing. 
---
That being said.. I'm interested in hearing the other POV. 
---
Its true. Osrs started off with the “no changes” mindset after about 1 yr they slowly added QOL updates and then after a bit longer they added bigger and bigger updates that still gave osrs “feel”. 
---
&gt;start a fight with anyone I see
---
You and I are spirit brothers. I would do this in a heartbeat. I was never a pacifist and played vanilla mostly for the PvP (World/BG/etc, this was pre-arena... people actually went to the Arena in STV and fought over the chest). I have played just like you describe, balls-to-the-wall unabashed aggression, lashing out at that ?? enemy in my level 20 zone, damn the odds. 
---
I'll never forget that time I solo attacked and killed an ambushing level 41 Troll Rogue as a 32 Protection Warrior in the Yeti Cave. I would love to have those moments all over again.
---
No regrets!
---
Especially easy if you take tailoring.  Make your own giant shard bag, extra bags for your bank, and some decent gear along the way.
---
What about a radical idea? When there is no more content, you stop playing? :)
---
It does come off like that after reading that point, that was not my intention so I've edited that part. Apologies for coming off like that.
---
Vast majority get a game they like.
---
Hardcore players lament some parts of the game yet still enjoy the rest, and hope for constructive feedback to change the parts they don't like. 
---
Toxic elitist vocal minority whine on an internet forum yet continue subscribing.
---
Everquest took this kind of approach tho and its doing fine, it’s too early to say anything, let’s see how the wow classic community will evolve
---
And don't forget, warlock drain tanking making leveling a breeze.  Absolutely no downtime when you play it right.
---
Option C is the easiest and most likely for blizz. I think most everyone outside of the hardcore #nochanges is open to the idea of option A, a la OSRS, but it would take a lot of work from blizz and only has even a slim chance if there's millions of players exclusively on classic. I think the most likely route is that blizz will try option C, and if they see the playerbase drop massively, they will abandon seasonal servers for new content.
---
I'm saying I've heard the arguments against it before. There is no point you can make other than your personal preference for the stance. It's an unrealistic stance and will hurt the game in the long run. Sticking your head in the sand and saying it will work is ridiculous. Anyone with any business experience will tell you that failure to diversify or expand leads to stagnation and falls in customer and clientele retention and gain. Why will not changes work for classic? Look at any server that has been on nax for more then 3 months and the population is always down by 40-60% and that's a consistent recurrence. 
---
About the stigma of druids and their only role being healer:
---
So far I've done half a dozen of low level instances plus lots of elite quests and I've tanked almost each and was a DPS once. Nobody ever wanted me to heal only, people always asked what I want or can do.
---
Of course things will change when raiding comes into play, but that is a tiny part of the game itself.
---
I also had zero difficulty holding aggro but was a bit squishy in deadmines due to the boss being higher level than me.
---
Then we could have just stuck to private servers and official classic becomes pointless.
---
Maybe being able to find my lost guild members once again from TBC days. I wasn't lucky enough to see anything beyond vael in bwl with my guild during vanilla, but once tbc hit i worked hard and got into the top horde guild for my server. I never imagined all the laughs which awaited me as we pushed for server first on horde side (sadly impervious shit all over everyone at the time.)  I had assumed going into one of the best guilds would be rough, and everyone super serious while constantly seeking your replacement on a single screw up but it was far from my misguided assumptions. We were all relatively laid back and relaxed and just dealt with the bs the game threw at us, but I was personally happy to constantly being able to do all the end game content.
---
So basically I hope to either meet my old guild members I've since lost touch with or find a guild which is as good as they were and just as relaxed around the difficulties of raiding.
---
Well, I do prefer the vanilla classes, talents, and overall design. There's a big dose of nostalgia I want to revisit. But my primary goal is just to experience an open-ended, social MMO again. 
---
All the modern MMOs I've tried are shiny themepark experiences with no depth, everyone in their own little bubble as they're carefully guided along a designated progression path. Classic WoW is a chance to play an entire genre that doesn't truly exist anymore.
---
Just realize that all classes have upside and downsides. 
---
My point exactly you can still have change but the point is to avoid becoming like retail and to retain the magic of classic.
---
If it is any consolation a ton of the the top streamers aren't actually very good at the game and I'm kinda interested to see how many actually make it through the grind without going back to BFA. On a completely fresh launch they might have to actually "get good". 
---
Big three for leveling fast, what classes? Rogue, mage, and what’s the third?
---
You level easy class like hunter, mage or lock to 60 first, farm up some gold, then roll a warrior and keep it equipped full blues + enchants.
---
I'm curious as to what the best professions are for druid (horde) for raiding? I tend to be self sustaining and try to target all the bis i can prior to mc/ony. I'd like to also hopefully make money with one of the two for mounts. Skinning / Leatherworking are my initial thoughts. Are the bis from leatherworking worth it over the world drops from dungeons / raids or how quickly will those pieces be replaced?
---
Pvp is on the brain but not a priority, which spec would be best for bgs without friends if I were to push for rank 14?
---
Very few people knew that it was one of the better places to attempt to farm Teebu's.
---
I'm really curious what everyone's mindset will be after 3 years when Naxx is on Farm like MC was in vanilla. 
---
I'm all about #nochanges, but #nochanges might #change and will be #changesafter3years
---
I would like to see some horizontal content or maybe even a re-make of BC, but give the classic server some time to progress.  I felt like AQ, Naxx, and BC were all released right on top of each other. 
---
Yes! I enjoyed that zone so much.
---
Leveling in classic I really enjoyed Duskood, Westfall, STV (was a rogue, pvp was a blast), Southshore/Arathi/Hinterlands area, and Western Plague Lands.
---
I wouldn't worry much about crafting professions contributing to your BiS. Word on the street is, nobody is going to use leatherworking because everyone is going skinning to vendor the leather for gold while leveling, only to drop it later. If this holds true leatherworking will be one of the least popular professions at 60. Take a look at the "Salt Shaker". I bet during certain parts of the release schedule a leatherworker could make a killing. 
---
I want to level a char and time it right so I’m in duskwood for a few days leading up to Halloween. 
---
Had the same thing happen while leveling in Hinterlands. Got into a fight with a warlock. Ended up getting deathcoiled and falling through a hill. Just sort of drifted (alive) underneath the surface heading generally eastwards towards the coast for a while. Got a roleplaying GM to help me after a few minutes and he transported me to Orgrimmar.
---
If played optimally, most classes at most points in the game can 1v1 warriors. But not everyone will play optimally, especially considering Classic will have a less hardcore population than private servers.
---
You can definitely still win 1v1s as a warrior. You're naturally pretty strong against rogues and warlocks. Paladins and mages are basically impossible but the rest can be situationally beaten. 
---
Warriors were a lot less faceroll in the days of stance-dancing, so skill can make a difference. 
---
Ye Argent Dawn eu
---
Where does it stop
---
Hunter is by far the fastest class for leveling. After that I would personally say druid and next probably mage.
---
Then new players that didn't log in within the first 20 minutes have to have a queue to join up in their server.  
---
I wouldn't be happy about downloading the game and then having to wait 12 hours to play with my friends and miss out on the big grind.
---
I see nothing wrong with sharding for the first few days in the low level zones then get rid of sharding, forever. 
---
People can say #nochanges, but when I rolled on a brand new server and it took 6 hours to get to level 5, it made me allow this #change

This is the route I'll be taking on my human rogue :)

There is little to no chance of either of your choices to happen because Blizzard has clearly stated that they don't want to maintain 2 mmo's.       
---
C is closest to what is most probable, diablo-esque seasons, whenever a new server launches the older ones get merged into a static "main" server.       
---
With only 4 progression states, that would be fairly easy to at least semi-automate and keep a small team of devs to keep check on it instead of a whole team of devs working on new content and bugfixes.         
---
And with recent news about Activision Blizzard telling their devs to try to not spend a lot of money unless it's necessary, i don't really see them "wasting" a whole dev-team on something uncertain.        
---
On a more personal note, if they do add content to classic, that's the day i quit the game.        
---
I'm here for something i know and like, not something i may or may not like.
---
Depends on success. If classic is successful classic TBC is the likely option. On brand new servers, possibly with the option to transfer or copy your classic char to the new TBC server. The classic servers stay put as they are, nobody would be forced to go. That gets you another few years to develop classic WoTLK and the same deal about transfer/copy. 
---
This will give them a solid 10 years without having to come up with anything new, just use the base of classic to develop the others. Allowing people to settle in the expansion they like best (I know many who loved TBC and will only come back for that) and otherwise change nothing. 
---
As far as your thought that classic has to change somehow, if you get bored or sick of raiding then you have options. You can leave for a while until you want to play again (Because it's not a shady pirate server your characters will be just how you left them as long as blizz runs the servers) or try another character class, or the other faction and start from scratch. 
---
Classic is not meant to be a game for you personally to play for the rest of your life. Some people will play just classic vanilla and never get bored, some will move on for whatever reason. But the game itself needs to be unchanged, so that someone starting 10 years from now gets the same (As much as we can make it) experience as someone who is there day 1. But seasonal servers will simply fracture the playerbase leaving dead servers in it's wake for those who just want to keep their same characters and not start over all the time. 
---
As opposed to dynamic respawns, guesstimated numers and mechanics, honor/bg's released on day 1, pickpocketing nerfs, changes to DM, etc. that exist on your 'true to vanilla' private servers?
---
How is it different? It pertains to economy and will happen in Classic
---
Not even gonna lie; that shit actually made me *excited*. I'd watch the *shit* out of that if it were a movie.
---
Definitely amazing work, whoever dunnit.
---
Also... I hate the idea of just making Bolvar "Lich King 2.0", but I really do miss the Scourge. Even if they joined forced with the Ebon Blade, and were just a neutral or "anti-hero" faction. That was, far and away, my favorite content.
---
Druids arent great at grinding but they have good movement speed: herbalism or mining is good choice early on.
---
If you want to be a tank, take enchanting once you can afford it to craft [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](http://classicdb.ch/?item=11811)
---
Engineering is best for both PvE and PvP.
---
I personally took herba+alchi for both moneymaking and owPvP at low levels. Mana potions can really extend your shelf-life.
---
I can't speak about leatherworking, apart from the fact that every leather dps wants devilsaurs.
---
Saw his T5 trailer in that thread. Wow.
---
What? Your matr gets the item and you claim it was a mistake and ask for it. This was done in the past.
---
And the token can be sold outside classic. You give me 20 devilsaur leathers and I give you a token on bfa which you can Rclick for 30days
---
Here let me save you the time of reading the comments in this sub.
---
"NOOO CHANGES REEEEE"
---
That kiting in Winterspring was so damn stressful! I loved it.
---
If I'm in game and want to watch something while I play, it is related to the game
---
I notice you forgot Option D: Releasing BC as it was and WotLK as it was. It's not the option I would prefer but it's still an option.
---
Just like Hekagigantes said.  Hunter, druid and mage are the fastest levelers.  In that order.  
---
Hunter, for obvious reasons.  Its super easy mode.  
---
Druid, you have absolutely no downtime and when you reach 40 and abuse the wolfs head helm and furor your DPS is broken until 60  
---
Mage for high damage and AoE farming.  AoE farming really gives you that edge in the last 10 levels especially
---
Rogues are not really that great in the leveling race.  They have the damage, but can struggle at multiple mobs and still have some down time issues.  Not on the level of a warrior but its still there and a decently large factor
---
Fuck Stitches
---
Man I really wish the devs would understand how casual friendly the classic style is. The leveling is so good. Leveling is just a means to an end on live.
---
Half the no change crowd will be on board with this too after actually playing classic. They cant even realize they have already accepted change.
---
Well you'll probably have already quit due to lack of content by the point change becomes necessary. However I do agree with most of the post I just see it as becoming like diablo 3 and losing what makes it alluring. If you lose your community every season and have to start over I can see it becoming like something you do for 2 or three months the quit for half a year. Coming back once every few seasons. If it is implemented it will need to be different from how they do D3 seasons where they make you do the same few objectives every seasons and give you the equivalent of a tier set.
---
Yes I did ;)
---
forsenHead LAST GAME GUYS forsenHead
---
A fair and valid point Ill add that to the post once I finish my clinical.
---
:) no worries man
---
Stonetalon or Ashenvale. First zones were the two faction collide (apart from gankers in Duskwood and Redridge)
---
Elwyn Forest, Teldrassil and Tirisfal both have amazing atmosphere.
---
Currently leveling a warrior (47). I make damn sure to stay ahead of quests and areas. I just got to Tanaris at 47. I didn't really touch STV until mid/late 30s. I made the mistake of heading to STV at level 32/33, which I thought was late enough...... I was ganked left and right and would eventually just log out. Not even rage quit, just log out calmly knowing that there was literally nothing I could do to avoid it.
---
This is probably obvious, but the best deterrent from would-be gankers is to make sure your a higher level than them. Not like that usually matters against a mage or hunter, but you'd be surprised how many people respect the level gap.
---
When you have double xp, just go out and grind some mobs 2-4 levels below you to use it up. If you have Whirlwind Axe / Bonebiter you'll tear through them and save content that you can revisit when you're a higher level. 
---
Get First Aid and level it quickly. At this point I don't even use food, just bandages. Much quicker health regen. 
---
I want to be an officer for sure, but not a GM or Raid Lead. I can manage my group, my class, my role, but not everyone.
---
I loved Loch Modan. The "Defense of the kings Lands" questline was epic. The feel and the scenery was great.
---
I love the hunter pulling
---
I just don’t buy this mindset. There are classic emulated servers for very early MMOs (see project 1999) that have been running for years and years. They have stable numbers and P99 is currently having tons of new players mostly due to streamers playing. 
---
Classic WoW servers will be fine without ever adding content. With 4 stages of classic content bring released and finishing with Naxx, nothing more is needed. Most will never see Naxx, just as they didn’t in 2006. 
---
Mining and skinning while leveling. Hold into some mats to level blacksmith to 300 once you hit 60
---
Yeah windwall is underutilized but a HUGE bonus whenever a hunter is opposite you.  Really powerful as a healy shaman in PVP too, negates hundreds of damage easily with a 30 yard friendly range. 
---
40 here.  My family has also been given notice.  They thought a few hours a week of video games was plenty.  
---
They are not prepared.
---
druids got thorns to take care of and rebuff in raids, as its not a long lasting buff. also got some regs to carry. also drinking.
---
we'll be playing 1.12 so paladins got 15 minute blessings buffs so it aint that bad. 
---
warriors need to rebuff shout all the time. which sucks.
---
rogues only care for themselfs, so if you forgot something - who cares. you need to carry poisons in you backpack and thistle tea. but overall its the most care free class i'd say. you have no responisbilities or shit other ppl depend on, so that you'd feel pressured you need to do shit. yes you apply poisons to your weapons but its fast and lasts for 30 minute buff, rather than that you have nothing.
---
so i'd say rogues overall.
---
Modern mmos which are even more shit than retail wow I'd rather not see those as things to look up to
---
Probably 2 or more people sharing the same character so they can keep it up 24/7
---
No?
---
Classic is Vanilla. The whole point is that you can play Vanilla. Private servers are not the original.
---
True. Webwood Venom is a bottleneck. BUT, the EASY 5,000+ xp from the follow-ups makes it worthwhile, IMO.
---
On an xp per hour basis, I think it still pulls ahead even if it takes 30 minutes to get the 10 venom, it's worthwhile.
---
Troll can be pretty sweet because of the buff to cast time.  Kind of like the hunter's rapid shot ability and you can pew pew lightning bolts like mad.  
---
Orc stun resist makes it probably best for PVP as the defensive bonus is better than the all-around bonus that war stomp gives IMO. 
---
Muuuuh!
---
Took a break from posting karma-whoring posts bashing on the current version of WoW?
---
Just stop, your post history is cringe. Trying too hard.
---
Yea but no one is going to want to play a dead server in 10 years. You say some people can play classic forever and be satisfied but server statistics show that its not a large number of players. Say you have 10000 players maybe 200-300 will continue after reaching Nax. 
---
The point in the second paragraph doesnt hold up as single server sustainability takes that into account. Again that's only 2-3 years of active investment as you can't realistically expect most people to get another class to 60. You can tell yourself you'll do it but I have a hard time believe even 2 out of 10 people who tell themsleves that will stick to it. I personally can only get 2 classes to level 60 before losing interest in leveling another. Not to mention getting to a point where both can raid. Telling people to reroll when they get bored isn't going to help the game and will just kill the player base that much faster.
---
Turning 34 in a month. GF thinks she's prepared, she is not. She think my little league of legends 2 hour sessions are going to be comparable to my wow playing..... She's in for a surprise. I can't wait to see her reaction when sure walks into my office and my desk is covered in empty, dented mountain dew amp cans, hot fries packaging, that red cheetoh dust everywhere, and stacks of hot pocket sleeves.
---
I can smell the disappointment from here.
---
I guess we'll see. 
---
HOLY COW! What an amazing trailer please hire this guy for the in game cines!!!
---
Love the old tier sets in the cart. Detail is on point 
---
I hope they do. It’s not fair allowing characters on each faction. Contributes to a lot of faction collusion
---
Alright fair. What if they open up more servers and release a list server names beforehand?
---
That’s why blizzard asks you twice if you’re sure you want to Need something. Not once. Twice.
---
Don’t need to add any further mechanics than what we have
---
Then after a couple of months, server's are going to be extremely low pop once the initial hype wears off and people are sick of leveling.
---
Then server mergers.
---
I want to dance on the top of the bank in Org.
---
To beat Princess Huhuran and finish AQ40.
---
That bitch killed my guild back in the day, I want revenge .
---
Also, naxx (only ever killed Instructor)
---
I'm curious, what's it like inside Grim Batol during the vanilla lore?
---
Did it even manage to kill Bolvar??
---
Joined! Looking forward to it
---
The appeal of classic to many is that it is a different game compared to retail. Trying to say  "if you want updates play retail" is disingenuous at best.
---
Its vanilla. Healer.
---
All a Paladin needs is pally power to make re-applying buffs a joke. The reagent costs for (symbol of kings??) Does add up though. If you are very generous with your 10min blessings you can end up spending a lot of gold. 
---
Thanks for your understanding and taking the time to reply.
---
thankyou
---
I’m exactly the same, except I don’t have two kids. Same wants and desires out of the game and play. I’ve even considered a Druid that may be able to do some light off tanking and be able to go pvp too, but I don’t want to get relegated into becoming a straight healer (same concern as paladin - the class fantasy that appeals to me the most). So I’m considering Pally, Warrior, or Druid and idk which!
---
&gt;  If you were to poll the majority of Vanilla players you’d see most of them used the loot trading service at least once.
---
LOL - if you believe this it honestly isn’t even worth discussing anymore. You have such a warped view of the facts it’s beyond reality. That is such an absurd claim to make.
---
I played vanilla, i know a ton of people who did, I played private servers, and I have literally never met a person who even *knew* about this happening. Everyone I’ve spoken to confirms this.
---
Its such an insignificant thing that blizzard just needs to say “no” and be done with it 
---
He has an enrage at around a minute I think and every time he kills someone he heals about 10% of his hp. Stormwind was fucked before he even arrived.
---
So we were able to trade soulbound items in Vanilla, but you want to make it so we can't trade soulbound items in Classic?  That right?
---
P99 has custom GM events and brand new seasonal content. It also is a completely different beast than wow as EQ is almost a sand box compared to wow.
---
From an XP stand point, there are a few zones I love:
---
Barrens- More than any other zone, loading up your quest log until it is bursting, grinding it out, then turning it all in feels amazing. You gain so many levels so fast.
---
Hinterlands- So many great quests then you finish with Jintha'Alor, you level incredibly fast and the zone has a great atmosphere.
---
Western Plaguelands- Not a fan of the atmosphere of the place, it is pretty depressing, but the XP from the cauldron chain will cheer you right up.  Each one of those quests gives an insane amount of XP, which is very welcome in your 50s.
---
Probably the same as in cata minus deathwing end of the world bs. Grim batol had long since been inhabited by the dragon maw orcs and it is where they had kept alexstaza enslaved to breed dragons for them to ride.
---
Race to 60 again with my best friend just like we did in vanilla. He both started later and beat me to 60 by about 6 hours.
---
I only started taking it seriously in the final stretch though.
---
I also have less free time now so I probably won't win but should be fun either way.
---
Now to decide.... Human or Gnome Warlock...
---
Not at all. There are thousands of games "different compared to retail". There is only one Vanilla World of Warcraft. Classic will be that.
---
How do people even do stuff like this? The CGI in the background and sky... the music. How do they make it? It would be fun to tinker around with something like this but my best guess is that you would need a super-powerful rig, some very expensive software, and a butt-fuck ton of time.
---
Kazzak heals for a ton of health when he kills someone and he's killing too many people to out damage the healing 
---
For me, everything after Vanilla felt like losing more and more of the original feeling of danger and mystery that were somehow present everywhere, in music, in quests texts or even in the combat sounds.
---
Over a certain number of enemy combatants, Kazzak spams his shadowbolt volley. It is like 800-1k damage and you cannot LoS the attack. 
---
Thats my point, though. You aren't a casual. You are a hardcore with obligations. Those aren't the same people. Casual is a mindset. I know casuals that play 13 hours a day. They just don't want a HC style of game. Classic wow is far more basic and, accessible to a much larger audience. It will be more popular for those reasons. At least in my opinion. 
---
Lots of thread already commented on this. Do a quick search my friend
---
Herb and Alch. Without health pots and without a buddy spot healing you then you will have a bad time. Alch also is a good gold maker later with flasks and arcanite cd.
---
There is only one classic wow, but people like classic because of how it felt and played. Saying adding new content regardless of it it preserves the integrity of the gameplay and atmosphere is automatically bad is again disingenuous. I'm not saying it would be easy to do but it can be done. Also no other game has world of warcraft in its title so that's a poor conflation.
---
Wow, as Protection no less. Like an angry ball of undergeared rage.
---
Comparison is the thief of happiness. Accept things as they are. Then, actively spend time to contemplate what would give your life purpose and meaning.
---
Good luck. Life is suffering, but it can be truly amazing. You get from it what you put back in it; not the other way around
---
Probably worth it, really depends on how Blizzard decide to launch. 
---
As a mage I will have trouble tagging mobs in a competitive fashion at that level.
---
Pirate servers are not a thing you should point to since they are not permanent at all. People leave for many reasons, the newest freshest trend is just the latest one. Why would you want to leave dead servers in your wake and perpetuate that by having seasonal ones? 
---
Changing the game just means that in a few years there will be another push for classic vanilla again since the game will no longer exist. It worked for OSRS, but that does not mean it will work again, and since everyone with a wow sub gets a vote your vision of a new wow using the vanilla mindset is a pipe dream. Retail players will want changes that make things easier, or more like retail and you will not have the votes to stop it. Now you are playing a watered down retail with less content, congrats vanilla is dead again.
---
I'm not someone who watches streamers but I am going to be trying to roll on a server they don't go to so hopefully they all stay on one server.
---
I did! I'm not playing it! Thanks for your concern!
---
I plan on getting leatherwork for some recipes early on. Like Warbear Harness as a Tanking chest and Living Pants/Shoulders for Healing and Devilsaur-Set for Cat.
---
And drop it later for Alchemy and Herb, since in the beginning there are not a lot of Potions for Healers.
---
Flask of Destilled Wisdom is rare and Mage Blood gets introduced during ZG Patch.
---
I don’t know what I need to be happy
---
I'll probably go herb / alch at the start until i can burn gold to get enchanting / engineering up
---
Taking my time, having fun, and not trying to do the rat race.
---
Last time, I was in the alpha, closed beta, open and then vanilla. Progression guild, usually 2nd or 3rd on the server. MC, Bwl, aq40, all that. It was fun. But too much. Too much time, too much stress (screw you Vael the guild breaker), just too much now that I'm older and got more going on.
---
I'll recreate my main maybe, but just take my time and enjoy the community, smell the roses, all that stuff.
---
Although I do plan to make the 2nd incarnation of my main look like an old man this time. So I can occasionally annoy people with stories of the old days, before video guides for every boss.
---
P99 has not had seasonal content for years. Occasionally a GM will drop by and turn players into Ogres. That’s the extent of a GM event. It is more of a sandbox but I’m just saying, the demand for classic servers for the biggest MMO has enough content already. 
---
Well, Blizzard promised Vanilla/Classic WoW. Not Vanilla+. Doesn't matter "what could be done". They should deliver Vanilla, how it was. It's a historic game. People should be able to play it.
---
If you want something else, ask Blizzard for that something else. *Separate* from Classic.
---
That was my intentions as well with skinning. Going by bliz's release schedule what lw pieces come out during it and how does it fair for bis if i'm not getting lucky in mc/ony? 
---
The AQ40 trailer is amazing too. Every wow player I know, I've sent them this one
---
TBC.
---
Lockpicking and maybe leveling up cooking to make thistle tea is the only time consuming thing there. You make enough poison while leveling that you should he able to easily keep up with new ranks.
---
Are you really implying that post nax population drops are a unique trend to private servers. I think that's very optimistic. I think your falsely associating classic with the content available rather than gameplay, professions, and atmosphere.
---
Absolutely deserved! I want more of this dudes content already!
---
“We” = a select few, minority of cases where GMs intervenes
---
Blizz clearly does not want to pay for big GM support for classic and essentially said as much.
---
if Blizz is hamstringed as they say they are, then there are really only two options that allow for zero GM intervention in loot issues 1) introduce this new loot system that’s from Cata/Wotlk or 2) don’t allow any sort of loot trading
---
In any case we’re not getting true Classic.  And Clearly, everyone wants #2
---
That seems to be the same line of thinking some of the other posters have said. Sounds like I've got enough info to plan ahead, thanks.
---
Because i was in my 20s playing vanilla, I am not looking back with the rose colored glasses. Managed to make r12 in pvp and get 3 down in Naxx and to Cthun in AQ40.
---
I say all that because what I can't wait for is actually having a sense of accomplishment. Being apart of the top horde Pvp guild and high end raiding at the same tine was so awesome. 
---
The grind was real and hard and tedious no matter if you went pvp or pve. People are forgetting that even get riding and epic mounts were a legit accomplishment. And i for one can't wait for that misery. Ready for needing a group to get to the high end enchanting trainer? Yup. Cant solo most high end and group content? Yup. Horrid rep and gear grinds? Yup.
---
Sign me up. It feels so good hitting a goal that you actually have to spend time or actually be good to get.
---
But preserving the gameplay is preserving classic, again the content available isnt what makes classic classic. There is  a reason classic ended with tbc and not patch 1.4. It's because it changed gameplay so drastically and altered the  feel of the game reducing the value of professions and making world pvp nearly completely avoidable.
---
No, I am pointing out that the nonpermanence of pirate servers leads people to be less invested in their characters and more apt to go to the new shiny. You have a certain subset of the population who will play classic playing on these servers and that is not representative of the group that will play classic.
---
Which mob? What makes this place better than others?
---
Seen this happen with my very own eyes and I am quite thankful for it.
---
I know my guild used GMs whenever there was a lot issue, so from my perspective, I am not sure that you actually have any data when it comes to a "minority of cases."  It really sounds like you are just saying that to make it seem like you are right.
---
And obviously not everyone wants 2, you are projecting. Plenty of people, like me for instance, are fine with the loot trading when Master Loot is used or everyone rolls greed.  You are not everyone.
---
No matter what class you play you're gonna feel like you're only continuing to play for the people. That's how the game hooks you. Yes warlocks need to farm shards but you're gonna need to spend every waking moment farming consumables for your raids anyway if you want to clear AQ+Naxx regardless of what class you pick.
---
The Barrens, its flows over so well back and forth Stonetalon, Thousand Needles and TB/ORG, not to mention it has two dungeons. *Two*. What other non-endgame zone has that?
---
Wow, really? You’re the first person I’ve talked to who was there for this. How insane was it?
---
blessings aren't even bad with the version we are most likely getting.  5minute single target is the worst shit in the game but greater ones makes them paladins the least chore heavy class in the game considering healers have the least consumable burden as well and a geared paladin laughs in the face of mana
---
No, the gameplay is not what makes Classic. Everything makes it. The content, the gameplay, the graphics, etc. Vanilla was everything between 1.1 and 1.12. Blizzard is bringing that back as best as they can. They only have the 1.12 data so that limits things substantially. But they are still bringing back Vanilla and not just the "gameplay".
---
(You can nitpick that they are not re-releasing the 1.12 client unchanged but that would be that, nitpicking. I don't think I can clarify things more clearly, so I'll stop here. :)
---
That's epic :D I hope we can do stuff like that soon!
---
My main is a druid in retail and honestly, I don't think its for me in classic. There are too many inconveniences that I just can't live with, most of all though feeling like a half baked warrior, priest or rogue. 
---
Look up Jordan Peterson’s 12 Rules for life, it will help I promise. He knows what he is talking about because he is a clinical psychologist of 30+ years
---
Is it efficient to kill mobs within two levels as you explore and gain levels?  So like you could be regenerating health and mana while you are running to the next flight point.
---
&gt; hell maybe even change abilities and how they work allowing more diverse gear set ups 
---
What? This came out of nowhere. 
---
&gt;  Wrath and BC added as new 50-60 content 
---
Holy disconnect...
---
Idk maybe it can run a 40m with graphics all the way up and 120fps, that could be dope
---
Dots aren't even worth casting if you're in full bis you have so much crit rating it's better to just spam shadowbolt since dots can't crit in vanilla. Warlock is the best dps in the game in full bis. However you could be the best warlock in the world and if your tank is shit you won't be doing any damage because your damage is entirely bottlenecked by tank threat. Hunters and rogue can do a full threat drop you have none. This is why rogue is the best dps in MC before your tanks get thunderfury and why hunters are strong in MC. Basically you just spam shadowbolt and prey the fight goes longer bc unlike other classes your damage actually scales linearly and the longer the fight the more your dps will stick out compared to the mage who is popping arcane power at the start and blowing their load in the first minute. This is the only real differences between dps classes. Everything else is very minor. Regardless of what class you play your gameplay will revolve around mindlessly spamming a two button rotation. Vanilla class balance is better than you think just it doesn't accurately reflect on the damage meters (damage meters aren't everything and playing vanilla has taught me this lesson better than any current expansion)
---
Time zone and PVP server fit me perfectly. I’m so down for this!
---
I don't think mage is that bad. The only time where it might be "chore-ish" is during the raids, but honestly just open up youtube on phone or something and spam conjure. Not that big of a "chore".  
---
Farm pummelers and practice power shifting. I hope to see plenty of competent kitties in my raids
---
I think it's just because the mobs are level 60 and elite. 
---
This isn't a pacifist run for the sake of pacifism. It's just assuming that there'll be a lack of shit to kill, so ignore killing.
---
I'll 100% be killing anything I come across along the way, but I've just built a route that will guarantee level 10 in about 3.5 hours. With rando kills it might get me to level 12 in 4 hours. win win.
---
Mithril Shield spikes and spamming Shield Block was a thing in vanilla. He basically killed himself, with the occasional stance switch to overpower.
---
What's stopping you? 
---
It's not a personal preference.  It's not unrealistic.
---
It's a group of people who have played WoW in Classic and played WoW today and seen what changes have done to the game.
---
The entire reason Classic is being re-released is because of the number of players that have been LOST by changes.  Any consumer will tell you that changes made just for the sake of innovation are usually bad and gimmicky.  Do you know how many TV shows I quit because they changed the formula or changed the message?  Do you know how many game franchises have tanked because of changes that have been made?  Now look at Counter Strike.
---
Now, do you know why Classic is being made?  It's being made as a snapshot in time of the Vanilla game.  So that players who came in after Cataclysm can even see the content, and so that players who were already playing before can revisit that content.  If you start adding all of what you want to do to the game, then it no longer is in that historical state.
---
The funny thing is you want to add expansions to the game but make less changes than making the full expansion (i.e. remove flying mounts, keep the level cap at 60).  So you're actually advocating a less changes version than the people who simply want TBC and WotLK servers.
---
In Cata isn't it almost entirely Twilight forces? I think in vanilla all the Dragonmaw are dead or fled so it would just be red dragons in there.
---
For me its more about sending a statement not only to AcitiBlizz but the game industry about what kind of games I want to play. Fuck the mess that retail has become.
---
I expect my PC to be thoroughly bored throughout Classic. 
---
Despite what any of you think, 99% of people reading this will never step foot in Naxx, let alone farm it.
---
This sort of mindset of "give more stuff" "give more QoL" "give more expansions" is exactly what lead to this situation.
---
Blizzard has already said that if it's even just a few people playing, they're going to keep Classic alive for posterity.
---
I sincerely hope you people won't kill Vanilla a second time.
---
Honestly I spent my 30-40 levels in SM. I was the tank, groups were easy to find and I would run as many in a row as I could. I avoided STV like the plague. After 40 things seem to get a bit easier. I did quests that were mostly green to me. For instance, Tanaris at mid 40s is a bit harder to get ganked when you're 45-46 and they are 41.
---
TBH, it will depend on what you want to get out of your professions? Do you want the profession for income or end-game fantasy? You could be the master axesmith, swordsmith, etc. on the server. Maybe you want to go for smaller margins with potions and elixirs with alchemy to make $? Or perhaps you want to gather while out killing horde?
---
I'd recommend deciding what you want to get out of it and committing to that.
---
In 3 years, 99% of people reading this will never have set foot in Naxx.
---
If i level regulary, i grind 14-60 except class/dungeon quests.
---
level 60 characters for tbc servers
---
So 2/3rds of the raids in vanilla don't count? Where I come from, that's the majority
---
I will second this. Jordan knows what he's talking about and is very charismatic and passionate. If you are skeptical just watch some youtube of him talking about depression, purpose, responsibility, etc.
---
ok, I was curious if there was a draw back.  Cause it does help in a few ways to stay busy with random kills with in range while you travel. thanks for the heads up.
---
Thanks! After reading a bit I ended up finding about that too. But I never saw the dragon there on official realms. 
---
Yet the winner has never been that so far, weirdly enough.
---
I didn't say they didn't count and if that's all your wanting to raid then you can get by with nearly any spec, I just don't want people rolling a class that they are going to invest months in then expect to be welcomed into raiding with open arms. 
---
I'd be happy with a 3 year down the line change to adding BC, or some other content. Really my only wish is for enhancement shaman to get BC talents. Wanting to relive my favorite class and spec.
---
Tirisfal, undead starting zones captured the tragedy of Forsaken and plague of undead extremely well, IMO cataclysm can't even lick it's feet in terms of climate captured.
---
Mulgore also has that 'vastness' feeling that is missing on retail.
---
STV, i love the jungle and pirate theme, also love booty bay and the gurubashi arena. And lets not forget the PVP :)  
---
Love the music too: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6G33wEb34E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6G33wEb34E)
---
When the Vanilla Map doesn't have any zones you can blatantly hover over and nothing is there.
---
&gt; Plenty of people, like me for instance, are fine with the loot trading when Master Loot is used or everyone rolls greed. 
---
I would certainly take those options over the current form.
---
My first choice would be zero trading at all, second choice would be the way you describe above.
---
But the current form is the wotlk/cata trading system, allowing trading of Needed BoPs and that opens things up to far more abuse. This is the worst solution and the one that Blizz has already coded into the game
---
Not your first taste if you leveled up in Hillsbrad Foothills :D 
---
I'm well aware of this, and why I feel no Vanilla+ content should be added for a couple or few years.
---
The game needs to play out as it was first before anything fancy can be added, which essentially just adds horizontal content to the game when WoWClassic is years old.
---
Well you are wrong. People don’t quit because of lack of content, I have been playing vanilla realms  constantly since beta. Yes some of that time was on private realms it I have not quit due to no new content, in fact I have restarted maybe thirty times due to realms closing. MAYBE some portion of the community demands new content, but my guess is only1% of them will even last until naxx let alone clear it
---
Naxx is NEVER going to be on farm by more than maybe 5% of players. So you are asking for additional content that almost nobody wants. 
---
And if you do get naxx on farm you still have other objectives such as playing another class or grinding pvp tank
---
I have been playing vanilla since beta. I have tried tbc but just don’t enjoy it. I am not alone either, and what you are proposing is a kick in the tears to the thousands of players that have been asking for a return to vanilla for over a decade
---
It has 3 dungeons actually, WC, RFK, RFD :)
---
You're going to have plenty of people backpedaling away from you in Classic servers. This ain't no pserver, and even they are full of noobs.
---
That being said, many people stick to the "standard" zones and routes. You can easily go to less populated areas, less visited zones like Silverpine Forest for Horde, and even pick up some dungeon quests.
---
I know you're asking about solo warrior, but many warriors will level in groups of 2, usually with a pocket healer.
---
I mean who wouldn't?  
---
Kara was supposed to be in vanilla. Even if we didn't know that, its obviously in vanilla zones and has nothing to do with TBC.  
---
Who wouldn't want Kara but vanilla version?   
---
Couple of spergs I would bet but yea, I beckon most would love it.  
---
This completely 
---
Finally i can be one of those people who put on ultra graphics and get smooth framerates :D 
---
If you don't want to be poor, mining + skinning or herbalism + skinning, then dropping one of the gathering professions later on for your choice of engineering, blacksmithing, alchemy, or even two of them if  you're rich.
---
Many keep one or even two gathering professions for a long time after hitting 60.
---
Sure, if you exclude the 2 big vanilla projects, the lower pop instant-60 one, both TBC projects that recently launched (and that also host WOTLK projects), the P2W remnants of Molten that fake pop and the hungarian MOP project. Again, the owners are hungarian and the main server is in hungarian but it's hosted in France like every other pserver.
---
OVH also hosts stuff like wikileaks and [were sued for 188 millions in US court](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/60nu4w/ovh_has_a_very_good_track_record_on_defending/) for hosting websites that illegally provided copyrighted content. They won the case.
---
GJ proving your ignorance.
---
That's true. Good call :p
---
We can only hope!!
---
&gt; Most of them already are.
---
Again, like I've told you already, every single major private server is hosted in France. Do actual research before you spout off random bullshit after you've read a wikipedia article.
---
Not that I'm aware of. There are some class specific discord channels however. For example here is the mage [discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/PGUh2Hq).
---
Yay me too! But if I want a truly no changes experience I will have to play with everything on low and a very low sight distance. Hmmmm
---
I loved when i played enhancement in vanilla and you popped all your cooldowns, your racial and trinkets but then windfury didnt proc :D You feel like a chihuahua who barks like crazy but can barely bite 
---
I actually saw it drop once when I was leveling a toon doing random dungeons. Dude that won it had no idea what he had gotten lol
---
My kt xbow back, haven’t felt whole since I lost it.
---
Nothing stopping a group from swapping to masterloot before a boss dies. The fact this is an issue just goes to show how little we have to talk about.
---
a diverse community again... the nostalgic feeling of playing late into the night when everyone else in the house is asleep, all the lights are off, and I am just strolling through the barrens or tirisfal glades with my headphones turned all the way up. 
---
That's a very flawed view point. If any thing its the type of content but since you ended hte conversation there doing exactly what I said many nochange people would do. Argue their point and then ignore the point I or any other person with an ounce of foresight make, and then they proceed to stick their head in the sand. Classic is the game and the content exactly as it was, by that logic one could say classic ended with 1.7 because battlegrounds ruined the game, you critiera is just as arbitrary as that except you go with the official end date that blizzard provided rather than actually looking to see what changed. 
---
Your analysis is skin deep. I don't think you have an actual grasp on what made classic so endearing. The foundation for your justification falls simply to "i liked classic as I remembered it, I can't point out why but blizzard said this period was classic so that's what I'll go with." When you get your head out the sand and actually want to discuss why no change will work for this when it never worked for any other server I'll be here.
---
Hide of the Wild with DM patch that is BiS for all healing classes into (I think) AQ. Needs 3 Cured Rugged Hides which has a cooldown through Salt Shaker. After that Naxx gear requires Curred Rugged Hides to make. 
---
Sure that could account for some of it. But let me ask you this and you can look at server populations yourself. Why is there no steady decline in server pop, why is it always a gigantic population drop right after nax. Surely you see the correlation? There is no way that every suddenly goes "Welp they hit nax my character doesnt matter anymore even though some of these servers have lasted longer than actual classic."
---
I have stopped playing BFA... instead I have gone back to my roots of exploration and leveling. I can honestly say it has been the most fun I have had on wow in at least 2 years. I am not in any guild at max. I simply make new toons and races I havent tried or havent tried in a while and just explore. I talk to people here and there. But overall I just zone out leveling. 
---
I feel personally attacked by this meme (bought a PC for Classic WoW on a Black Friday sale, got it for a great deal tho). 
---
on the bright side you can gank tipsout and watch him cry afterwards
---
**Early zones:** Teldrasill, Dun Morogh, Darkshore, and Duskwood are probably the most ambient zones in the entire game. The music, quests, and atmosphere are all logical and true to their design. 
---
Imo the game *slightly* decreases in ambient / quest quality after this point, but still remains pretty good. There are a few areas that stand out to me.
---
**Mid Level Zones:** Shimmering Flats, Desolace, and to a less extent, STV. I do almost all of STV, but it just doesn't speak to me even though I think they did a good job on it. My friend swears by it though. I haven't done Ferelas or the Hinterlands while leveling so I can't speak for them, they might be really good, I just don't know.
---
**High Level Zones:** I absolutely love Western Plaguelands—maybe one of my favorite areas. Winterspring and Blasted Lands are pretty cool for me too. It's been a long time since I've done Un'Goro, but the idea always seemed a lot cooler than it actually was.
---
But, will you be..... very happy?
---
Is the Elemental/Resto PVP spec viable to heal end-game PVE? Or do Shamans have to respec each time they want to switch it up?
---
Vanilla is the greatest game ever made, modern blizzard devs aren’t good enough to be coffee delivery interns at old blizz.
---
Lol, you sure you want to play? Seems like you just want to watch a movie.
---
The biggest thing you can do is be higher level. This is recommended anyways as a warrior. I'd add an extra zone for each bracket and pretty much just do quests when mobs are 1-2 levels below you or more. If you maintain this, most players will be a few levels below you as well. A good players can probably still kill you, but baddies should be kill able. 
---
Additionally if you level arms and have a decent weapon you aren't entirely helpless once you have Mortal Strike and Intercept. 
---
Ele shaman is the "fuck up peoples plan" class in pvp :D 
---
You want to cast? Nope, earthshock  
---
You want a spell to land on me? Nope, grounding totem  
---
You want to fear / seduce me? Nope, tremor totem  
---
You want to poison / blind me? Nope, poison cleansing totem  
---
You want to afflict me with diseases? Nope, disease removal  
---
You want to catch me? Nope, earthbind + frostshock  
---
You want to run away? Nope, earthbind + frostshock  
---
You want to kill me? Nope, heals  
---
You want to buff your self? Nope, purge  
---
You want to shield your self? Nope, purge  
---
You think you faster than me? Nope, wolf form (unless you druid)  
---
Oh and btw, even tho im a caster, windfury still hits pretty damn hard when it procs
---
You don’t have to rush hard, it’s going to take 2-3 months for the good guilds to be obvious.
---
The corrupted blood incident was pretty epic too.
---
WTF is paper.
---
WTF is a store? Amazon?
---
Warrior, you have battle shout and that's literally it, if you're DPSing or tanking in a dungeon the only thing you have to worry about and the only thing people will ask you for, is battle shout.
---
I felt like a god in the 2 months I had KT xbow, before tbc ruined wow.
---
It was the best gaming experience I’ve ever had and I’ve been gaming since NES was new. I need my xbow back and soon I’ll get her back.
---
\*airhorns\*
---
I agree. I think this is the best Zone in wow. There are so many quests. Great WPVP, a huge range of player levels. A great raid attached in ZG, pirates, a huge quest chain killing cool beasts. Arena battles, fishing competitions... It really has it all. 
---
are you implying you cant add content without change the formula? Why did first 12 content patches work then? It is unrealistic saying that populations wont drop post nax is straight up lying there are dozens of examples of successful servers that died in population right after nax dropped because there was nothing to work towards aside from twinks and alts at that point. Also you cant honestly think every person who played og classic and wants classic is a no change crowd. I and plenty of my old guild mates want more classic content you cant just assume that if they want more content that "they didnt really play classic" or "they arent a real vanilla wow fan they are just cata fan boys!" Also this isnt a discussion about tbc or wrath server so at that point your just changing the topic. As i said in the original post explain why population wont drop and why no change is ultimately the best solution in the long term. Don't just say "It will only work like that" you need to explain.
---
Whoever you get to lvl 60 first will be your main for years. I saw a few rerolls in my guild but it was very rare and often someone with influence in guild.
---
if you invite your friends too you won't be playing alone like I had to most of the years i played WoW.  I do hope you make plenty of friends in the group once classic launches.
---
We won't. Classic will operate on 1.12 version of the game so stuff like this will be fixed already.
---
My wife just lost her shit when she saw this. It's her favorite two worlds colliding.
---
Is late game BS that profitable? What do u sell?
---
I will raid but wont be cutting edge and dont know if I will have the recipies for it to be worthwhile 
---
The guy is asking a legitimate question, stop exagerating and lying. Either you are the most pessimistic guy who only see the bad time of PVP without noticing the good times, or you are the most unlucky person in the world.
---
Thank you.
---
This small exchange should be enshrined in the sidebar and quoted every single time another annoying sharding thread pops up.
---
Hint: it would
---
Considering all it takes to get into nax is mat grinding and bwl runs its not that hard to set foot in it. Raids today are much harder.  Nax is almost 14 years old now do you really think people are going to have as hard of a time building up to that as they did back then?
---
No, he said they contacted him but nothing ever came of it.
---
I swear this sub will believe anything...
---
Ahh I thought they still did seasonal shit my bad, but a sandbox with actual progression and build diversity has much longer sustainability than a theme park with 4-5 end game that play out the same every time.
---
&gt;Surprisingly there was more people excited to try the game that never got to play it replying to my poll than those excited to return to it.
---
I mean, that makes sense. Vanilla WoW peaked at around [8ish million subscribers](https://kotaku.com/why-world-of-warcraft-lost-so-many-subscribers-1702814469) back in 2006/07, right when TBC was released. While that is still a massive amount of players (considering the time and the fact that it was a $14 a month game), there's A LOT of people that didn't get to experience it back then for a variety of reasons. 
---
Now, I can't speak for those that've played on pservers, but I imagine (could be wrong) the the amount of people who have never played vanilla WoW but are interested in playing it have never played Vanilla WoW be it when it was the retail version or even on PServers. 
---
To actually answer your question (as someone who played Vanilla) I'm hoping to achieve what I couldn't achieve in game (so, same class, race and faction). Get past Princess H in AQ40, get into Nax, kill more world bosses than just Kazzak and 2 of the dragons (forget which ones we did), and pay for my own Epic Mount. 
---
I also hope this is a great bonding experience for myself and my wife, I think she'll really like the game once she gets a feel for it. I've also invited some RL friends to play and I'm thinking of starting a guild (have a constitution I'm working on for it, may post it once it gets a little closer to release date if I'm feeling ambitious enough to actually start a guild). 
---
Finally, in addition to those things, I want to connect with people like I did back then. Even though I never met them in person, some of my fondest memories come from raiding with my guild mates, first time downing a boss and just shooting the breeze with them, running dungeons with them on non-raid nights. I want to experience that again, and I really hope I get to. 
---
Then go hotw. Your speed would be absolutely awful at healing. I would recommend 0/30/21 or 1/29/21. These specs can do literally everything at a passable level. Not optimal, but viable. Your speed will not let you heal in any raid, and honestly I wouldn't even heal a five man with it. It's pretty feral DPS / tanking. And frankly, when then, I wouldn't take 5/5 into improving armor bonus.
---
You don't even need the extra armor raiding. Think hide is misleading. You get like 90% of the armor bonus just getting in dire bear form. Think hide does very little in reality
---
yea alot of people who watched the surfuras 1shot shaman are gunna be really upset when they realize that by 1.12 dual wield was the go to due to WFW nerfs.
---
First its completely true. Secondly I was defending this person by implying that it actually was a mistake and she didn't ninja it on purpose. Third, cry me a river.
---
&gt; I played private servers, and I have literally never met a person who even knew about this happening.
---
The Nost devs admitted that a full 1/4th of all GM tickets were about loot trading. That’s 25% of all in-game tickets.
---
If you played on Nost and didn't know about this then you were in a tiny, tiny bubble and you were not representative of the majority of players.
---
Which is why all of the arguments in this thread against loot trading because of *memories* or “personal experience” are just Feels over Reals, anecdotal nonsense.
---
I say no loot trading and no tickets. If your ML can’t do it right get a new one.
---
That doesn't solve the dilemma of  finite content tho, you're eventually going to run into the same issue (people are done w/ content) when TBC has been out for so long, or wrath, or any expansion. 
---
Sounds like the rogue slapped you silly. There are a few reasons I commonly hear for similar situations: maybe you had some lag? Or maybe your keyboard spazzed out? Perhaps he is just a no-lifer who plays all day and you are secretly very cool?
---
:) 
---
It happens buddy. Keeps it interesting!
---
In Cata, I "RPed" as a Goblin Rogue. But by RP, I mean I just read all of the quest text and gave my character motivation for doing all the things he was doing. It was one of the more fun experiences I've had with the game. Way better than just mindlessly clicking Accept to level as fast as possible, but since everything is so focused on endgame, that feels like the only efficient way to play.
---
This gives me chills to my bones! It also perfectly highlights a critical issue that MOST of us have had with current WoW. The big up. The jailbreak quest line build up and progression to the Onyxia reveal in the throne room was one of the most insane moments of my life. 
---
The constant battle of the argent dawn vs the undead starts early in WoW, escalates in the scarlet monastery, and fully explodes in the plaugelands and accompanying dungeons. It dwindles as you battle BlackRock Spire and fight the forces of molten core and blackwing lair. 
---
Then as we stood on a pillar of power BAM bugs! AQ hit the world, and we rush off to gain higher power. Then just as you have almost fully forgotten about the Undead struggles, NAX hits.
---
It was the peak of vanilla. Battlegrounds were fleshed out and active. Servers already had legends of their own among the players and guilds. Yet, floating there above the ground, Naxxramas loomed as an exciting omen. A taste of adventure. An adventure so hard that you KNEW you didn't stand a chance without a huge guild and the best armor from the other raids. 
---
Walking around Ironforge and seeing someone with T3 was a mouth gaping moment. The only other times that the mysteriousness of Naxxramas was achieved in other raids (although not to the same extent) was Karazan and Icecrown Citital. Since then the stakes have never felt so high. Perhaps the knowledge that we had overcome those monumental challenges had made equally large challenges feel less intense. I'm not sure. 
---
Boy ol Boy am I excited to get back into classic. 
---
You suffer until 60, then avoid solo WPVP at any cost by farming DM:E with a healer and buying everything u need from outside dungeons :)
---
&gt;And guess what, you are actually required to trade the old Ultimate Weapon to the NPC to actually upgrade it to get the +1 version. 
---
I think this is key. And as long as it's not exploited all the time to the extreme and with some creativity in it, it would be an extremely useful addition to WoW.
---
Or you get a failed attempt 😐
---
No lag.. I just whiffed and couldn't move with him and he ran backwards and around me like I was half asleep. Should I be moving differently??
---
Are crafted weapons any use anyway in 1.12.1? The first Char i ever made is my warrior who had Blacksmiting weapons specialisation. But i did feel like craftable weapons became kind of lackluster in the later patches. I reckon something like Nightfall still has a use, but are ppl still crafting stuff like arcanite reapers in servers that start at patch 1.12.1?
---
How would people from your own faction prevent you from tagging mobs?
---
My two friends and I used to play WoW in middle/high school, and we're going to be leveling and questing together. We got into Vanilla at different times, so we never really got to play together in-game before lvl 60.
---
This time around, we want to do it all together. As a group we have an ambition of going to every dungeon in the game, and more importantly – using WoW to spend time together again. We used to have LAN sleepovers and would spend all our free time playing. Now we have full-time jobs and other stuff going on, so we're hoping to recreate some of those great teenage years again!
---
Besides that, I have a bunch of different goals for myself, but it's more like a bucket list. I'll be happy just playing and questing, even if I have an ambition of rocking a full T2 set.
---
I believe I read somewhere that the guy was hired by blizzard.
---
He already works for blizzard.
---
The more I think about it the more I don't like the "seasonal approach" for WoW.
---
I've been playing Diablo III for a while now, and I do play when the new season comes out....but after a few weeks I put it down because I get bored of the repetitiveness of it all (rift rift rift grift grift grift, repeat....) but, I keep coming back because it's free, WoW isn't, and depending on how long the seasons would last I would have to go in and restart my sub and cancel it every couple of months, years, etc. and that honestly sounds like a bit of a pain. 
---
Let alone, theoretically, you can sort of do "seasons" now, just start a new character and see how fast you can get through content, do that w/ 40 other people when Classic is live (take that with a grain of salt, I know things like the Nax and AQ event's are things that could only be repeated w/ a "seasonal reset" but my point remains). 
---
Going back to my point about "repetitiveness" I made earlier, I know that WoW is, to an extent, repetitive to begin with. You run the same dungeons, raids and etc over and over again until you get the gear you want and then.....? You continue to play, at least I do, because the people you meet along the way (not saying WoW isn't a great game in and of itself), but finite content, seasonal or not can only last so long IMO. 
---
We'll see though, I guess it really depends on how popular the game is and what people want when the time comes.  
---
Yeah I understand what you’re saying. I have played on P99 for so long.. I’m very excited for classic wow servers and I suppose we will find out what happens when the time comes. 
---
Also I laugh every time someone mentions slow levelling in classic WoW. Compared to classic Everquest it’s still a breeze. 
---
I believe he posts a "making of" video for each of these videos on his youtube channel. It's more of a sped up video of the entire process, but still pretty cool to watch.
---
Honestly try to pretend your a Rogue, but without stealth.
---
If its attackable, stalk it. Wait it out until an ample opportunity. Offer no quarter: if they're good, you will lose if they initiate most likely. Take the point or just pray you two have a mutual understanding.
---
KEEP A SHIELD IN INVENTORY. When you sit to eat and whatnot, its common for a rogue or hunter to go nuts. Any amount of defense to get through stuns, slows, etc. in order to close a gap or retreat is that much more time you have to turn the tables. a Two Hander won't help while sapped. Armor value still applies.
---
Also even if you're solo that doesn't mean everyone else is. Extend a hand or group up in nasty areas like STV when you can/ Having a buddy to help and helping a buddy cam be the start of a great friendship... and less ganking.
---
Revenge time lol 
---
One more time: It doesn't matter what made Vanilla "endearing". I don't care. Also I haven't played the original. :)
---
What I want and what a lot of people want is Vanilla back. Not an "idea" not an "experience". You can't go back in time.
---
I want the *game*. Just like you can play the original Warcraft or Starcraft. It's what it is. With all its flaws. It's fine if you don't want that but let us have it.
---
Fortunately, Blizzard seems to understand it. Also, they'll not want to spend too much money on it. They'll not create a "new WoW". They'll bring back Vanilla (as I said, as best as they can). And *now* I'll stop. If you don't want to understand, then don't. Have fun either way!
---
I agree it will completely ruin the game. If they don't release TBC in 2 years I dread that they will introduce the WoW token and I will unsub.
---
Armorsmithing is profitable If you are one of the first with lionheart. Aside from that... Not really. 
---
I mained a feral druid on Nostalr*** and it was pretty funny to get a Warden Staff at level 43. Bought what I'm pretty sure was the first one on the server for 100g, like five days after launch. Lived without a mount until my 50s, but that's okay as a druid. Meanwhile, I was tanking ZF with like 7-8k armor and healers complained that there was nothing for them to do.
---
Druid has been the least played class on 100% of vanilla servers. There's absolutely no reason to be concerned about overpopulation. It's the least played class by a huge margin, like 3-4% or something.
---
I guild mate of mine got a 3 day ban for doing that. I thought it was hilarious. 
---
^ This is correct.
---
I leveled my warrior Herbing/Alchy back in Vanilla. Health and other pots proved invaluable when it came to living through bad situations as a warrior and optimizing my grind speed.
---
No more wow movies, I’ll take a hbo series tho
---
Shimmering Flats is an easy one
---
I love the idea of this. 
---
I always thought it would've been cool if the NPC's of (insert city here) would've joined in the fighting or ran when something like this happened, make it a little more immersive but totally part of the mechanics. 
---
Did he mention why? Was he looking for a sense of pride and accomplishment? 
---
I don't like it either, but I'd play it and possibly prefer it if they made the seasons long enough (at least 2 years). I think it would focus more on getting people to come back for the fresh server, similarly to how private servers have worked the entire time they've been around.
---
I disagree that this would eventually wear out... I think it would definitely see a steady population decline, but at the same time I think it would plateu at a pretty reasonable amount of players that could still populate a few servers. I mean, private servers have been doing this for over a decade already.
---
Though maybe that's what makes it feel so special when everything procs and [that gnome just disappears into thin air](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/075/925/112.jpg)
---
Mining engineering. Reflectors and grenades/nets/sapper are the absolute difference makers in pvp and the shield is amazing for dungeons.

Join or die

Thanks for your feedback, always good to see firsthand how autists are triggered by my karma-cringe-posts. :)
---
Thanks to your motivation I shall double the amount of the posts, and quadruple on the cringe.
---
Barrens.  Easy to get to. Plenty of rare spawns that are all pretty close to the quest lines.  Some good drops to speed up the grind. Quests out the ass.  And StV, 1000Needles, .Org, etc close by
---
Continue being successful in life while still being successful in WoW.
---
Hey man, nice work on the video. I am rolling Tauren Sham come launch, and want to be a wrecking ball in BG's and WPvP. I am so torn between a 1H Ele Resto spec https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfzVcGqZZxcIz0xo and a 2H Ele Enh spec https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hVfzVcGqoVibzV. Any recommendations or tips to help me decide? Thank you.
---
I made a compilation of all the Classic Raid trailers by this guy. No gonna make another thread for it.
---
https://youtu.be/kW51s983RLM
---
I played and quit wow before Naxx was nerfed . It's as hard as they say it is. In all likelihood your guild will dissolve and you'll quit before you clear it 
---
Let's say you were a dedicated melee group shaman healer. Does the 30 21 spec hold up for mc/zg/ony? Like stacking mp5, int, spirit to make up for loss of talents? Or if you want to pvp and raid are you more likely expected to respec?
---
Good, play druid or hunter and stop whining, please, or just play retail ’cause there are no chores, only endlessly grinding dungeons for every single class.
---
It happens. I had a 29t filly stuffed.  I owned the bg.  Never ever lost.  I ran across one other rogue one time that just owned me. He bowed at my corpse. Never saw him again.  Some people are just better.  I don’t get it. And it’s hard to admit.  But it happens to everyone eventually.  
---
I personally like the elemental build over the enhancement one. WF crits are epic but you are literally at RNGesus's mercy ALL THE TIME. I would rather play a spec that offers at least consistent damage with amazing burst potential and even some healing utility.
---
Apparently your the one who doesn't understand as all ths post shows if you don't have a solid grasp of the point of this thread. 
---
I played to 50 until tbc hit. I want to experience all the things I never had a chance to.
---
I'm actually not familiar with the latter spec. I thought you meant deep enhancement into Stormstrike. I know little about this build tbh because most want SS for another possible WF proc.
---
Depends...how do you turn your character?
---
That would be so much work it's hilarious to even imagine
---
This sums it up for me as well. I'll create my human warrior and meander my way through the early levels. I don't have the time to seriously raid, so there's no rush to get to 60. The 5-mans will be waiting for me. 
---
Really looking forward to just wandering the lowbie zone with no real solid plan in mind other than 'Hey, look at this! And this! I remember this! And this piece of green armor that just randomly dropped is THE SHIT! YEA!' All at the correct pace (I've tried doing this on retail, but it all blows by too fast, and then I'm into zones that have been changed by Cata and what little nostalgia existed is now entirely gone). 
---
Finally, I'll reach levels for Deadmines. I suppose that's my first true 'goal'. Tank some old school Deadmines and enjoy the hell out of it.
---
The only other goal I have is to attempt to get 4 other friends (RL or online buddies) to play at the same time so we can enjoy a good dungeon group. Considering jobs and kids these days, that will be a worthy goal for us.
---
W S and the mouse I guess ?? I try not use A and D but I guess I do?
---
Well look at the thread about half the people here seem to believe that will never happen. It's hard to have a discussion when half the people are so enraptured with a concept that they think it can never fall. I'm coming to the conclusion that we'll just have to have this discussion when we reach this point and these people are forced to face reality. 
---
On that we agree lol. Still though leveling a teleport slut was the best and most consistent money maker ive ever had in an mmo.
---
He didn't get enough creative freedom iirc
---
Classic is ported to the new engine so why do you expect it have as low hardware requirements as the original client?
---
Yes. This is what this sub needs on these long cold days. 
---
Seems arbitrary and pedantic. Besides, yes it is. What do you think is the definition of content, lol. 
---
frostmourne hungers
---
By tagging them first? 
---
I am no expert but I use my mouse for all movement other than a strafing
---
source on nost devs saying that?
---
And even if it’s true, does it change the fact that the players prefer no loot trading policy over a loot system from cata?
---
Woot
---
&gt;wrong
---
"you people" ahh so we've devolved into being a judgmental pricks. Ok I can adjust to this. Nax isn't that hard. It was back in the day but no so any more. People know how it works and if you can get a group of experienced players with all the gear an consumables its quite manageable. Its not that elite asking for more end game content is not what killed classic. What killed class was the fact the game got an expansion which wasn't planned as in the game was to successful. Then activision hopped in during wrath and added all the QoL changes to attract more people to get that increased revenue growth that investors look for. Not many players even during tbc and wrath were clamoring for More QoL. Stop saying people with differing opinions killed the game it was circumstance and the fact blizzard is a business with an xpac being the most financially lucrative move. Now say something that isn't complete condescending bullshit you pulled out of your taint so we can go back to being civil. 
---
I'm getting downvoted because I'm saying that people report that's now how it currently worked in the legion client they are using for classic.  I actually don't know, but I'd assume (because they said they are just leaving it in because why take it out if we think it's going to help) it's the same system that it was from the client they borrowed.  I don't know, I didn't play during that phase of the game and in BFA I've only had personal loot.  It is a question that needs to be answered.  Why are you assuming it would be any different than the borrowed clients version?
---
It's unorthodox for sure hahah but the strategy would be to open with a LB/CL/Shock combo to proc Ele Devastation (Ele Mastery could assure this) and melee to proc Flurry. WF would be the RNG boost, but I wouldn't need to rely on it, so to say. I do lose NS burst/heal utility but hey I love 2H on Tauren 😋
---
Blizzard would like to know your location
---
Oh that's true. Though the amount of information between the novel and cata about grim batol doesnt help to much with how little there is aside from a few npc dialogues.
---
Their AMA on this sub.
---
&gt; does it change the fact that the players prefer no loot trading policy
---
You're in a biased bubble that and are still making assumptions. Do they not teach critical thinking skills in schools anymore?
---
But Taurens are so fluffy :(
---
I would say BFA is the class you're looking for.
---
Create a community and guild that focuses on fun and nostalgic experiences. Avoid streamer servers and be a force for positivity.
---
And not play any more retail.
---
Nope, you're going to type the item name out manually and you're going to like it
---
And have that old boxy aspect ratio :D 
---
Ditch the S and use the mouse to get that direction... combined with some strafing to max out the speed when you are half turned. 
---
Yea, its so satisfying, sometimes you are as suprised as the enemy you killed after a crazy proc 
---
&gt; their ama on this sub
---
That’s not a source, that’s you claiming a source exists
---
&gt; You’re in a biased....
---
You’re not even responding to my comment now. We can go back and forth not saying anything and get nowhere if you want. But the bottom line is Blizz ain’t paying for GM teams to handle loot like they did in vanilla. So it’s either gonna be cata system or a statement of no loot intervention by GMs
---
Leveling a warrior now (private server). I’m 31 . Just got the WW so life is good. Pulling 3-4 lvl 25-27 mobs got me to lvl 31 in like 1 hour. Crazy stuff with shiny new axe. 
---
As far as world PvP - seems to have to do more with who gets the jump than what class it is.  If I’m on a mob and don’t have a lot of rage, yea I’m pretty much toast unless it’s a rogue and I have retaliation up AND I get some nice crit action. If hunter gets jump on you, might as well /sit.  Going to have to get some lucky resists against frost mage to have a chance. I still love playing warrior. Fun class to me and I live for world PvP encounters - gotta stay on your toes!
---
&gt; blizzard asks you twice if you’re sure you want to Need something
---
Here's a key issue: when rolling on an item, the confirmation message
---
says: "Looting [item] will bind it to you."; but never whether you clicked Greed or Need. For this reason, I often click the X button and re-click whichever roll I intended for safety measures. A nifty little change would be to include which roll you clicked in the confirmation message.
---
I like this post.  Nice way to illuminate how a strict #nochanges is kind of a silly policy and that discussions are at least worth having about how things could lead to a better game. 
---
Go up to the search bar and search for the latest Nost AMA and then scroll down and read. Educate yourself. Do your own homework. Are you always this lazy?
---
Geeze!!  First the color blind changes and now you want to save yourself from more carpal tunnel! 
---
Classic's ruined already.
---
"it's not harder, it just takes longer because you have to do more things, pay attention to more things, and generally be on your game more"
---
Yeah, that's called "being harder"
---
If you're gonna be pedantic, try not to also be wrong. You're wasting your effort. 
---
Honestly, I'm excited mostly for the familiarity of it. Retail feels like this weird amalgamation of systems and rewards that I just can't get immersed in. I really enjoyed my Hunter through the tail end of Vanilla and fully into BC. Such a great universe to get immersed in and find friends to raid and pvp with at end game. That's really all I'm looking for. A cool guild and that standalone server community where you don't feel like "just another player". I'm going to try a Holy Priest this time around, a class I have zero experience with, and that just makes it more exciting.
---
Hi, /u/dktigerr
---
You guys basically have the same gear, the level difference is miniscule (perhaps a few higher ranks of abilities).  
---
I don't remember exactly but melee classes have an easier time going after higher level targets.  Casters get a string of resist and can't do jack shit but melee usually hit all their attacks. 
---
You are confusing time for difficulty. You don't need to do anything special to level in either expansion, but you need actual tactics and skills to raid.
---
Jesus how hard of a concept is this to grasp ?
---
&gt; Hunters are also nasty.
---
A good hunter can be nasty, but I find I encounter a lot of hunters that try to cc and kite you like they always do. But then I just shapeshift into bear, shaking the cc, feral charge them (have furor talent) repeat as needed while utilizing the rest of your kit
---
Im hoping to do this exact thing
---
Yeah if this was turned into a movie.....I dont think I could handle it lol
---
I'm just going skinning and cooking on the biggest private server ATM.  Too much competition for nodes to try alch or mining.  Skinning and cooking go together well since beasts usually drop something that can be cooked, and of course can get skinned too.  If you have surplus food that is cooked you can sell it to vendors for profit or try your luck at listing on the AH or advertising at your local quest hub like crossroads or redridge or wherever.
---
*but who innervated the priests???*
---
Warlocks but lategame when you have AQ gear and spec balance you can lit them up from maxrange and there is nothing they can do about it. (Fear has a 20 yard range) add reflectors and its ez mode 
---
The first assumption you're making is that the servers will last long enough to make it to that point.  That Blizzard won't screw it up (with changes) before then.
---
The second assumption you're making is that live will be the same as private servers.  With live you'll constantly have new players coming in, and you'll have a lot more casual players than exist on retail.
---
The third assumption you're making is that end-game raiding is the only point to playing the game.
---
The fourth assumption you're making is that Activision-Blizzard is capable of adding to the content without changing the formula, when everything post-1.12 has changed the formula.  
---
With all of that said, your "solution" is to add in the expansions, but only half the changes.  If you're for changes, why not include the changes that came in TBC and WotLK?  For example, you don't want to include flying mounts, but half the end-game content was built or gated around flying mounts (Skettis, Netherwing Dailies, &amp; Tempest Keep in TBC; Storm Peaks and Icecrown were completely designed around being able to fly in WotLK).
---
So you want changes made to Vanilla, but you don't want the changes that came in TBC and WotLK, but you want the content from TBC and WotLK except that which fits your definition of bad changes.  It is arrogance and hubris to assume that your changes are "good" and the other changes are "bad".
---
And to assume that everyone who does not agree with your set of changes are just a bunch of opinionated idiots who are lying and sticking their heads in the sand.
---
&gt;I mean, private servers have been doing this for over a decade already.
---
But private servers are free, WoW Classic is not.  I can't imagine that NOT factoring into the equation. I will admit though, I could be wrong, $14 a month may not be a deal breaker for a lot, but I imagine it will be for some, particularly over a long period of time with literally no new content. 
---
I want to have meaningful goals. Something to really work towards. Be it through a hard grind, tough enemies, or what ever the game throws at me. Just as long as its fun and meaningful the grind doesn't matter. Plus having a game I can sink hundreds of hours into and still see a goal on the horizon is a bonus while at the same time feeling like I am still achieved something for the time I have put in so far. Hopefully classic can achieve this for me. 
---
Well I did get a character to level 60, so I have an idea what the game is like. I was happy with the priest in this regard, just wondering which other classes are similarly chore-free as I'd like to try a different one this time. Some classes felt really chore heavy, and I don't want to sink time in a class to realize I'm not having fun playing it.
---
For me it's a toss up between duskwood, and STV.
---
Duskwood has hands down the best environment and queslines by far.
---
But STV has an insane amount of quests and the pvp that goes on there is stuff of legend.
---
I looove that Sulfuras smash! So awesome.
---
I don't think it, I know it. I've been playing Vanilla for years and log in and play Vanilla every day and see the vast majority of the server never setting foot in BWL let alone Naxx.
---
Pretty much this, with an alternative to Blacksmithing being Engineering.
---
&gt; I'm coming to the conclusion that we'll just have to have this discussion when we reach this point and these people are forced to face reality.
---
That's probably the safest bet if I'm being honest. To be fair, the game isn't even out yet, I understand people's hesitation to thinking about the future of the game when we don't even have a release date. 
---
That doesn't mean stop talking about it, just choose your battles. If I see someone in this sub talk about new content on a post, I chime in and support it. If I see someone talk about "seasons" I'll let them know my opinion so we can have an honest discussion, but I too [know from experience](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9td7ca/classic_20_the_what_if/) that posts dedicated to hypothetical talks of new content do not go over too well, unless it's literally the [top post of all time in this sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a16wwq/unpopular_opinion_the_future_of_wow_classic/)
---
Bookmarking thread. Will join when home.
---
You're right - here is one of them
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIw8Z1fL6mY
---
Why on earth do you want ActivisionBlizzard to fix stuff dor yoy when you can just use an addon created by the community.
---
Agreed. Tbh, i’d take anything over this abomination system from Cata they are putting in
---
The weapons can give you a good boost of gold early when everyone is gearing up at the start. Crafting professions can give decent sustained gold with new resist gear in future patches.
---
If you pair it with enchanting, there are recipes that produce more value in enchant mats than cost for crafting I think as well.
---
You are a bad bad man :-P
---
When someone claims a source exists, the onus is on that person to provide the source.
---
Are you still in highschool? Serious question not trying to poke fun
---
The Nost devs said it (and recently too!) If you don’t want to look it up yourself then don’t. You’ll continue looking like a fool in the future. 
---
Would a druid be a good leveling partner for a Warlock? I'd like to play a support class for my SO who I think would love the Warlock class, but not sure if a druid would be the best combo for it. 
---
There is no chance at a physical release in this day and age.
---
Well what really annoyed me was that my Raid only got like 2-3 Naxx Bosses down, because TBC was announced and no one bothered to show up for Raids anymore.
---
Which I understand. But I'm certainly want to go back and go through Naxx how it was intended.
---
It feels like I have still unfinished business in Classic. (I'm a completionist, my OCD has not been satisfied)
---
Then of course meeting people. I met so many interesting guys through WoW. Firefighters, Judges, Hippies. I'm very excited for those late night talks. People are so interesting to me.
---
And last but not least, recognize how terrible I was back then and laugh about myself. There is nothing more wholesome than being able to laugh about yourself.
---
&gt; Also I've leveled over 10 characteres on 1x pserverse and raided over the span of 4 years, so I think I know what I'm talking about :)
---
hahahaha. thanks for the laugh. 
---
You're confusing "difficulty" for "who even knows what" but if WoW has taught me one thing it's that you can't fix stupid. 
---
Masturbating 
---
You spoke right to my heart, I feel the exact same..
---
Really enjoyed it!
---
My tiny $600 alienware laptop from 2010 runs classic private servers maxed out with no skips @ 60fps, this game is going to be sooo popular to those with low budget builds
---
I like that this guy is acting like this is politics and, he just caught you on the "/r/thedonald". Why was there an inquisitorial look into your post history? Just ignore the post bro. 
---
RETAIL BAD VANILLA GOOD
---
Sorry for my outburst, seems like I was wrong about you. You seem like a fully developed mature intellectual.
---
Sorry to interrupt your busy schedule. Continue pumping out these stellar memes which clearly take a lot of time to make.
---
Honestly I didn't even know there was a key. I just kinda never thought about it. Suicide is how you get into scholo. This is just how it's always been. This news is unexpected but, welcome!
---
Seems reasonable
---
The worst part is carrying all the gear that you need. 
---
I love bfa's login music, probably my favorite. I often wait to hit enter until the beats drops. 
---
Very interesting
---
Druid might be the best partner. Or paladin if you can stand the boredom.
---
Gamepedia is by far the most complete and updated wiki for WoW. The main contributors and authors left WoWWiki and started the gamepedia one years ago. 
---
" The first assumption you're making is that the servers will last long enough to make it to that point. That Blizzard won't screw it up (with changes) before then. 
---
 The fourth assumption you're making is that Activision-Blizzard is capable of adding to the content without changing the formula, when everything post-1.12 has changed the formula.  "
---
Spot on with those two points. However I never once implied that my solutions were the only ones, im simply saying htey are options, you dont have to like my solutions as i dont have a say in the outcome. however saying that no change is the only way forward will only lead to an early grave for vanilla. i didn't say end game was the only thing of value about vanila but i am saying its a huge part of it.
---
If your saying the vast majority that never reaches 60 then sure, if your including the players that have hit 60 then your FoS.
---
Should I write swoosh here?
---
Haha, well made!
---
Getting my prebis. I assume I won’t be the only one rushing to 60 so I won’t really have to wait long. Plus, it gives me a jump on the market. Epic mount money should be easy if I’m one of the few selling high end items a lot of people need ie: devilsaur sets.
---
True, but the will do some phased content releases like gates of AQ, Scourge invasion etc.  Perhaps there will be more quirks and stuff to cause funny scenes like this =)
---
People want to hate but changing all the content such as values, mob placement, loot drops, etc would give us the vanilla experience again since we won't know anything again. 
---
The game's longivity takes a hit because of guides like this that tell us everything before the game is even released. No challenge or mystery anymore.
---
So the people who just keep playing vanilla pservers are what? Blizz said they’d keep it going if only tens of people were playing.
---
Bringing sweet death and chaos to Stranglethorn. May the Crimson banner of the Horde remain supreme!
---
You may be right. I may be projecting, considering how much I am not of a cult follower and how the behavior described seems completely alien to me. Then again, life so far has thought me that nobody is particularly unique and I have a lot in common with other people, so I have a hard time imagining over 1 % of the people I know acting the way you describe. 
---
Picking flowers, hopefully a few black lotuses among them.
---
i was so excited when i first found him because i had no idea he was there 
---
Fresh
---
I wish there were more content like this. Too many people discussing the same things about classic over and over. It’s hard to find good vanilla vids through all of the clutter.
---
Can switch to both at 60. ¿Por que no Los dos?
---
I expect most streamers to go to pvp or pve servers. I’ll enjoy the smaller community of a rp server.
---
Basically regarding the tokens, if they will be separated from the retail preventing the money to be transferred from retail, it will not be harmful for the game. Anyway the wow token doesn't mean, that it generates any in game gold or items, it just transfer the gold from one player to another one, while it still needs to be earned in game (in opposition to many other games, where you can just buy in game gold that comes out of nothing).
---
Sometimes especially at low levels, you just get worked lol.
---
Mechanically, low level pvp is not that Intense since there are very few skills even available, possibly bad rng ? Or he was just flat out a better pvp player than you ? Your level difference doesnt really matter that much. I have gotten worked by lower level players a few times. It happens
---
'What they are supposed to look like' in vanilla is how they were literally were during vanilla. The project is a historical recreation of the game back then EXACTLY as it was, the devs LITERALLY state that as their goal. What you feel and what is fact are entirely different things. If you're going to lobby to bastardize the game then at least be honest about it.
---
Marie Kondo is a gem
---
I play most of my PvP at 39.  Rogues and hunters are good, but I would still avoid certain well twinked classes.  Warriors were great, but I found them boring.  Paladin at 39 was fucking amazing. I wasn't afraid of anyone, even taking on 3 or 4 at a time. 
---
Lotta great moments from vanilla. Funeral raid was a great one. 
---
I'll be 60 before 1st reset if things go to plan.
---
DM:E farming when I'm not doing BiS runs. I could quite reasonably have 1,000g for epic mount by the end of week 2 - BUT I'll likely be on a buying frenzy while everyone's leveling, getting as many mats and early-bird deals on gear while everyone's leveling.
---
When most people have dozens of gold, I'll have hundreds, and by getting in early with a lot of capital, the returns will be astronomical.
---
No chance is a bit far fetched, a lot of games still come in physical form next to the digital counterparts. I don't think Classic will get a physical release though, however i don't count it out. 
---
that sounds super simple to solve, no? just need a hunter on aggresive
---
False. The only ones you even know of are Nost leftovers.  
---
So your "every major pserv" is just a straight up bs   
---
You probably didn't even play on them before Nost 
---
If it releases at midnight, my happy ass will be sitting at my desk, refreshing the login page waiting for [PLAY] to activate.
---
0 chance I'll be standing in line at Gamestop, wait to check out, then drive 30 minutes home, to install, and hopefully play around 2am.
---
&gt; we don’t know how compatible retail addons will be with classic’s engine
---
Can people stop saying this? They have commented publicly on this. They are going to use the retail API, slightly culled of any functionality they think shouldn't exist in Classic. The only thing we don't know is what they are culling because they feel it shouldn't be in Classic, but basic functionality like tool tip rewriting existed in Vanilla, it will not get culled. It is highly likely that most retail add-ons will function with no changes in Classic, they will only break if they are using one of the features the developers specifically removed because they feel it impacted the spirit of Classic. 
---
You people are out of your mind if you think there will be a significant amount of other people hitting 60 in 2 weeks IRL time lol get a life. 
---
Do you have any proof all of them are hosted in France?  
---
but it uses 7.3.5 client, not the OG 1.12 client.
---
How does your laptop run retail? That'll be a much more accurate representation.
---
Plans to rush to 60 and be farming god as warrior. I am praying for your patience and real life.

How they do it in FFXI is that lets say you have Ultimate Weapon +1, but that was 5 years ago with the old expansion. Now with the new expansion, you need Ultimate Weapon +3. You can upgrade the +1 you have, which would cost less materials or whatever than having no upgrade. This essentially makes +2 better since it will be even less than the +1 version. Vertical progression is an inevitability,  but in WoW, its out of control

Farming devilsaur, farming mara if I'm geared enough, using mara gold to buy out cheap AH mats, go for the gurubashi arena trinkets, and if I can get a group 5 man dungeons. If I can get enough devilsaur leather for the BiS pieces and it starts getting competitive, I'll drop skinning and try to max engineering.

Everything on paper for a Druid is amazing. Can perform all roles, 2nd best tank, battle Rez, innervate, viable melee Dps (effort needed), amazing tier 3 set to strive for, underplayed, a fucking bear, batte armor mage. Just doesn’t correlate to fun in game for me. Shame. 
---
Well said.  When people ask me about WoW I simply refer to it as the greatest, most comprehensive video game ever.  It's not for everyone, but Blizzard took aspects of several different games and genres and mashed it all together into a really special and HUGE product.  
---
Even if the game ends after Naxx...it will last longer without changes.  Because when changes start happening, the majority of the players will leave.  At first it will be the die-hard no-changes players, but as the guilds dry up and the economy slows down, that will be the death of the game.
---
I am all for them adding in expansions.  But those should also be #no changes. 
---
The classic era of WoW was good.  Don't need to mess with what worked.
---
There will be more than you think.  Its summer so kids wont be in school and I, like many, plan on taking a vacation for launch.
---
If you can level in 7 days /played thats 10.5 days at 16 hours each day.
---
Also, youre on a classic wow forum months before launch.  Dont act like you have a life either.
---
this but unironically
---
Sure. Both are a pretty big money sinks especially without mining.
---
Honestly even on the new engine, the game is not very demanding at all.

Did you ever q up then go level up so you had level 30 skills in a lower bracket?
---
find joy in chores and you will always be happy. vanilla is described as zen-like for a reason. you can of course also blast your attention span by watching tv series on a second monitor and alt-tabbing constantly to browse social media. 
---
A return to a more laid back casual game style. I am not a tier one progression raider Esports guy. I like classic wow's far slower pace of game play.
---
90% of the difficulty in Vanilla is just finding people to help you. None of them care about the timesink that grinding is because it's literally their job to play the game. You're kidding yourself if you think streamers are going to have a hard time doing Scarab Lord for example.
---
Soon people will be saying "RETAIL GOOD MODERN BAD"
---
I think a small number will leave but I think a majority will be fine with it as long as it only adds new things to do without making the old content irrelevant. 
---
An annoying dynamic. I know it’s an unpopular opinion. I just pvpd a ton in vanilla and am over it. I liked the rp server where I could quest in peace and q fir bgs if I wanted pvp.  Wpvp did occasionally break out.
---
But good luck cuz by time you get there northshire will be bursting with humans.
---
why on earth would you want bunch of bloated addons that do the most mundane things possible that your dear Blizzard from 2005 was incapable of doing when you can have it already in game?  
---
Laughing a passive aggressive r/classicwow Redditors.
---
True XD 
---
Someone with talent needs to make a YouTube of this
---
Playing Horde "unfortunately". 
---
I only say that because Paladin would probably be the best but I have a feeling she'd like the Forsaken too much to play anything else. 
---
Then people are bored because the new content represents no power increase.  That's what's happening on Live when you can raid, or you can just keep doing world quests and randomly get an item that's boosted +70 item levels.
---
You say that if there's nothing left but alts and PvP, people will leave.  If the new content is not meaningful to your main, isn't that basically the same?
---
Or if it is truly post-naxx content, and there's no new level cap, power creep becomes a very important factor.
---
Fair enough, I suppose a more accurate wording would’ve been “I’M not sure how compatible retail addons will be with classic’s engine”. 
---
With that clarified, doesn’t it seem pointless to force players to download an addon for minor things like this that already exist in the retail interface? Maintaining bag space is a big deal for vanilla/classic and being able to see how much grey/whites vendor for helps you make better decisions on what to throw away while away from town. There are other examples like a cast bar, actual numbers on skill icons representing time left on the CD etc. 
---
Just getting opinions on whether people think these should be included in the default interface or left out?
---
Yeah I agree, I dont personally have the skills
---
Darkshore, stonetalon, any quest given by a night elf usually. Feralas has night elves galore. 
---
Just curious, because the specs you mentioned are the minimum viable ones, right? So this means the "ultra nice gfx" - settings people speak about in this thread would still be way higher.
---
Yes playing a game for 16 hours a day for 11 days is borderline cancerous. I live and breathe this game but there is a big difference between putting in 50 hours a week which is already excessive and putting in 100+. For every person who plans on being 60 in two weeks I imagine 2/3rds of them will fail.
---
The top one always made me feel like I was walking through the gates into WoW as I was pressing enter.

The bottom one reminds me of my grade 11 PowerPoint presentation, which was just a picture with a bunch of crap posted around.
---
I cant wait for Classic!
---
get your pre raid bis and herb/mine the high level stuff
---
Indeed, Classic WoW will be the perfect game for laptops. I already have the lifestyle, chilling on couch at night playing games while wife watches any one of our 5,000 ongoing series.
---
Honestly the true "#NoChanges" group doesn't actually exist. 99% of the people who qualify themselves as NoChanges are actually okay with small, reasonable changes. The disagreement is actually whether "NoChanges" actually means "literally no changes at all" or "No major changes." 
---
Eastern Plaguelands. Afterwards I was riding back to LHC and killed a random hound and boom: Krol blade. Sold it and used the money to buy my epic mount. 
---
It would be meaningful as new content would provide gear sets with different bonuses. For example a set with stats comparable to dungeon sets 1 but with different bonuses to make different play styles relevant. If your against horizontal progression that's your prerogative I guess. Although if all change has to change the formula to be meaningful I'm wondering whats your opinion on the first 12 patches. I dont know why its so hard to conceptualize this.
---
farming mats
---
I guess it depends if they means "Ultra" in terms of "What ultra used to be back in Vanilla" or "Ultra in the modern engine with all the graphical improvements." 
---
I'd say you lose out on a bit of healing (mainly the 10% from Purification) but mostly on mana costs/recovery. You aren't going to be running the improved mana spring talent and you'll have to choose between smaller mana costs or faster healing waves.
---
Someone with more raiding experience as resto shaman than me might correct me, but I'd say that you should be fine as 30/0/21 as long as you're in melee groups, as not having mana tide then only hurts your own mana regen. You can make up for it by bringing more runes/mana pots. If you're moved into a healer group and expected to mana tide though, you'll be a bit screwed.
---
As a parting note, you shouldn't bother with spirit and you'll already grab a ton of MP5 as a shaman. Shaman's shtick is to ignore the 5s rule and just spam r1 chain heal when raid healing. Unless you are MT healing, in which case you should probably go full resto and get Healing Way+Ancestral Healing.
---
I think it probably will get a physical release. But that physical release will be, at best, a box with a [battle.net](https://battle.net) code inside of it. Realistically it will be in the form of a small card with 1-month subscription worth of Bnet cash on it. 
---
Can't correlate when the naxx population drop is always when another server has just opened fresh. You may be right, I am not saying that the fresh thing is assuredly the cause, but the data is not there to support either side because of it.
---
The character not mattering is an overall thing because none of them are permanent. The servers come and go, and you could lose it all tomorrow so it isn't the same as blizz where I can log into a char I haven't logged into for the last 13 years and it will still be there, on a server with people, and in the same shape I left it in.
---
Blizzard did make trailers for their raids but they are pretty bad. I like the ZG one and the Naxx one only because I fucking love McConnohie's voice work.
---
Soupasouka did a test on the demo and it turns out it will actually run even smoother.
---
I don't know, truthfully. The game giving you nothing and forcing you to learn is part of what made it so engaging. I played retail WoW up to 20 recently because my stream was telling me how bad it was now. I said it couldn't be that bad. It was. The babysitting was ridiculous. But literally everyone who learns about some functionality will downloaded an add-on for it, because of how useful it is. That is why some things got baked in the default in the first place. So you're really just punishing bad players, especially those that don't engage with the community and hear about these things. Is that part of the spirit of vanilla? Kind of, yeah. Because a huge part of the gameplay is learning things and socializing, "QoL" changes really do impact the actual gameplay that made vanilla what it was. 
---
I was really mad in actual vanilla about vendoring all my Large Fangs. They are an ingredient for Rage Potions. I was an Alchemist. Once I bought the recipe and saw what it used, I downloaded an add on that listed what items could be reagents for in the tooltip. I never vendored anything useful ever again. There is a lot of value in that lesson about the game. 
---
If you want to tank, enchanting for the bis trinket.
---
If you want to pvp, engineering.
---
If you want to make money, forget skinning and leather working.
---
Pre-raid gear, and farming for an epic mount.  Can we get enough for an Ony PuG??
---
selling stuff to you for my epic mount
---
Yeah, but sluggish and that weird hump + ugly casting animation.
---
don't forget that shadowguard does high damage, so I would categorize it more of as a roundabout damage spell, something you'd cast anyway as part of your rotation. it can also stun and apply shadow weaving.
---
druid and priest are quite similar in this aspect, both have a few buffs which you'll be reapplying nonstop - for example, druids have  nature's grasp, which you'll be recasting damn near constantly in pvp, same as shadowguard or inner fire.
---
but yeah, both are solid choice if you'd like a low annoyance class. have you considered rogues and warriors? former ones have often stated that they basically show up to the raid, press a few buttons and take the loot, while warriors are bit more involved, but no constant buffing or anything like that.
---
I'm not against horizontal progression.  I just don't see how the changes you want fix the problems you have with the current system.
---
Some changes are good.  Some changes are bad.  In Vanilla (and TBC) most of the changes were good.
---
However, there are several major issues with adding in changes:
---
1) Most of the changes people want are bad for the game.
---
2) Most of the changes that are not bad, would be bad for the game in aggregate with other similar changes.
---
3) Most of the changes that would be good for Vanilla would be implemented automatically with the release of The Burning Crusade.
---
4) The changes the company has introduced in WotLK and on have mostly been detrimental to the game.  The changes that Blizzard has suggested implementing to solve problems are those same ones that have been detrimental to the game.
---
You say "I don't know why its so hard to conceptualize this."  Guess what.  We have conceptualized it and seen the problems it can create.  We're not just ignoring changes.  We've seen the effect they have.
---
But then that might be a hard problem for someone to grasp when they way they deal with differing opinions is "here's my opinion, if you disagree don't reply to my thread."
---
Gonna level a female tauren shaman (never played shaman. Max fishing/cooking as I level, probably max herbalism/mining along the way. Run tons of dungeons, help as many people as I can.
---
I have leveled a few tons to 60, and I learned that when I focused solely on getting to endgame as fast as possible, alot of the enjoyment of the game was lost. Gonna take my time and enjoy the game...than grind endlessly for pre bis and get ready to raid
---
What do you think people who want no changes would think?
---
&gt; Classic is ported to the new engine so why do you expect it have as low hardware requirements as the original client?
---
Did you play the demo? When you turned it to the classic low settings, your framerate was through the roof, even on an mediocre PC. The textures and all that were brought back, including the shorter draw distance. If you are going to play with classic visuals, a modern day PC will absolutely eat classic WoW, that much is certain.
---
I would also suggest when you get a little bored, spend some time leveling professions. Maybe just fish or cook for a few hours. There's lots of rep grinds/professions/honor grinds that people typically do at 60 but you can start on at a lower level which can help break up the monotony. I also remember spending a few hours literally just running zone to zone, exploring areas, collecting some resources, and snagging flight paths. Not the most productive in terms of EXP/hr, but having tons of flight paths definitely helped in the long run!
---
Lol same
---
Against warlock, you either burst him as fast as possible using feral charge and bash to interrupt their fear (you will most likely need an insignia for the fear that will come after death coil) or hot yourself to heal from dot and outlast.
---
Against hunter, watch for their fear and go out of form if you see it, dispelling their poison that drain mana whenever you can they shouldn't be able to kite you since you have feral charge, if you see them moving fast (aspect of cheetah), moonier to slow them for 3 sec. If you can hibernate the pet.
---
Shaman are a much nastier counter imho (esp ele)
---
&gt;Classic cannot exist without change in perpetuity. I'm sorry but it's the truth.         
---
          
---
Hard disagree, there. Nothing new has to happen to the game for it to be just fine, and the reason's are two-fold:        
---
        
---
1) The goal behind Classic WoW is not "obtain a huge playerbase and another wildly popular product". It is "re-create the original experience as an homage to our roots and to help provide the authentic experience that no longer exists."         
---
         
---
This much has been outright stated in interviews about the project - the server could die off to two dudes circle jerking in Orgrimmar about the 'good old days' and the servers would *still* stay up because it isn't about making some living, evergreen product. Now, of course, this is hyperbole and would never happen because of the second point:         
---
           
---
2) Classic WoW is a monument in gaming history that will continue to draw new players even as the old ones drop off from being 'bored'.       
---
Yes, some dudes will cruise through, hit the content limit, and decide to bug out. But they will be able to do so with confidence that the character they come back to, should they choose to, will be exactly how they left them. No worries that their gear or accomplishments are invalidated by new content, no worries that they'll log into a world distinct and odd from  vanilla. Moreover, for every player that quits there will be others who try the game for the first time.      
---
Will that population make-up balance out leavers completely? I don't know, I don't have a crystal ball. But I am confident the draw of Classic *will* replenish its population to some extent. And it can do so without creating new content that "follows the spiritual/design philosophies of vanilla" or whatever the hell that's supposed to even mean.      
---
Maybe that steady-state population will be too low for  some people to view classic as a success? I feel like that's too obscure of a dragon to chase, compared to the very concrete parameters that established vanilla content outline.
---
Good question
---
god stfu
---
Thanks for your valuable input. Really didn't expect to generate so many elitist responses like this. I like vanilla WoW, that's why I'm posting on this subreddit. Vanilla and TBC are in fact the only versions of WoW I ever played. At the same time, that doesn't mean I have to enjoy every single aspect of the game. 
---
WoW has always primarily relied on the CPU; hasn't changed since Vanilla. The more core clock, the better, not so much as more cores on their own.
---
That said, you'd probably compensate for your PC pretty much running WoW idly if you ran some sort of mining in the background. At least that would negate the power usage of the PC, and maybe net you a few cents on top.
---
Or, run retail WoW in the background, farming gold, while playing Classic. That way you can keep using free tokens to pay for game time :D!
---
I haven't paid for a subscription since the past 3 expansions, lol.
---
No way, I did only Stormwind rep quests as nelf in retail vanilla, using databases to look up quests to not miss out. I wasn't even close, turned in a metric shit-ton of runecloth at 50 to get exalted.
---
I feel obligated to say that while jordan petersons self help stuff is good (basic, but that's fine since it can still help a lot), there's also more than a bit of ridiculous religious conservatism snuck in there which can be easy to accept when you're vulnerable and looking for answers.
---
LOL

“My entire argument is based on this on source, but I won’t provide the source”
---
Is this the first time you’ve ever gotten into an argument on the internet?
---
Everyone knows the onus is on the person who makes an outrageous claim to backup that claim.
---
You’re basically admitting you’re making the whole thing up since you know you can’t dig up the source when asked 😂
---
Druid are the best 5man tank and great offtank in raid. Some raid boss are also easier with a druid tanking them. Finding a place can be hard because most guild rarely want more than one but the stigma is less and less frequent because bear are proved to be viable and valuable now (I even see guild looking specifically for some feral on world chat nowadays, some seem to like having more than one like the one i'm in which use 2 war and 2 bear as tank).
---
How would mining negate the power usage?
---
why do you think so many bad players mouse click abilities?
---
don't forget scare beast... in wPvP, a well placed fear is akin to saying "enjoy the repairs, bitch".
---
All casters are extremely good in pvp. The only thing you need to win at pvp on a caster is (Talisman of Ephemeral Power, and Zandalar Hero Charm. I think Mage spell cap is something around 360 in classic. These two trinkets along buff you 300+ spell power. They make every caster a viable pvp threat and, shamans get as monstrous and anyone else.
---
imho hard counter are ele shaman and spriest.
---
Warlock can be hard but doable unless they are geared to death.
---
I’m curious if you could give me any examples of this? From what I’ve seen he merely takes old mythological stories from across cultures, and the Biblical stories of the west because that is what he said he has studied the most, and uses them to impart lessons about life rather than preaching theism, although he is a believer himself. At any rate, I am open to any examples you could throw at me without judgement.
---
More importantly, how do you farm retail gold while playing another game without getting banned
---
To this though, Rags was never killed before DM was out. 
---
Even if i end up with a bad rep, if i see an opportunity that will pay me my epic mount with a ninja, i will do it.
---
"if you equip the item it will no longer be tradeable"
---
No, it only become non tradeable if you enchant it.
---
And even if you make it non tradable after equipping, what if the ninja already have another one in his bag to show to you after winning it ? 
---
Yes
---
Literally me irl
---
I only gave an example of what you could do specifically while playing Classic. For example the flight paths could take ages, so you could just tab to Retail and gather 30-40 more herbs for a few grand, depending on prices of course.
---
Otherwise you wouldn't really try to play two games at once without having down time in one. There's just no point lol.
---
Also, the ToS don't say anything about having WoW open and any other game, so you can't get banned for it.
---
Do you think with the release in the summer people will still be raiding Vanilla in a few years - Knowing blizzard I would assume TBC if Vanilla is a success? Also why was it so unlikely for a reroll? 
---
I see you too are a sophisticated gentlemen
---
Lmao I started singing it in my head as hey there delilah. Kinda works
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddenwow/comments/35regp/curious_about_how_wow_looked_back_in_2003_heres_a/
---
Hmm, interesting view, that's not how I thought of casual vs hardcore.
---
I like leveling, dungeons, storlyline, alts, mount collecting etc. On my 2 max chars I got to max level, got up to iLvl 350-365 using mostly WarFronts and WorldQuests (hardly any Heroic/Mythic0/LFR) then get bored and rolled another alt. 
---
I've never done M+ or real Raid, so don't think of myself as hardcore at all?
---
Statistically speaking, your PC on idle (not sleep) already uses up to 75% of it's total power draw, not factoring severe overclocks etc. With Classic running (assuming it would have similar performance as private servers), the power draw doesn't go much higher than that percentage. It's just such an old and undemanding game, there's almost no difference between running it and not.
---
So, if you let your PC mine at basic levels, it would mine enough coin to compensate for the PC running at all, and maybe then some on top.
---
Otherwise if you try to play a proper demanding game and trying to mine... Not a good idea. In fact your PC may struggle or become unstable.
---
Nice, thank you for the reply and all the other info!
---
Nesingwary Camp...god save us all.
---
Gotcha. No, you wouldn't get banned, but anything that made you gold while actually playing something else would typically involve a 3rd party program. Thought I might get in on the secret of making gold on retail without actually having to play it :P
---
sure but making gold in bfa to buy tokens sucks
---
Stop posting one's with the dodgy hair already. 
---
Haha nah. But come to think of it, I think they may make it so that you could only launch either Classic or Retail. But then again, they are being treated as separate games (as they should), so I don't know.
---
druid is more or less the best partner for damn near every class, since their designation as "swiss army knives". post-40 mage + druid can be especially ridiculous.
---
The cinematics are pretty insane. I’d say if they gave this dude a budget he’d make better ones.
---
Even if you could, you would get right click reported for griefing and automatically banned
---
My goal I have right now is to get a main to 60. I only played classic for a few months on a private server and only ever made it to 55. Did LBRS once. 
---
After I make my first 60 I want to go around doing all the random stuff ive been looking forward to trying. Rep grinds, leveling professions, gearing up, and eventually do some raids. 
---
Damn. DM:E really that good? Can I ask what about it is so profitable? (What drops etc)
---
Druid and Warlock have fabulous synergy. Really the biggest problem is that Warlocks are even slower than Warriors which doesn’t play to Druid’s strengths. That being said, through judicious use of roots and bear form and HoT’s, a pair will basically be unstoppable farming machines.
---
&gt;like a half baked warrior, priest or rogue. 
---
You've got that all wrong, as a druid you're a half baked warrior, priest AND rogue. 
---

This is me... Built a $2000 PC this part boxing day and all I've played is vanilla and TBC since 
---
[I understood that reference.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/204/CaptainAmerica1_zps8c295f96.JPG) 
---
And you still don't understand the difference from leveling and raiding?
---
Yeah i understand and i thinl it's the greatest difficulty we have with this upcoming game. Making the right choice at firts. I'm still not decided either eheh!
---
But back on topic, you should make a class-role-youlike vs chore-load list. Because even if you play a chore-less class, if it's a role you dislike you won't male it anyway.
---
Also imo i would say to look at class which have the most self-benefits array of skills to judge their chore level. For example a paladin offers alot to others compare to a rogue who is mostly for himself. 
---
Hopes it helps! 
---
(My only real experience was shaman MC/BWL healer raising in Vanilla circa 2007)
---
you do know there are private vanilla severs that have a significant amount of people hitting 60s in 2 weeks?
---
How is your 39 allocated? Did you put 4 points into MOTW?
---
I think you’re better off taking 2-4 points out and getting a few more points in roots and movement speed. Something like 2/13/36. The 35 gives you furor and enrage (although enrage isn’t strictly necessary) with all of the good healing talents although no points in nature’s focus or motw.
---
The source is one click away. At this point I don’t want to link you to the AMA because I want you to look like more of a fool next time you have these convos!

Anyone else reading this will easily be able to find it (or look through my comment history to find the last time I linked it.)
---
In an hour:
---
- 15g from vendor greys
---
- 5g+ from herbs
---
- 5-10g from vendored greens
---
That's fairly reliable 25g base given a 1 hour snapshot.
---
Traveler's backpacks drop a bit, blues every few hours, an epic on occasion, rare book drops.
---
So normalized over 'tens of hours' it bumps up to 40-50 gold an hour.
---
This isn't a great 'oh i'll drop in for an hour' location, though it's fair for short grinds, it tends really well for long sessions.
---
It's also an incredible (if you can manage a couple gear pieces) leveling spot for paladins from 52-60 - So it's a double whammy in gold farming.
---
&gt; Also, youre on a classic wow forum months before launch. Dont act like you have a life either.
---
At first I was a little offended because it hit so close to home but yea, totally not wrong. 
---
What are a couple places to farm gold for warlocks? They seem halfway between Hunter and mage, not being able to do either of those classes farms quite as well.
---
Thinking about the future release of Classic WoW or dropping into a private server. Would love some feedback on the experience of leveling a rogue vs priest? Ideally in a pvp server sine world pvp is so great 
---
I played druid in Vanilla WoW. Mostly feral (cat), in MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20. It was fun to play, and DPS was quite nice. The only classes I really could not match on the DPS meters were rogues and warriors. I could also be the savior of the day sometimes by providing emergency healing/tanking and battle resses. I could also heal Strat/UBRS/Scholo, etc, in feral spec. 
---
However when I returned to WoW during the Cataclysm expansion, I found druids to be much stronger than they were during vanilla: higher DPS, better tanks and able to have two talent specs at the same time. I think if you roll druid now, you will be outmatched on dps/tanking/healing, because players play their class much better now than they did during Vanilla WoW.
---
Somebody else lol, I went warlock
---
It was you who brought up raiding. 
---
Oh, the irony. You truly can't fix stupid. 
---
I think that's grossly over estimating the profit from mining isn't it.
---
You do know that not everyone plows through MC or even follows prebis lists. There are people even on pservers who are playing vanilla for the first time and have no idea what they are doing. Before you say they won’t get in raids, which would be incorrect anyways due to pserver players being the minority, you should know they have their own guilds. I believe people who either haven’t played since vanilla or people who have never played vanilla will make up the majority. It’s likely you will know who the pserver players/guilds are because they will have the best gear. 
---
DM coming out at launch only effects a very few who actually care about rushing. Tbh, you don’t even need prebis to do mc anymore.
---
Very interesting, def bookmarking this. Thanks for sharing!

Just bought a $1500 gaming laptop for WoW classic and justified it by also adding autodesk inventor and autocad. Didn’t get a cad graphics card though. 
---
How long's it take to farm a month's sub worth of gold/tokens?
---
No idea when they added it to the game but I've always liked that feature.
---
I showed it to my wife's boyfriend and he just shook his head disapprovingly :/
---
P.S. As I re-read what I wrote, I'm starting to agree with you that maybe Classic would be better for me than Retail. Sure I might not have many/any classes at max, but apart from not getting the full abilities for each class, that doesn't really affect me as much.
---
This is what peak performance looks like
---
Sure, but there are ways to make plenty of gold without any expansion buying.  
---
The one and only real villain. He killed / betrayed his father, his friends and all his kingdom. And because of him, death enveloped Azeroth like never before. Totally impossible to beat that...
---
takes like 15 hours of herbalism on my server, assuming everything sells
---
Counter point - for those who only play classic I have zero incentive to sell time tokens (aka buy gold) since it will never be useable for the version of the game I play. Don't get me wrong, thats a good thing for classic, but don't think that the lack of tokens in classic is some 5d chess move by blizzard to get even more money - its just not the target demographic for their game.
---
I feel personally attacked lmao

THANK YOU for not confusing QoL changes with drastic modifications to the underlying foundations of the game's design. Frightening how common that is.
---
You said Retail will always have expansions to buy? I’m sorry to who this might upset but I don’t think they’ll be making too many more. Fully believe legacy servers will take over and they’ll discontinue new projects. Might be in 2-3 years, but it’ll happen. 
---
My guess is they won't be but the progression patches are said to be 4 large patches and nowhere close to Live or even private server progression. I'm not guessing what will be in those patches until they are confirmed.
---
Do you think they'll ever let some of these fun bugs to take place? Part of the fun of Vanilla was discovering insane bugs like getting into Hyjall, leading bosses through Stormwind, or Blinking into Old IF.
---
The updated wow classic will probably use a bit more resources than the original. Should I upgrade to liquid cooling to compensate?
---
I don't believe there is Wrath variants to rings. Just normal body gear.
---
You're such a clown. Reginald Windsor post didn't get enough upvotes so you deleted it?

It's infuriating seeing this type of garbage here. PLEASE, stop making these.

It absolutely is.
---
Some good points made here. 
---
I don’t think that every single little feature should be baked into the default interface but some are obviously a lot more universally useful than others.

Depends what you do.

I have max bnet balance and by the end of my sub ill have at least 50+ $ extra in tokens 
---

---
Haha, I laughed. :) 
---
I just now realized that i havent seen the BFA login screen
---
I agree, some people are far too willing to drastically change things just because they weren’t ideal or aren’t in line with someone’s personal ideas. Lots of things weren’t ideal but the goal for 99% of things should (hopefully) be to replicate not replace.
---
ah very cool. so you sold your wow tokens for bnet credit instead of keeping them as tokens? I am reading here that "The maximum amount of Blizzard Balance you can have on your account is $350, or $110 if you don't have an Authenticator linked to your account." is that just so you don't have deal with retail? (at least for 2 years with your stockpile)

---
Instead of complaining about other classes, your complaining about another rogue.
---
**(Serious)** I want to say if you had the same gear, but they are lower level, they get more out of the stats from it. I could be mis-remembering, but this is how low level rogues could get the dodge cap at lower levels easier than the higher levels.

It surely was. U felt so cool because not many ppl have done that.
---
wut
---
I know that but you don't really play all 3, you specialize. If I were to go down tank route I'd miss the warrior perks, and same with each other respective role. 
---
I don't care about TBC, vanilla is infinitely better if you enjoy pvp at all. I think most people feel that way even if they enjoyed TBC(which I didn't). 
---
A lot of team effort goes into gearing someone up, if a Mage gets a BiS item in BWL then they can't just switch classes for AQ and Naxx. I was in a guild that completed Naxx in vanilla so seen it all. The only re-rolls that are acceptable is a DPS going into healing or main tank if they commit to those. I never saw a dps being allowed to re-roll into another dps class in all of vanilla. 
---
Locks are great farmer but not quit as good as hunters and mages.
---
We are as good at Mara as hunters and DM E lasher/satyer like mages I would argue. Do allright for hounds and guard in DM N.
---
We however can not farm full DM T runs like hunters or ZG crocs like mages.
---
Warlocks can also farm the demons in winterspring for the Eye of Shadow it is called iirc for the priest staff.
---
I would put mages and hunters as the best farming classes with warlocks behind them.
---
What was a shame? Its not like they made it a 5 man dungeon. 
---
Thought it was very cool that it didn't end up borderline wasted content, and was repurposed as an entry level raid.
---
LFR wasn't a thing yet, it wasn't a joke in wotlk.
---
Yes it's the early levels where mana is more the issue. This is why spell damage is key and the importance of having Wrath greens available while leveling Elemental. +damage spell gear (and you can load up rather silly numbers early using Wrath gear) is how mana efficiency improves. My test shaman at level 53 currently can kill about 6-8 mobs before needing to drink. Always wise to carry stacks of mana pots too.
---
It is very solid.  Mages or even priests can level there as well but I think the only classes that can do it efficiently are mages and paladin.   Like the guy said too, you might have to invest in some gear to be strong enough to manage it as well.  But it's fun.  I do the grind on private servers and it's quite easy at 60 especially once you get the hang of it. 
---

check out /r/woweconomy for tips - but as it stands right now, gold making's pretty slim / slow.
---
I got up to 15 million gold around BFA launch, it's pretty much converted to Bnet balance and waiting for Classic to buy gametime.
---
You joke, but I can't see that happening. There's absolutely nothing else new that could be done to WoW to make it any more different than it currently is. Cataclysm was such an enormous change to the game, and with BFA everything is just so, so different. *NOTHING* is the same. In fact it would be silly to even compare the games.
---
That said, with the majority of the opinion on current retail being negative, I don't see it becoming a sought-after game in the future, like Vanilla is.
---
Now, if Blizz ever pulls their heads out their asses and does a WoW 2.0? Then hell fucking yeah it's gonna be the best new MMO ever. But it seems like that ain't happening because fuck if I know.
---
It's all opinions at the end of the day. All opinions are equally valid and worthless at the same time. Sometimes I even wonder why people argue. Arguments only lead to conflicts.
---
Damn this is getting deeper than it should, apologies for my random banter.
---
I mean, it would be better if it wasnt just a recolor.
---
Its one thing to like vanilla wow in its entirety, its another to look at clear limitations from their time and budget and think its the holy grail of game design.

Me too, I was level 35 at the time and I had no idea what happened to me....untill I saw him with my own eyes. The carnage was real and the fun was epic. I never thought this was a non intended event and was quite sad I heard Blizzard was gonna fix it. The idea of not being safe inside a capital city when the real baddies invaded was pretty epic.

Old map 🤤
---
If you have token in your bags you have to login to use it.  
---
If you turn it into balance you can use it from the launcher.  
---
Also there's limit to how much tokens you can have in bags (i think its 10)  
---
so its always better to just turn them into balance  
---
Yeah, most probably will fail, and it is a ton of hours but its just (in my case anyway) frontloaded so I can get my main to 60 asap.  My hours per week will fall way off after that.
---
both are quite good at wPvP, rogues can gank the living shit out of everyone, while priest can easily "play" with undesirables, mind controlling or fearing them into groups of enemies.
---
rogues, however, can be way more easily caught with their pants down, while priests... let's just say most wise players don't attack leveling priests. 
---
for one, if the player is any good, they rarely dip below 80% mana, so they'll have reserves, for two, psychic scream has the ever present danger of fearing you into a group of mobs and DoTs tend kill you, even if you win. also, priest players are just as likely to be easy-going carebears as omnicidal maniacs that will corpse-camp you to hell and back.
---
as for leveling... priest is quite peaceful, if somewhat boring, but rogues are way too fragile for my tastes.
---
Nice! I'm wondering how viable a leveling area it is with a small group of 2-3. If I'm a rogue with a druid friend, I imagine I would want to pick up a 3rd with better aoe
---
Kaaris
---
I find the people who don’t care about server merges were never involved with one or on the receiving end of transfers/migrations in Vanilla.
---
I haven’t talked to a single person who was on the low pop realm receiving migrations/transfers that is pro server merges.
---
"Hey babe, now that we're all caught up on the shows, want to start Starbound with me?" 
---
"Nah." *starts another series
---
I agree with this. Once you get through all the poison and lockpicking grinds you only take care of yourself. And you can get paid for lockpicking if you decide to even do it.
---
Rogue/druid would have a really hard time as the only limited AOE you have is not enough to take down the mobs before they get you.  You'd probably be better off as quest partners or grinding elites perhaps since druid can tank it then stun/heal while you pound away DPS.
---
Also if you have three of you the xp/hour would crater and as a rogue you are honestly just dead weight.  There might be other instance trash you could solo that might be more effective that wouldn't require as much AOE.. like perhaps packs of three you sap/roots two of them and then kill one by one. 
---
BC and Vanilla were my favorites for login music. WotLK wins the award for FLAP FLAP BOOM INHALE S C R E E E E E E E E E C H FLAP FLAP tho.
---
I believe certain Auction House addons will solve these problems. just give it a few weeks and wow classic will have as many addons as all those private servers do :) don't worry about the small stuff. 
---
In the game why would a hunter pull instead of the MT?
---
Yes because the amount of virgins who play on them is about 20 times greater than what we will see on a real classic server. 
---
hi i just wanted to state theres a BC server you can play right now, do it because the changes already occured in outlands and the belf/draenei starting zone. The quest chaining was socially isolating because if someone wasn't part of their chain it would be detremental to group, since quests where designed to either "be" a gorup section and a solo section there was even less incentive to group

I regretfully wasn't around in vanilla, what was the purpose of the dream dragons/portals? Do they drop anything? Quests?
---
I hope to finally level a character with my brother to 60. We both played vanilla pservers but got interrupted due to the servers shutting down. When I was real young, he told me about his experiences in vanilla, and I hope when classic comes we will play till 60, raid, pvp, and make memories.
---
this is great info. thanks for sharing!
---
So what will a 3K gaming PC do?
---
Thanks, that actually really clears things up. 
---
It's Warrior! Get a macro so you cast battle shout automatically if it's not up, and then there's nothing but health.
---
Kill enough humanoids so you don't run out of bandages. (which happens naturally)
---
You can get cooking if you want, takes up a few bag spaces, (especially early game when leveling it up takes a bit of effort) I'd say it's mostly so you don't have to go to town to buy food, the buff doesn't really matter that much. Each new area you enter has a cooking type quest that earns you a local recipe, so you can just hunt a few of that animal if you ever need food.
---
Druid is a close second place. I like to go high spirit and feral/balance for low chore reasons personally :) Cast til almost out of mana then stay cat or bear til you have mana again. Has a little bit of a warlock feel, no drinking but constantly moving and thinking, same goes for warrior too if you do a lot of rage management and can stick to bandaging.
---
Some people do come off as very militant about it. "It's not classic unless there's loot-lag".
---
Nixxiom has some good classic vids too.
---
Thing is, everyone seems to have a different idea of what "small, reasonable changes" are. Like, to me, right-click reporting is a good, commonsense change, but I've seen people in this sub say it's going to have a detrimental effect on the community.
---
Relive what i did years ago
---
I've never understood this mentality. Life is an exercise in compromise and sacrifice, the things we sacrifice makes everything we experience more meaningful. Choosing between spending time with your family and playing a video game is a compromise you make, the consequences of that are that you may not experience the entirety of the video game and that's fine.
---
It's missing out on that experience that makes the parts you do experience more special. If you're spoon-fed the whole thing then nothing you've done really matters because you were given it for no cost.
---
Redridge was a favorite of mine for ally
---
This argument shares alot of similarities to the war on drugs. If heroin was available at your local 7/11 would you buy it ? Anyone that wants these black market goods has the means to do so already.
---
The black market will be there and all the problems that come along with it. In this case, accounts being hacked, credit cards being stolen etc. People who want to buy gold will buy it. It is going to happen 100%
---
Selling the wow token completely eliminates that. Now I DONT think or want a wow token in classic. But if it is already going to happen why not bring it out in the light and have blizzard regulate it ? People will always want to get ahead and the ones who cant be asked to farm will buy it one way or another.
---
If blizzard does not implement tokens, they are going to have to come down VERY hard on both buyers and sellers. With them trying to pinch every penny possible does it sound like this is something they would go out of their way for ? I'm not shure but I hope so
---
This. You could roll for anything.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience, but this post seems to be about private server gameplay discussion, and would be better suited for r/wowservers so I've removed this post as a Rule #1. If you feel this is an error, please send us a ModMail.
---
Thanks for understanding.
---
The portals occasionally spawn a world boss green dragon, they have some decent loot but nothing important to progression (I think there was some decent nature resist gear which helped and a few other good but not irreplaceable pieces). They were kind of a bitch to kill much like any other world boss, especially factoring in opposing faction raids attacking you. My guild that had cleared BWL took a few cracks at Emeriss one time that he spawned in vanilla and didn’t have any luck, but he was probably the worst of the four (IIRC).
---
I love me my Druid, but I've played it A LOT on private servers and I am worried about one MAJOR issue:
---
- All of our current macros and addons won't likely work and Druid (along with Hunters) are very macro heavy classes if played to their full potential. 
---
I will level 2-3 classes tiered due to how rest xp works and the professions I want per account. Shaman will be my primary however as it barely requires jack to start out ... until I understand how to duplicate my current macro list and functionality for playing a proper, power shifting feral.
---
But... scheduled maintenance took all day.
---
One of my biggest fears for classicwow is that on launch day I roll on a server that a streamer rolled on without me knowing it. I’m gonna have to refill and I’ll be stuck behind the pack. That’s why Blizzard needs to release all of the servers names before classicwow releases. By this I mean they say all of the server names like sargeras, illidan, dalaran, etc and what country and time zone they are in. 
---
ALSO! Pay attention to what server famous private server guilds like NOPE/APES roll on because you don’t want them on your server.
---
Nothing about the way blizzard currently designs games makes think WoW 2 would be any good at all if they ever made it 
---
Heroin in ones and zeros
---
Yep. I was a bit of an ahole sometimes. Someone clearing mobs around a node. I would mine the ore while they were busy. Talk about being abused. Lol. And it was for the lols mainly. Had it happen to me as well. So all is fair in love and war.
---
Lol u guys are funny. They are still making billions on wow every year.
---
Either an updated classic with new stuff that keeps the spirit of the game in tact, or were going to TBC which seems like the most logical option
---
Oh okay, well thank you that helps!
---
*euro sign*
---
*is a meme*
---
Wait a second...
---
IIRC, guards would keep spawning
---
Though I appreciate the timeliness of a good Marie Kondo meme, and yeah Classic is almost assuredly going to be more fun than BFA, I'm removing this post as a Rule #7 circle-jerk post. If you feel this is unfair or incorrect, please shoot us a ModMail and we can discuss it/another mod can review my action.
---
Leaving this comment for transparency/explanation to others.
---
Thanks for your understanding.
---
My idea oh no changes is ultimately zero changes because in my opinion (not that it matters to anyone) if we’re okay with changes, however big or small. It opens the door for them change things, they won’t stop.
---
People like/liked vanilla as is and if they start changing things, regardless of what it might be, some people may not like the game anymore. Well that’s just my two cents, if they start changing things, it’s inevitable that people won’t like them and lose interest as many people have through all the expansions and changes.
---
I quite like a lot of qol changes they have made over the years and I’ve disliked other things they’ve changed, any qol improvements they make won’t bother me, simply because it’s a change. Moreso because they may not stop from there is all.
---
There's a reason they're referred to as huntards
---
it doesn't matter that much, the +5 is like 0.2% hit rating and 0.2% crit.
---
I find the mage thing to be irrelevant.
---
Every class that has mana has to drink once and a while at some point. If you dislike this. You won’t like the game at all.
---
Wrong template. Tip is grey.
---
No it's wrong
---
I'm not a 100% sure but I believe its more about glancing blows reduction.
---
I was thinking of doing this if I end up quitting retail. Currently enjoying the new raid with my guild and trying to maintain my gold reserve. If I end up swapping to full-time classic I may just finance the first 2-3 years of game time with WoW gold I have no use for.
---

---
Ah yep, I understand. I forgive you! &lt;3
---
In a lot of cases, timing can have a huge effect on gameplay.  There were a lot of things that have changed with spell and resource timing.  For example:
---
* Shadow Word: Death (which I believe was added in TBC, maybe WotLK, but bear with me) would do a small amount of damage to yourself when you used it.  But this damage was processed a tad late, which meant you could use it right before you get polymorphed and damage yourself out.  
---
* Mana and energy used to regen in ticks every 2 seconds (either 20 energy, or 40% of your MP/5 value) instead of a constant stream.  Over the course of a fight it's not too different, but it allowed Rogues and Druids to essentially start a fight with 120 energy if they timed it right.
---
* The way stuns worked in Vanilla you would stop in your tracks, even if in midair.  Later the physics changed and you could move forward while stunned.  This could affect whether you land where you want to or not.
---
Some things might seem like small issues, timing can mean a lot.
---
I want a paladin with an aracanite reaper 
---
I totally forgot that we will have Kel'thuzad's original Voice Actor back in vanilla, the amazing Michael McConnohie.
---
Not the awful guy they used in the Wrath of the Lich King Naxx remake (they let McConnohie do the voice of Arthas instead, and because they wanted to avoid confusion they didn't allow him to do both characters. So bad.)

This is amazing

Weapon skill increases your hit chance by 2% for the human/orc racial +5, so you'll notice an increase in threat generation even when there's no autohits.
---
&gt; It's Correct. It was blonde until MOP  [](https://i.imgur.com/WSflIIC.png)
---
Sure, take Joana for instance. Joana is a speed leveler, he levels from 1 to 60 in wow as fast as he's able, that's his thing. There's no argument that Joana loves "the journey" of vanilla WoW. In his journey he doesn't read quest text whatever, he just seeks out the most efficient path on his journey.
---
He's still there for the journey but goes about that journey in a very different way and that's just fine.
---
a good game
---
In the pentium era integrated graphics weren't really a thing, you literally couldn't load 3d objects with them. The bare minimum was like a geforce 2, which was a super old card by 2005.
---
I never said that and even edited my post 5 hours ago to better iterate that it was not my intention to send that message. None of the changes I suggest had been done before in wow so i dont know where this "we've done these before and see where they lead" is coming from. None of the changes I've suggested have offered anything but new content and items while keeping the level cap at 60. If you don't like that change ok that's fine what would you recommend, but you dont recommend shit. You just preach about how shit wouldn't work, what do you suggest would make it work. You dont provide input though you just say "you're wrong we've seen this" while providing zero examples while somehow conflating I'm promoting blizzards suggested changes. You also say "Your problems with the current system" I don't have a problem with current vanilla, I have a problem with its sustainability. You can still love the old and continue to improve upon it without tarnishing what makes it good (Like retail has) but as I said you can't seem to  grasp that you seem to think that I'm implying the entire system needs to change to make it work, which it doesn't, but the game needs something else to provide long term sustainability to it. But the fact that people are even trying to have that discussion seems to genuinely anger you. I guess your afraid the game will die again but are to short sited to see that's what will happen in a few short years if blizzard just relaunches it and leaves it. Sure they may keep the servers up (which I have a hard time believing with the companies current direction) but 200-300 players per server 1 to 2 years after nax isnt enough to keep a community engaged.
---
God damnit I hope we get auto loot instead of having to shift click every mob too. Half the reason I hate pservers. And yes I know there's an add-on but it didn't work for me idk why
---
I can see the logic in that. I guess the whole situation is a wait and see sort of thing. 
---
Put it in and many others as a checkable option.

Ok, I'm talking about loot lag, which is a bug, and OP is talking about shift+clicking text in the AH, which is so minor I don't think anyone would mind. Your examples are spell batching, mana/energy ticks, and stun mechanics, which are all in a very different realm of changes. I understand why your examples matter, but the 'loot lag' no changes crowd (who do exist) are the ones I don't get.
---
I will tell you this bro. If you wanna be casual in classic it's about picking the right class. If you wanna play a warrior. Yes you absolutely need to be HC with the time to play. No bones about that.
---
If you wanna be competitive in pvp but, don't have a crazy amount of free time. I would highly recommend playing a caster. The reason why is that two items go into making a caster an absolute threat in pvp. The only two things you need are Zandalar Hero Charm (drops from 10 man) The other thing is Talisman of Ephemeral Power (Drops from MC). If you play a caster that is all you really need for endgame pvp. It won't be easy to get as it's very in demand but, my point is that it comes from highly accessible content.
---
All of that being said. The reason why I like classic more is because for me as someone without a lot of time the classes are pretty easy to understand and, play. They also take a lot to master if thats what you want as well. One of the things you will find in classic is that. They made the game before they decided what casual people need is bleached hardcore content. The leveling is more engaging. The spontaneous pvp around the world you will constantly find yourself in. It all makes it a far better experience.
---
You forgot half-baked mage!

I do like getting raped .... repeatedly 😃.

He he its funny because you think kids play Vanilla.

I'm looking forward to playing a game without hand holding.  I rolled a fresh warlock on a retail server to see if I could practice exploration routes (doesn't work at all, if anyone else is thinking of trying).  
---
Literally the very first thing that happens is that you get assigned a lackey to follow you around.  Apparently the starting zone is so hard that you need a helper to make it past the level 1 mobs.  I'm looking forward to being dropped into the game, and that's it, go explore.

Tailoring can craft you Truefaith Vestment. You will probably not replace it for 6 months.

I know hunter has some "advanced" macros like the TBC one but everything else will have no issue

---
/stopcasting

I don't see what special macro would druid need  
---
&gt;The goal behind Classic WoW is not "obtain a huge playerbase and another wildly popular product". It is "re-create the original experience as an homage to our roots and to help provide the authentic experience that no longer exists."
---
I think that's a very optimistic outlook to have with the direction blizzard has been going taking them at their word is very hard. Especially when it comes to a profit margin. 
---
 "follows the spiritual/design philosophies of vanilla" How is this hard to understand. Vanilla had 12 content updates none of those "ruined it" I'm saying you can add stuff to vanilla and still have it be vanilla. Adding kara to vanilla as another 60 raid would not ruin it. I can't see how some people view that as a bad thing. How is new content that doesn't violate the gameplay and design of vanilla spoil the experience?
---
Not gonna lie I've spent over £2k twice on pc builds entirely for wow and almost £2k for a laptop for the same reason. But I think we've all done that. Add in peripherals, subs for up to 3 accounts, server/race transfers etc and the game has easily cost me over £10k
---
The chipset had an Intel GMA 950. This PC was so old the integrated graphics were on the motherboard instead of the CPU!
---
You can be somewhat competitive without them. You can go daggers and use Aged Core Leather Gloves, Mugger's belt and Circlet of restless dreams instead but human with swords is still going to be better in full BiS I think. But, in practice, everyone in your guild wants a sword if you are alliance side (rogues included). If you can get ACLG and some daggers from raid then you don't need to shell out 1000g for Edgemaster's and you can buy Cloudkeeper's instead or something. ACLG + Muggers + Cloud will be better than human with Edgemasters+Devilsaur legs I imagine.  So you can go that route and actually get drops, spread out loot for your guild, and still compete in DPS. Later on, you might not be able to keep up with someone who gets CTS.. But, if you show your skills by topping DPS in MC with your daggers, you might just get CTS. Hard to say.  
---
For tanking honestly it feels really bad not being human. Hit cap is very important for having good threat, and having to wear 3% more hit for non humans means you often have to either cut tanky gear or hope for some really good pieces that the dps also want to take from you like Onslaught Girdle and Chromatic Boots.  Again, daggers is a decent option here.  Edgemaster's can still be great for a DW tank threat setup. But not necessary for traditional sword+board  I would say.   
---
The value points are at +5, +10 and +15 skill. You don't really want to have +14 skill. But this is one of the things people expect to be different in classic than on private servers. Some say that the jump from +10 to +15 won't really be worth it anymore.   
---
Cataclysm was an act of mass vandalism.
---
Lol please I spent 2k on my RTX rig just so I could play WoW Classic at 10,000 FPS.
---
You're gonna download an addon just like we used to.
---
You want to make new content without making old content obsolete.  By that very nature, the new content is obsolete.  So people in search of power creep (the people that get bored after Naxx) will have no use for it.
---
But people in search of a different experience (the ones who level alts, who you say are the only ones who would stay anyone) are the ones who would benefit most from this content.
---
So you have a problem that Group A will leave and Group B will be the only ones left.  Then your solution is to add in content that Group B will want and will be of no use to Group A.  That doesn't resolve your problem.
---
You say I don't recommend anything.  DUH.  I'm on team no changes.  Not only do I not recommend anything.  In fact, I recommend nothing.
---
You have a problem with Vanilla.  You think it won't last.  You have identified a problem that is 3 years in the future. 
---
You say "I never said that" then say "I edited my post".  So did you never say it, or did you take it back?
---
You can't even keep straight from sentence to sentence what you want.  You want changes, but only certain changes.  You want something after Naxx, but not that makes anything else obsolete.  You want to retain the players who push power creep to its limit, with a solution that wouldn't work for them.  You think Vanilla is great but it needs fixing.
---
The longer your wall of text, the more inconsistencies I see in what you're saying.  And you're making a lot of guesses about the population when we don't even know what the population will be on launch day, let alone 3 months after launch.
---
don't care, but i would care about stuff like 1 big bag instead of 5 or any tool to organize or sort items. deceleration from daily life and taking the time for that stuff is, to me, a very important element of vanilla. 
---
I am hoping for server communities. I'm hoping to have the adventure at my pace, instead of rushing to 60. Retail is great for me as a casual player but is overwhelming to me with all of the achievements, systems, etc. I want Classic to "Marie Kondo" WoW for me.
---
Keep in mind as well. The go online and, copy other people style of play was around in classic as well but, also far less popular. Why? Because in classic if you hit 60 with a Shaman. You are a Shaman thats your life now. No way in hell you are going reroll if you decide some other flavor of the month is better. Classic solves that problem by simply exhausting those people. 
---
*immersion*
---
Thanks for the feedback @collax974
---
so many 60 zones, i was hoping there'd only be a couple so wpvp would be concentrated 
---
lol ok. It's just my opinion. The long time meta of private vanilla servers is a unique experience. If you choose to run with the top players (the ones who invest a shit ton of time and are on the edge of progression where all the memes reside. 
---
Life is very, very good when not surrounded by these sorts of players if that is not the social aspect you want from a game. I gave up on that years ago. This happens when you grow up and want maturity around you.
---
Always nice when users validate the roadmap.
---
Nice map.  Missing RFK across the road from RFD
---
Just so you can look at them these are the two items I mean. Keep in mind pre Naxx. I think a mages spellpower from gear caps at like 350. So you can immediately see why these two trinkets are so deadly.

Paladin does not have a taunt. If you want to play one as a DPS or tank you will need to bring consumables, or play in a very casual guild. Very casual guilds spend much more time raiding, 2-4 nights a week rather then 1.
---
Warrior is easier to gear for the tanking role then paladins are. Warriors are very gear dependent when it comes to DPS and PvP.
---
Druids can be crit by bosses and just die. Other then that they are fine. Easiest class to gear in the game for PvP and tanking. Warden staff is bloody expensive though.
---

I use to play priv servers well chilling in bed. I need to find a laptop again

From your comment I just realized I can finally be one of the people that has vacation to take for this exact moment.

I'm trying to level a character to lvl 20 on retail to post on the forums and I just can't do it. It's mind numbingly boring.
---
Meanwhile, I'm level 56 on my third soon-to-be level 60 character on pserver along with many low level alts, enjoying every day of it.

---
I was playing a Pserver last night. Killing quillboars on my level 12 warrior. A warlock was on the same quest so he grouped up with me. He was pulling 3 mobs at once and killing 2 before I could even finish 1 unless I got a crit. If I so much as looked at 2 mobs at the same time odds were good I would die.
---
Jokes on him though. When I get geared up I can tank dungeons. Take all the durability damage. Then pay much higher repair costs then him. Then we will see who the better class is!

Just keep up with the leveling curve. The reason why the hardcore FRESH players on private servers power level is to stay ahead of the curve.
---
Every single ganker that uses his t2 or better toon to gank lowbie zones for 10-16 hours a day (oh you will get to know them by name trust me) never had put up with the abuse they dish out.
---
The big names in pvp power level to avoid the shit the rest of the population puts up with. If multi-boxing is allowed expect this to be worse. This is why I hope to find a rather obscure server devoid of hardcore private server crowd. Fuck streamers, they are a small issue compared to the guilds full of the same players that have been powerleveling since early Nost.
---
You either play hardball with these guys or you forever become the player who avoids nearly all content when it 1st hits a server. Even if you have 4 rl friends to play with, you will be not compete with the top guilds controlling the content progression in ALL areas of the game.
---
This is the REAL meta of private vanilla. Content control, AH control, BG control, RAID progression control, World 1st control, zone control (even their OWN faction as they will zone snipe you and harass their own faction members away if it's a pvp server), etc.
---
And yet, Arthas did nothing wrong. He was initially lead by his conscience, arguably betrayed by that square Uther and that self righteous basic bitch Jaina, then slowly slipped into madness.

A truly interesting multidimensional villain.
---
You're seriously complaining about having to press the shift key?
---
Ninja looting is serious business in WoW. Some things that are not BoP are still very valuable and warrant discussion, like Tome of Conjure Food. It's important that there is the conscious decision to press the shift key to auto loot something.
---
There's no way pressing the shift key is actually too much for you.
---
Just WTF is he wearing and why? 
---
Sauce pls
---
Can't see shit on this one tho. 
---
More than likely farming Arcane Crystals...if its too packed, I'll just run lowbie instances solo for greens and other drops.
---
In fact, every fucking mobs, thousands and thousands of mobs yes, I dont know like pressing the shift key every damn mob. And I am also against loot trading and and conscious about what I pick up as others can see it and I care about my rep.  
---
I'm 90% sure they will have autoloot, so I don't even know why I am commenting
---
This isn't drug dealers out in the open world, this is a 100% virtual and digital game which Activision Blizzard has complete control over.
---
The two legitimate reasons Activision Blizzard has is
---
A: they don't want to pay for the resources needed to combat gold selling and
---
B: they want a cut of the action.
---
The good players just masturbate while on flight paths. 
---
no, people raid every tier of endgame content, no matter how far the content has progressed. i don't think any content, in all of azeroth from 1-60, ever got removed or changed up. it's also not really the last patch, they will progressively release new content. 1.12 only affects spells, talents and maybe items if they're lazy. 
---
&gt;I'm saying you can add stuff to vanilla and still have it be vanilla.       
---
That has never happened, though. Call me pedantic, but vanilla did not exist when the content that comprises it was current. Vanilla as a concept only came into existence when additional content arrived, supplanted and/or modified it.        
---
To that end, vanilla's scope is very defined and very finite. Yes, when it was current  it was added to, but all those additions are now neatly  catalogued and compartmentalized. I do not think it is accurate to argue that adding content *now* is equivalent to adding content in 2005-6.       
---
Besides, we can't even wholly agree as a community what "gameplay and design of vanilla" *means*, so how could we ever be in a position to say with confidence that new content conforms to it?
---
The Icon for wailing cavern is wrong.
---
Classic had trial accounts to level 20
---
this one is really good, but doesnt have a few FP, like in ungoro or searing gorge
---
Yeah it's so annoying to have to click stuff.  Why don't they just put in garrisons so you don't have to go out into the world to click?  It's too hard to find enough dreamfoil anyway.
---
&gt; My idea of no changes is ultimately zero changes because in my opinion (not that it matters to anyone) if we’re okay with changes, however big or small. It opens the door for them change things, they won’t stop.
---
The fact is that door is already open because of the update to the new client, starting with 1.12 talents but launch content, loot sharing, sharding and so forth.
---
Lol you're really taking this off the deep end. It's a shame for you they will have it in the client anyways. Have fun standing up on your slippery slopr
---
Would this layout work with WotLK too?
---
Oregano?
---
Yeah because I'm about to build one lol.
---
&gt;when I rolled on a brand new server and it took 6 hours to get to level 5,
---
Ironic because this experience of chaos and competition, and finally breaking away from the pack, was among my absolute favorite experiences I've had on pservers.
---
Some of the friends I made helping each other get quests and tags, who I could tell clearly were "pro" and not "noobs," stayed my friends and two of us even ended up in the same competitive guild.
---
They've already stated they're not mucking with the regen rates, it will still tick in the old slow system of updates.
---
Yep, sounds like a good thing. Trial to level 10. No sending mail, no auction house, talking in public channels and no whispers to anyone who doesn't have you on friends list.
---
A level 60 shaman for one thing.
---
What did you possibly buy specifically for wow classic 
---
Why would one do this? Just for completionist's sake? Both Gelkis and Magram rep rewards seem absolutely useless and only worth it for exp from the quests.
---
If their servers can't handle hundreds of people in the same spot, then we've got a bigger problem than sharding in starting zones.
---
Why a laptop as opposed to a desktop
---
I just made 800G selling those Hardgards so certainly must have important still on the private server I am on. ;)
---
The confirmation window only tells you the item is BoP, and it appears just the same whether you roll need or greed.
---
It is something among the lines of "Looting &lt;item&gt; will bind it to you" and nothing more.
---
Apologies mods, I didn't read the rules before posting 😅 have a great day
---
If you played the AH you would probably be able to generate a significant amount of gold for small amounts of play time/alt tabbing.
---
I forget if TSM can list auctions for you while alt tabbed (where you queue them up), but it doesn't matter too much.
---
I hope they will introduce it a little later. Maybe after 2 months after release.
---
Ganking hillsbrad or redridge depending on faction.
---
&gt; What was a shame?
---
The fact that Tier 7 Naxx was a fucking cakewalk. KT died the same day the raid opened. The only final tier bosses to die the same day they were released (not counting singular boss instances like Magtheridon or Obsidian Sanctum) are Naxx KT and Xavius in Emerald Nightmare. That is some shit fucking company to be in, Ensidia got WF for every Naxx boss AND Malygos in one day. That's fucking insane.
---
Level 60 &gt; gold/gear/mount/consumables/professions in one big orgy  
---
The idea that there is nothing to do if you're the only level 60 has survived for far too long. There is plenty to do alone at 60.  
---
I can try, will think about it xD 
---
go play retail ... you get your progress reset every 2 years
---
permanet value of stuff is exacty one of the main things that this wow classic movement is about
---
I need to hit 60 on a PVP server without a single HK.  
---
You just created a goal for me.  
---
Not just decent. They drop some BiS forever loot for certain classes like [https://classicdb.ch/?item=20628](https://classicdb.ch/?item=20628) (Deviate Growth Cap), so if you can secure kills it immensely helps progression with both sick pieces and OP nature resist gear. 
---
...what job, family, and social life?
---
You have to open it up in imgur. It’s very high rez 
---
That's my plan. Going to be starting an alt rogue guild on the biggest NA PVP streamer server and recruit like-minded trolls.  
---
Honestly this is one area where sharding would work wonders. 
---
The problem about recreating a game under a dedicated subscription as part of it's game play principle, is that allowing any player to play without a sub is detrimental to the paying audience.
---
At least sharded newbies will be able to talk to themselves and perhaps still have a channel open to those wanting to give advice from the core player base. Otherwise, you are locked out of chat channels, locked out of AH, can't trade, etc. in order to avoid exploits and gold farmers.
---
I actually expect Blizzards attempts to combat the old issues of mmorpgs to be what impacts Classic greatly. It may be hard to stomach such changes but certainly likely better than free rein gold farmers.
---
The lore in Classic is more fragmented than future expansions.
---
It's explored little pieces at a time and the entire game doesn't have a centralized story arc. The lore isn't forced on you, rather it's at your discretion if you want to dig around and learn more for yourself.
---
You could easily play the whole game and remain mostly ignorant to the layered story aspects, as they mostly happen in the background of your main objectives. It isn't necessary at all to ever catch up if you take time off.
---

&gt; Tipsout, Esfand, Staysafe

These three are rolling on the same PVP server together. Horde, Alliance, Alliance, and having their own guilds.

You underestimate the core group of microtransaction whales, skinner box addicts, and dollhouse enthusiasts.
---
Retail WoW will retain its target core audience of milking cows for as long as Activision Blizzard wants.

Feralas and Un'goro are exp monsters  a good route will net you 2ish levels in each zone very quickly.  Favorite zone\`s to level in are the plaguelands.
---
Alliance Warrior racials: 
---
If your goal is PvP play gnome. You'll just regret not picking gnome if you don't.
---
Human if you want to do slightly higher DPS in raids for some reason. The boss was going to die either way. But you got a slightly higher number then the other guy. Very cool.
---
NE is the most useful in the open world. 50% of your time leveling a warrior will be ghost running. You're a vanilla warrior. Shadowmeld while you eat. Shadowmeld and wait for the priest to come to you. Objectively the coolest looking in all the tier gear as well.
---
Dwarves make fighting rogues easier. That is already easy for warriors though. Don't play dwarf.
---
Horde Warrior racials:
---
Play Orc lol
---
But you'd all have fones rite?
---
That’s a good point, as I said I’m not against some of the things they’re doing, mostly worried about them not stopping and ruining the game for people who want to play vanilla because they liked how it was back then.
---
Those low poly squirrels are going to look great in 4K
---
No need to apologise! 
---
No
---
Play an actual MMORPG again and not the insta teleport theme park they have become. 
---
One simple rule to remember folks: Better is not better.
---
From what I understand, it adds a small amount of +hit but more importantly it helps negate the effect of glancing blows.
---
A boss is considered a level 63 mob, so having 305 weapon skill takes that from an "orange" mob to a "yellow" one. This is the biggest bonus you can get. Additional weapon skill is still very good, but not as much of a boost as that initial +5.
---
I'm not sure if this info was from pservers or retail Vanilla, but the way melee attacks are rolled out is a factor here. From what I've heard, glancing blows make that swing unable to be a crit. Since misses, dodges, parries and glancing blows all come before hits/crits on the rng, it limits your crit cap.
---
Example: 15% chance to miss + 15% chance to be parried, 15% chance to be dodged and 40% chance to glance = 85% of your swings can't crit, meaning you're restricted to a crit cap of 15% unless you can bring those hinderances down.
---
I'm no expert on the subject and am just echoing info that I've heard over the years from many sources claiming the same thing.
---
I don't even know what most of that is. That being said I haven't been able to play this game seriously since TBC. I keep trying to come back but, I just can't enjoy it. My vision of retail since WOTLK is that I want so bad to like the game but, I just don't. It's just a hot mess.
---
To me the old game felt like a "boring" world. Where exciting stuff happened sometimes. The new game tries so hard to be epic all the time. It just ends up being too much. Nothing is ever exciting because everything is always exciting. I just can't go for it.
---
During closed Beta, the Flypoints were buggy. You could fly a little with the Griffons.
---
Was the biggest glitch I found during beta.
---
Worth it.
---
Man good luck with this crowd. Theyve killed all enjoyment of this sub for me.
---
Sounds great
---
Leveling speed is about class utility. Druids are not a high damage class, but they level extremely fast compared to rogues.
---
The map makes it seem like there are more level 60 zones than there really are. The zones like Moonglade and Deadwind Pass are high levels zones but there's not much there, so usually a low population. From what I remember, Silithus (outside of AQ) is the big max level PvP spot, trailed by Eastern Plaugelands. The other places outside of big raids also had plenty of max level PvP, such as Stranglethorn Vale (Zul'Gurub) and the two zones outside of BRD/BRS/Molten Core.
---
"Looking at you human warrior. How much is that +5 swords and maces really worth?" 
---
Honestly everything. The only reason I say this is because you are competing in the class where the HC players are most concentrated. People who want to raid fury are not uncommon. Warriors are normally the most populated class. The way you get a raid slot as a warrior is to be the best. To hit every goal.
---
All of that being said. This is classic wow and, they will bring 40 people. If you are charismatic. You can dps on a prot warrior. People will bring you lol.
---
I feel ashamed
---
Play causally and have fun. But I'll play horde this time and a hunter. Looking forward to visiting STV and killing some cloth wearers for now.
---
It's hard for me to imagine what it would be like to level without a breathing world. Are you going to start at 1 or buy a boost?
---
Damn he was a thicc boi.
---
EPL PvP brings back such good memories.  
---
Way too many druids leveling on the pserver im on right now right now, and they all think they expect to dps. Most don’t ever plan on healing or tanking. Man what a let down when you find out you’re healing in endgame.
---
I’m on the no changes camp, so I will be running classic on the same machine specs I used during vanilla. 5-15 FPS during raids and PvP was part of the experience.
---
This is 100% correct in my opinion. Classic wow is a far more open and, accessible game to new players. This alone will give it a serious edge.
---
Classic comes with a retail subscription, so you'll be able to check out retail then.
---
I hated healing in endgame, and realized I loved being in cat or bear form most f all. So I rolled a rogue main and warrior as an alt. Best wow decision I ever made.
---
Pretty sure it would be the same. Cataclysm is when they ruined it.
---
This is what I’m looking forward to most! Being able to play “vanilla” with a framerate higher than 20 fps and a stable internet connection. This time I can actually run dungeons!!!!
---
hah waiting for the last parts to arrive next week havent had a pc for a long time and will mainly play wow ,needless to say the price has been significantly higher than in the meme,so hyped
---
They were all optionally done with 10 people. I remember early into WoW people ran them with 10 people more often due to the difficulty. The only one people still routinely run as 10 man is UBRS.
---
A great service, but some questionable text color choices. For example, can barely see Dun Morogh's level text.
---
Herbing and fishing and repping

 Stop. I can only get so erect from the memories.

---
Meh, most of it will happen in Blackrock mountain anyway. Everyone is going to be running the instances there.
---
Thats a no from me dawg.
---
They can also introduce new content for the people that might not be doing Naxx. They could introduce new dungeons and questlines. They could introduce new raids that are as difficult as existing raids and give loot as good as existing raids but with different itemization.
---
Those players who have no hope of ever entering Naxx might still like having new content now and again.
---
