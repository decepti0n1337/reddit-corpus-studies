When classic was announced there was a huge outcry for changes. That seems to mostly have died out.
---
---
---
Druids too
---
How can your summer be "classic" if we only get to play classic for a small minority of the summer?
---
On that already, though I’m afraid once classic releases I’ll lose all motivation to go..
---
Rested is more like a 50% increase, not 100%. So it would be like doing 6 characters instead of 4.    
---
  
---
This plan doesn't really make any sense though because playing in rested is inevitable and obvious when playing multiple characters, as long as you rest in an Inn and take turns playing the characters, it doesn't require a special strategy. You'd have to very purposely play badly to avoid rested experience if you were trying to level 3 characters at once. One of the nice things about rested is you level faster for the same amount of quests, so you tend to run out of quests less and don't have to spend as much time grinding or travelling to find quests. A bad thing is you level faster compared to the the amount of mobs you kill so you end up making less money for a given level.
---
What does that change? honest question, only played horde in vanilla
---
Nice. I miss guild forums with neat avatars and such.
---
yeah early lvl tanking sucks generally, the rage starve is real.... but I heard that the Battleshout AoE threat only works if you're not buffed already, i.e. once every 2 minutes... we'll have to wait for classic to get that sorted tho
---
The more interesting events the better!
---
Get a jump on professions, at minimum.
---
That's impossible. If "literally every player" got attacked while outnumered or outleveled but never attacked others when they were outleveled or numbered, then no-one would be attacked while outnumbered or outleveled.
---
I think he meant Mining and Cooking delayed him and made his time higher because he was mining ores or crafting food
---
Lets talk about the noob tank that pulls at 35% health
---
If you read the comments you can get a confirmation that it works even if people already have it applied in your group :D
---
Works on pservers and in Original Vanilla :D
---
Stranglehorde Vale
---
Pretty sure they said it’s based off 7.3.5
---
It's called a fap. (Free action potion)
---
When I was much younger when vanilla first came out there was an older guy who always came into the same computer cafe as me. My parents would drop me off on weekends with some friends and this guy was there everytime. Once his kid came to tell him his mom, the wife, is calling him. The son was persistent because he knew his father and sadly so did his wife. Until the guy yelled at his son, "TELL MOM IM BUSY!" the whole place went silent but he continued. This is just one story of this guy as he gave us a new story every week. Also gave me the ability to regulate myself when playing games.
---
Yes, do you just have a problem understanding or why do you need to repeat it? My lvl 30 ud rogue in vanilla wasn't exacly wreaking havoc ganking noobs.
---
+ speed, and biggest bags you can get!
---
Wasn't thinking weekend the non PvP weekend?   Or am I making stuff up?    Damn it's been a minute.
---
doesnt work on all pservers, and I generally don't trust people's 15 year old memory about the state of the game during one particular patch (1.12). I hope that it works (it makes tanking easier), and it is definitely something that should be included in warrior tanking tips, but imo the prudent thing is to wait for classic before making factual statements about it.
---
&gt; Rested is more like a 50% increase, not 100%. So it would be like doing 6 characters instead of 4. 
---

---
You should also take into the account all the extra traveling you'd have to do to get to and back from the Inn every time you switch characters
---
Classic
---
Priest is hella fast compared to Paladin lmao? Paladin is probably the third slowest, warrior and rogue being the slowest two.
---
Chuck nourish
---
Well there is an arcane resist buff an MC-able mob in the plaguelands can give you. I did my best as a rogue to assemble a shazz outfit so I could dps. I did get to melee on shazz at least one attempt. Worth
---
&gt; we excel with ~~people~~ HEALERS around us.
---
FTFY
---
What? I don't understand the question. Why would it be a problem? I'm just saying that Classic won't be based on 7.3.5 but whatever client version is the latest. At the time Classic releases it'll probably be based on 8.2 or 8.2.5.
---
That is quite true, let's hope I we are not wrong and therefore not leading classic newbies into tanking the wrong way. If you ever get a bad tank you can blame me :')
---
i mean what else would he mean? how is it even possible to misunderstand that
---
Great break down, thanks!
---
Every dungeon is m+30
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
yeah it was 3-4k.  Healers also had -20% for range plus salv plus they were team healing the tank and the tank had some shadow resist just from priest buff and t2 pieces, plus the tank was getting rage from being damaged.  I dunno, he's not buffing anyone but himself with battle shout so... pretty negligible threat generator.
---
idk dude ask the guy I replied to lol
---
Classic. It's far more endearing with it's quirks. I never liked the new water. Ick.
---
Whichever setting takes away that ugly new water
---
Mc doesn't drop t2 except the legs? Ret is awful in  pvp agaisnt any competent player, and even more of a joke in pve.
---
That's not true at all. It might not have been a thing in Vanilla, but I used the fuck out of Shadowmeld/Stealth in Battlegrounds in BC. Idk when they added it, but it was long before Cata
---
Hmm, I don't really mind more plants n stuff, and while natural shadows are better in my eyes than painted on shadows, it's a bit to much, also I prefer the water of classic in most scenarios, makes it look more "alive".
---
Pally for life
---
Whats your ign gonna be so I don't accidently invite you to a dungeon run.
---
I'll tank everything myself, no worries ;)
---
Isn't it 5% spirit?
---
Probably will go with the max settings. Visuals don't matter that much to me as the nostalgic factor. I rather have it look just a little bit better. The gameplay will still be the same anyway.
---
Wrath wasn't a brainless button masher lmfao. Heroic LK was one of the toughest bosses in history.
---
I mean if you only raided Naxx...
---
Account sharing between parents and children is okay so you might be able to.
---
Just enjoy the ride. It's a fun one. There's literally no need whatsoever to rush it, most of Vanilla's content stays relevant all throughout its lifetime. The only really time-related thing is the AQ opening event, and hitting 60 till that will most likely not be an issue, even if you level all professions to maxlevel and run a lot of dungeons.
---
Get the Ultras which are sweetened with xylitol. Cmon now guy
---
@Joana_Wow I plan to just do dungeons from 1-60 on a warrior what do you think?
---
Blizzard has already given us more information that we ever could have expected from them. Don’t act all pissed about stuff when you’re totally out of the loop and don’t know what you’re talking about.
---
I think 10%? Either 5 or 10? Not a lot, but something.
---
\#000 background color, brings me back.
---
I dont think you couldve chosen worse music if you tried
---
16 Slot bags and some gear (especially weapons) for different level brackets, enchanted with high level enchants.
---
?
---
You're retarded if you think pala is better than priest.
---
IIRC a paladin unfortunately does nothing better than a druid or a warrior when it comes to tanking, so it's out of the question in raids.
---
Thanks for the feedback. I have to use no copyright tracks, it's kinda hard.
---
Ret Paladin prio
---
Hold up, why would they use a 1.12 server? The ability to use modern battle.net tech was the reason they used a legion client, and they talked about how they had to adjust parameters to make the server emulate old behaviour like for spell batching.
---
/!\\ Pedantry incoming /!\\
---
Algorithm generally refers to generic procedures that solve problems, e.g. sorting algorithms, or algorithms that return a solution to an instance of the traveling salesman problem, or an algorithm that optimally distributes players into shards.
---
While you certainly use algorithms while communicating using certain protocols (e.g. data arrives out of order through bit torrent and you need to merge it all), code that parses a stream of packets from a server into structured data, for a specific protocol, is often called a client library. Like your program might use an HTTP client to get data from a webserver, then parse it with a JSON parser, etc.
---
They could launch a server today that is 100% vanilla. However, there are many ways to exploit and hack that version of the game/database. So instead they convert everything to a modern server and client. These systems do not speak the exact same language, so they have to convert a bunch of things to make them work like they used to.
---
This happened to me and several of my guild mates back in the day.  We kicked someone out of the guild for being an ahole for too long, and this person then changes his toon over to horde than starts ganking people from our guild.  We couldn't figure out how he was able to make a bee line to everyone in our guild till we found out someone on our faction was telling him where everyone was in our guild.
---
The plan is not only about always playing with rested bonus, it's also about never overcapping it, which essentially is the same as wasting it.
---
Yall must not have been around in Vanilla lol. Post 40, priests speed up. Paladins also have access to AoE Prot grinding. They are both on the slow end.
---
Probably on ultra and will check on classic for the more nostalgic parts.
---
  I'm not really dying to play because of nostalgia, I want to play because it's simply a way better game.
---
Mained a paladin throughout Vanilla, TBC and Wrath. Had AQ40 on farm and cleared Naxx to the four hoursemen.
---
You couldn't pay me to play a Vanilla again. At least the 1.12 paladin had some QOL changes like greater blessings, but overall it  is a class with three extremely boring specs.
---
Holy is the closest to playable, but unless you find downranked FoL spam fun, it ain't entertaining at all.
---
No priests are good even pre 40 due to their efficiency. Clearly you are mentally disabled and are not capable of understanding how things work, or you leveled a priest and spammed abilities. Please stay away from me when classic releases, people like you make me not want to play because il have to deal with idiots like you in dungeons.
---
I used to tank as enhancement spec once in a while when levelling. It was far from perfect but it worked. 
---
This was in good old retail vanilla, and it was usually as a result of the tank leaving. Always took some convincing but I don't think we ever gave up.
---
The cool thing about shaman tanking is you can create a decent amount of threat at range while kiting with earthbind. The other classes will be soaking up every single hit, while the shaman can fuck around with the mobs.
---
Fun fact, in TBC a warrior was indirectly given this same ability/niche. The combination of thunderclap, charging (stance-dancing), and intervention along with other abilities like that cone stun attack meant you could tank at range. It was *amazing*, so many dungeon runs where the healers and DPS alike were like "dude how the fuck are you doing this?" as you pulled entire rooms and AoE'd everything.
---
That route is going to be very over saturated though unless you get ahead, which shouldn't be too hard if they're free to play as much as they want on launch week.
---
I find 1-20 to be relatively quick. 30-50 is awful. 50-60 you hit tanaris ungoro plaguelands it's a breeze plus the almost max level rush keeps you going.
---
Ultra mode but ima turn the new water off and use the classic water. Ultra really isnt that big of a difference, its just a higher res version of classic.
---
Battle Shout is not "great" AoE threat in the slightest. It generates a very small amount of AoE threat, barely enough to keep mobs off the healer. Same with Demo Shout.
---
Other way around.
---
Battle Shout gets split between mobs, Demo Shout applies the same amount to every mob.
---
For my money, the most compelling thing about the Forsaken was the inherent tragedy of their existence. They never asked to be what they are and a lot of them resent it, but they aren't about to lie down and die over it. So their only choice was to try to figure out a way forward in a world that hated them.
---
They're rather similar to Thrall's Horde in that respect, which I think is why Cairne decided to be their advocate in entering the Horde.
---
It's a shame Blizzard decided to forego exploring that further in favor of Saturday Morning Cartoon Villainy.
---
Completely agree, I love the old Wow so much more because of the community and that you actually have to be the best person you can be because you have a reputation and if you fuck that up people won't play with you.
---
Could probably change server but then you gotta earn that reputation from scratch again.
---
I've heard talk of both, so I'm unsure. My instinct says a flat out 25% chance but I could be wrong.
---
You sir are an honorable man. And lmfao to those hunters that need on things like this or other warrior/w.e class gear they should just roll need on any bows. "Better bow to pull mobs with bro, higher threat off the get go!"
---
That’s cool! Thanks for answering
---
True. I see most of the game’s development as finding bugs and fixing them. They aren’t developing anything cutting edge, just restoring everything to what it once was.
---
Thorium shells are made by engis with thorium bars and dense blasting powder (made from dense stone). The arrows are traded for Thorium shells by an NPC in the IF inn for allys and valley of honor for horde. Its a straight 1:1 trade with nothing else involved. Its very easy to farm the mats, you can farm a weeks worth in maybe an hour. You can use them just for raids, or all the time if you want, on pservers, the standard cost is 1g per stack. Theyre probably about 1/3 the cost if you just craft them yourself. Theyre only made by engis so its the AH or craft them yourself.
---
So hand of reckoning?
---
I thought the beta only went to level 30
---
Dude, well done.

All brackets will have twinks, 19 being the busiest one.
---
I appreciate this answer. Thank you
---
That's unfortunately not true, you can read in the comments player that have done Nefarian and Twin Emperors in original vanilla and the warriors in raid spammed Battle Shout to keep Mobs/Bosses on them :D
---
So much for Ultra settings—they are 99% similar and 1% dissimilar.
---
[removed]
---
That's great to hear! This is something else I love about Vanilla; even when a member leaves the party we keep on moving forward to get that juicy loot!
---
You don't use those in Battle Stance because you don't tank in Battle Stance. Stance dancing is necessary for optimal play, but you do not pull in Battle Stance and waste 20 valuable Rage on a worthless ability when you can use Demo Shout and start tab Sundering right off the bat.
---
I’m equipping a hunter. I buy a level 6 green leather boot with minor runspeed enchant. I buy a level 6 green bow. The lowest level blue bow I can find. And there’s a level 40 epic bow with a fire proc. It’s generally really cheap on the AH. I pick up that bad boy for about 35g and ride it to 60. I also get full 14 slot bags and the best quiver I can buy. The rest of the gear isn’t that vital for a hunter, but a nice blue piece of mail at 40 is probably smart. And a low level ring to go with the one from the Kolkar quests in Barrens is also smart.
---
This 100%
---
If it is based on 8.0 then it (should) have no problems copying over the WTF folder. Not an expert on this though and if there's a testing period then we could try this
---
When I leveled a hunter on pservers 1-10 felt way too easy. Its like mobs don't move fast enough or something.  Can reliably kill them without meleeing  or something them
---
&gt;It could get better
---
Nope. It's too far gone. There's no way it could possibly get "better" without making major overhauls to the game, which Blizz refuses to do as seen with the last 3 expacs.
---
Run into a zone too high for you.  Oops the world is dangerous you better go level up before you can check out that other zone!
---
This one is pretty unique!  The fact multiple ToS violations were going on definitely muddied things up, but account investigations were very thorough and would use pretty much any factor they could to get to the bottom of the reported issue, including but not limited to location of login to things said in chat.
---
I had never encountered someone that was able to hack into more than just the account they had info for.  There were a lot of unique ways people would try and snake info from each other, and sometimes a group of people having each others info leaked more than people realized.  Outside of that though it's hard to say without know what happened on the other end.
---
Just as a side note, when it comes to giving Blizzard your info, always, always use real first and last name and correct contact info to ensure your accounts security.  Account ownership is taken very seriously by Blizzard, and should you be in the position where you need to recover an account it will make the process much easier and quicker to prove you own your account.
---
Spell batching is an issue (or feature) that was brought upon because of the speed that the client could communicate with the server. The Legion client will try to connect to the server wayyy more often than a Vanilla client would. All they have to do (to my knowledge) to fix spell batching is tell the client to send certain information to the server in intervals with more time in between than what it currently is.
---
Making the legion client work with the 1.12 code is what the whole puzzle piece video was trying to explain. They aren't remaking code that they already have, they are just retrofitting the client to work with the old code.
---
I agree that the word "algorithm" probably wasn't the best word to use, but I felt it fit what I was trying to say pretty well and was more for a lack of a better term.
---
Underrated professions that nearly all classes should pick up. Fishing can be a good money maker and compliments Cooking well. Cooking is required to make some BiS food buffs. You could buy them but supply and cost can vary. 
---
First aid is the obvious must have. I passed on it many levels as a priest healer and completely regret it when I started to PvP.
---
Thanks for the reply. I have not played a fully geared pally. What will you be playing this time around?
---
With your experience, does horde or alliance have the advantage when it comes to speed leveling?
---
Late August.  Nothing to see here!
---
I am a little torn, I don't mind live graphics but classic graphics look more right. Especially with water, I never liked the "ice" looking water that was added in Cata(?). But I do like the ground shrubs a lot, but color pallet looks better in classic.
---
Only took about 4 hours for the world first 70. Basically had a raid group zerging every mob after he tagged it.
---
Make some friends!
---
I love it.
---
It looks great. Why is this not in the modern engine again?
---
totally. i hate a lot of old world gear on current, but it looks so so much better in vanilla paired with the old models
---
Auto scaling is one of, if not the worst things ever implemented into retail. It's the main reason I quit.
---
Cant remember why they downplayed weather and nights tbh. It was quite a while ago. It was amazing. Nights were so dark and cozy :D
---
RIP Wade Hobbs
---
Ive tried to bring up this exact point numerous times.
---
They DID up respawn rates massively for new server launches. I played on the first days of Gul'Dan and Demon Soul and both servers were like this IN VANILLA. I always played firs days of Auchindoun during BC launch and it was the same.
---
However it seems like a lot of the people on this reddit and assume that increased spawn rates is a pserver invention and ignore the fact that this was a vanilla solution created for servers during vanilla, ive tried bringing this up numerous times but it somehow goes over everyones heads. I think most of the people on this reddit never actually played a new server back in Vanilla.
---
And no Sharding hasnt been confirmed, though it seems likely despite a Vanilla solution being easily available.
---
Yeah I had full t2 on retail horde mage,  full t2 on ally rogue in pservers.  I can tell you that the only difference that is noticeable is human warrior vs non human warrior dps.  Have done mc / bwl / aq40 w/out fear ward or tremor totem on retail and pservers and its not a big deal.  Play what you want and have fun.  If you want to min/max do it, if you want to play a class / race combo that isn't top tier do it.  You will spend 5-10days leveling staring at the character and 20 more days play gearing / raiding / pvping.  Pick what appeals the most to you because if you don't you will regret it later and burn out.
---
Last time I checked, you can't even toggle old models on retail anymore. They disabled the option for BFA because the allied races were breaking something or other. I miss my dwarf, I had made her and levelled her up with the old model :(.
---
EST. Georgia USA
---
Max except for the water. I don't like how metallic it looks.
---
It's not deep, it's 10 points.
---
I prefer melee DPS. Probably going to roll human or orc warrior depending on what faction friends want to play.
---
Vanilla is world of warriorcraft, so I see no reason to fight it.
---
Lol? tanking a boss by spamming battle shout? It generates less threat than any of your single target abilities.
---
Also, a lot of things changed throughout vanilla's patches, so unless those comments are from 1.12, we can't take them as absolute truth.
---
I've been all for options. That's a perfect way to do it. (like Final Fantasy X remaster)
---
whats this about lack of gear for a shadow priest? So much crafted stuff, between dreamweave, shadoweave and felcloth, then target the accessorries and weapons from quests/dungeons. Enchant stamina and you can hit 60 with around  3k health 4-4.5k mana and +200 shadow dmg self buffed.
---
Top speedrunners and those who've bought their guides. If there are hundreds of people on a server using Joana's guide, no one will be able to complete 60 at the speed record.
---
Best I can offer is 35g and 5 arcanite bars.
---
You profit 35c
---
This
---
Yes, if you get lucky you can one-shot undergeared players with a big double SoC and white crit.
---
Other than that your severe lack of mobility and on-demand burst makes you pretty bad.
---
A lot of people still like retail thou
---
I will try and once again fail to have the patience to lvl fishing. I suck so much at clicking the lure.
---
Thank you for offering the service to those who love to go fast. I want to take it slow and enjoy the leveling and experience the first time or two. 
---
Can't wait to see everyone in the game.
---
What? Not even MySpace? You didn't like entire free music albums back then?
---
The new water really brakes my visual nostalgia, definitely won't use that one.
---
Think I might go with Classic settings as a base and crank up things like view distance and AA/AF. Other than that I'm fine. Vanilla art team did an amazing job, not many games from that era have aged that well, let alone a MMO.
---
400ms? that is what australians played on all the time
---
You know what, this blue post is the only one that hasn’t had an instant tips video associated with it. 
---
He should really make one so his viewers who only watch him for wow news know what’s up.

The poison cure can be really nice as a class without a poison dispel, I'm just going to have to ignore my Tailoring for a while so I can get First Aid up to snuff.

I'd love to see the answer to this. u/Joana_WoW

The water alone makes everything worth it. The vanilla water is awful
---
welcome to the world of warcraft ( the real one, vanilla )
---
Ultra, because I can.
---
1) Onslaught is a guild pushing hard for week one Rag, and very likely will do it. Super hardcore. They’re still recruiting like-minded people so look them up!
---
Mind = blown. Just 14 years later I'm getting in the know what was the story behind BWL, and why we raided it.

Syphilis: because it was just unnecessary and painful.
---
Class: Shaman

---
Yeah welcome always awesome to have new players. I’ve only experienced classic on a private server and it’s a blast. 
---
I think we’re in for a game changing moment
---
There’s no convincing you; that’s okay. Agree to disagree.
---
shit was godly , i had a heirloom with 30sp on it made it so fun to level casters
---
30 sp even on a grey would be pretty much better than anything you get leveling
---
I mean, everything you said was right. And I do miss being able to use the old models on retail, they fit so well when using old mogs. However, I don't really see the harm in at least adding the new models as a toggle, as long as it isn't buggy and doesn't break the old models. That being said, I highly doubt we are going to get the HD models. Like you said, there were too many issues and bugs with having both sets of models in the game, and if retail WoW couldn't make it work, with it's billions of dollars backing, then I *highly* doubt Classic will be able to.
---
xD
---
The profession that has the most useful things that you need to be sed profession for is engineering. Is by far the best pve and pvp profession. It doesn't make much gold but it's definitely the best for self-enhancing. You can buy most/all useful things from other professions for yourself without having the profession yourself. But most engineering things require engineering. As for goblin vs gnomish, gnomish has the convenient teleport, goblin has the convenience of making your own sapper bombs, everything else can be bought from one another. I prefer gnomish because I'm too lazy to farm sappers anyway lol. I just use stun bombs for pvp.
---
Apparently you need to do some more digging on why Human's are excellent fury Warriors. It ain't about that dodge.
---
I can distinctly remember 1-5 on my first character, then everything after 42...so I can see how this is true.
---
runez scazmatar
---
The 1% dodge is a moot point since with 305 weapon skill as human you can gear 2% less hit than a race with 300, meaning you could then equip one or two defensive pieces with mitigation or if you need more threat equip higher dps pieces, instead of something carrying hit%. Not to mention glancing blows dealing about 25% more damage.
---
So it comes down to do you want a small edge in PvP or a quite big edge in PvE?
---
Probably mixed. Water Classic, amount of grass and other ground details also classic (looks actually weird in max settings) but shadows.. i think ill crank that up.
---
Isn't 15+ agility better for a leveling Rogue?
---
There were many great memories, the ZG plague day stood out as one of the most fun unique days.  Just all of the chaos and flood of tickets and complete lack of preparation for what was about to go down maybe it very fun and unique.
---
another great memory was the first time I saw the queue hit 0 minutes.  When I first started working there, if you submitted an in game ticket it would take about 4 days until I finally got to your ticket.  It was like this for months, then eventually it started chipping away, 4 days became, 3, which became 2 then 1, then 12 hours, 6 hours, then finally one day we hit no wait time, totally instant response to tickets.  The entire GM floor erupted in cheers.  
---
Especially to those of us who fought 4 day queues (and worse, it was even longer before I got there I heard)  seeing the queue at 0 was a real accomplishment, we wanted to blow your minds with how fast we could solve your issues!  We joked about solving the problems before you guys even submitted the tickets, good times!
---
The main thing about the community I learned is that it's a huge diverse population with lots of different types of players and play styles.  It's very humbling to look at the ticket queue and see the wide variety of issues players are having all at the same time across so many different realms, you get this sense that the World of Warcraft was way bigger than you ever realized.
---
I do miss it!  I miss the culture, the people and all the awesome swag! ;)  I am happy with the journey I took, but it was a great memory in my life and I am really glad to have it. I like to think it helped shape the professional I am today!  Blizzard will always have a soft spot in my heart, and I was honored to get to be even a tiny piece of the World of Warcraft experience.
---
Where would I look them up? Got a link to a recruitment thread or a discord? Thanks.
---
I’m sorry you misunderstood. I’m saying literally every single player on a PVP server regardless of faction thinks they were only ever ganked by cowardly players in groups. 
---
Horde players thought Alliance were cowards and Alliance players thought he Horde were cowards. 
---
It’s universal.
---
Same. I don't want to raid this time. I just want to smoke up and level while I listen to music. So soothing. When I get to 60 I'll just make a new character and start again.
---
The old pre-Cata quests are what I'm most nostalgic for. I knew the most efficient routes for every zone and LOVED turning in a full log of quests. Can't wait for that grind again.
---
Nice dude. Cool site by the way. I’ll pass it on.
---
Platinum Wow breaks the whole down very well in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ5Z33ZYAec](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJ5Z33ZYAec)
---
Not even a comparison, private servers are not vanilla or classic
---
I wish there was a water setting between those two. I like the classic shimmery look of the water as it feels more inline with the art style but it's so flat. If they could keep that texture but add some rippling that would look good I think.
---
Have you taken into account how annoying it would be to level a bunch of alts every day?
---
it would work fine at the lower levels but then again you can just have a level 60 power level through the lower levels then power level an alt back for them.
---
it would start to suck bad when the leveling really slows down at higher levels and you realise you need to do this on multiple characters.
---
honestly i think the better strat is either have some friends and make an alt younonly level with them every day or so, or just talk a high level mage or paladin into boosting you. 
---
A mage friend talked me into playing wow and boosted me pretty hard back in the day so unless blizzard fuck up it should still be viable
---
Classic. I’m going all I’m boys!!! Sorry 1080 ti, this is personal.
---
Fsck no, that cancerous "bring the player, not the class" neutering of my hybrid viability was the definitive nail in the coffin of good expansions.  
---
(Shadow Priest in TBC was the best time I've ever had)
---
I just straight said it to her face. After she told me she is doing the same.
---
I appreciate this meme adaption.
---
my understanding (i d9nt onow that much about priests) is that 1 shadow priest per raid will be desirable
---
there are more dot slots and spriests have shadow damage vulnerability that will be a boost in any raid with multiple locks.
---
i think thats about it most raids will want priests healing
---
correct me if im wrong
---
19 Twink here, can confirm goggles mean you’re badass.
---
It did not work that way in the demo and in patch notes it's clearly not supposed to work that way
---
Ultra for sure, turn that shit up to 11.
---
We absolutely do. I used to form groups of mage pally healer and myself tanking and we would aoe down everything like it was retail. I think I used to avg at lvl 32-28 min gnomergan runs with a competent group. I lvled pretty quickly like that.
---
Cosmos was developed during closed beta for wow.
---
http://www.vanilla-questing.me/  I was looking at this recently.  From what I can remember it does help a ton with optimizing certain quests and the best way to do them. Make a new character and see his view on his route.
---
This sub is become closer to /r/wow by the day. Haven’t seen much good discussion in a few months
---
Onslaught-wow.com
---
rofl. this guy never played vanilla
---
They indeed can have changed but I highly doubt a mechanic as benign as this one working on an AQ40 boss; the Twin Emperors, would be changed that much.
---
But I've never said that it's better to tank spamming Battle Shout; I'm saying that to AoE Aggro when dungeonning to 60 as the title says, B Shout is boss. As for Twin Emperors it works because you can't cast any melee abilities on them. So you would need a warlock's void walker or other strats.
---
Amen
---
Anger Management is a no-brainer anyway if you look at the math. Think about it. You need Tactical Mastery anyway, because that's your most significant tool to make tanking much better. Then you're only 1 point removed from Anger Management. If you go deep in Arms because you want to level as Arms, then you need 30 points anyway to get Mortal Strike. To get MS you're sooner or later going to have to decide to either do 2/2 Imp Overpower, 2/2 Imp Charge or spend one point less on one of them to take Anger Management as well. More points than 1/2 Imp Charge is not worth it, especially if you compare the 3 rage you get extra from your charge with 2/2 to the hidden rage that is generated by Anger Management.

[Put them side by side and it look slightly squished?](https://imgur.com/WJTm88L)
---
Anyways I might be missing something but the OG aspect ratio is a little off is all. I appreciate the discussion though, map is cool, etc.
---
I can’t see anything from before 2008 which is weird. Thanks for the link, I am looking into the advice they gave there. I put in a support ticket with blizzard to see if they have any answers for me.
---
Hah! This is my kinda theorycrafting!! 
---
I love this OP, awesome job!
---
I wouldn't have been able to tell them apart if they didn't tell me what to look for and have the line down the middle.
---
Private servers are almost 1:1, the levwllijg is the same..??
---
The duo is insane for leveling the downside being you’ll be fighting for gear at every turn, I’d suggest picking up tailoring and funneling all the cloth to yourself and aim to make the shadow damage gear for the both of you. 
---
If you’re desperate to get into raids jus teach him to heal, you can heal in shadow spec just don’t tell anyone.
---
Don’t forget Xanga
---
Yes it is. I’m glad that you’ve found the charts on my site to be useful. Classic has provided me with a chance to restore my original Vanilla resources, while also inspiring me to develop new content.
---
Well played. Well played. Am laughing.
---
I used to try and look at the ground raiding in vanilla to maximize FPS - now I have a good PC, I'll play on ultra thanks
---
Battle Shout is not "boss" threat in the slightest, anywhere you use it.
---
It generates 55 threat per party member buffed, which is a total of 275 IF you manage to buff every single person in your group. That threat is then split among all mobs that you are in combat with.
---
So if you're tanking 3 mobs, that's only 91 threat on each mob....barely anything.
---
Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. I mained warrior tank for a good 8 months on the most recent big vanilla server and Battle Shout was just awful AoE threat. Tab-targeting single target abilities was always better for 2-4 mobs.
---
Do people really have to post these every day?
---
The irony of this sub is that the trolliest thing to do is reply with "#nochanges" over and over again. lol
---
Will have to verify your numbers here;
---
Also I didn't create this thread out of nowhere; I tanked on every pservers that was the "big" vanilla server of its time.
---
Multiple mobs worked great with Battle Shout, I also did cast single target abilities.
---
There's dozens of us!
---
why did you exclude priest? they are also a hybrid class.
---
Well considering the private server community is toxic and think you have to min max to actually clear raids, you will struggle finding a raid slot. But the smart people know, that u can have shadow priests, ret pallies, feral druids, etc in your raid, multiple of them and clear raids easily. So in my guild that I will be running we are okay with bringing in ferals, shadows, pallies, etc. We obviously arent going to stack 30 of them, but we will have more than other guilds because we arent toxic morons. THey are amazing in pvp which is what ima do a lot with my guild along with raiding. I will pvp more than raid, which is why im going to assign someone to become a dedicated raid lead because ill be out pwning in the world. If you are interested in my guild, all the info and spreadsheets/guides on each class check out our discord!  [https://discord.gg/h36hGuB](https://discord.gg/h36hGuB)
---
What about the worst /time played? That might be entertaining to see.
---
Yea, the problem is it feels like such a huge waste of time while you’re leveling, so you’re forcing to do the long grind at 60.
---
Can’t count how many times I have to right click hots before pulling on my warrior.
---
Its only an issue if Blizz wants it to be.  
---
Its not immoral.
---
Welcome aboard! I'll make a suggestion here, but if you decide to power level a character to max level quickly at launch, make a second character later on and just do a nice, slow leveling process. There are a lot of fun stories in the guest dialogue and fun nooks and crannies to explore throughout the world, and it'd be a shame to miss them by speed leveling and never going back to smell the virtual roses.
---
Can we call this Betamining?
---
I don't think they're actually using the WoW engine with an emulated server to run it. I'd guess what they've done is just make a fancy model viewer with a floor/skybox texture - so basically just a more complex version of a webpage model renderer that loads any given animation/model that they've datamined.  
---
Blizzard is ok with people datamining assets (models/animations). It's messing with client and server(emulating) that they take issue with.
---
They’re a meme spec in raiding. You’ll be doing half the damage as other good DPS, and it’s not even fun because you’ll be going OOM and needing to wand. Some raids might run one just to buff warlocks, assuming they have 3-4 of them. But even then, warlocks are bad the first tier too, so it’s not really worth the investment until post-MC anyway.
---
For PvP, they’re arguably the best 1v1 spec.
---
In my experience warlock will really suffer from not having an instant dmg cast to tag important questmobs, while hunter will be faster. Even though warlock gets an early imp, its very slow to kill stuff because you get oom very fast until around level 7-8 where lifetap starts to feel more usable. For me it's hard to tell if an average warlock is really faster than an average hunter cause of the tagging with arcane shot. Id vouch for hunters.
---
Thanks a lot - really appreciate it!
---
Oh my god I remember I was like 10 years old and I saw your guides. You know what my dumbass does? I fucking PRINTED your entire guide on the household printer. And not just like “okay I need levels 1 to 10 today”. No, no, no. The WHOLE thing. My dad gets home, we’re completely out of toner and he’s starts yelling “WHY THE FUCK DID YOU PRINT THE WHOLE THING.”
---
So thank you for helping me level and get an ass whoopin. I loved watching your YouTube videos while you leveled with PurePwnage going on in the background. Found out about that show cause of you. Awesome that you’re back and I’m super hype!!!
---
If he thought alliance had an advantage why an earth would he be playing horde?
---
1 per raid for most guilds, sometimes 0 per raid for hardcore guilds (holy spec with enough points for shadow weaving), expect to heal in pug 5 man dungeons unless you make friends with a healer and just run with them.
---
raids, you will have mana problems expect to spend a sizeable amount of time farming mana pots and dark runes, your dps will be below hunters generally.
---
pvp you are great 1v1 about equal with SL lock and are generally touted as the 2 best 1v1 specs in the game.
---
premade bgs they aren't desired
---
pug bgs they can do a pretty good bit of work as long as the enemy team doesnt have a hunter who just viper stings you and makes your life hell.
---
I am for sure playing a paladin. I’m not sure if my main will be a pally or a Druid yet.  I’ll figure it out soon.
---
I will, love healing. I haven’t played vanilla but I’m looking forward to it. As I’m a casual player more than likely will be just leveling as I won’t have the time to dungeons or PVP. 
---
Is it true a dung can take days to complete? And pvp? Did it take a long time to do?
---
Yeah that was another I was thinking but my dou buddy is gonna roll Drood.
---
December is summer.
---
 "bow of the sick owl" that made me laugh
---
I guess it's a little strange. I never have died to hogger - his cataclysm incarnation is apparently quite nerfed.
---
So I have this strange urge that fills me with glee to *deliberately* run up to him as soon as I can and let him kill me.
---
Just once.
---
Assuming you want to raid, getting your BiS gear is the priority. Just non-stop dungeon running. When you’re not in a group, you should prioritize making money, whatever the easiest path is at the time. You’ll need gold for your mount, professions, consumables, etc.
---
Some servers did not have Battle Shout scripted properly, and the threat generated was not being split between all mobs like it's supposed to. I know I played on one private server that begins with Kr, and Battle Shout was broken like that; I could literally just spam it and get infinite AoE threat on everything. It's not supposed to work that way.
---
Do you have a YouTube channel???
---
Near the end of my time playing wow hacking was going off big time and I had to change my password several times because of it. I wonder if something similar happened to my character/account in the time I wasn’t active and paying attention to my account.
---
Not really, no. Crusader is 100 extra AP and a 75-125 heal every proc. With double you're looking at 200 extra AP for pretty much every extended fight. That's worth more than 30 AP and some extra crit.
---
I remember being like level 34 and logging on for a few hours to get like half a level. But leveling fast wasn't the goal.
---
Welcome to the obsession, man!!
---
Just having autoloot makes for multiple hours.
---
Was nearly certain it was going to involve twitch some how . Thank god it doesn't and it's just / played + / who! 
---
Also thanks for all your guides while I'm here :) used them many a time of the past decade lol
---
Hmm I see.
---
I play on Kr 3, El si m, Nos al iu, Nor hda e.
---
Don't know much about their coding and who took who's coding. Anyway let's not get in a misunderstanding; This is only for new players to Classic that won't have a clue on how to keep mobs off of their teamates in their first dungeons. 
---
Cheers and thanks for sharing your knowledge, it can be easy to spread misinformation &amp; I'm glad we have people to correct what is wrong.
---
I think it's gonna take you a while bud
---
You could say it's speed leveling but super slow
---
Man I wish I had someone that wanted to duo pally Druid.
---
Battle Shout is SOME aoe threat, yes, but it should not be relied on. You pop it once at the start of combat and then tab-target shield slam / sunder / revenge.
---
Masterpiece! I could tell that you put a lot of time into that. Very clever and on point, enjoyed it man, keep up the good work!
---
Not physically possible
---
They're basically the same. The differences aren't enough to change much of anything.
---
1- about 150 is VERY easy. Plenty of places you could find a minute or two where you’re waiting or doing nothing. The real issue is using the bag space while lvling to get fishing up.
---
I.. literally can’t tell the difference
---
Please include oceanic too mate we exist :(
---
I was thinking me skinning/tailoring (priest) him herb/mining or maybe enchanting for wands (lock) and I'll level a druid alt for farming bloodvine.  That way if he falls behind I can tank/heal for him.
---
Oh yeah most definately not a main source. Usually I used it once a mob ran off the pack and I would prefer not to run after it to regrab aggro. Regarding the values you provided; does Battle shout generate 55 x the number of party members affected? Which would mean 5 (including tank himself) which would give us 275?
---
Feel like it still takes 60+ minutes. And it makes sense it squeeze it in here and there, but I just never seem to do it. Hopefully I find a way to work it in this time.
---
340
---
bear works just fine in dungeons.
---
My original priest was 32 days played when I hit 60.... not sure what I was doing but I fucking loved it haha.
---
Well, my friend wanted the name fuckton, so he made it phukton and got away with it. He also made his warrior semenstorm in wotlk and got away with it for about a month lol.
---
but then they nerfed it
---
That would be a very nice in-game addon.
---
Ah yeah then our raids are probably a bit too late for you.  Good luck finding a nice guild!
---
You're right, zg I get hit gear (bloodvine) and when aq20 phase hits I get mp5 to supplement (virtuous).  I'll just have to use a lot of consumables till then.
---
A whole lot of things makes Classic fun. Honestly it's game full of flaws and basically never had it's original concept finished or at least polished due to the massive change in direction that was TBC.
---
The features that make fun mmorpgs is what we, in a general sense, call old school. To learn these features it's better to research the small crop of mmorpgs in development shooting for an even more old school feel. 
---
Classic was the transition between old school and the change toward mass appeal and the micro-transaction transition that watered down mmos.
---
Enjoy what made it good. It's those little things that makes Classic highly enjoyable, yet at the same time, frustrating and a reminder the game could have gone in a different direction that preserved it's original audience. It's a snap shot in time and I have no faith that Blizzard will learn from it. 
---
Ultimately, Classic is an aberration from the main stream focus which is still a exploitative, mass appeal cash grab. So glad we are getting it, but I feel it's important to remember why we are even getting it: it's not a change in business model direction but rather an attempt to take ownership away from pservers.
---
By the end of Classic's progression, I do hope that Blizzard learns a few lessons, they manage to obtain some sort of independence from Activision for development, and perhaps, just perhaps, we get more genre specific games again that DO NOT cater only to mass appeal.
---
Nope, the procs produce a lot of Rage for Warriors and can get you to the point where all MH attacks are Heroic Strikes much faster in content.  The weapon is solid until about AQ40.
---
can you go classic mode and toggle ONLY the water?
---
It was great in sm with all those caster pulls, drop a grounding totem, chain lightning the caster, run in a bit, earthshock his cast and then tank his friends while he nukes your grounding totem and by then it's off cd so it ends up almost being like cc.  I always thought it was cool blizzard designed it like that.
---
\#1 - most are taking place on discord.  
---
\#2 - I strongly recommend taking the habit of killing everything as you travel that's level appropriate.   
---
\#3 - I don't play warlock, but a few friends do and seem to love the class.
---
[These](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12553) are what you are referring to I believe, good pre-BiS boots for feral, rogue, and DPS Warrior.
---
Macro /cancelAura Renew ;)
---
Go dorf to shit on other rogues
---
&gt; Breakdown of the ammo you'll use at 60
---
* [Doomshot](https://classicdb.ch/?item=12654: 20 DPS
---
The best ammo in the game, but a massive pain to farm (if anyone even farms it). Semi-rare drop from a boss in LBRS. You could sneak by and solo the boss but it's really not worth it. Decent enough to keep in your bags if you happen to run LBRS and get it as a drop though.
---
* Thorium Arrows/Shells : 17.5 DPS
---
Engineering ammo. Made with mats from the common endgame mining node (thorium ore+dense stones). Engineers craft the shells. You can trade a stack of 200 shells for 200 arrows with an NPC in Ironforge/Orgrimmar. The most common ammo for raiding.
---
* AV ammo: Ice Threaded Arrows/Bullets: 16.5 DPS
---
AV rep ammo, requires honored. Slight downgrade from the Thorium ammo, but you don't have to mess around with the AH+go and turn in the bullets for arrows. My personal favorite, always filled my quiver with them when I went and bought some [Alterac Manna Biscuits](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19301), which restore 4.4k health and mana (it's better than lvl 55 mage food). They're also cheaper than thorium ammo, so that's nice.
---
* Jagged Arrows (lvl 40 vendor arrows): 13.0 DPS
---
The most basic arrows. Use them when you're too lazy or poor to buy the engineering ammo or don't want to trek to Alterac. They'll get the job done.
---
Note that Battle Shout threat might or might not be a thing that private servers invented. Several different pserver builds have several different ways it functions - in one particular build, only the lvl 60 version generates appreciable threat.
---
I found 52-60 some of the most enjoyable leveling back in vanilla.  So much of the stuff you're doing there isn't just a means to another level, but actually counts toward the endgame.  You'll be picking up gear that you'll probably keep for quite a while after hitting 60, you'll be maxing your professions, you'll begin farming mats for raiding, and if the other guy isn't great, you can actually defend yourself from 60s in WPvP.
---
Read what I posted earlier. 275 threat split between all mobs in combat.
---
PVE or PVP focus?
---
PVE: Human Rogue with Engineering/Optional. Maybe mining to supplement yourself, herb for your own spells and usually higher sell value, alchemy for transmutes is another option. Take skinning/herb or mining for leveling though.
---
PVP: Pretty much above but engineering is even more important now. In terms of the 'best' race people would say Dwarf because stoneform can act as a pseduo cloak of shadows. If you aren't up for dwarf then gnome works as well. Escape artist is pretty good with only a 1 minute cd.
---
Ne gives u nothing but double jump.  If you care about numbers, go with human.  If you like ne and dont care about max numbers, go ne.  If you dont care, go human.
---
This is exactly what I'm searching for. I don't have anybody added on Battle.net these days, it's quite depressing. I'd love nothing more than a good friend who shares my passion and nostalgia for Classic. 
---
If you want to add me I'd really appreciate it, same for anyone else reading this, I'll add anyone who is looking forward to Classic. Would feel awesome to have someone to start my vanilla adventure with on release day.
---
Welcome to the community bro, you must now watch the WoW southpark episode as initiation.
---
The nice thing about battle shout is that there's no range on it tho. I'm not sure Demo works on stuff that isn't within its area.
---
Commenting because i'm interested. I'll contact you soon.
---
Your picture guides are so helpful, thank you!
---
I was too busy playing WoW to care about free music albums. XD
---
yes
---
You didn't answer my question. Also nobody said anything about useless or can't heal, so I'm not sure why you're bringing that up.
---
Ideally both but I tend to enjoy pvp more so than pve. Will probably go dwarf/engineering/mining route
---
only if your pc is a potato
---
Yes.
---
So patently wrong it's hilarious. Drugs are the best tanks for five mans, and amazing off tanks. This min max mentality shows the ignorance of many players.
---
Early to mid September.
---
Free music was exactly the thing that pulled me through all the grinds. The Prodigy, The Crystal Method, Marilyn Manson, Godsmack, Disturbed, Linkin Park, etc. Not that MySpace was the only source, but it was such low hanging fruit. No idea how MySpace got away with that, considering all the trouble that the RIAA had Napster put through.
---
People have done this with modern WoW, and iirc, it doesn't work very well. Maybe see what people have done for Legion or BFA and I suspect you could do the exact same for similar results.
---
Inconvenient Truth by Al Gore
---
Why do those need to be mutually exclusive?
---
&gt; This is just untrue. I know this is just a personal anecdote, but my guild in Vanilla never used Warlocks to tank Twin emperors in AQ. Our strategy was just having the Warrior on the side of the caster twin spam battleshout over and over until they switched places again.
---
&gt; 
---
My guild did the same thing, put a bunch of hunter/warlocks with pets in the group for extra threat also. Could also do it on nefarian to make grouping adds really easy.
---
This is what we did for lvl 19 rogues but, I swore that lvl determined the agility Dodge ratio.  I remember a twink that was as low as possible to maximize this effect and was almost unhittable with physical damage.
---
It is, tried it out on some PTR servers.  Hard-on was achieved.
---
Almost everything he said is wrong... The toggle worked fine until they removed the old skeletons in the Legion pre-patch. The toggle for the entirety of WoD used the old skeletons and character animations and they didn't completely remove the toggle until the BfA pre-patch, not the Legion one.
---
I once tried to ghetto hearth out of Blackrock Depths and ended up in Purgatory like this. For those who don't know, if you're in a group's instance, then leave the group, the game will automatically teleport you to your hearthstone location, regardless if it's on cooldown or not. I left the group and the ghetto hearth began. I saw the loading screen, expecting to find myself back in Ironforge.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Except I wasn't in Ironforge. I was dead, instead, in Purgatory. When looking at my minimap, it showed that I was on the opposite continent in *Durotar*. Not only that, I was very slowly moving northeast somehow, even though I wasn't touching anything. Nothing happened when I tried to move.
---
A GM eventually got me out, but gave me a light warning that I shouldn't use ghetto hearths as an intended method of transportation.
---
This is genius man, great friend :)
---
You can still do this with scaling...
---
wat rly?
---
Can you elaborate on scripting and server mechanics? Im not sure what those are.
---
So can you take say alchemy and herbalist and then also take these 3 secondary?
---
Nice! Been subbed for a while, love the vids, man!
---
I'm probably going to give ultra a try. I used to have to play on low settings in the original WoW because my computer couldn't handle better than that and still have reasonable frame rates. For me, the poor graphics I played with wasn't as much a preference as it was a limitation. I always wanted to be able to play with better graphics when I was a kid so this is my chance now.
---
&gt;Just let people have their fun
---
Uhuh
---
Pure, natural Guarana. Simply the best
---
In Classic, Innervate is a resto talent. Pretty deep one, if I remember correctly.
---
This has to be the dumbest complaint I've seen in this subreddit to date.
---
I am speaking as someone who played a LOT of retail vanilla WoW, and exclusively as a priest.  0 Private server experience.  
---
&gt; How difficult will it be to find spots in raids/dungeons?
---
Very difficult.  Shadow is low damage compared to the normal DPS classes, especially in a raid environment.  You will also have big threat issues in dungeons because mindblast is practically a taunt.  DPS is a dime a dozen, and its very easy for groups to be choosey about the DPS they bring.
---
&gt; How are they in pvp? Do they have a large influence on the outcome of a match?
---
Great early on.  As people get more and more geared they will phase off however. This fact is exacerbated because its incredibly hard to get a raid spot as shadow.  If you're able to snag rank 14 or AQ gear you'll probably be well off, but good luck.  
---
&gt; How much farming should I expect to do for potions, flasks, etc?
---
Same as any other class.  A lot of people were lazy back in vanilla and didn't really bring flasks or potions.  I expect that most raids will be stricter about it in classic.
---
&gt; Is it possible they will do more/less damage in retail classic due to resistance values, or perhaps the lengths of fights will be longer/shorter making mana less of an issue?
---
They are using the same system they used in vanilla so no.
---
I wanna go back in time. [Oh, shit a portal thanks!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJaQJw1Wf2s&amp;index=54&amp;list=PL49Ga_-r7iKkxrbckm9CkUhWzxqrOnw-n)

---
If you don't like it, don't use it, it is not a hard concept to grasp.
---
People WILL use HD models regardless if they are officially added to the game or not, people already do on private servers. Let people enjoy their game without having to look at shitty graphics, some people want to play vanilla for the *gameplay*, not everybody has nostalgia over the same aspects of the game.
---
Yes, but not because it will maximize anything...
---
Hello /r/classicwow,
---
My name is Murk-o-matic-Bubble, and I'm an Alt-aholic.
---
I will argue that whatever allows you to convert more MH attacks into Heroic Strikes is what matters most.  You need Flurry up at all times to keep Rage generation consistent.  If you are rocking two weapons with 2.5s speed+, and don't have at least 30% crit, you will suffer bouts of Flurry droughts.  A faster OH will give you more attempts at getting a crit in order to proc Flurry.  Pre-raid geared, this will happen.
---
Abilities/procs/whatever that give you additional attacks generate more Rage.  This Rage can be converted into Heroic Strikes so that MH attacks are no longer hindered by Glancing Blows because they become Yellow attacks.
---
Yeah that’s correct
---
I did not make the piece. I just found it!
---
Sequencing wasn't in vanilla
---
They actually aren't, most vanilla pservers are backported TBC servers, and most of them have XP wrong as a result, either from general TBC increases, or the massive 2.3 or 2.4 (can't remember which) XP restructuring.
---
We're talking like, 1.5-2.5x XP for quests, here, it's a huge difference.
---
I still play my main rogue I leveled to 60 in vanilla. I’m approaching close to 400 days played over all since vanilla through every expansion. I plan on remaking him come classic 👍🏼
---
I have this. My parents bought it for me right before I lost my account from sharing/selling it during TBC like the dumb 13 year old I was, but they still gave it to me as a memento of sorts. I can take a pic of it tomorrow but not sure how I could scan
---
Level from 110 to 120 and get back to me on that.
---
I've seen the trait trees but im not sure what you just get from levels and wait you get from the trees.
---
When I started back in '06 it took me about 3 months (not in game time) to get to 60. I jumped around in IF a lot and didn't know what I was doing lol.
---
I know you're not serious, but just remember you have a good window of time to push yourself really hard to find something new.  
---
Once you do you'll be in a good routine just in time for classic and be able to go about your time with a clear head!
---
Hey, I’m so happy to see you post here. I just wanted to say I’m one of the thousands of 12 year olds your guide helped out so much. I learned so much about pet abilities and the hunter class from your OLD playthrough videos and your original guide way back in the day. I think you had a paid version as well that I grabbed? And you updated every patch that changed things! Either way, I’m really happy to see you supporting this Wall of Fame.
---
You do understand the phrase has multiple meanings yes? Have you been dropped on your head as a baby?
---
\&gt;bitches about someone bitching on the internet
---
Stop embarrassing yourself
---
Flingpu lmao
---
Gnomes have probably the best pvp racial: escape artist. In general, for pvp, anything that CC's or breaks CC's is pretty awesome.
---
You're complaining about me complaining about someone on the internet, if it didn't cross your mind that you're a retarded hypocrite then yikes.
---
its not that effective thou, someone pushing 1 char will always be more effective and faster.
---
if you can be an orc you should be an orc
---
The data behind the mobs is pretty straightforward, such as how much damage they attack for, how much health they have, how much exp they give etc. That was mostly all saved in databases like thottbot or can be looked up and than easily put onto the private server, just by entering in the rights numbers. Scripting refers to mob behaviour... for instance in deadmines when you kill a certain boss a group of mobs is spawned behind you and then patrols towards you. So where they spawn, the route they take would all be scripting. In addition enemies have abilities and routines that are controlled by scripting. When do they use their abilities, what is their ability priority, events like stunning the raid and moving somewhere or spawning adds. This sort of stuff is often really wonky on private servers because we have no way of knowing how it was implemented in vanilla, it's essentially logic code - much more complex than just getting a few numbers right.  
---
Server mechanics just means the comunication between client and server. So how the client and server talk to each and update with position/events. This has some really weird results on how mobs path and how combat works. This is what enables 'frontstabbing' and 'spell batching' which are very different on private servers to actual vanilla.
---
And yet somehow you are the only person who does not have a clue.
---
I'm also looking at doing Shadow Priest main and the absolute single issue I keep coming to from most "progression focused" guilds (not die hard min/max hardcore) is the debuff slot issue. If Blizzards goes with the initial 8 debuff slot on bosses then there won't really be a reason to bring SPriests to buff the locks because there is no room to apply their debuff. If Blizzard decides to go with the 16 boss debuff slot then you can expect most guilds to at least bring one.
---
realistically if you want to make the most of limited time trying to main a dps class, a sub par one at that, is a mistake
---
if you aren't prepared to heal on that priest quite a bit, i wouldn't bother at all
---
herp derp data0x0 mad
---
90% of the time when levelling a solo character you level out at an inn anyway so it really makes no difference.
---
You are remarkably unpleasant.
---
What are the unmarked islands?
---
😂
---
I'll max everything except maybe the water.
---
Ya I like this idea and it’s a good solution, the only problem with it is that you lose out on the musical immersion when you transition into caves, taverns, villages or unique parts of the zone (demon infested, etc.) and the music doesn’t change automatically to fit the environment. I hope it becomes an option, but I do love the wow classic music and will still be happy if that’s all we get.
---
It's not a grind, it's exploring an entire world.
---
The leveling experience is arguably the best part of the game
---
If I'm leveling a physical DPSer, I'll want to focus on buying the best weapons I can on the auction house and sending them to my alt. Buy ALL the potions/scrolls: those that have regen, stat bonuses, etc. Use health/mana potion every time the cooldown is up. Enchant my weapon for more damage.
---
It was like fighting the big show or the undertaker in wwe and you were yourself.
---
Because that's examples of unfounded criticism. Where saying it's a weaker class isnt.
---
Sorry but there is 0 chance you did 1-21 in 14.5 hours, especially on a Warrior. An experienced speed leveling Hunter or Mage wouldn’t even be able to make that time.
---
It’ll take an average casual player approx 4-6 weeks to get to 60, so playing 1,2 or 3 alts will take a while!
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
Someone already posted today a 'strategy' but there's really not much to say. The more characters you play the longer it will take you to get anywhere but you get a small increase in efficiency. If you don't care about end game and want to play a ton of characters than go for it I guess.
---
There's definitely a place for games like Classic WoW.
---
2 prime examples are the Souls series and Hotline Miami. Incredibly similar to the process you are explaining about WoW. The game takes place in the decisions made between those moments of pressing buttons, the decisions, the waiting, baiting, juking all line up for when you need to get something off.
---
In a game like Hotline Miami or Souls, it's all about the moments between the execution. In WoW with longer cast times, fewer and longer cooldowns, energy/Mana/rage management - there was a lot more to think about than "OH SHIT THIS BUTTON ON MY BAR IS GLOWING - I'D BETTER MASH IT".
---
In PvP you'd buy your time and work the setup when you know you can pop a trinket and warm up a long cast or hope your target doesn't have any defensives left before you go ham with your weapons.
---
In PvE it's a game of outlasting the boss, positioning, teamwork, MORE DOTS, less dots, threat management, recovery, etc.
---
Hmm interesting, OK i see what you mean about choosing the pet that makes sense. And darn that night fall proc seems very very low, would it even be worth speccing to it then for pvp? Most fights would be over in seconds rather than a minute.
---
Ahh right i see what you mean.
---
“Wait. Where the fuck did I leave off this character 11 days ago?”
---
There is a program that will slice the game up into 3d components for VR. A massive VR system with treadmill was posted on this sub months and months ago. Might have luck with search.
---
Ultra looks a lot sharper to me. Feels like a no-brainer
---
Not sure if it was considered a gimmick or legit, but back in Vanilla, I remember maxing out Imp Charge and (I think) Tactical Mastery (let you retain rage when switching stances). I’d Charge, Thunderclap, switch, Demo Shout, Battle Shout, then start tab-Sundering. I know TC didn’t give much threat, but any was better than none, and it added mitigation as well.
---
Or the old Charge-&gt;Berserker Stance-&gt;2h+Whirlwind-&gt;Def Stance+shield combo can't really be beaten for most pulls.
---
I love these pictorial guides, you're doing us a great service!
---
hmm very interesting I see what you mean.
---
So for pvp, nightfall may barely proc if you are 1v1, but if you are in BGs, and have multiple corruptions up then I guess you can get it once in a while. still seems like a ton of points to spec to that instead of gong far into destro tree.
---
And I see what you mean about the pets, both have interesting uses and different scenarios when they shine. shouldn't you soul fire after you charm an enemy?
---
haha yeah then playing for 40min and woops. Damn! Rested is gone ill guess ill log of this and jump on next.
---
In no particular order 
---
Battlefield 3
---
Guild Wars 2
---
Counter Strike: GO
---
Wildstar
---
Cataclysm
---
I feel like I could always tab target?!
---
&gt; Well considering the private server community is toxic and think you have to min max to actually clear raids, you will struggle finding a raid slot.
---
Vanilla was no different.  I didn't know a single guild that ran with a real shadow priest, feral druid, or ret paladin.  I knew shadow priests who healed while keeping shadow weaving up, a ret paladin who healed, and a nax guild that let a feral druid tank most of Molten Core once as a meme.
---
Won't be making a lvl 19 twink but i sure will be making a lvl 29 hunter twink for AB. Running around with the stv gun in the 20-29 bracket you can poop on kids.
---
Oh yeah, I’d have one person skinning and leatherworking for the initial launch because at level 5 you can just grind 80 leather and that’s enough to get to level 40 leatherworking and make enough embossed vests for 2 lesser magic wands then just drop lwing and keep skinning. 
---
The wand at level 6 will give you both a huge boost.
---
Maxed but with Lighting turned down, and Foliage turned down. I don't like all that extra grass, and the lighting engine makes certain zones darker, and I don't like that. But everything else Im just going to max.
---
Not a chance. I played one on pservers. It wasnt terrible but honestly I dont want to spend real classic healing.
---
Thorium shells are good, but not needed unless u have plenty of gold. I used to switch out and use them for bosses only on raids,  
---
AV ammo was nearly as good and only needed honored rep (easy to hit).
---
I remember the biggest hurdle for ferals was lack of itemization once you hit the raids. Is there any tanking leathers equivalent to T1/T2?
---
Ya, if your guarenteed to get it off. Usually right after getting stunned or another type of cc tho your charm is already halfway over by the time you get out. So usually you want to start walking away so you don't start getting smacked in the face again. Which doesn't leave time for the 4(?) second cast. But ya if the opportunity presents itself def soulfire. 
---
And a nightfall proc is big dmg even if it's only once in a 1v1. Big nuke plus you get to keep moving away and kiting. Even better if it procs in the middle of a shadow bolt cast so you can get 2 shadowbolts to land at the same time.
---
Classic Pat
---
I’m actually not joining till classic comes out, no interest in current retail but thanks for the welcomes guys. Looking forward to it.
---
You could but it was clunky at best.  I'm not sure when it was changed but when I started playing again in legion I noticed the difference immediately
---
Twinking now will be bigger then it ever was, I imagine there is a large amount of people going to play classic just to twink
---
And I STILL havent found an addon to restore classic combat text. I play retail and ever since Legion I've HATED the new combat text.
---
Just get one of those fuzzy covers
---
Thanks! I appreciate the kind words.
---
So then we're back at our original point of contention:
---
Let's say you told someone who is really ugly that they're ugly. Or if you told someone who was really stupid that they're an idiot. Or that you told someone really weak that they're weak .
---
Can you not see how at a certain point that could be hateful? Especially if they weren't asking for criticism at the time?
---
Love it! Now I just need a reason to use them...
---
I set my suicide date for my 30th birthday. Got a bit over a year at least.
---
I didn't read that way at all, thanks.
---
Got 10 grand? I’ll get ya a kid.
---
Pve - Human- The passive to weapons are great.   
---
Pvp - Human/Gnome. Both have great racials for pvp.  
---
Now if you want to play a hunter... Night elf.
---
He is mentioning how much time he leveled and then mentioned his trade skills.  Trade Skills have given xp for like 10 years now, but pretty sure they didn't in classic.
---
Yeah I think it was wotlk when they added it. That’s what made me go nelf. Pretty much had a second vanish because it would get you out of combat for you to immediately stealth.
---
Yes, last time i played bfa (january2019), i was leveling a mage using geforce now on old mac, i actualy played for several days and reached around 78/80 lvl and only than found out blizz banning people randomly for using it, i tried to contact them but got no answer either from blizz or nvidia.. To this day game is still there and running
---
thought I was the coolest kid on the block showing my parents how I could download 250kbps off Napster
---
Without cross server battlegrounds, queues are gonna be horrendous.
---
This was my first PvP video I ever watched when I started back in the day, always been a favorite
---
They've confirmed 16 debuff slots
---
It's a shame they did so much wrong because what they did right felt sooo good. Their 5 man content on launch was some of the most fun I've ever had in a dungeon, in any game.
---
Gnome is better for pvp. Your hardest fights are mages in wpvp. Escape artist is huge against frost nova
---
I can't see the small dot and big moon?
---
Please post this so that everyone can see how amazing this is. Hopefully the upvotes show blizzard that we want it.
---
You would think but pretty much every server will be on high especially in the first year of release. But that’s the thing some will make a twink but it won’t be til around that time. At least I won’t. I want to focus on my main for as much as I can. Even then I want my next char to be a level 60 as well then maybe a twink. So yes eventually the queues will be okay but nothing at the start imo.
---
Blizzard hopefully removed autoloot option
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about. I reach 10 in 2h, I’ve done it many, many times. It’s a test run to get ahead of the pack.
---
&gt; Or just jack off in between flight paths, if you aren't already eating.
---
Why not do both? You'll have a place to cum, and it's a great way to recycle some protein.
---
The poster would need to be taken to a place that provides large format scanning services. If you would be willing please PM me.
---
You will be way more engaged than a DPS... but you HAVE to stay more engaged than a DPS. So it's give and take.
---
Long-term Health damage is a part of the experience!
---
I think a lot of these people don't know what they are talking about, shadow doesn't do top DPS but if you really know what you are doing and try hard you will do a good amount/not bad at all. Raiding will be a little hard to find spots, which is why you find a guild who likes you. There will be more competition with the 16 slots, so make yourself stand out. Shadow is viable if you take it seriously and put in work.
---
Stuff like this is already ruining classic wow.
---
No disrespect but can you point me to the confirmation post?
---
Your brain damage is deep, it's astonishing you even managed to type english let alone know how to turn on a computer, maybe your supervisor is typing for you?
---
Mana isn't a super issue if you buff correctly, know how rotate &amp; down rank etc..
---
We generally don't allow that specific F-word (yes I recognize it's supposed to be a joke) on the sub in text, so this post has been removed. If you wanna edit out that word at the start, you can repost it. Thanks for understanding.
---
You shouldn't really think like that, that's retail where everything is about end game.
---
Vanilla was about the journey, feel free to take your time enjoying it!
---
This guy min/max's
---
Best thing to ask yourself is if you care about meter pushing and maybe slightly easier gearing as a human or any advantage you can get in pvp. Personally, PVP will always have the higher skill cap and to me, I would rather have PVP racials as they are way stronger. If you are on the fence about both, I think it's safe to say PVP min/max is better.
---
Anyone else nervous about the bg ques/player count that's going to be on their realm.
---
Frost resist on kt? I don't know about that. Perhaps if your healers are lazy and you have a small hp pool.
---
Buffing has always generated threat in Vanilla.
---
You sound like me, we should start a guild for stoner casuals. Happy 420!
---
I’m pretty sure a chicken breast at 400 for an hour would be like eating a shoe. Dude needs to level his cooking some more.
---
Yeah god forbid that both camps of players get what they want in the form of a toggle that doesn't affect you in the slightest.
---
A white dagger with crusader, or life stealing, bags, somebody else's alt to level with, a \[Lucky Charm\].
---
Ultra + every possible graphical tweak/mod to increase gfx
---
It was a fun Tuesday
---
&gt;Same as any other class.  A lot of people were lazy back in vanilla and didn't really bring flasks or potions.  I expect that most raids will be stricter about it in classic.
---
But I thought everyone was strictly nochanges? 
---
If we didn't have to bring flasks or potions in vanilla we shouldn't be expected to in classic.
---
I’ll be playing more than likely. I too will take my sweet time but I have a newborn at home so on my days off I’ll have very limited playing time as is.
---
That's insane. Apparently he wants to do this... Why??
---
4 weeks would be like 5 hours a day. Super casual.
---
Ugly is one subjective. Calling someone ugly with no context. If the thread is about ugly people and people say something then it's related to the topic. 
---
This is a thread about druids. They are a weaker class. Healing touch cant out speed priests or paladin heals so they get the heal off faster. Rejuvenate doesnt stack with others meaning only one druid can hot a target which minimize their impact.
---
Moonkin is one of the weakest dps. Feral druid while viable arent as strong as other melee class counter parts.
---
Druids are a true hybrid. They can do everything but not as well. It isnt subjective like appearance but a truth. This is a topic about druids.
---
Buy skills from trainers every 2 levels. The trees you get 1 point per level starting at 10 so you can use the calculators online to see what you would get.
---
Usually the munchies
---
It’s the orc/Durotar start for warrior + Barrens up to and including WC so you get the OP staff. Obviously it will be impossible to achieve that time on a fresh server due to congestion. 
---
It’s fun to run a warrior route because you simply have to avoid equal/higher level mobs, the normal guides will likely fuck you over due to low damage/survivability.
---
And shadows
---
The ultra settings look neat, but there's just too much ground clutter. There's also something about the classic settings that warms my heart.
---
&gt;Part of my original vanila experience
---
&gt;macbook pro 2010
---
That makes no sense
---
Right in the feels, I think more than anything I’m so excited for the social aspect of classic. I think the asshats will be weeded out quick and the genuine good people will have a great server community.
---
Don't forget the different lighting. I find the brighter classic settings more heart warming.
---
I'll be playing on ultra. I didn't overclock an 8700k and get a 2080ti to play on low settings.
---
Are you.... Literally blind?
---
No confirmation post for that, it's straight from Hazzikostas mouth during the talk at blizzcon 2018.
---
Give me the option to use HD, updated models, thanks. OG female tauren faces are blocky and sad.
---
There is no perfectly re-creating the experience of being back in the mid 2000s. There's no way to artificially create a bubble of ignorance and mystique around aspects of the game. The people who were trying their hardest were always using Ventrilo, Thottbot, Auctioneer, and other websites and add-ons. This time around, they'll be using Discord, WowHead, and other resources I almost assuredly don't even know about. The try-hards will once again try hard, and the casuals will once again be casuals, but both groups have leveled up, respectively. It's all relative, though.
---
This isn't just nostalgia, when TBC was in full swing and frostbolt was doing 1200 or 1500 dmg to a target with 12,000 hp, and icelance was critting harder than frostbolt with no cooldown and instantly cast, it felt terrible. This one spell holding the rest of the spells hostage, you gained almost no advantage by standing still anymore, ignoring mages used to punish you.
---
I think we’re in for a reset soon, not wow 2 reset but I think blizzard agrees with you and is actively working towards squishing the levels and resetting it all. Everything from vanilla - BFA should become just cosmetic farming and restart the game in a new world, done right could be awesome but no high hopes, so just waiting for classic!
---
Literally? No. Figuratively? Yes very possibly
---
Good point. I just do not want it to turn into current retail. Wishful thinking though

I feel like people who bad talk shadowmeld have never played WOW. It's stealth, and it's a game wrapping effect in pvp. On a pve server, meh, like you described. But in BG's, world pvp, any pvp, knowing how many people you are fighting, and what classes and gear they have changes the conflict, and often chooses the winner. Is it just a priest, or is the nelf warrior, and that rogue still around? Should I send 2 or 3 to LM?
---
I mean there’s always the option of just liking the faction/races more but I’d like to see some math and his opinion as well.
---
My brother deleted his Orc Rogue because of it. I don't know why but he just did.
---
You’re basically just fertilizing the lawn.
---
Totally with you! I've tried using different Scrolling Combat Text addons and the gameplay feels so lacking. I've also tried using 3 monitors to play but due to Blizzard deciding they should scale different UI horizontally, the combat text and chat bubbles were massive!
---
Here's to hoping they configure Classic for triple monitor play!
---

My girlfriend thinks the last two expansion launches were bad.... she is in for a shock
---
Pretty much this. 1 per raid at most. Generally guilds would prefer if you go “holy weaving” which is a hybrid spec where you always keep shadow weaving up for the locks but spend most of your time healing.
---
Playing holy weaving kinda sucks dick though, so often guilds just have to let someone be full shadow and leave it at that.
---
Vanilla rogues with Shadow Dance and Shadow Step. 
---
Sounds like a fresh hell I don't want to see
---
The biggest tip I would have for tanking is make sure everyone is on the same page as to what you are actually generating threat on. You can't just thunderclap and keep aggro on everything around you. Also Vanilla was all about using all your class tools, even in dungeons. CC everything you can so you can make every fight a 5v1 instead of a 5v3. Parties get quickly overwhelmed, and there are many many small tools to get the job done instead of a couple big tools. 
---
As a general thing I would say to everyone is have some sympathy for some classes just being kind of garbage at different phases of the game. Some classes take a while to come "online", so that guy or class you think isn't worth bringing at level 20 will absolutely clap dungeons in the 40+ dungeons. Above all else I would rather "carry" a dungeon with a couple team players who are more than happy to run to the dungeon than some prima donna who will only go if they can get summoned. Classic is all about the experience and community. Let's have some fun this summer boys :)
---
Average casual player? I beg to differ...
---
Dont blame him! Orcs were the laughing stock of the horde! 
---
Main tanking for the guild with the small shoulders was a running joke for us 
---
Took a whole for it to actually get it fixed too

Kinda. There’s a fight at Ganymede, it’s pretty badass

On a very very very rare occasion you might run into a case some a GM did that accidentally.  
---
Those are the kinda situation that gets your GM name called out on the floor
---
"Hey, I got a ticket from \[Player\] they are asking for \[GM\] cause they got sent to the wrong factions city!!"

no one wants to hear their name when that happens, lol.

End of Summer (September) almost for sure now. Internal Alpha just starting is not a good sign.
---
You keep your hands off my warrior's ass candy!!
---
Plus all the level 50-60 zones are really cool. Plague lands, burning steppes, un'goro crater, searing gorge. Lots of variety and fun quests.
---
You also gain experience exploring, so, this challenge is impossible
---
Shadowmeld is sick for pvp and leveling. Nelf isn't meta for pve but I would play nelf if you want to. I am.
---
Meld to drop target and get the charge is clutch. Imma be guarding bases melded with engi mines set. Cant wait.
---
To clarify, he was probably 10 years old and the Rogue was around level 25+. 
---
I don't know what made him do it, could have been me joking it was permanent.
---
Man, actually have to read quest text to figure out where to go is going to be something else. 
---
Been quite a awhile.
---
You must be fun at parties...
---
No, there were definitely blunts in 2004
---
This sub operates under the most min-max PServer data of people beating Naxx on Best-Effort tuning... 
---
If you are good and can show that you've put in the work, gotten the right gear and enchants, consumables etc. I'm sure you will find a group. 
---
A lot of people forget you need 40 people, that want to raid.. my guild cleared to Twin Emps and 4-5 Naxx bosses and we ran multiple Resto Druids, 5 hunters..
---
When alcohol is involved, I’m a fucking blast!
---
Played hardcore in vanilla. We never played with, or even had any desire to recruit a shadow priest. If we wanted the debuffs one of the holy priests would spec into shadow weaving, but would be healing mostly and interweaving damage spells for the debuff.
---
Am I a psychopath because I hate having combat text :(
---
Haha brilliant
---
Classic Models and Classic Water, the rest turned up imo.
---
My guild ran a Moonkin caster group, Feral Rogue group (he was also an offtank), and Shadow Priest... BWL was on Farm, working on Twin Emps, downed several bosses in Naxx. When people quit to take a break before BC, some of the guild split off and killed KT so it's not like we were complete shit. I think a lot of people just had different experiences.
---
I know, the reason I said my statement was because the private server players are so brainwashed they think they need to play the same or similar comp as vanilla. Its 2019 and its proven u can play the shittiest comp possible without pots or consumables and still clear nax.
---
Leveling dungeons are tuned for players in leveling specs. I healed every dungeon pre-60 as shadow and tanked every dungeon (not, even pre-60 just every dungeon) as arms.
---
So emotion! Much crying!
---
If you want ones that consistently make money through patches? Herbalism and Alchemy are definitely some of the best.
---
Wrath is where it STARTED to turn into one. Dungeons were fairly easy and they were not only nerfed many times but at one point you just did heroics and you can grind out insanely good gear. You can basically go from 5-man heroics to 10-man ICC. Heroic raiding was the only place the game retained a tough difficulty but the launch difficulty of ICC was nerfed over time. Still remained a tough one till Cataclysm's pre-patch but they constantly made it easier throughout its lifecycle.
---
wow this is really something else. I'd love to see a scan.
---
No, play what you want.
---
Best energy drink, perfect 5/7. I'm getting a case of Bawls for Classic launch thanks to you.
---
Warlock is much more versatile. It has a lot of interesting abilities that make it unique and well suited to solo play. It's also excellent for PvP at any level. Pally is boring by comparison.
---
WoW's side content is genuinely, un-ironically fun and casual PVP is varied and fun, moreso then its ever been for me (playing since start of TBC). It's the core of wow (questing, raiding, socializing, dungeons) that's dogshit. They just need to bump up the difficulty in a meaningful way. Playerbase would be too skewed though. People want their buttom masher and people want their RPG. Classic is going to be a turning point when it becomes successful and doesn't fizzle out.
---
Big shatters
---
Just like OP's mom who0a0a0aaa. Just kidding pls don't ban me, mods.

On pservers it’s amazing how many teenagers there are.

Anyone have video examples? It's been so long, I don't even remember a difference, but I'm curious/intrigued now.
---
Will you be healing as a pally?? Cause everything else is pretty rough end game in 1.12
---
Consumables will never go out of style. But if you're looking to straight up make money, you're better off doubling up with another gathering profession or enchanting (to disenchant and sell the mats). You can make money on the AH and free up the time that you would have spent crafting.
---
All you have to do is blood rage tab target sunderx2 repeat and taunt when necessary. I did this all the way through aq40 no probs
---
To be enhance you will be the nightfall bot for life. Step 1: Convince the guild to have 1 enhance shaman in the raid. Step 2: Make sure that 1 shaman is you.
---
To be elemental: Well this is a tough one.  If you don't have the raid on farm mode it won't be an easy task to convince them to let a 250-300 dps shaman raid. Good luck with this one.
---
I was actually wondering what a working persons level schedule might look like. Let’s say you want to level up a warrior for tanking later. I was thinking that leveling an easier class alongside it might make it less painful: 
---
You could decide to level warrior and mage (aoe farming makes them good for gold farming at 60 and leveling, alternatively hunter?)  and only really level the warrior when it has rested xp. The rest of the time (if you have time) you can level ahead with the alt and funnel some resources to your warrior to make its leveling easier. You might reach 60 not much later than other warriors and have an alt that allows for easy farming. 
---
I don’t know, just maybe that’s a terrible idea too.
---
I suppose the best way to level a warrior would be to just have a duo partner that can heal
---
Nothing casual about that pace. I'd say casual is 3-4 months, erring on on the latter if you're a new player.

My plan is to level Fishing at 60 once i'm geared. I will be the bait, and let the horde scum think they found a tasty meal, only to be bamboozled.
---
I'd recommend you stop pretending everyone is a top tier player or you're going to be extremely upset by classic.
---
Ayyy. You too, my man! 👽
---
God damn. I thought I was hot shit with my 40 days played time on my main, but seeing some of you guys with 100+ days makes me feel like a scrub
---
I mean I played a shadow priest on a private server. Fun as hell. Started as a holy priest, we needed a shadow and converted. Usually I was the only shadow in the raid, towards the later stages when we were dicking around there was a second shadow priest. It’s a fun class to play if you can get the raid slot. Also if you get the raid slots the dungeon slots will come easy then lol
---
Interesting. Didn't expect this! It's roughly the same as total xp right? 40-something-ish is half way in total time.
---
That said, this is for hunter right? Other classes may speed up a bit later on. Mage could aoe grind, warrior gets better later with sweeping strikes, etc.
---
You're much better off that way. I've played my fair share of MMO's and vanilla WoW is by far the best.
---
Chucking you a PM :)
---
My "upgrade" I'd purchase would be a paladin/mage leveling service who boosts me to level 40ish. Then it becomes a bit more challenging and more pricey, so from then on, I'd focus on dreamweave for casters and +30SP enchant.
---
Not a bad idea TBH I might do the same
---
Flight paths are for inventory management
---
&gt;WoW's side content is genuinely, un-ironically fun
---
Not for me. I have no interest in collecting a million mounts/pets that I'm never going to use, or playing some crappy Pokemon ripoff, or doing weird random crap for "achievement points" which mean nothing, or...etc.
---
The problem is that the game has changed so much that it's pretty much an entirely different game now. The community/socialization has been entirely axed in favor of making the game more streamlined and casual and straight-forward. It's closer to Diablo 3 than WoW, nowadays. (random drop legendaries, endlessly scaling dungeons, no communication required for anything, etc)
---
Yes, the more party members are within its radius the more threat it gives you.
---
Overall confirmed a lot of suspicions that I have had about Naxx. Naxx......is a simple videogame, click the correct buttons when prompted to. The hard part is the time, and coordination of people.
---
Also it didn't sit right with me that people describe these fights as having such insanely strict tolerances in terms of dps required when so many variables like RNG crits and whatnot exist in the game. They had to make room for certain errors which means the fights have some leeway. Naxx is more forgiving than checkers.
---
Are there tier sets for all shaman specs? For pvp would it be worth it using them in PvP or should he just go for the PvP sets? I know it’s kind of confusing. Just trying to figure out the best possible scenario for my friend here.
---
I'm planning on supplying myself and a bank alt with 6 slot bags and then doing a 50/50 split between Tailoring and First Aid. As a Warlock, I feel like both are valuable to have early on, so I'm gonna be farming a lot of cloth from the get go.
---
big waste for aoe lvling but otherwise great enchant.
---
Not sure if they stacked but I would take 1 crusader over 3 x +15 agi.
---
I played a shadow priest both in vanilla and on private servers so let me answer your questions.
---
Its usually 1 spot per raid, if the guild is competent/hardcore. If casual it probably won't matter as they will just want to fill slots. It will most likely be the same unless blizzard decide to increase the debuff limit even further than 16 slots.
---
In pvp they are fairly good, a decent influence. They require some decent skill though.
---
For farming, depending on your guild, you will need to farm mana potions, demon/dark runes, flasks are really for bwl, aq40, naxx.
---
Its possible they will do less damage but it doesnt really matter, all you do as a shadow priest in raids is attack enough to get 5 stacks of shadoweave and then just mind flay lvl 1 to keep it up every so often and wand.
---
Realistically, mind control farming / pvp is fun as fuck, but for raiding you will always be the last person who will get loot as your really just a shadoweave bot.

---
Bring on those Classic graphics!
---
Lol, what a ridiculous assumption.
---
Played a night elf warrior with ironfoe and mostly bis gear and couldn't top the human warriors in dps in MC. 
---
If you want to tank, it's not a big deal.
---
Ashkandi is good in pve for hunters, not for warriors,
---
With ashkandi and the crossbow from bwl u can weave into auto attacks with it between auto shots, increasing the dps.
---
it's completely valid to give it to hunters on priority and then to warriors for out of raid activity
---
bow of searing arrows was under lvl 40.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=2825](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2825)
---
It won't last you to 50, there is a slower, harder hitting, cheaper bow at upper 40's, BiS for 49 hunter, my twink Belf would hit 1200+ with this. [https://classicdb.ch/?item=17753](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17753)
---
Even on Ultra settings, Classic will probably put your rig to sleep.
---
Some people talked about this before in  thread. Had a source from some alliance saying yah its 30% resist Nd didnt like opening on orc that much
---
Sounds a little “short-sighted.”
---
Oh it certainly will. Lol
---
Main has always been a lock, no regerts.  Get used to changing your play style a lot, as they can't seem to leave locks alone.  It's a love hate relationship.
---
look into VorpX
---
Thanks for this. I was able to find some additional levels of clarification to. Thanks so much for this info.
---
You know, my very first character was a Tauren Shaman. My brother played Alliance and told me to reroll.
---
I think I might go back to a simpler time and actually play one.
---
No changes in regards to the actual game.  Gamer mentality has changed drastically since vanilla's launch, and that isn't going to suddenly revert.  There are a lot more resources available these days to find accurate information, and there are a lot more tools available for people to check your consumables.  
---
With that said, vanilla content is fairly easy.  I was in a decent guild (Cleared up to C'thun+2 or 3 Nax bosses), yet we had a rogue in mostly blues join our raid once and place in the top few DPS.  A lot of people just plain sucked in Vanilla, even in high ranking guilds.  If the content is easy enough, it may be possible that no one will really care enough to use consumables.
---
"My original".. you know, one of those servers.. back than, there was no way my parents would pay me sub for online game
---
Underrated post
---
first alt would be a resto shaman, I would probably have gear from 1-40/50 made for leveling, lots of spirit and either int or str/agi depending on what I level as.
---
* \+30 spell power to skinning knife
---
* speed on boots on tradable white
---
* bandages
---
* tons of mana potions 1-45
---
* lesser/brilliant mana oil unless it overwrites shaman buffs.
---
* nightfin soup buff
---
* spirit food buff
---
* troll's blood potion
---
* spirit scrolls
---
* Start each session getting the relevant 30 min buffs from a major city.
---
Might think of more later but I think that about does it for a shaman
---
In classic: "plz break pvp Blizz!"
---
In live: "plz fix pvp Blizz!"
---
The difference is underwhelming, hoping for more client side upgrade options (skyboxes, dynamic weather, texture packs etc).
---
Most speed levelers are NE hunters.
---
Herb and Alch are known as "Primary" professions, where you get 2 slots, and secondary are 3 slots, so you may take all 3, ontop of your primary professions.
---
Continue, what guild? =)
---
Often times you are doing a lot of grinding/questing far from an inn, would this not mean you do a lot of walking from your current inn to wherever your quest is? seems like, at times, it's almost counter intuitive.
---
First aid is AMAZING on a warlock, minimizes downtime. Also if you are undead, so much the better for cannibalization.
---
But if its for wiping where does the poop go.
---
Withhold sex
---
Max environmental settings.
---
Old shitty water textures.
---
Old Animations and models (if there is an option)
---
Upright Orc Posture (if an option)
---
His record will always stand since Classic WoW won't be the same game as Vanilla WoW 2005.
---
Ultra, i like classic for it's mechanics, not the look.
---
Lmao "soggy ramen" couldn't agree more.
---
I won't play if I have to look at the new models.
---
Not just itemisation. While traditionally tanks get first dibs on plate tanking gear, ferals have to compete with the rogues as their tank gear is also leather dps gear.
---
But why?
---
You get absolutely nothing in regards to skills from leveling. It's all learned from trainers.
---
Level with skinning. And herb or mining.
---
Sell all skins while leveling. 
---
At Max decide what crafting Prof you want.
---
Alch is great. But raw herbs also sell well.  Tailoring will make a load right at the start if you can get it high enough to make runecloth bags. As nobody will have the materials to make mooncloth bags yet. 
---
Good advice to level an alt eventually and get them to 35 and train them in alchemy. Sell your transmute arcanite cool down or just make arcanite and sell it. 
---
That's a few things you can do. Also like devilsaur leather  and mooncloth sales and enchanting if you can bear it. Vanilla has lots of avenues. 
---
Good luck.
---
Marlamin is my dude. I was a GM with him years ago.
---
Oh cooking and fishing also make fair bit as well.
---
Are you allowed to use mindflay? It is another debuff slot right? I always thought you used mindblast and wand
---
Wasnt cross bgs confirmed??
---
Nah, in software development we do not future proof. We just hope for the best, then blame our users when it inevitably becomes an issue.
---
Or from talents!
---
I feel you. I am undecided between warrior, druid, pala, warlock, mage, shaman.
---
i want to play with modern models. toggle will be good solution for both sides.
---
This happened to me and what I assume to be everyone in the zone once.  All of our corpses were in purgatory, suspended in the air forming a chain reaching into the sky as far as I could see.
---
What's a 20 man?
---
#nochanges
---
Question is if you are allowed 3 debuff slots? Mindflay, swp, and shadow weaving all take a spot and if you are only allowed one that's it for your damage
---
I know there is an EU one, but not sure of a more general one.
---
The EU one is: https://discord.gg/yBP6V6b
---
Tab used to have a very short range, like 20 yards. Made it pretty useless. That's how I remember it anyway.
---
Ultra of course.
---
It's fine as long as you don't get crap for cooking something other than Mithril Head Trout at 225.
---
Mained a paladin from 2005 to 2007. You could not pay me to choose this class as a main again. Back then my best IRL friend was a NE warrior and seeing him being able to smash multiple useful spells and attacks made me green with envy. The simple things like being able to hamstring an enemy player, the spurt of blood and the Squelch of him using Rend. Seeing massive crits from Execute in Combat text. When he hit 60 and rolled Fury that was it. My paladin could only look on, spamming Seal of Command and auto attacking every 3.20 seconds, feeling crazy? Might throw a hammer of justice and a judgement in there, whilst he was a blur of swings, constant crits and spinning animations. Needless to say, it sucked.
---
If you discuss any QoL changes you are met with #nochanges and downvotes. So this place isn't exactly hospitable.
---
All the race specific tavern music was added in BC. I felt an immense sadness when I found that out.
---
Zul'Gurub and Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj.
---
ZG and aq20
---
When WoW first came out itemization wasn't always that great you could say, esp when it came to hybrid classes. The original tier 1/2 set stats were god awful for hybrid classes. it wasn't until AQ where they tried making itemization more hybrid friendly (ignoring random ZG/BWL items lol)
---
The thing is PVP items won't be out until BWL is released. Secondly these sets are a mixture of hybrid stats. Some pieces are good for elemental shaman while others pieces are completely useless.  The question shouldn't be if he should get the pvp set.. but is it worth his time.  
---
Lastly elemental items for shaman before before BWL/ZG kinda really sucks bad. Elemental shaman is basically summed up as having high crit + spell dmg. The tier 1 Earthfury set is made up of mostly +heal only items and 2/8 has crit. I think the gloves and maybe, maybe.. bracers can be considered good. 
---
A mixture of tier 2/zg chest/belt/bracers and raid off items is when shamans become fun in pvp. 
---
Not sure where I am going with this but I hope this helps...
---
Spirit tap is a levelling talent and pretty irrelevant in end game as it's very rare to actually get the last hit for it to proc and even when it is up it doesn't last long enough for it to matter much.
---
Force of will is 5% flat spell damage and spell crit which is pretty god tbh.
---
Genuinely curious why you'd hope that? I understand not including mass loot, but is not having to hold shift really a big deal?
---
Welcome aboard the hype train sir!
---
Getting raid guild - not that easy, pvp yeah facemelter class, 5m dungeons  is easy to get it.
---
Meet Boarletics!!
---
Oh good point! I didn’t think of that.
---
I Imagine the upright orc will be locked to the newer models - I can't image them going back and re-rigging the old orc models, plus the toggle for it is in the barber shop that doesn't exist in classic.
---
Potentially it is easier to gear as non human once you’re in raids, as all human rogues and warriors (which will probably be 50-80% of warriors in any decent raiding guild). Going gnome/dorf and going for daggers, you might get the goods with far less competition
---
Getting fiery will make 1-10 or maybe 1-20 better. Crusader or 15 agi may be better after this. Crusader healing can be quite strong if leveling
---
Play night elf so you get to use deathbringer and crulshorukh, swords are for losers.
---
I volunteer as tribute!
---
Uhh... No it isn't. It's a base ability you train at 40.
---
I'm not sure if you have experience on private servers but if you did for what it's worth the rested exp was broken on them. I believe you got rested 2x as fast as you should of while resting
---
Yeah, too bad you’re seldom at home.
---
Epic mount makes you do every thing else faster
---
I agree with you so much. Even though 50-60 is the longest levels in terms of played time required, they were the funnest levels for me to go through. No part of it felt bad or grindy. I think the reason for this is because by your 50's, you've already got a lot of your fun stuff (spells, talents, and mounts) so killing mobs and doing quests feels much more fun than say being in your teens. If anything, I would have liked to extend that period even more to soak up all the diversity.
---
The 900 or so gold you pay for mount will cover alot of your pre bis expenses tho. 100% is a very long term investment to brake eaven, and probably only worth it if you are a miner/herbalists or want to focus on battlegrounds
---
There aren’t any. You just follow the rest of the melee dps.
---
It's incredible the lack of oldschool joan fan boys in this thread. i convinced my mom after weeks of begging and showing her your site and forum posts to buy me your leveling guide. i leveled to 24 on a troll hunter to level 24 and i felt like THE MAN. Thank you for the nostalgia trip and hope you lead the pack in classic again
---
Weapon skill makes a huge difference for leveling. More so than shadowmeld.
---
No, it's a level 40 spell with a 6 minute cd.
---
&gt; #000 background color, brings me black.
---
Appreciate the effort. Will definitely be using this as a guide for Fishing.
---
Shadowmeld doesn’t work like that. It’s actually useless in vanilla.
---
Well if you watched the video he literally says, "The only exp allowed to be earned is exploration and boars. Otherwise its obviously impossible."
---
Shouldn't just level with herb and alch and craft along as I go
---
If you've played Ret on retail, you will definitely be playing something new with classic Ret... they don't remotely function the same.
---
Feral druids we know now are great tanks (with proper gear and consumes). And with the right gear &amp; consumes can dps rather competently as well. Shaman can tank up to about Maraudon before its starts getting really rough but they can technically tank a little at 60, and enhancement can sometimes find a raid spot as a nightfall bot. Pally tanks (with proper gear and consumes) can OT into BWL if your guild is patient. Ret deeps is still not great though, sorry.
---
I played a tanksham till 40. Loved it! Only reason I stopped was cause it was too difficult to form a group. Too many naysayers and nonbelievers!!
---
Warriors counter Rogues in vanilla. Perplexity beat Monkeynews because he’s a god and monkeynews is not good.
---
Yeah because you wont top the damage meter or the healing meter, and you are last priority for gear. So it would suck a lot, even if it is good for the raid.
---
Right!  Loved guild forums. They each had such unique character.
---
How would it?
---
I know but my guild give rets prio on t2 who healed in mc
---
Pretty sure bc. I started back then as night elf and had no idea how hard these mobs on dark shore hit so that was my life savior all the time. But I started August 08 so quite at the end of tbc.
---
I have a second account I’m going to use and slow grind a hunter to 60 to fund my tank. All while leveling a tank... I’m going to be busy first hours.
---
Crafting takes time and there will be points where you hit walls and will need to farm extra beyond what is available while just running by. No to mention cost of learning recipes and extra crafting mats that must be bought off the vendor. 
---
I recommend skinning because it can get your gold going as it sells for ok amounts and is quite passive. No need to auction it especially with so many fresh people. Nobody will be using auction house for a little while. At least not to buy. It will be very different from a typical expansion launch where people already have money to spend. 
---
Once you get to max level it's a simple task to run through low level zones grab what you need and get out. And hopefully by this time more people have leveled and made some money. More people are willing to spend money for item advantages and such. Probably be a few think alts running about. 2-3 weeks in will be when the auction house begins to ripen. 
---
Personally I'm doing skinning tailoring and I'll be sending all my cloth to a bank alt that I make and let sit till I'm ready to level tailoring.
---
We had files for azerite. No that doesn't mean that we will have them at launch.
---
Is it me or does the Classic waters look a bit nicer and wavier. Retail waters are too smooth. Was there no wind in Azeroth?
---
Great gifts and damn I love this forum and the look of it
---
Esfand
---
I wish professions in modern would also go back to having quests to progress and having rare mats and rare recipes 
---
Love this. Good job!
---
Nah, I dont normally like having it on either. Probably a holdover of other games where the combat text was in a log. 
---
I think the instant availability of combat numbers pushes the minmax ideal onto the human psyche. 
---
The concept of hitting an enemy and that it is instantly correlated with a number means that, I want to get a higher number seeing as I produced that from my actions and i dont want my actions to come up short. 
---
 However, games that dont provide you damage numbers often have you gaining a feel for combat and then your advancement merely comes from accomplishment rather than the number associated with your feats in the background code. The numbers are going to be there regardless, but dont alter my psychology so I lose all sense of pride in an action because my brain is provided more stimuli from instant gratification.  
---
Sorry for ranting! Just my two cents.
---
 **How difficult will it be to find spots in raids/dungeons? Will it be different in retail classic compared to private servers?** 
---
There will always be a guild that needs a SP (as long as you're not on a low pop server), but at the start, most guilds will probably not need one because warlocks do very little dps in MC. Later on as locks get better, if you're good geared, you will be in demand. 1 shadow priest per raid. 
---
 **How are they in pvp? Do they have a large influence on the outcome of a match?** 
---
Gods in 1v1 and 1vX. The problem is that they go oom very quickly, so they have to use a lot of consumables. Most premades don't want to run with a shadow priest unless he is really good geared, as their damage is dispelable and they run out of mana too quickly. No reason to have a SP over a disc/holy priest other than perhaps the 5 second silence. If you're going for rank 13, I would recommend going healer for the climb, then respeccing. 
---
 **How much farming should I expect to do for potions, flasks, etc?** 
---
A lot and  your ability to farm sucks massive donkey balls as shadow priest at 60. prepare  to level either a hunter or a mage as a farming alt.
---
 **Is it possible they will do more/less damage in retail classic due to resistance values, or perhaps the lengths of fights will be longer/shorter making mana less of an issue?** 
---
We have no idea.
---
4. Tell your mages, rogue etc what to sheep, SAP, banish so you have less adds
---
Awesome work, man! Posting here so I remember to snag this image on my PC later!
---
You monster... that was you?
---
top notch bloke, right here
---
6. Use line of sight to pull mobs into a pack easier.
---
Also im really bummed they got rid of loot trading in dungeons so i can ninja all the loot i want with my friends.
---
Doesn’t support the raid, but potentially half or more of their warriors and hunters (and maybe even paladins) will want ashkhadales for pvp. As a warrior I’d prefer to farm for an extra hour or two for an amazing pvp weapon.
---
If you come prepared, rarely will you ever have  to use your wand.
---
Thanks! This is gunna help a lot leveling a warrior
---
Aren't Paladins missing a taunt in vanilla?
---
&gt; I don't fully understand the dynamics of tanking in classic
---
If you look at speed run videos on private servers, most of them have a shadow priest, so even those people are fine with having one.
---
\&gt; They require some decent skill though. 
---
Lol no. As someone who played a SP on nost and did a lot of PvP, they are one of the easier classes to play, with a very low skill ceiling.
---
Interesting, I kinda agree as I feel the numbers just get in the way and are unnecessary information that I don't care about and draw me out of the game.
---
I dunno, PVP was actually incentivised by “honor” meaning that every battleground was one instance closer to those boots/shoulders/gloves and the grind felt like it actually had an end where you could then move to competitive PvP.
---
I miss queuing up for BGs to gear up noob characters and then heading into arena with them. The whole process of gearing helped you learn how to play your character in PVP before diving head-first. The modern games really lacks that sense of finality and purpose in the co tent that the tiers are comprised of IMO.
---
Vanilla has this but to a lesser extent, obviously. But some of my favourite memories were gearing up in S12 gear running battlegrounds all weekend, miss those days.
---
I fap quite often as a warrior.
---
If you're good geared and put in the effort, your guild may even allow you to SW:P. It all depends on  your guild.
---
Rested XP only counts towards kills not quests. Which means you will need to workout what's the fastest XP/H for each level period. Also your going to need a modified quest log if your doing basically X2 since you will outlevel some of the zones meaning you will find to find a new path for it to be optimal.
---
Ye, and that's just the start of their issues.
---
It used to be in Vanilla, but was changed at a later patch when the Druid talents were overhalued. As Classic will come with 1.12 then all Druids will have access to Inntervate.

Yeah but in vanilla you get told where to go 95 percent of the time and the way is obvious. Not like dark souls at all.
---
Gps ruined retail
---
Do you have a wobbly computer desk?
---
This is a huge contributor to retail dps feeling like shit. It's crazy cause on paper it doesn't seem like a big change, but never seeing any of your numbers really pop up just really takes the punch out of it. 
---
That, and the new animations. In making them smoother they actually made combat feel worse. It's like im playing a shitty anime
---
Protip from a guy who made a mistake:  
---
Do NOT--I repeat--DO NOT, under any circumstances neglect leveling your Cooking, Fishing and First Aid as you go. I know you all want to start dominating WSG and Arathi with your Guilds, but trust me when I say you'll have a better time leveling these in tandem with your slog.
---
It still trips me out listening to your podcast and then seeing you post on here.  Congratulations on episode 100; I've really been enjoying the content.
---
Well I wanted to be as transparent as possible lo.
---
MSN and AOL links too
---
Every. Fucking. Thread.
---
Don't forget the shadows. Prebaked or realtime shadows and the player either has a blob shadow like in true classic or a actual shadow from the player model.
---
Could you go into more detail? I know they lack a taunt, and they have issues, but specifics would help!
---
Classic ofcourse, its best
---
The youtuber right? Does he have a guide?
---
Yep ultra settings plesse
---
The single most important point is the rage mechanic. A warrior and druid tank keeps on giving. 
---
When you progress in the game a druid lacks itemisation and a warrior just becomes stronger.
---
When you farm dungeons for new comers to your guild and you are a T2/TPS geared tank you can just keep on pulling and pulling and pulling. Your priest or shaman will lose 10-20% mana per fight and by the time you moved up and marked the next pack, the healer is already back to full.
---
A shaman or paladin tank makes running dungeons a chore and just bogs everything down for everybody.
---
When I run with healer, rogue/warrior, cloth, cloth/hunter/another warrior or rogue I can just keep pulling.
---
A shaman or paladin will have to more than a mage or warlock.
---
It's just not as much fun as playing with a warrior tank. this is a teamgame and when your fun goes on the expense of the other group members they will just refuse to join your group - exactly what happens in vanilla. People just dont run with paladin or shaman tanks.
---
Yeah, I played single player games which required it and even then I had some adjusting to do in wow, but not for long. 
---
If she hadn’t used it before of course there were “hiccups”. Still, the more she plays the sooner it’ll become second nature and it’ll all sort itself out.
---
Paladins can tank just fine in dungeons throughout Classic WoW. However, it is very difficult for them to be tanks in raids, for a variety of reasons, one being that they do not have a taunt.
---
I'll be turning everything to max but putting water down to classic water texture.
---
When I’m with a bad tank I’m honestly surprised. Your healers mana is common sense an LoS’ing should be a no brainer. As I’m typing this I’m considering rolling warrior instead of shaman because I cannot bare to have a bad tank....
---
&gt; Yet, every guide says intellect is a worthless stat and to go for strength gear instead
---
Just in case you're not aware in vanilla Intellect only adds to max mana and crit chance - [54 int for 1% crit](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#intellect). To increase spell power you need actual spell power. Since most paladin spells and abilities are instant cast they receive very little bonus from spell power, most have coefficients normalized around a 3 second cast time giving 100% spell power. With shorter casts giving less of a bonus, and longer casts more a bonus. This means spells like judgements and consecration don't really benefit from spell power. Add in how mana limited paladin tanks - you can oom after a minute or two - and it this makes spell damage tanking tricky outside of dungeons where you can stop to drink after a pull or two.
---
Their spells do however benefit just as much from strength which also improve their autoattack damage which makes them less reliant on their mana.
---
Ultimately Paladin tanks can work for dungeons and raid trash. But between their inability to taunt and difficulty generating threat over long fights makes them a pretty second rate tank. If you want to tank raids then save yourself and your guild the trouble and roll Warrior! Or accept your role as a good healer or average-to-low-end dps.
---
You go for it. Taunt is honestly your smallest worry. I have been thinking of paladin tanking a while and to me the biggest problem seems to be mana, when you run out you won't do any more treath. Sure you can get the druids inervate but it seems like you won't be using any stoneskin potions. Getting the right gear is alsow a problem if you are critt immune alot of your tanking talents is useless so you need the tank healers to expect some spikes in damage taken. I'm sure it can be done tho and building treath as second tank should be a breeze sins you don't need incoming damage to do treath.
---
Make her watch a short and funny vid guidabout WoW in yt
---
Don`t worry about her learning the basics. Or learning curve at all.
---
If she really likes and get into the game there should be no problem. Because interest is always the best teacher.
---
The other questions is here, if YOU really want that?
---
Does this will not have any impact on your relationship?
---
What if at any time, she will become a better player than you? Are you ready for accepting that?
---
I'm sure I couldn't.
---
But that should be no recommendation from me.
---
I just speak from bad experience. 
---
Ex-girlfriend really pushed it over the limit in my case...
---
Possible negative outcomes:
---
- She will be hooked to much!
---
Probably funny and exciting first.
---
But could be a real bummer if that means she will be a female version of you.
---
She should still take care of any stuff she did before in your relationship.
---
-She could sell naked pics for gold.
---
Yea there was high demand of juicy pics from my gf on my server...
---
Never realised that at the time of our relationship.
---
But dude... I really got it back 5 years after.
---
That was something like in the end of mop.
---
I got a openfile link from a random player as a reward for boosting him through some instances.
---
So I really can say I got payed with my own ex-gf nudes.
---
Dafuq sounds strange if I type it out. 😄
---
I got some couple more bad experiences.
---
But Im to busy writing it down on mobile.
---
I hope you have better luck 👍
---
Thankyou for the insightful response! In terms of five mans I have a group of friends I will be leveling with. You are right! Its slower with a Paladin tanking, but not impossible! More to the point, why should we let what's optimal dictate how we have fun? I am sure there will be plenty of groups happy to run with a Paladin. Why get bogged down in the "warriors only" mentality?
---
Most important is to find the class she really likes. The mechanical stuff will come very fast, give her another day. About the million questions ye, get patience for a week. Mine asked me why are you going for vanilla? Legion had portals and LFG... I know i know
---
How i look at Tanks in Classic?
---
Paladin - cool at aoe, shit at ST, need to drink
---
Druid - no blocks, painful to heal
---
Shaman - lulwut
---
Warrior - my buddy
---
Kinda offensive yes, Paladins are my favorite tanks in WoW history overall, but in Classic the Warrior is a go to if you want to be The Tank.
---
You're actually wrong on this one! Brill tavern music was unique to vanilla and was removed during patch 2.3.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Gallows%27_End_Tavern
---
I'll say it again... You are a remarkably unpleasant person. I hope you're able to get over what ever issues you've got haunting you so that the rest of your life isn't filled with so much impotent rage.
---
I’m busting out my 15 y.o. Rig. Getting some blazing fast DSL internet, and playing on Max potato. I want the FULL experience!
---
Holy cow I remember using your guides when I was a teenager! 
---
At first I didnt care to much for classic wow but as time went on the hype is fuckin real
---
I’ve leveled to 60 twice now with my wife and she loves it too. We’re leveling up a third time right now casually. 
---
I’d say she got more of the hang of it around the late 20s. She has always been a healer and I’ve done rogue, warrior, and hunter with her. All classes that compliment healers. 
---
Shadowmeld was very helpful for hiding from PvP at first. 
---
She is really good a professions which got her more into the game. By the time she was 60 she was able to raid and geared up pretty well. 
---
It’s going to be up to you to teach her how to play though. Just teach her how /follow so you can do the long walks and help her get use to the game.
---
Thankyou for the information! I didn't know that about intellect! However, I refuse to give in to the idea that a Paladin will never be the main tank, second rate or not. I'm not going for world firsts or anything. Again thankyou for the insight but I won't give in!
---
You just have to make sure you choose a PvP server, oh man. My hands are sweating already
---
Thanks for the support! I know there is a lot to overcome but I hope to be able to do it!
---
Thanks heaps mate, appreciate it :)
---
Just let her learn at her own pace and enjoy the game
---
Let’s talk about the noob healer not using down ranked healing spells and runs themselves oom every pull. xd
---
5. Press Sunder Armor.
---
6. Repeat.
---
You should try to understand the basics of the game first.
---
Absolutely right! Thanks for the response! Still as long as its not impossible I won't give up!
---
I like it, its slightly fuller foliage and slightly more realistic water and textures, but it's optional. 
---
I'll be using it and glad others who don't want to wont have to.
---
I knooow! I kinda feel like they gave that whole arc over to the Worgen, and the Forsaken were left with mustache-twirling. 
---
I also feel like they had an opening in BFA to revisit the Tauren /Forsaken relationship.  Like if we're gonna write Sylvanas and Bain into the front and sack the Undercity... 
---
Example: some Forsaken Refugees show up in Thunder Bluff in addition to Org, maybe the caves in the spirit rise become a little more populated.  Bain, fearing Sylvanas' direction and wanting to  make good on his father's vision, starts restrengthening political ties with the Forsaken while she's away. Maybe the efforts of Hamuul's druids in curing / managing undeath become more visible with some quests or something. Seems like fertile ground to me!
---
Don't know about paladin, but I tanked most of the lvling dungeons and some lvl 60 dungeons as an enhancement shaman in vanilla
---
Thanks for the response! It's not offensive lol, I know there are plenty of drawbacks. As long as its not impossible I want to try my best and play a Paladin anyways! Again thank you for the response!
---
This video gets posted here every other day, though.
---
Yes. There are a bunch of things you can pick and choose from.
---
There was a strat for nefarian, the last boss of BWL, where the raid would stack on nefarian’s throne and one warrior tank would tank all the adds in phase one by spamming battle shout. Also worked for the caster emperor in AQ40.
---
\&gt;can't hit uncrittable or uncrushable
---
 
---
\&gt;they have mana. this leads to more downtime and over longer fights you will run out of mana. you can't tank without mana
---
\&gt;no taunt, as previously mentioned
---
\&gt;they don't have access to as much good tanking gear for their class, so damage taken is higher over all
---
\&gt;they produce a subpar amount of threat compared to warriors and druids
---
You can take a look at Skarm's video about [prot paladins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdNFdBB3GfA). He also has videos about warrior and druid tanking, so he can make various comparisons between them.
---
I played with a girl from school awhile back on retail. She had played before and wasn’t the best, but it was really fun for casual content. I imagine there is a lot of variance between people. Does she tend to pick up other things quickly? If you’ve never played a computer game before it is pretty complicated, don’t forget that. 
---
It can only get better too. Keep trying for another week or so. It will cause you to play less efficiently, but if you can accept that then I would encourage you. I would love a girl to play with again.
---
Just make sure to try and steer her towards a simple class, like mage! 
---
Another couple things to consider is it sounds like she did this for you and she enjoyed it. So I think those are reasons enough to keep going.
---
Thanks for the response! All good points! I still hope to find a way to redeem the Paladin tank! My hope is that as long as its not impossible to tank as a Paladin, I am ok to be second rate! Thanks again for the response!
---
I know the basics, I just never played true vanilla.
---
Ive started my wife into it also maybe we should just let the girls play together and learn together lol
---
big yikes!! this ain't it chief
---
Thank you for the support! Hopefully these guides will help!
---
Taunt is a minor issue. Very few bosses requires taunt. And you can build treath better then any second tank as long as you have mana. If you are second on treath just bop tank and there's your taunt. I never understood the whole no taunt thing on my list of things that makes paladin tanking difficult no taunt is in the last spot. Your biggest problem is gearing. You need mana for whole fight, defence to almost make you crit immune and hp to be able to take the occasional crit. Your second biggest problem is that your whole talent system is built on you being critted
---
I guess I'm going to have to upgrade from the 8400 to the 9600k or 8700k to get better single core performance for classic.
---
There is a lot of 'i played vanilla back in the day' snobbery out there and sometimes it is from people who either barely played and think that qualifies them to tell everyone what they MUST DO or those who played it not at all and are just parroting what they have heard. 
---
If everyone just picked what was optimum in every guild all the time it would be boring, the exciting thing for me about classic is that there are sufficient differences between the classes that you can find your niche. Good on you and good luck on your journey to prot pally tanking, don't let anybody bring you down! just remember they might not know as much as they claim to know! Just make sure you find a nice guild of people that are willing to try and enjoy different things :)
---
boarderline insanity challenge  
---
obsessive compulsive disboarder challenge  
---
i am unimaginative
---
:O holy shit man, that is crazy, we are over 30 so hopefully no nudes
---
Yeah, once you have tactical mastery I’ve found that to be really effective. If you combine that
---
With an engy bomb you’re good. Even though beserker has a negative threat modifier, it still is good for some initial agro.
---
The only issue is when the mobs require a ranged pull. If you have imp revenge and it procs early you can have a mob stunned and dead while you’re tanking the next.
---
You don’t want changes, and then complain the difference between graphic styles doesn’t change enough? Never happy
---
Low% speedrun sorta
---
"Did you set your pet on Wild Feeding?", the tank asked as the hunter's pet went rampaging through the instances and pulling all adds, only to pounce on a lvl 1 critter and devour it.
---
I can already see it.
---
wow, thanks for all responses, you get my motivations back on, we will see how this end i guess :)
---
Thanks for the response! You're right that the systems in place can be difficult to manage. As long as its not impossible I hope to find a way! Thanks for the support!
---
A Warrior friend of mine did ZG the other day with a Paladin off-tank. On Bloodlord, the Paladin was tasked with off-tanking the raptor, and all the DPS just focused Bloodlord. My Warrior friend pulled aggro off the Paladin just with Whirlwinds. I'll let you decide if that is acceptable threat from a Protection specced class.
---
I was the first hunter on my realm to get this.  I got a lot of /spit on me :p All of our warriors (who wanted it) got it already.
---
Just to add to that there is of also the 'I've played private servers for years so I know everything there is to know about vanilla and you must do what I say' brigade, don't listen to them either :P luckily though I think those people are the vocal minority , i think most people if they played private, original vanilla or none of the above are just going to get stuck into the experience and enjoy themselves,  you won't struggle to find a good group of people ithink :D
---
Don't worry.
---
I tended to look out for crazy ass bitches back then.
---
Probably with a 'normal' gf/wife there will be no problem at all :)
---
Thank you so much for the support! I should hope that more people think the way that you do! Don't worry I won't be discouraged! As long as its possible I will find a way!
---
Feels like OSRS with people coming up with crazy challenges to keep themselves entertained. More power to them, the mad bastards.
---
I want to do the same thing, but can’t decide between mage, Hunter, or MAYBE pally as secondary
---
Yes
---
I think fishing is the most underrated profession ever. If you have the time can you please make a more detailed fishing guide combined with cooking?
---
You could have some fun in dungeons, but paladins really can’t tank raids. For so many reasons that have been stated here. No taunt is a big one. You can’t taunt swap on bosses that apply debuffs. 
---
It’s already been linked, but I highly suggest you check out Skarm: https://youtu.be/WdNFdBB3GfA
---
If you want to play something other than a warrior you could try feral druid. They aren’t optimal, but are viable and actually fill some niches better than a warrior. Check out Taladril’s guide: https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
I'm going to be blunt, and my intention is not to be mean. There have been a countless number of people who think they'll be the one guy to figure out how to play meme specs and that they'll make it work somehow. Whether it's trying to make Paladins tank, or getting Balance even close to a Warlock or a Mage, or anything along those lines. It never works. I'm sorry, but you are just not going to be the special guy who magically figures out to how to make main Paladin tanks viable.
---
Hey friend, did you know a nice trick to make black/white easier on the eyes is to use a dark grey instead of black (like 80%). Good work anyway
---
For me it always looked like blizzard never intended for paladins to tank in vanilla. The talent tree is a joke and there is almost no paladin tanking gear
---
I assume this was done on a private server? Thanks for the response but I feel like your opinion is already biased against my message. As long as its possible I will find a way to do it! Thanks again for your response!
---
He was writing an hex color, not a title
---
I feel you are putting words in their mouth?
---
Thanks again! I think you're right! I'm sure there are others just looking to have fun and aren't bogged down in the perfectionist mindset.
---
Shamans have it pretty easy aswell frost shock and earth bind are awesome. And being able to always stay out of mele range is nice. Think warlocks should be fine aswell but never played one
---
No it's not that'd be stupid :D But it would work decently, but gimp every other aspect as a priest.
---
YESSS, I loved the old combat text!
---
Make sure to turn it on guys! I think it’s off by default.
---
Classic mode, plan on paying this on my Dell XPS 13 9370 while my girlfriend plays it on my gaming rig
---
Hopefully it'll run alright, we aren't interested in raiding just leveling together and shit.
---
I would need on the staff even if I was playing warrior.
---
Whoever you are watching that said that, stop watching them. 
---
Which elites? Leveling? Instances? 60? Elite world bosses?
---
Mages, warlocks, hunters all have the highest solo capability vs elites, but even druids and priests can to an extent, and really, any class can with enough preparation if needed.
---
This is the second posting
---
the problem is going to be a lot more spell resists than you realize and the risk of luring additional mobs while kiting. Also, elite mobs have serious hp pools and with your long cast time on your basic abilities its not in the same league as hunters.
---
I honestly think this speaks more about the player than the class/spec
---
Effective¿ Efficient? It actually is *more* efficient to have an alt with rest exp to level and rotate - if you're looking strictly at exp
---
So much yes. I thought I was the only one.
---
Yeah, it’s good if you have the room to charge. Combine with an engy bomb and it’s really good!
---
Huh. The more you know.
---
Ultra all the way for me. I played WoW from 2004-2007 and never played longer than a day or two at a time since then so it's less about nostalgia for me than just playing a great game I'm familiar with. Better graphics are a bonus.
---
Need on all valuable boe
---
I'm not trying to be special, I have no interest in breaking ground here, I just want people to keep an open mind and stop preaching that warriors are the only way to tank. Again thank you for taking time to respond but please don't misconstrue my message. People have tanked as Paladins before, its not a meme build. I don't care for the optimal, "warriors only", mindset and frankly just want to play for fun and want help with finding a way to do endgame content as a paladin tank.
---
I've noticed fiery in the level range you mentioned just blows through mobs.
---
Fucking A these type of info graphics give me a raging boner.
---
Shadowmeld for life. Also NE animations are way better. You should play what you like the most tbh. It’s not that big of a deal tbh.
---
Agreed!
---
Makes sense. Ally questing is miserable from 25-40 (duskwood is fun as fuck but so goddamn hard).  I don't remember having the same issues as horde
---
If DM north is far away and the mage equips it immediately I'd pass it to the mage and would agree that the others are ninja looting.   
---
But ,any mages would have agreed to all roll need for gold either way as they know they will replace it soon enough.  
---
I dont think I'd call out my party tho, as i see the reason for rolling need on it. And as soon as one person disagrees it all falls apart, making it a long shot that it would work to begin with.
---
Thanks for the response! These guides look helpful! Honestly I am just looking to tank as a Paladin, but I'll watch these videos and hopefully learn something! Thank you for the help!
---
You want to solo content (warlock &gt; Paladin). You want to be a high priority invite to dungeons and raids (for the summon). You want to have cheap repair costs (cloth v plate). You don’t want to farm materials just to play (Paladin &gt; warlock). You want to dps (warlock &gt; Paladin)
---
Thanks for the response! Could you give me some details on the talent tree issues? Any information is appreciated!
---
Different thing.
---
I'm gonna be maiming a Pally, I'm going SP Ret as the guilds nightfall wielder.
---
I guess you would not mind if everyone rolling need on Edgemasters handguards and Stockade pauldrons for gold then aswell?
---
The most casual of Casuals. Good luck, seriously. You just have to find people with similar mindset to yours. I wouldn’t be confident in changing any minds.
---
Said by a Warrior tank ;)
---
You'll have to somehow prove it's not a meme build. I wish you luck.
---
Certain raid bosses require a taunt rotation between a number of tanks. BoP will not work for that.
---
Wow super well done! I'd love to see something similar for main professions. Though I imagine that would take a lot more work  XD.
---
Thanks for the response! Lol you're right, it seems like people are more eager to downvote than help. I definitely will be a very casual player! Cheers mate and happy tanking to you!
---
I remember my irl friend had a twinked out hunter with that gun. Legit 1 shotting people similar level.
---
Thank you sir! Again thank you for your responses and insight, I hope to see you once classic launches! Cheers mate!
---
I'll say it again.. You have brain damage, you got dropped on your head as a baby, your dad kicked you when he was beating your mom while you were in her belly, you don't know how to process logic and you're too stupid to realize that if im "unpleasant" then you can simply stop replying, you're a chromosome ahead of the entire conversation.
---
If an elite can be affected by control effects, many classes san solo it, like frost mages, warlocks, hunters and druids (Entangling Roots ftw).
---
I know four horseman needs it, which other bosses? I also know few guilds every beat nax so I am not too discouraged! Thanks for your response!
---
Because people complained.
---
Ok, maybe a little fat 😂😂😂 but Even “casual” players will be playing 2-3 hrs a day at launch. Never seen excitement like it for classic. I’m hoping to get to 60 in 6 weeks at least.

In case your friend decides to go Gnome, it takes about 15 minutes to do the Theramore run without any interruptions. It feels like it takes a lot longer when you are actually doing it though.
---
unless she legit gets into it on her own and not just as a way for you two to play together, be careful of out leveling her. It will start a fight akin to watching a show together on netflix and you watching the next season without her.
---
Been thinking about asking blizz to resurrect my 33 hunter Lionbluff. First character I ever made in 07
---
I honestly hate the mentality of "them" vs "us".
---
Never liked it, I love to play with all kinds of people.
---
Also you have to remember that many of the Elites, even when kited, means the player needs to clear the entire area and hope for no respawns until the elite is killed. 
---
Hunters have it easy as they have the pet with taunt and aoe’s. They can Feign death to wipe threat, they can mend their pet and dps down the elite and even if the pet dies, they can kite with conc shot, frost / freeze traps, wing clip etc. 
---
But elite quests are still tough for hunters.
---
A properly geared Druid that knows how to tank is in many ways better than a warrior tank in dungeons as a priest. Down time is low because the Druid can innervate and heal between pulls. And I find that the average Druid tank is better at keeping aoe aggro than the average warrior tank. In raids a Druid as off tank is very nice to have.
---
Rested exp exists to help people who don’t have a large amount of time to play. In that case I’d highly recommend not making alts unless you want to switch to a different class during leveling.
---
Vanilla is just not an alt friendly game. Unless you have infinite time you are gonna struggle to complete all the things you need done with just one character and a bank alt. Let alone leveling several different characters all at once!
---
They’ve never said your entire summer will be “classic”. It’s just a deliberate misinterpretation from your side. A mid-late August release(which I’ve said numerous times is most probable) still gives you more than a month of summer with classic.
---
was hoping for a pic of the card but that's chill too
---
If it’s a pug, need on any boe, but greed on any bop you don’t use (can still vendor or De if enchanter. 
---
If with guild mates,  talk it over on voice chat as you start the run.
---
Palas can also solo elites really well
---
M+ at high levels is a million times "harder" than any dungeon from classic.  
---
The difficulty in classic dungeons are finding people, getting them all there and not disbanding during the dungeon ;)
---
Honestly you're a bit of a noob if you even equip a valuable BoE, their value in gold is far more than the incredibly minor benefit you'll get from using them levelling for ~5-10 levels. Forcing someone to equip it (which you obviously can't do and is just inviting drama) is even worse, what a waste. The value of BoEs is selling to someone (generally twink/gold buyer) so you can use that gold usefully.    
---
    
---
At the start of the run you say *ALL NEED BOEs*. Problem solved. No bickering, no whining, no 5 minute pauses when something drops. If someone wants to be all noble and give it to someone after they win they can.
---
Shamans can solo that tinker boss in maraudon for the awesome shield.
---
Unless you know the people in your group ( say a bunch of guildies) the standard approach is for everyone to need on boe items when they drop.
---
That is the thing, just make it sure before the run. Like if you run DM just ask the grp before if you bis drop that you need it.
---
It Is all about communication
---
&gt; enhance shaman, who can only wear it past lvl 40. Seeing at it has a lvl 37 req I still argue that they're clearly warrior/paladin priority.
---
Except those shoulders are mail and not plate, so you can make the argument that they should be Shaman priority just as well.
---
Warriors and Paladins will learn to wear plate armor at level 40, so even though you probably won't replace them right as you ding you still have the option to get an item drop with an armor upgrade and usually after level 40 both of those classes will steer away from using mail if possible.
---
Shamans on the other hand learn to wear mail armor at level 40, so even though the shoulders have a level 37 level requirement which means you have to wait 3 levels to use them, the mail items you get from SM from various bosses are some of the best gear a leveling Shaman can get at level 40 whereas a Warrior or Paladin will replace them as soon as they get a decent plate drop.
---
yeah but the new graphics will make you say "WoW!" every time
---
Bawls energy drink :O
---
If you equip a BoE, it’s dumb af anyways, except maybe edge-master’s cause those are BiS for the whole game. No one is going to expect you to have these and you can do content just fine without them.
---
The amount of gold you can sell them for represents a lot of time played or a mount, as you say. 
---
I would just talk in party chat about what to do before hand, you have time, but I really don’t think a warrior rolling on Staff of Jordan is an asshole move. It depends on context and how nice everyone is being imo.
---

Unlike most people here, I actually have been totally fine with almost every modern WoW decision.  However, this...**THIS SHIT** in modern WoW right here that's described in the OP is something I can't disagree more with.  I kind of understand why they changed it: When everyone's doing at least 5 damage events every second on average and auto-attacks don't matter as much, it's fair to argue it's too obstructive and meaningless to show them the old way.
---
However, I still absolutely hate how they changed it, and I will be very upset if they're unable to use the old combat text because of using the current client.
---
Another good idea people had even with pugs is set a macro and hotkey so post in group chat, for everyone to need on BOE’s and greed on BOP’s they didn’t need. 
---
Then everyone is equal.
---
Might be worth a discussion if the audit system might be too much and not the way of classic.
---
But yea, gbanks in istself would definetely fix the account sharing issue.
---
How long does it take to level fishing 1-60?
---
Well humans develop. So it does get easier with time invested. You'll also achieve high level patience with noobs in groups instead of raging 5-6 computers into destruction as I have done over the years of gaming.
---
You Will have no problem whatsoever when you play 5man with your friends. As long as they give you a few seconds to build threat pala tanks works great. In vanilla I only played together with a pala tank up to ZF and I had no trouble at all keeping him up. I have no late game experience so I dont know how they fare after that. 
---
In levelling dungeons neither you or the warrior tank has any defense items so you get to use your getting crit abilities. At 60 when the warriors start to stack defense though you need as much mitigation stats but you also need mana regen and spellpower. Its obvious you cant keep up then even if there were no defensive stance, shield block etc.
---
If you dont aim for 40 man raiding I think you can have plenty if fun though. Im going for a druid tank with that mindset myself.
---
Depends on how much gold you want to grind. If you are a plate wearer and take BS, making yourself weapons and armour will be alot cheaper than buying. And any surplus you make can be stuck on the AH. The only exception to this is cloth classes. Its not as easy to farm mats for tailoring as it is for LW and BS, so in that case I would take gathering professions and buy gear. 
---
If you enjoy grinding for gold, get a couple of gathering professions, and sell the mats on AH till you can afford said gear.

I personally will be taking LW and skinning on my hunter, have always had it on my main and it's come in handy s fair few times over the years.
---
I want to play night elf.  Its certainly not the strongest but i think the racials are a bit underrated for pvp
---
Send pet &gt; Curse of Agony &gt; Corruption &gt; wand.
---
All the small dragons in bwl requires this. There is probably more bosses as well, just cannot think of any more atm.
---
Keep in mind that the rested xp you gain is something like 2.5 levels over 10 days. Since level require more and more experience it means that rested xp becomes more and more valuable the closer to 60 you are. Inversely it's complete trash in the lower levels and waiting 10 days may end up saving you like 20 minutes of leveling. 
---
I think the math would work out better if you made one character and got it to level 40. Then made and alt and got it to 40 . Spend your first characters rested xp, Then start a 3 alt and so on. Sort of cascading down your character list.
---
Autoloot was in vanilla. Aoe loot was not and it's not in classic either.
---
If it would be for the "nostalgia" i would be playing 1024x768 black bars with classic graphic settings.
---
Though my "nostalgia" get's triggered by the gameplay and everything, not from the graphics. 
---
Though this can obviously be different from person to person
---
Thank you for the response! I definitely am focused on just having fun that's for sure! After reading everyone's comments I know I won't be the best tank in the game lol, but I will still have a crack at tanking 40's and hopefully with a good casual guild I might be able to do it! Thanks again for the response, cheers!
---
Yeah I'm concerned about this too. It got worse in wotlk and it just went full retard in legion, no idea why.
---
My 1ghz processor and 512mb ram and that old school voodoo 3 gfx card turned org into power point lol
---
hey screw you guy (learned my lesson here)
---
Man you're just not understanding me at all. 
---
Okay lets say you run into someone with dwarfism. Do you think it wouldn't be hurtful to say "hey you're really short", even though it's true that that person is really short?
---
When I got my wife in to the game she took a few months to get hold of everything 😁
---
Surprisingly greedy consensus forming here. My approach was always wait to see how everyone else rolls and if people were clearly rolling to sell then I would too. But I’d say 75% of the time my experience was that if someone said they needed it (and it was clearly a solid upgrade for them) people would let them have it. A couple pulls later it would be brought up if they still haven’t equipped it, but that wasn’t too common.
---
I have seriously considered rolling paladin for Judgement set aesthetic alone. I think the best looking set to this day.    
---
Stormrage is close though, and I'm a druid at heart.
---
Thanks for the information!
---
Ofc you gained an advantage standing still. Spamming frostbolts &gt; spamming Icelance. Even if the target was frozen, you'd still prefer to get a shatter combo off over just casting icelance
---
I dont mean the general concept of buffs producing aggro (which does actually make sense) but the coefficient of def stance. I read something  somewhere about that.
---
Then you can have a toggle for mount skins and stuff aswell. Whats wrong with you people contantly begging for changes its exhausting! The old animation and models add a great deal to how the original game feld. If you dont like classic then you are the one that needs to gtfo, stupid kid
---
I think you're overestimating the difference. There is definitely a difference, but it's NOWHERE near that much. Most quests give the same exp, some give a little more, resulting in faster leveling, but the overall difference is not massive.
---
Would be awesome if they did but doubt it.
---
&gt;Do you seriously not get that a lvl 37 shaman has no fucking god damn right rolling need on herod's shoulders over a lvl 37 warrior?
---
Play on any decently populated private server and try to run SM and you'll quickly notice that the groups you find are infested with Shamans because the mail gear from SM is the best leveling gear they can get by a long shot as soon as they learn to wear mail and get to replace their shitty leather items.
---
If you actually logged onto a private server and started yelling in trade chat that a Shaman ninja'd your mail items from SM as a Warrior people would literally laugh in your face and make a meme out of you.
---
Damn the only piece I ever won was the headpiece of Mount Hyjal, such an Awesome time back then
---
Count your lucky stars she will play with you and don’t you dare complain itll slow you down!
---
If there is an option to upright orc posture I won't play Classic for sure, it would ruin the experience.
---
They make money *because* not everyone is picking them up. Which is fine. Capitalism, ho!
---
No, you can't.
---
The shadows are the biggest different aside of the foliage and water.
---
But I bet those instances ran like Atari!
---
Well, is it confirmed that it'll be back?
---
Would love to see some old server names so we could have a better chance of running into people we played with back in the day.
---
If you see someone starting a cast on you, you can still use shadowmeld to cancel their cast as you are not put into combat before they have finished casting. For a warrior this is huge against mages.
---
There is also a lot of fun gameplay that you can have with shadowmeld if you are a bit creative. Stealth gives a lot more options to creative play in pvp situations and battlegrounds that other warriors do not have.
---
I loved the Paladin but alot of people tell me they sucked at Holy and even tanking was shit due no taunt spell. Thats why I am still curious about choosing my class :(
---
Niiiiice! Thanks a lot
---
Level 1 Rogue twink with slow weapons enchanted with agi. Fully enchanted you can get extreme amounts of dodge crit and AP.
---
In cases where you had to interact with the game world, did you use a GM addon/interface or did you use chat commands?
---
If it was an interface, do you remember what it looked like? What kind of features it had?
---
If you used commands, do you remember any of those? The commands used on private servers are like:
---
    .gm on
---
    .additem ID
---
    .mod speed 10
---
4
---
Miss
---
Dodge
---
# 12
---
 I'm mostly looking forward to play a great game true to the roots of MMORPG(no gameplay changes). Max settings for me , graphics is a bonus and I'm happy to have that option.
---
Initially I remember playing vanilla with a GeForce 4 with 64mb VRAM on a CRT monitor. I guess [times change](https://youtu.be/TLzhlsEFcVQ?t=202).
---
***Private server** speedrunning. Do not make the mistake thinking that private servers=classic.
---
I was playing on the HD mode macro back then, so I'll play on Classic but with maxed ground clutter radius and density
---
NO. It was not in classic so they should not be in it today  and i dont want people to see a different character that i see. No changes. New models are in bfa you can play the cheap anime looking stuff there
---
I remember my system was good enough to raid up to BWL. For some reason in BWL the cpu just couldn't keep up and I would go out of sync constantly. I had to leave the progression raid team until I could upgrade and back then I was in high-school so it took awhile.
---
For me, it's that what you do is basically laid out for you.  You get a formula to follow, and you do it.  The formula is more complex than Vanilla, but it's still a formula.  It doesn't matter if you're on a raid boss or fighting little guys in the open world, you do the exact same thing.
---
In Vanilla, if I'm playing on a Warlock, sometimes I'm using my full array of dots, sometimes it's shadow bolt spam, sometimes I'm wanding to save mana, sometimes I'm using Drain Life to heal, sometimes I use a utility curse instead of a damage curse ("oh, you wanna run away and grab 5 more mobs, I'll CoReck you"), and sometimes I'm doing something else entirely.
---
In Live, if you're playing a Warlock, you just run around building soul shards and then using them to make every other fight shorter.

---
look at side 2
---
65 days 4 hours 34 minutes on my level 116 druid had him since 2005
---
It was a separate game client, but If I recall correctly it was a command prompt at the top of the screen you would pull up.  The commands were like the ones who showed.  For the most part it really did just look like the normal game.  
---
I don't remember what all the commands were, but the most common were definitely teleporting to a player, or teleporting a player to use, the instant kill command for bugged monsters, run speed, fly and clip through walls were typically just left on as well as invis.  If you were a specialist you would end up create a lot of items, lots of looking up items numbers.
---
I hope that you will record your run this time as well. If I may suggest, please do it in higher resolution cause I wouldnt mind watching it in the background. 
---
Higher resolution with vanilla WoW ambient sound/music in the background (if its allowed).
---
I still remember that "Your computer fails to meet the minimum requirements" popping up before the actual Installer.exe
---
Ultra. I like vanilla for the game play not the graphics
---
&gt; If you want to play THAT game, the warrior scales better with gear so they in fact need it more.
---
Complete BS. If you're going to make a statement like this you can't just make it out of your ass, you have to actually calculate it.
---
First of all you have to know the EP values for each stat for both classes at a certain level to be able to calculate how beneficial a stat point would be for them, which I doubt you do.
---
Second of all you have to take into account the gear they're wearing at the specific moment.
---
Even if in theory the stats would benefit a Warrior more (which I'm not saying is a fact, I'm just entertaining this idea for this point) in reality most of the time the Shaman gets a way bigger stat boost from that item than the Warrior does.
---
The primary stats for any leveling Shaman are stamina and strength, same as it is for Warriors and Paladins.
---
Do you know how much leather gear you find with stamina and strength slapped on it while leveling? Most leather gear is either agility based or intellect / spirit based, so unless you're willing to spend a ton of gold in the AH for expensive optimal stat items (which no one does while leveling) chances are you're going to be wearing some weird mix of stamina, spirit and intellect as a Shaman.
---
So even if 1 point of strength is worth more for a Warrior, that Warrior is most likely already wearing a green quality mail shoulder that gives him 5 strength and 5 stamina, whereas the Shaman might be wearing some scrappy stamina / spirit leather shoulders.
---
So not only does the Shaman get a massive armor boost of 100+ armor, the SM mail gear is so wanted by them because it's the first leveling gear in the game that actually has good stats on them for a leveling Shaman.
---
A Warrior wearing some 150 armor, 5 stamina, 5 strength shoulders is going to benefit from the stat boost far less than a Shaman who gets 100+ armor boost and +6 strength boost from them.
---
Even if in theory 1 point of strength would be more valuable for a Warrior, the amount of stats most Shamans get from the SM items far surpasses the minor stat upgrade a Warrior or a Paladin would get if they would replace their green mail item. 
---
Which is exactly why on private servers you see a ton of Shamans try to run SM as many times as they can at that level range, because they're wearing low armor leather with a weird stat mix and not only is the SM gear close to level 40 level mail but it actually has stats that Shamans have been looking for the past 40 levels but are hard to find on leather items.
---
So in the majority of cases those mail items from SM offer leveling Shamans way bigger of a stat boost than it does for a Warrior or a Paladin, it's not even in the same league how much a Shaman replacing a stamina / spirit / intellect item benefits from that over a Warrior who is already wearing an item with stamina / str but it just has 2-3 less of each stat.
---
would be nice if it was possible to only have the extra detail to shrub without the new water/shadows
---
I've already played retail vanilla Wow. I've played on pservers.
---
This is Classic though.
---
Max Settings.
---
If a player wants to equip a boe for an upgrade they can just go buy it themselves on the AH whenever they want to. A boe item has an equal gold value to all 5 members of your group, everyone has a right to roll on it.
---
Memes
---
Practicing.
---
A big thing I think many are missing when it comes to rppvp or rp, is that it scares away many immature people.
---
The shear fact that the server has a RP tag on it repulses many and that is a good thing, especially in vanilla.
---
I can only judge from playing on AD in retail for some expansions. Most of the people I met where more mature and chill so to speak.
---
Now imagine trying to troll on a rp-pvp realm in vanilla. What a absolute waste of time. Not enough that you are going to struggle tremendously with doing anything in the game due to the rp community is very strong. But also just making a lvl 1 ton that can't get anywhere in game to do said trolling will as I see it, be way to MUCH work.
---
so, if you are like me, not really into rp but can absolutely tolerate it and it's users. Then RP-PVP can be a very relaxed server environment where you meet alot of mature people.
---
I'm not saying all other server types are inferior in any way, just that I personally with experience find rp and rp-pvp more relaxed then pvp and pve and that it fits perfectly for my playstyle and goals in the game.
---
I wouldn’t be too afraid of rolling warrior. It’s going to be a heavily populated class, but it’s also going to be an in demand class. They’re the best tanks and dps. Also they suck solo, so it will for you force you to socialize, which is really the whole point of the game. 
---
Between Warlock and Ret Paladin. I’d definitely go lock. They’re a strong class with a lot of utility. Summons are so good, especially when it takes so long to get around. I’m thinking of making one myself. Even a level 20 alt has a lot of use. You could level one to 20 and see how you’re liking it. 
---
Ultimately just do what you think you’ll have the most fun with!
---
of course not, it's fair game. If someone wants edgemasters they buy them from the AH.
---
I like your style
---
First of all redoubt and reckoning requires you to be critted second you have improved concentration aura instead of retribution or sanctify aura third you have to go 11 points holy making you miss alot of synergy talents like parry and critt in retri also making you spend 3 points to get 50%extra treath from righteous fury is just wrong
---
Was it this one?
---
https://i.imgur.com/ZDbS7pW.jpg
---
This is just on the top of my head whiteout seeing the talent tree might be alot more I don't remember
---
It’s only not an alt friendly game if your only goal is hardcore raiding (pushing server firsts, etc.). 
---
These servers aren’t going anywhere anytime soon. There is no need to rush to be able to experience everything.
---
300-350g at 40 on a fresh new server while leveling fast? You're so full of shit.
---
The difference it will make to raiding and end game PVP cant be understated.
---
Sure it will if you are second on treath and can pass the other tank in time for bop to run out. Won't work on four horsemen tho
---
Wealcum!
---
They don't scale.
---
I came
---
Played a NE Warrior in vanilla and had an absolute blast. Animations are sick, they look bad ass in plate and shadowmeld was great fun in pvp. For the record the only other warrior to beat me on the dps charts was a Dwarf from MC to Naxx.
---
Roll NE my bro and don't look back. Ignore these people that keep regurgitating the same thing about weapon skill.
---
I would go undead, cause you get devouring plague and you don’t have to deal with people resisting/escaping your fear in pvp. It would make you much stronger. 
---
There are a lot of people on horde and alliance. I’m sure you will find friends either faction you play. Especially as a priest!
---
Unless you want to lvl fishing, which takes a lot of time, I would recommend lvling cooking from mob drops, especially clams/crab meat.
---
Herbology and Alch to supply yourself with potions.
---
Good on ya Paul, and good luck!
---
Cross server bgs were in 1.12 sooooo
---
As others have said, levelling is part of the experience. The world is open and organic. Some of the 5-mans you hit while levelling are absolutely epic (BRD is my personal favourite)
---
I'm torn because being part of the speedrun experience would be fun (not that I expect to really do well), but I'd miss so much. Half considering speedrunning an alt first, then levelling my main properly.
---
&gt;Just as a side note, when it comes to giving Blizzard your info, always, always use real first and last name
---
This is so much more important than people realise. For about 5 years I stopped playing entirely on my [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) account and since I had many accounts I often forgot the passwords. The thing is, after 5 years I had deleted the email's domain name and couldn't log in. However I had put a fake name on that account that had many purchased games on it because at the time of creation I was quite young and stupid and thought it'd be more secure.
---
So when I contacted the support, I explained the situation to the support staff: the name I had put in was my original name but with 3 vowels deleted. Hopefully they were understanding and I was able to get back to my account but if I had put in a random name I probably couldn't have done so.
---
Herb works great, alch is optional
---
Execute crits on Vael make me so happy!
---
What would you get alongside herb?
---
I think the biggest takeaway is that L20 is only about 10% of it.
---
Are there specific potions for alchemy that are superior that other professions do not get?
---
The sad thing is that correctly geared shamans are probably better at 5-15 man tanking then paladins the threat generated by a shaman is awesome and gearing shamans and paladins have the same problems. I eaven think you can tank 40 man bosses that do elemental damage as shaman sins you don't need armor or defence and you have 15% less damage from elements
---
Noooooo!
---
There's 2 completely fair ways to handle this and that's a problem.
---
One is to let people who NEED items get the item, obviously checking that they equip it first. 
---
Second is to argue that a BoE item is worth the same to everyone, and thus everyone should get to roll. Say a edgemaster is worth 1k gold, well everyone gets a roll on 1k gold, the warrior in the group gets to roll whether he saves 1k gold or not, which is the same thing as getting 1k gold.
---
It's really hard to judge which one is more correct, and when you have a group where people have different opinions on it, then bad situations can occur.
---
I remember the Lifeblood spell from Herbalism which gave you a 15 sec haste buff. I'm not sure if this was a thing in vanilla or not.
---
Is battle shout efficient even if you already have it applied?
---
Are you NA or EU tho? If you are EU Just pm me om launch and ill tell you what server me and my buddies are playing on. 😉 ( Or if they release a list)
---
Choice is always appreciated, I blindly spam my rotation and do fine. 
---
In vanilla if I did that I'd be oom or dead.
---
No you are limited to what you can farm as resto and herbs is the best way to go
---
Thats wotlk
---
also much of their damage cannot crit so spellcrit is a really weak stat for  tank paladins.
---
No because warlock is shit class.
---
Aha
---
Warriors are the easiest tanks to get with. They're also the best tanks. 
---
Paladin's don't have a taunt. They can't raid tank.
---
Pick skinning/herb for levelling and then dropp skinning for engineering if you want to pvp else you can pick any second profession you want
---
Warrior and Paladin
---
People doing speed records will make their own route though, else they wouldn't be able to make it
---
So I’m not interested in PvP at all, so go herb + skinning for leveling then drop skinning for alchemy?i assume I collect all my herbs to help alchemy leveling when I’m 60?
---
Using consumes really just is easier. The time you save from wiping and slow dps makes up for it 100%.
---
*Came here* to say this.
---
Yes, practicing private server speedruns, not classic speedruns.
---
I was in a guild on a pserver with the feral boomer and shadow too, we cleared naxx, but we did have to sub out the meme specs sometimes when progression was rough.
---
Warlock maybe all other classes you need to out gear your opponent
---
I can't imagine an authentic Classic experience without this.
---
Thing is, vanilla wow was very much a case of Rock Paper Scissors! No class was OP against very class. 
---
I played a hunter and got to Marshal, they were great, but locks and shadow priests were tough. Pally’s were hard too. 
---
Well geared Mages can kill a tonne of classes too, but rogues and practically 1-2 shot them.
---
I'll roll rsham too and i think i'll go with alch + herb. why? because leatherworking do not bring that much for a rsham as far as i see, and because i want to be independent with my consumables and mana pots!! but i'm still wondering...
---
This is awesome
---
You can pick anything alchemy is nice but a guild only really needs one. Sure transmutes are nice but that's it. Enchanting can be nice just to de gear from 5 mans making you some extra money and giving you the opportunity to do strat living runs effectively
---
Woyer:
---
Charge &gt; Mortal Strike crit for 2k+, finish off with Execute 2k+.
---
If more than 1 enemy: Recklessness &gt; Charge &gt; Mortal strike + white hit crit on the second enemy and they all gon b ded.
---
The answer you're looking for is Mage. The guy below me saying Warrior and Paladin is an idiot as that's not even 1 v x thats 2 v x.   Warriors will get beaten by anyone that can kite them such as a Mage.  Look up Vurtne vids to see the potential of what a mage can do.  Mages can control multiple people at once with low cooldowns and very decent burst even in crap gear.
---
This is amazing, AMAZING!
---
I believe that they can, they have in the past, they will be able to again. They aren't the best sure, but they can be viable.
---
This is coming from the perspective of a PVE focused Holy Paladin. All of my lessons learned from failure and to other classes' insight.
---
In the event that you have 6 paladins in raid: Each paladin does one blessing each; simple
---
1.  Salvation
---
2. Kings
---
3. Light
---
4. Wisdom
---
5. Might
---
6. Sanctuary
---
In the event that you have 5 paladins in raid: 
---
1st paladin does salvation on everyone
---
2nd paladin does kings on everyone
---
3rd paladin does Light on everyone
---
4th paladin does Wisdom on healers and caster. Then they do Might on melee dps, tanks and hunter pets
---
5th paladin does Sanctuary on everyone
---
In the event that you have 4 paladins in raid:
---
1st paladin does Sanctuary on Tanks and Salvation on non Tanks.
---
2nd paladin does Kings on everyone
---
4th paladin does wisdom on healers, casters, and hunters. Then they do Might on melee dps, tanks and hunter pets.
---
In the event that you have 3 paladins in raid: (this is where you start to lose effectiveness due to not having light on everyone).
---
3rd paladin does wisdom on healers and casters. Then they do Might on Melee DPS and hunter pets and then Sanctuary on tanks.
---
In the event that you have only have 2 paladin in raid (Really sacrificing effectiveness here)
---
1st paladin does Kings on everyone
---
2nd paladin does Wisdom on healers. Then they do Salvation on all dps. Then they do light on all tanks.
---
In the event that you have only 1 paladin and are doing a raid, strongly consider waiting for at least one more paladin. In the event that you have to do all blessings by yourself;
---
Wisdom on healers. Then do Salvation on all dps and hunter pets. Then do kings on tanks.
---
Other Thoughts; Blessing of Salvation in my opinion is the best overall buff in the game. 30 % reduced threat generated serves multiple beneficial purposes. 
---
  A.   It makes it less likely you'll pull aggro and die if you don't have a mechanic to prevent it like Divine Shield or Feign Death. 
---
  B.    It makes it less likely you'll pull aggro and put the boss out of position on position important fights. 
---
  C.    DPS don't have to slow or stop their dps to avoid pulling threat, so in a way it's a dps increase if the dps can out threat the tank with or without salvation.
---
Kings is also really good. The more you benefit from multiple Primary Stats (not secondary stats like spell crit /  + healing) the better it is. As a holy paladin I've found that while I do enjoy kings (bigger mana pool and slightly higher spell crit that I get from the increased intellect), on longer fights (raids) with gear lesser than T3, I get more mana back with wisdom than what I would get with a bigger mana pool to start with and what illumination would refund via kings.
---
Kings is incredibly good for tanks, because they strongly benefit from at least 3 primary stats, Stamina (more reaction time for your healers to do low cost mana heals), Strength increases their attack power, and how much damage they block when they do block, and Agility which increases their attack power to a lesser extent (warriors), increase dodge chance, and  their armor. It sounds like a dream come true for feral tanks.
---
Not every paladin will spec into kings. Rarely will any paladin spec into sanctuary. I've even seen prot paladin skip sanctuary despite it only costing 1 point in the prot tree.
---
I plan on not speccing into improved might (because most holy paladins take it anyway), holy shock (terrible cd time and healing per mana ratio) and go after blessing of sanctuary for the benefit of the raid b/c it is almost always gets skipped, even with 5 or 6 paladins and is pretty good for tanks (still less beneficial than kings and light though).
---
When assigning blessings in a raid (pallypower addon should be mandatory) consider who has what blessing available, and who has the upgraded book ranks of might and wisdom. beyond that consider who has talented improved versions of might and wisdom. Hopefully at least one paladin specs into kings. You'll be fortunate if someone specs into sanctuary at all (atleast one person in repeat group should).
---
The minimal requirement was
---
&gt; 933 MHz or higher G4 or G5 processor 
---
My processor had 895MHz, which triggered the "Your computer fails to meet the minimal requirements" warning, with the "quest abandoned" sound, when running Installer.exe
---
Wow funny you say this.
---
I just switched away from playing on that but not out of necessity at all! With everything on medium/high I average 50 odd FPS and cleared ony MC bwl zg aq20 on it as mage on a private server recently. Moved back to the rig though for now.
---
lol
---
Hi, /u/CPTB14
---
On the XPS 13? 
---
Nice good to know it runs okay.
---
I also have an old machine that's currently running as a media server with an i7 920 thinking about picking up an AMD RX 470 to beef that up some and give that to my girlfriend. 
---
My rigs a i7 4790k GTX 1080 so going to be quite the difference in performance, but we just want to casually enjoy leveling like we did over a decade ago...
---
God I'm nostalgic.
---
A big issue with retail is the numbers are meaningless. 100 damage or 800k damage there's no real difference when players have a million HP and pvp scaling. In vanilla the numbers are small, consistent and easy to wrap your head around. You hit a big crit in a raid and you think to yourself wow I must be strong! Imagine if I had done that in a bg vs a player! And you can imagine it because the game doesn't change damage scaling everytime you enter pvp combat.
---
Everything ultra except water
---
Yeah, I'll check out some of his vids. The stealth mechanic of rogues seems so OP but I'd rather have the ability to 1vX at any given time.
---
That was the name of the addon. Was it the “first” major addon created?
---
Idd, but still not confirmed?
---
Probably because it costs Blizzard money, somehow. Or people got offended. Any bullshit reason you can think of, really.
---
You can force more foilage into the vanilla client already
---
Wow! It's like Im in the World of WoWCraft!
---
Cool, thanks! Now I have 2FA, (I'm not sure if this was available around 2007) and luckily both accounts used real names so I remember that after my friends account was locked he had to fax his ID during the recovery process. And this way he could get it back. 
---
Also, I think I read it here on reddit that nowadays if your account is hacked, the hackers put an authenticator on it immediately so it's even harder to recover. 
---
Moral of the story, use 2FA as he recommended. (Just don't forget to write down the recovery code of the authenticator.)
---
You are right mages are by far the best class for 1vX when you know what you're doing and have consumables. Btw that dude was obviously trolling lol.
---
Son, I didn't build a system with an overpriced GPU and 27" WQHD screens just to run the game with the same setting back in 2006. #changes or no, them sliders are going all the way to the right.
---
What are you talking about mate, Joana just did lvl21 in 11 hours a month ago. If you get lucky with item upgrades, 14 hours as a warrior is easily possible - especially given that you can save around an hour in 1-10 compared to a hunter.
---
im fairly sure people said it made it "hard" to see. So you know instead or having a option they just flat out removed a very immersive option, because of people who most likely believe the earth is flat.
---
from 26€ a month (or 30$ for dollarpayers, or whatever for brexiters)
---
Cool thread that made me try practicing the leveling route and surprisingy it's really fun! Cool way to pass the time before classic

It might work on some Mages, but any good Mage will counterspell you or use R1 Frostbolt to put you into combat. And if you do get a Shadowmeld off then he will Blizzard you out and then you can't Charge him at all.
---
buy pastle motar 50 gp
---
Only 7 million online?
---
While i like that you went and made this vid, or who ever did. The problem with doing it like this where you show half the screen with either option is that you arent really able to see the differences as you would if you showed before after shots
---
If I, for the first time, roll on a PVE server (limited time to play), then I will play for the immersion, with full weather effects. If I roll on a PvP and decide to play as efficient as possible, then it will be without effects. Not sure what to do... I kinda want to PvP, but to be in higher echelon it requires time, which is a resource I am limited on... God damnit, why does everything needs to be so hard... I want to be a teenager again :(  Almost to no responsibilities and all the time in the world.
---
Shadow priest, or rogue if you can keep CC up.
---
Isn't the idea that joana didn't use is in his soriginal speedrun? If thi'k that's the case.
---
If you plan on making more than 1 lvl 60, then I think it’s worth considering (also depends how much of a hurry you are in of course)
---
I think you get around 1 lvl of rested every week, so even if it’s just to get that lvl every week on the alt, is worth considering
---
One alt day a week could put a real dent into it
---
People here downvote almost everything that's not a low effort meme...
---
I think #nochanges should apply here as well and impose a 20 FPS limit in raid and pvp zones
---
Paladin can't 1vX?? Consider looking 'Zalgradis' videos, this guy 1v5 with protection pally :)
---
I thought that was what you were looking for, some food for your troll post?
---
Because its gonna be a radical change... Get you head out of your ass, private servers  might be wrong regarding some values, but not completly different.
---
You can kind-of get a similar looking scrolling text by modifying some cvars, but it's not the same... :(
---
If you plan on doing any pvp you should pick engineering. Don't worry about mining, you can buy the mats pretty cheaply. Other than that, idk really, alch does work great, could also go with another gathering profession like mining, if you end up doing DME drop runs which is a very strong way to make gold as shaman, you group up with a warrior and you need: enchanting+mining and optionally herbing. Obviously enchanting is also a choice there, but you can keep it unskilled and just use it for DE'ing(skill requirement to DE high lvl items was added in TBC).
---
Smile. You are about to be in a PvP video.
---
Go show me onemodern art asset they are using. Good luck.
---
Crazy to think and those are amateur numbers compared to TBC and WotLK, I’d be surprised if BFA is even hitting a mil.
---
Warlock can dot up multiple targets and stay alive while they slowly burn down.
---
Mage can do big AOE burst as elemental spec (and you still have iceblock x2)
---
Rogue can keep multiple targets CC'ed and assassinate one target and get away.
---
SPriest can work kinda like a warlock too.
---
Warlock is one of the most gear dependent classes in the game.
---
Sorry let me just submit by classic wow speedrun.
---
Oh wait the game isn't out yet? Who would've thought..
---
I'm expecting the veterans of the private server scene to steamroll 1-60 in classic. They've had a lot of practice. Same with the PVE World Firsts.
---
A Frost Mage can do that fresh at 60. 
---
Warlock and Spriest can do it when they get some gear.
---
Worn dagger + fiery weapon enchand.
---
These 40 fire damage proqs are really strong.
---
Remember that she probably views it as couple quality time right now, rather than having fun with the game itself. Later on, she might start fancy the game alone, but if you suggest her playing alone she will probably be offended. If you like doing other things with her like sport, and she is fun playing with there, she will probably be fun playing wow with once she gets the hang of things.
---
Sure it is.
---
One hand.
---
Yes that talent is a must.
---
Anyone know if it's possible to play in Classic mode but have ultra water?
---
That's great :D A prot paladin is original and changes from the standard warrior tank. Looking forward to it.
---
What I'm planning to do is to play a tank/healer pally (since this class was meant to be hybrid) so I can tank dungeons and heal in raids/PvP if needed, and vice versa. I was just wondering what's the best path to Consecration (since I'll be picking Spiritual Focus for PvP): Divine Int or Str? Also is Imp SoR worth it? Idk if I should be picking them all tbh. Also I don't know about Reckoning as prot/holy. I'll be mostly playing with 1h shield so it is probably useless to spend 5 talent points in that. 
---
What do you think? :)
---
BoE epics BoE blues and wanted twink greens are for everyone to roll on.
---
People who make these kind of things should be honored for ever! Cheers mate
---
lvl 10 head is no joke
---
Shadow priests are not desirable, it depends on if the player is dependable and tries hard.  Shadow weaving gives warlocks a lower threat cap, so really it doesnt increase warlocks overall dmg because they will be able to cast less.  Farm 2-4 hrs a week on demonic runes, major mana pots, and flasks.  You will get less loot than others, so dont expect to get the first or third nef tear.  Our guild gave the 4th tear to our shadow priest, which he deserved based on effort.  But he quit 2 weeks later so he just kinda ruined the image of shadow priests for the rest of our guildees.****1****
---
Perplexity is not a man but a machine.
---
Playing orc helps a ton versus rogues
---
Swapping between 2hander and sword'n'board is very important too.
---
Get off overpowers as much as possible, they will be your main source of damage.
---
If the rouge tries to kite you with posion, wait until you are almost out of combat before using demo shout to keep them in combat. This will mean they can't stealth before your posion runs out.
---
Also try to get intercepts off when rogue is kiting. It's very hard to kite properly so most rogues will mess it up. Remember that rogues CANNOT dodge while stunned, so get off a big mortal strike auto when you do get a intercept. 
---
Get rend on 'em.
---
anti posion works really great vs rogues as a surprise way to get intercept on them.
---
Be careful with what stance you are in. You want to be able to counter gouge and sap with berserker, but you also don't want to take too much damage.
---
I don't believe the could tank properly, but I used to OT a mob or two on large groups at 60 in dungeons.
---
All palas heal in mc? Please don't tell me anyone will be ret.
---
Did you just say "Un'goro crater" in the same sentence as "really cool"?  
---
Un'goro is what makes me want to quit this game every time i get there.. such a pain in the ass to get through..  
---
Good to see some people enjoy the zone atleast!
---
If I used hearthstone to OG and logged out there I couldn’t login again during peak hours, or I would get a friend to login and run out of OG for me to be able to login again. Epic times. Problem was mostly fixed when I took my moped to the local hardware store and bought more ram.
---
When you have no server side data and make it from scratch, forums, and databases on the web then yes, you get radical changes
---
&gt; and you are last priority for gear. 
---
Yeah, I don't think any real guild is going to reward the player falling on the grenade of *actually* healing AND providing shadow weaving for your 2-5 warlocks with *lower* gear prio.
---
It’s just a guessing game at this point, no one knows how accurate private servers are in detail. 
---
You can choose to assume full accuracy until disproven, or you can choose to assume inaccuracy until proven that they’re accurate.
---
My Boarytania locked Iron Dwarf
---
If it's only a levels worth each week then it's a pleasant bonus, but not really something that can be counted on to level with.
---
If I want a quick efficient 60 then I'll use a speed run guide instead of one years worth of rested.
---
Absolutely. I'm a strong advocate for doing what's fun for everbody in the group. And if you guys enjoy your company and don't mind doing the run 20% slower, then there really is no arguing against.
---
I'm only against people who kind of demand that others let them tank when the others just arent interested in it. 
---
I will forever *love* warrior tanking because I'm a sucker for 5men dungeons. I enjoy PvP and dungeons and only do raids to get gear to enlarge my e-peen in PvP and to improve my 5men dungeon performance. There is not much in the game that is as satisfying as having tank gear + 8% hit + a twohander to tank dungeons as warrior. Infinite rage to mash them buttons!
---
41 ;)
---
Specifically prot warrior and holy pala.
---
yea, it's an American box. ESRB is our THINK OF THE CHILDREN! Organization.

Hunter
---
Good to know that frontshredding doesn't make much difference, but I still think a good warlock will be inherently faster.
---
Sorry it has been long lost :(
---
So with my usual x5 slack multiplier it's 24 days /played just to reach 60 (or something like 3-4 months). God, yes! Finally summer worth to live!
---
Even with 16 debuff slots, one shadow priest would use 2-4 of them. Not really viable between 40 players sadly.
---
It is a hunter weapon. If you are strictly pushing PvE content why would you give it to a warrior who is fury anyway?
---
Even on a PvE server taking the full 3 weeks would slow you down more than rushing would, because all the people in the zones would prevent easy grinding.
---
The point was that it was amazing, left you open to an offhand that usually has SP on it anyway AND the fact it's on a skinning Knife means that after you're doing using it you can resell it on the AH for almost 100% of what it cost you to make it.
---
There was absolutely no downside to it.
---
That depends on X
---
But it is the hand of justice
---
Hopefully someone makes a thread of which servers all the big streamers play so we know which servers to avoid. It's just not very Vanilla-like with streamers in the world.
---
What about my slot for VE to heal my party? :P
---
Level in Ashenvale or Duskwood
---
Also I'm pretty sure that all the optimisations in the client will speed up the fps several times all by itself, even if someone was playing on 2005 hardware. Those 15 years of FPS optimisations can't be underestimated.
---
Why not both
---
I am actually going rogue because I have always wanted to play rogue before they screwed up the class in legion/bfv imo. I also think dwarf shadow priest would be better than undead because while the undead would waste like half their mana on DP you can just stoneform it off at no mana cost and gain 10% dmg reduction.
---
Yeah the 16 gig of ram 4k screen one.
---
Better(no, not more realistic) lightning in classic imo. And the foliage in ultra looks misplaced. The shadow and water also adds a strange look with a mix between really low artistic graphics with some weird semi realistic graphics. I'll go for classic for sure. Looks better imo
---
What are some popular streamers from the EU? All I find on Youtube are the guys from the USA.
---
Do you guys think hunters will be able to do solo DM Tribute runs?
---
World of Boarcraft Challenge.
---
Ah I've only got 8gb of ram and the 1080 screen, what resolution did you play at?
---
Up to like L40ish conditionally yes but after that you really do need an actual tank.
---
I was considering starting with a SPriest, but a bit of research shows me that they do less than a third of the dps of the top classes...
---
So I decided to start with a different char &amp; do a SPriest after the first char is at 60. Any alt will be welcome to join a raid on content that's on farm.
---
Dungeons on lvling. Yes or no?
---
doubt
---
It is! Go to any of these zones. For some reason people are adamant that this feature got removed, but it never did. Blizz even publicly announced this several times.
---
Same here. 5ghz cpu and 2080ti. I was really surprised to see wow using 100% gpu usage while in the blood elf starting zone at 6880x2880(that's 200% res 21:9) graphics set to 10. I get around 80fps which is okay but my monitor is 120hz gsync. I hope the wow classic textures are easier to run and I'll be able to squeeze out more fps or else I guess I need to save up for next generation gpus? :(
---
tfw u get ur first 420 crit
---
Yes, it works, but is much easier at lower levels.
---
You'll never do badly with herb/alch, though the main reason is black lotus.
---
General consensus is they aren't as efficient as pure questing time wise. I don't see the harm in running one every now and again if you have a handful of quests for it, it's not too bad that way and they're quite fun.
---
Do you mean nothing but dungeons? If so, absolutely not, you'll be in there for years leveling because the exp is so bad.
---
They aren't typically recommended for efficient leveling unless you have a good group and several/most dungeon quests already picked up. If you're just leveling casually, then definitely - personally, I think a dungeon every now and again while leveling helps break up the grind and is always good fun with friends.
---
Depends. If you are rushing, they are not worth it. If you are going a little bit slower or trying to get some specific items, go for it.
---
Doing them once for quests isn't all that bad. It's still slower than leveling efficiently, but it's a good breather to get some nice gear, have some fun and get ahead in level compared to the quests. Especially if you are playing a melee as you need good weapons (and struggle vs high lvl mobs).
---
read somwhere its not worth it. Might be usefull for the first 10 lvls or so. Guide said only lvl blacksmithing if you intend to use it max lvl. Guide was recomending leatherworking/skinning for early gear and money
---
In Vanilla / Classic you don't pull like a madman until you found a good group with good gear and that has experience of the dungeon.
---
Most of the time it won't happen before everybody is lvl 60 and is full blue gear.
---
Before that it will be risky. 
---
But as always it depends on the skill of the players.
---
Why would I need fishing and cooking as a mage?
---
As a paladin, it's basically all you do.
---
Human shits over the other races in pve but gnome and dwarf both have things going for them in pvp.
---
It was very easy and possible in retail so I assume they will be able to from the start.
---
I hope and think however that blizzard will decide to nerf it, because it really just is super overpowered and really ruins the economy. It wasn't necessary to do in vanilla because people didn't abuse it much and didn't really discover it before late into the game.  People can say #nochanges as much as they want, it's more blizzlike for hunters not to farm 120g/hour even if you change the game.
---
That was fixed more than a year ago on the most popular pservers... I don't know how this myth still persists.
---
Not according to [http://classicdb.ch/?spell=29166](http://classicdb.ch/?spell=29166)
---
Innvervate is a lvl 40 spell that is trainable to your druid trainer.
---
I think it was changed in previous patches, but since we will use 1.12 talents.
---
I feel sad for the majority of people here. WoW Vanilla for me and my friends were smooth as butter on our computers.
---
This is true so much. The number one reason I hate retail. I want my old models and animations back so bad.
---
There aren't many.
---
There's some private server streamers from EU that will probably do well in classic, biggest one is probably monkeynews who also make youtube highlights, other than that it's likely that some of the method players will stream classic on the side and they will get lots of viewers.
---
When I'm done it'll be closer to The Silver Hand
---
All the bags, maybe a cool weapon.
---
Frostadamus i think
---
I'm personally not remotely interested in racers, but wish them well in their game. I plan to meet up with other burnt out raiders and meander our way to the top.
---
Or just like. Don't run 200% res. Lol 
---
Does it look noticeably better?
---
Upvoting you for more visibility. Maybe even make a separate post with this video just in case. 
---
I will probably use the ultra setting but keep water on low like in Vanilla since modern water looks like a silk fabric. I prefer the old one.
---
But the weather really is a make-or-break. I can't even believe how amazing and atmospheric the storms and rain looked back then. Also it should be a forced-on option since a heavy rainstorm can severely affect your view distance.
---
You can't really complete 20-30 off ashenvale or duskwood alone, you'll need to do multiple zones.
---
Plot twist, he is an elf shadowmelding and waiting for tauren meat
---
What you read was accurate. 
---
I dunno about leatherworking though. The gear isn't really that useful for warr/paladin.
---
Yes, unless blizzard decides to change something.
---
As a paladin specifically, you want engineering/mining. You need the bombs since you don't have any other way to range pull.
---
1.13 content please
---
So are you saying hunter pets can actually tank SM?
---
At lower levels it can work.
---
So how did it run?
---
Something I find even worse, and it's partly a side effect of lowered cast times, is that a lot of spells that were originally hard hitters have been reduced to practically nothings in terms of damage on retail. They're simply a means to end, a button you hammer out in hopes of a proc or to build a resource. Spells like Fireball, Frostbolt, Shadowbolt, etc have all become this and it's not satisfying at all. But I'll also say that simply pressing those buttons and nothing else isn't very fun either.
---
The Black Mage job in FFXIV actually strikes an interesting balance between a vanilla caster with long impactful cast times but a (comparatively) more involved rotation you need to maintain to keep putting off those big, meaty casts. You have more time to look around at the state of an encounter and pre-positioning and awareness are very important to playing the job optimally. It's interesting to think about WoW that veered more into that direction. Unfortunately none of the other jobs/classes in XIV are really like that and moreso mirror modern WoW just on a shorter GCD and with incredibly rigid rotations.
---
Happy cake day!
---
In my mind BoEs were always an 'everyone-greed' ordeal. Regardless if it's a straight upgrade for one of the party memebears. To me, a BoE is a gold-opportunity first, and a useable item second.
---
At Classic launch I doubt many BoEs would sell right away since the economy would still be forming.
---
But later on I'd say greed on all the random BoEs and if it's between a group of friends just give it to the guy who *really* needs it and check if he equips it right away.
---
Mike's scrolling combat text is what your looking for
---
*Live to win intensifies*
---
Going to play a lock again as well, and this has been bugging me for a while. I have never trained both Tailoring and First Aid during leveling, and farming for cloth during leveling doesn't sound fun. I was thinking about skipping First Aid because I will fish and cook, and use food for healing. The only downside is that First Aid can heal faster and during combat.
---
Anyone got some opinions or advice regarding skipping First Aid in favour of cooking and tailoring?
---
I'd get the gear first.
---
The mount will save you a couple of minutes getting to a dungeon. The gear will save you a couple of minutes in a dungeon and may be the difference between success &amp; failure.
---
The mount is nice to have, but I'd rank everything above it.
---
\#1 Gear
---
\#2 Attunements
---
\#3 Rep (For gear &amp; recipes)
---
\#4 Professions
---
\#5 Mount
---
\#1 &amp; #2 can be done together.
---
\#1, #3 &amp; #4 generate money for #5.
---
Ultra obviously. I played in terrible Framerates and Graphics in Vanilla and TBC already, I don't play the Game for the shitty Graphics!
---
This. I've seen 'em all but a week or so before launch I'm planning to rewatch all the top-boi machinimas and vids, ending with the South Park WoW movie.
---
*LIVE.* *TO.* *WIN!*
---
If guarding the flag is the only use of shadowmeld you can think of, you clearly lack the creativity to have fun as a Nightelf. :p
---
As a side note, and perhaps the most important thing when choosing a race: combat animations of female nightelf is in my opinion the best for warrior.
---
Any plans on doing the primary ones aswell?
---
Hey boiiz. I'm planning to go with Enchanting while leveling. I know in theory it isn't as good as going with a gathering profession in terms of gold, but is there like a detailed tutorial on how to maximize the profits from Enchanting while leveling? I'm thinking it should still be decent, right?
---
At this point, I think a whole new game is the only real way to make the world relevant again. There's just too much content and too little reason to explore it in retail WoW. Even if you start a fresh level 1 character, how much time do you really spend in any given zone? You might spend a little more time in each zone with a level squish, but there is still just too big a world to actually get invested in the story for each zone or dungeon. That's the big issue, really. In the expansions Blizzard really focused on getting a single antagonist or event as the reason for end-game content. If there's a dragon destroying the world (a la Cataclysm), then why should I care about an orc's missing wife in the Barrens? Or even some of the old raid content - trolls doing nasty things in Zul'Gurub isn't pressing in the face of a planet destroying catastrophe. It's just too big at this point.
---
no changes
---
Oh god I hope not
---
Main problem is that your pet cannot really agro multiple mobs.
---
But apart that, a pet can tank even bosses with efficient heal behind.
---
Yeah, the only issue is I'm having a hard time finding a guild, 'cause I won't be able to raid normal EU times due to my work hours, since my regular shift is 5pm-12am, and pretty much everyone raids at like 7pm to 11pm time frames :\\
---
A few things to consider. They stated this is a "phase" of alpha testing, not the start of alpha testing. It's entirely possible they've been internally testing Classic for months but it's only now reached the stage of adding it to the BN launcher. What this also means is they're preparing to allow non Blizzard people into the test. Why? Because it wouldn't be on the public facing CDN otherwise. So my guess is F&amp;F Alpha is just around the corner. What after? Who knows. But something else to keep in mind, this test won't be like traditional expansion tests. The content is already signed off as it's not new content. So the public test period could be a fair bit shorter than a typical expansion.
---
I like ganking and camping streamers, it's their best use.
---
I’m in a minority that would prefer current wow graphics with vanilla gameplay. At least it could be a toggle..
---
But we’ll see how well classic holds it’s audience and if it can pull in people who’d never played wow before and hold them. Personally I have my doubts.
---
Yea I had the 440MX, it was brutal from what I remember
---
What classes will get priority on legendaries.
---
Name checks out
---
Ahh ok, so is the gear I’d get from blacksmithing just not worth the hassle relative to the stuff I’ll get from dungeons and quests?
---
Female here. So, I've always played games, and a lot of WoW still confused me to no end at the start. WASD confused the hell out of me, having only used arrow keys in other computer games. Once I adjusted, I only played with WASD. Barely touched the mouse. I thought ALL SPELLS were CDs, and that I was a loser scrub if I used them. I staved everything to death as a druid until level 6. My BF really wasn't in to the idea of playing together, so I quested alone. Now I have all Proving Grounds titles, all Mage Tower skins, and a lot of raiding under my belt. Try not to get frustrated with her. It's NOT EASY when it all is natural to you but nothing makes sense to her, but I really think you'll enjoy having the option to play together. Just remember, sometimes you need to be able to play seperate, too. Otherwise, it becomes a chore, and someone always feels held up by the other. Maybe make characters just for leveling together, but encourage her to roll others, too! Best of luck to you both. If you or she end up not enjoying, no harm, no foul. You gave it a shot!
---
Good thing that this isn't vanilla then.
---
What exactly are tribiute runs?
---
So in your mind is all truthful criticism hateful?
---
Yes. If you don't need glasses then you can easily see the difference. Specially when it comes to movement and aliasing.
---
Shadow priests are not good for a raid because they take too many debuff slots. Not only does that mean you can't do your full DPS, it also means you will knock off other people's more valuable debuffs or someone might knock off yours. Messing up debuffs can be a massive raid dps loss. The only good shadow priest I knew was was ridiculously tryhard, on a server which had a very high(er) number debuff slots.
---
The "will I have to farm a lot" question already kind of shows that you will not be able to perform to that guy's level because if you're that tryhard you don't even worry about "do I have to use a lot of mana potions and a flask?" you just chug them.
---
So that means your performance won't be great. Now, does good performance matter to you or the people you'll be playing with? If you are personally fine with just being lower on the meters than someone who is maybe not as dedicated as you and okay with not being first in line for upgrades then that doesn't really matter. If you are joining a raiding guild that doesn't care about all of that it doesn't really matter as well. Same for many of the other sub-optimal specs.
---
Assuming a mostly tryhard guild, a shadow weaving healing priest is usually better for the raid performance.
---
real answer: mage and shaman.
---
finished on my main sometime in wotlk with 170 days, bulk of it in tbc
---
There was no dual wielding 2handers in Vanilla
---
I haven’t calculated this, but my feeling is that because of the long cool down (1 minute), you would need 1 more tank for this to work (which ofc would make the paladin tank pointless on those fights). I would like to see evidence of this working though, as I like the idea of paladin tanks.
---
It's either indescribably bad or so expensive to craft it's not worth it, and sometimes even both.
---
I wonder about regional servers too. Back then many regions didnt have its own servers, whats it gonna be this time?  
---
Are they gonna support modern localized versions of the game?  
---
Will there be separate Russian, German etc. realms?
---
Thunderfury is majority of the times given to MT/OTs. Sulfuras, depends on the guild. Since it's really expensive to craft, some guilds will just give the eye to someone who can afford the mats to craft Sulfuron, while some will have a class prio for the eye. The way I see it, Sulfuras is more of a status symbol you should get for guild dedication and effort.
---
Why so little focus on weather Blizzard?
---
Endgame content is too difficult for a paladin to tank it, and sorry about that (this comes from a feral that had to respec heal in vanilla)
---
Honestly you will not be able to find a way to do it as lots of comments already mentioned it:
---
- you pull way less aggro and therefore, if you are main tanking, you’ll limit the raid in terms of dps and might arrive to enrage phase
---
- you can try to off tank but why take a paladin off tank that does not pull dps while you can take a fury warrior or feral to off tank adds that will pull much better dps when swapping gears?
---
Anyway, good luck in finding a raid that will allow you to tank
---
Exactly this 👆
---
I can't say for sure but judging off my main vanilla character's current playtime I'd guess between 100-120 days and maybe another 20-30 on various alts.
---
A Diremaul North run where you only kill the last boss while dodging the other bosses through various means. After the kill the other bosses offer you their tribute. Basically rewards more and better loot.
---
seems like ppl can't read or something, he said "not too CD dependant". and ppl even dare to mention paladin. when its all gameplay is chain using cds.
---
Get skinning + mining. Let someone else craft you the low level stuff. Make some money instead. You can always start leveling engineering or BS when you are close to 60.
---
Not sure why your car has boots or what a squid has to do with anything but you've mentioned America so I'll give you a patriotic upvote.
---
Caption Obvious has spoken.
---
That frame rate and slowmo on crits is VERY classic
---
Tbh might be worth rolling on NA. Yes the ping difference is a thing, but Na has played EU private servers for years and been doing fine with it, 150ms is 100% playable in vanilla.
---
I mean, the question is kinda obvious too. Why shouldn't it work?
---
The gear you can craft via blacksmithing often isn't that big of an upgrade over quest gear and keeping your skill up can be very difficult. In some level ranges you would need materials that are beyond your level range to craft good items. It is also not a good money maker unless you get VERY lucky and the few rare level 60 patterns are actually very rare.
---
One of the only worthwhile self-benefits of blacksmithing is the Glimmering Mithril Insignia trinket for 30 seconds fear immunity but its usefulness really depends on your role and faction.
---
I'd go mining + engineering or mining + skinning or maybe mining + herbing and just bank excess materials for possibly learning it later.
---
One of my favourite things in classic is to fish. I can't wait.
---
And the ability to mindless grind for hours.
---
Its actually the opposite. The modern client eats more ressources.
---
While he is originally from the US, I heard that Nixxiom will play on European servers since he recently moved to the UK.
---
Played retail until legion on an NA server, but want to play on an EU server this time (moved to Germany recently, going to try to get in a German guild to learn the language). Is this possible or will I need to set up a new account/ re-purchase the game?  Seems like it won't be but wanted to make sure. Thanks!
---
I'm just afraid it would not be possible cause of legion base client
---
Not reliably tbqh.
---
Oh man I hope we can restore the glory of Warsong EU before the introduction of the Russian tab
---
Blacksmithing does fuck all for gear while leveling.
---
The first time you crit for 1k is always a milestone on a character.
---
Yeah, tho now i really feel like i really want to play holy/ret build Like holy to divine favor and rest to ret, so i can heal and do some damage.
---
That should be possible!
---
not the LFR or phasing? xd
---
Hi AverageBad,
---
Yes, your pet can maintain threat on a target while leveling and in the unfortunate scenario the tank leave, provided you are in a half competent group. But it does get harder as you get higher level.
---
P.S. If you are interested in raid tanking as a hunter at 60. You yourself as a hunter will achieve higher defensive stats than your pet. If you'd like to know more about this hardcore blood pumping way of playing the game, let me know!
---
Blizzard recently changed how you have to purchase the game. Everything but the most recent expansion is free now basically.  
---
   
---
Since Classic will only require you to pay the subscription fee, you should be fine without purchasing anything else.
---
As for accounts: I do believe you have to create an account for the WoW-EU servers. The option for that should be somewhere in your Battle.net account settings.
---
1080p but it's processor and graphics intense so you should be fine.
---
It's essentially an outdoor flea market, typically held in the UK on a Sunday where you pay a small fee to bring all the shite down that you no longer need and sell it out the back of your car. 
---
Good for some bargains if you're up early enough.
---
You definitely have my attention good sir!
---
Dear lord Goldshire looks amazing. I don’t like the water at max but w/e :)
---
The Classic footage is from running a local server using the Demo files.
---
No we used scripts to accomplish that. When the script functionality was removed castsequence was introduced in order to accomplish sorta the same thing. Since we know scripts won't be allowed in Classic it makes sense for them to not remove castsequence.
---
Same goes for mouseover, conditionals like stance or form and so on. They are using the modern API, if we're not going to lose important functions they'll have to use the modern macros too.
---
Twinks are fine. You overreact it.
---
1. I have never twinked, never seen the fun in lowbie bgs myself. 
---
2. It was very much a thing in vanilla trust me.
---
3. Why even play bgs in low level if you are afraid of facing twinks,  shouldnt i play AV as a 51 or newly 60 cus people could outgear me?
---
4. Either play the bgs or not but dont be sad because you are getting stomped cus it can happen at 60 too.
---
Oh fuck
---
Does this same logic apply to leatherworking and tailoring aswell? That I should focus more on gathering professions
---
blacksmithing is one of the most expensive proffesions to level at near no benefit, I'd suggest gathering proffesions instead, skinning is fairly decent for melee since you're always in range of what you killed, herbalism is also good money
---
Ye I think I’ll try doing them once for the items and quests! Ty
---
Ok so you don't twinks in Vanilla. Is there anything else you want to change or is that the only thing? Let's make a loooooong list where everyone can post ideas about changes they want.
---
or
---
Let's just play Vanilla.
---
I don't know about a tutorial about making money with Enchanting. But the big reason that enchanting is not good for money is that you have to not only use a ton of mats, but you also have to destroy all of your greens and blues along the way. Selling random drops and quest rewards is the main way most people make money while they level (without gathering professions). The thing is, enchanting doesn't make money unless you have some rare enchants. Everyone has the enchants that you get while leveling, so they're pretty worthless. The best you can hope for is a few silver as tips if you pass out free enchants while sitting in Org. 
---
What a lot of people do is pick up a gathering profession to make cash (and afford their level 40 mount) while they level and then drop it for enchanting once  you hit 60.
---
That is unique to mages, where they tried to make Frost a crit-damage build.
---
Awesome thanks! Was kind of hoping I could run around on my old toons with the same fee, but maybe this is better so I focus on classic ;)
---
I don't think I ever bothered with Fishing, how is it a money maker?
---
You wont be able to get your blacksmithing high enough that it will benefit you while lvling. 
---
I would go with either mining/engineering or alc/herb.
---
If your entire group is fine with just using auto attacks and wands due to the insanely low threat you're generating then go for it.
---
The fights will last 500% longer but as long as there are no enrage mechanics and healers have naxx level gear in order to not go oom it's definitely doable.
---
This is why gorilla pets were the bomb.
---
The jungle remedy available in STV is amazingly useful in getting rid of poison. Blizzard eventually nerfed it, but not during vanilla.
---
Tailoring offers very good BoP robes for priests, mages and warlocks at max level and provides a little more useful items along the way, plus everyone will need bags. Leatherworking has similar issues as blacksmithing but overall provides more items along the way, the only real self-benefit is the salt-shaker cooldown later on (basically free money every few days). Neither of them will make you a shitload of money but tailoring and leathworking are way easier to level and keep up to date compared to blacksmithing.
---
Gathering professions during levelling are always worth it, assuming they don't slow you down. If there's not enough herbs and ores early on it is usually best to just level without it rather than running around for hours trying to find some earthroot or tin.
---
How it was in original was Need on BoE's unless you knew all 5 people.
---
It was formed over times as the least abusable, least drama system naturally over all servers.

Twinks was part of WoW for almost 5 years and they didn't introduce XP in bg's until Wotlk.
---
&gt;The second we start to substitute our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago we are deviating from our goal of a historical recreation of the game as it was, and making something different, and that is something we want to avoid .

---
Legion base client can't change anything. There's no bug or anything that makes tribute solo possible,  just the bosses mechanics and his room makes it possible.
---
How do you kill that which has no life?
---
Go for first aid. As a warlock, it's amazing. I never bothered to carry food and water. Low on mana? Lifetap to regain mana and slap on a large bandage to regain the health used.
---
"Bandages are my bread and the tears of my enemies my drink."
---
I feel like so many people who never played original will run into this.
---
I think I had an alt hunter on the go before I even hit 60.
---
If blizzard actually followed this when how exactly do you plan on explaining:
---
The phase system
---
Right click report
---
New graphics
---
Sharding
---
1.12 itemization and gear
---
I know the no changes crowd would lose their mind but if they kept tje game play the same but did a total graphic overhaul and updated the graphics but didn't change quests or anything else I'd love it.
---
Not unless it's been datamined the last 2 days and nobody posted about it.
---
Classic cartoon mode
---
Unless it's discovered there's some sort of gameplay advantage to using better graphics I'm sticking to classic. They look near enough the same anyway.
---
You realize that all those sp scaling bugs don't work in 1.12?
---
Does Arcane Missles have a chance to proc Clearcasting on each tick or only when casting, I've seen some videos where it happens on casting, but in patch notes of 1.9, there is:  
---
* Arcane Missiles - Will now be able to trigger procs based on dealing damage.
---
How will it be then in classic?
---
I understand your point but I think it's too much to change to stop twinking. It sucks but twinking ruining lowlvl BG's is a necessary evil.
---
Warrior vs Paladin honor fights were some of the only good things about playing a paladin.
---
You say that giving twinks their own area was awesome because it made the low level bgs 100% playable for everyone. This is flat out wrong. When Blizzard implemented twink only bgs it effectively killed twinks. There 100% was twinks in Vanilla playing a 10-19 bg and getting stomped just made me want to make a twink. Twinks will not be there as fast as you are assuming due to cashflow. Twinks are fine and make the game as fun as an undead rogue in redridge.
---
Damn, I misremembered the stats. I thought they had 1% hit on them.
---
Hunter has always been the fastest leveler at every level. Aoe grind wont be a thing once classic hits and warrior obviously levels faster after level 30/40 but hunter has everything he needs to level.
---
Train First aid in between autoshoot
---
Recommend taking fishing and given the amount of traveling you do, it's easy to skill up without taking a lot of time. Every time you need to wait for a boat, take out your fishing pole and make a few casts. When the boat arrives, get on it and make one more cast. You don't make many casts per boat trip, but they do add up over time.
---
It's still a great class for nightfall uptime

Each missile can proc which is pretty cool.

Doesn't make a full arcane spec viable but it's a cool concept of trying to proc clearcasting using missiles.

1-20: Do the 3 nearest zones

50-60: Do the highest zones

Rogue with renatakis charm of trickery and thistle tea+ engineering. Easy 1v3
---
This is called a Straw Man argument.
---
Lmao, and when you login and start running you'll turn the game right off because of the godawful animation. Orc, undead and Tauren they really messed them up for horde. I couldnt  fucking believe it.
---
late game, fish are used to cook up(cooking/alchemy) consumables that are used for raids. Majority of people are too lazy to fish so they sell pretty well on the AH.
---
A nice gaming laptop is over $2000. Closer to $2500 really. So yes. $1000 is a budget price
---
Twinks we're not rare.
---
BGs are the slowest/worst way to level.
---
Every bracket will be full in time, especially once most people have been 60 for a while and get bored.
---
Make a twink and see for yourself why people do it.  It can be fun.  
---
Twinks ruin the game exactly 0%.
---
How is it a strawman argument?
---
Using all these things is using modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago.
---
Need on all boes, with some exception if it's bad or someone really needs the upgrade. Most classes need mount gold, so idc if that Argent defender serves the tank more. I'm rolling.
---
People pointed out a lot of reasons, and some are more valid than others.  The main thing is two fold:
---
No Taunt - You are invalidated for 50% of all bosses almost  
---
Mana - You can only tank fights of a certain length  
---
All of the other things are workable.
---
I like the trees better in classic, but the rest in ultra
---
You’d need a coordinated group to CC, off tank when needed, and plenty of heals. I never tried it but I’m sure it’s possible.
---
Should maybe use a FOV fix with Vanilla so that the FOV is the same.
---
I leveled Blacksmithing on my Paladin back in classic and got nothing out of it. Best recipe I ever had access to was Steel Weapon Chain, which some PvPers wanted to prevent disarm. 
---
Theres some Enchanted Thorium Plate pieces that I remember making that were pretty good around 60 but really hard to make and people prolly didnt use long.
---
As long as they don't mess with the music Im ok
---
Speak for yourself. I got a new PC during vanilla and had solid 60fps on my 1280x1024 display. Shit was insane.
---
Things to know: monkeynews is 10x the player perplexity is and doesn't over edit his videos.
---
This is what I am looking forward to the most I think. Huge pvp battles out in the world. Love this video
---
Shockadin is not the same preBC.  I would have to look up the exact changes to see how less effective it was, but the main part is the lack of SP scaling in original.  
---
TBC introduced the idea of SP Weapons, and that casters should treat weapons on the same level as physical damage dealers.  This addition of over a thousand spell power in many cases was key to caster scaling in BC.
---
In original, this SP scaling does not really exist for paladins.  For the most part, Paladin Tier 2 set is the limit here, and is a huge part of the reason why it is remembered so fondly.
---
I levelled a Troll Monk to 10 yesterday to see what's up. 
---
Decided to go for a new server, blank slate.   
---
Starting area was new but pretty much like Vanilla really, well aside from those annoying as fuck popups that repeated themselves like ten times *each*, but whatever, turned off in settings. 
---
Then I get to Razor Hill and I'm running around questing and I realise... There's no-one here. Oh there are a few people around, but with that fucking (*) on them, rolling around with some weird ass personal chauffeur goblin motorbike decked in heirlooms.     
---
Like, what the actual fuck?
---
Safe to say I got to level 11, then just quit out of sadness.   
---
It's telling that the state of WoW means new servers have to be merged/sharded with other existing realms, because there just ain't no-one rolling on new servers.  
---
And why would anyone? It's boring. You're alone. Chats are 100% dead. You're not playing an MMORPG anymore, you're playing a slow-paced FPS.
---
Pet battles were a fun little sidegame though. I mean, if you ignore how it's just a blatant Pokemon copy :p
---
^[*citation needed*]
---
Maybe someone will make an addon? Heck I'd LOVE to if I knew how. I know all the tracks in the game in my heart. I'd love to pop in cataclysm tracks and leave out all of the battley ones. New Mulgore is too good
---
Others have answered the basic part: they're good to run once or twice for the quests and a hopeful item drop. But there's another big point in favor of dungeons: friends. The guild I ended up spending all my time with in vanilla was created because a group of us kept running into each other while doing dungeons. They're a nice break from the grind and a good way to get to know people on your server.
---
Nah, the Classic client runs better than Vanilla.
---
You are honestly probably going to end up doing Ashenvale, Duskwood, and Wetlands to get from 20-30.
---
Take comfort in that twinks are in general terrible players that can only win by overgearing.
---
NPC's pathfinding might be different tho
---
Actually there are new textures but its immensely hard to notice. In Cataclysm they redid most of the textures in a higher resolution (I'm no art developer but I think they repackaged existing assets). And those made it to Classic. I'm all for it, you'd have to be crazy to notice it let alone complain about the addition of a higher resolution of the exact same assets
---
Yes, we did multiple dungeons with mage/Hunter/holypriest and 2 other dps. Hunter was using boar.
---
It's overall a good video but I think you don't need starter in the beginning and using skill sounds as sound effects is usually not a good idea imo.
---
I'm figuring 2-4 months before hitting max level. I do plan time off work for launch, but after that.  Maybe 1-2 hours a few times a week of play time.
---
As much as I'd love to play like I did in college, work life partner, just won't allow it. 
---
I'd classify myself as casual. Hitting 60 in first 6 weeks I just don't see happening
---
I checked once, maybe during TBC. There was over a years worth of hours on my main. I never checked again.
---
Yeah. We had a CD burner when hardly anyone else did. I'd bring in burned CDs to school for weight training and just leave them there. I was the music God.
---
Also, when I first showed my dad what Napster was he started using it more than me.
---
Dialup internet though. So it took about 5 to 8 months to download a song. But we didn't care. Napster was what changes the music industry to evolve to what it is today. Much better place. 
---
Now the movie industry is a whole nother ball game.
---
Surely the easiest solution to this is to make every BG award 100 exp for loss, 300 for win or something? Bad exp for people actually levelling (Therefore not a viable alternative solution to questing normally) but a very small reward nonetheless. Also means twinks cannot stay in one bracket forever. 
---
Fundamentally I am always against inequality on this scale. I don't understand how 1 shotting someone who is lower level and with worse gear is satisfying in any way (Most WSG twinks I came across actively avoid each other and the flag and just camp the non-twinks). 
---
This is similar behaviour as those level 60's who corpse camp lowbies and claim "itz PvP lul". These people **are** the minority however they are also the ones who also shout and whine and moan the loudest on forums claiming it's normal to behave this way and calling people skrubs or git gud. Truth is they are obviously terrible in any kind of 50/50 fight.
---
Boring af in endgame, most fun during lvl phase..
---
Raiding= 3 spell spamming, no need for pots,enchs or anything..
---
Up until 60 it's killer in dungeons and pvp imo, best thing ever.
---
Oh man frost mage shatter combo.  Deep freeze into a frost bolt ice lance double crit. Felt so good.
---
They’re remaking all the music in dubstep format
---
It's a myth that Vanilla wow was hard to run, I think it's more that people who played wow didn't really have gaming PC or worse, under powered laptops like OP.

How to get invite?

NEED INVITE!
---
While leveling, the only really good profession is skinning. Your other profession will slow you done with virtually no gain. An argument could be made for enchanting, as long as you don’t try to level it (just sell mats to others trying to level it).

She got abducted by the Dark Iron Dwarves and they dumped her body in the lava in Blackrock Mountain.
---
You can bet your ass they'll have a long list of fanatic supporters ready to camp you till kingdom come. 
---
I'm glad I probably won't have to worry much about streamers on EU servers.
---
Except both camps doesnt, since now i Will be forced to look at disgusting models when people take screens/make pvp vids.
---
Im forced to use whatever is best for example new animations might make certain moves more obvious which means ill be at a disadvantage in pvp if i dont use it. The old models are more than good enough and the people who want bfa animations/models are just clueless players who didnt want vanilla for 10 years like me.
---
Even the "old" models we are getting have the wotlk+ skeleton making things look different and annoying to me (cant moonwalk etc)
---
You did your part by easing her into it, the best way to learn is to figure things out for yourself. If you're in the same room playing that could be fun but try and encourage her to do her own thing. WoW is not difficult to pick up so after a bit of fucking around I'm sure she will get the hang of it.
---
I feel like nightfall gets a bad rap and people consider it a meme weapon.
---
The only really 'meh' part is the 3.5 speed.  It is still 80% as good as the R14 weapons, and is totally fine on a dps warrior.
---
Then you just have to consider:
---
80% Arms + Nightfall + Full DPS Class
---
Ret + Nightfall + Arms/Fury or Full DPS Class  
---
I suspect in most cases a ret with nightfall is more of dps loss than a fury warrior being arms with nightfall.
---
IMO nightfall is a tank weapon so they can be arms for dps in raids and pvp with a free guild weapon.
---
Really?  That starter animation took me about 4 hours in Davinci Resolve, so I definitely feel the need to use it as much as I can haha.  Thanks for the tip!  I'm always open to critiques and suggestions.
---
Spiritual guidance + Spirit tap until you have good amount of spellpower. Then switch to Force of Will.
---
Modern expansion content such as legion and bfa zones and raids will consume a lot of resources, but if you go into retail wow and run around the vanilla zones using similar graphics settings to classic there will be better performance than on a pserver with the 1.12 client.
---
Back then they had these things called yellow jackets. Tons of ephedrine packed into these pills. They outlawed them sometime in the mid 2000s because people were dying
---
Looks like the view distance is the same for both classic mode and max settings.
---
One thing to note is when you do the cooking quest at 225 skill, you can purchase most of the ingredients at Freewind in Thousand needles.
---
One of the main thing that stands out as questionable with Ultra graphics is probably the ground clutter density, it look ridiculous in some areas, like sentinel hill is just covered in fist sized stones. The game doesn't seem like it was designed to have the ground clutter density cranked up to 11.
---
Twinking was very prevalent on my server during Vanilla. I'm not sure where you're getting your information
---
\#nochanges
---
First aid was invaluable as a paladin while PvPing. In 1v1 or 2v1 bubble + bandage was a great way to get back in the fight.
---
Because of Blizzard acting fun-police and nerfing it/making it not work. I don't think Blizzard intended for Hunters to be able to solo it.
---
Wouldn’t even be to 92 agility by the time you could hit 60 lol
---
Clearly the best option is to get to the point of bellygrub and then explore 100% of the map to minimize bellygrub time.
---
There will be some gabba and psy trance as well, mainly for the raids. And it’s not confirmed yet IIRC but there was talk of adding the benny hill theme whenever the flag is picked up in wsg
---
You can tank dungeons while lvling ( and at 60) . But main tank without taunt is a no go, tanking single target in general as pala is a no go really. Roll a druid if you wanna prove haters wrong.
---
I agree with this, I levelled BS back in the day and it was not exactly the most helpful of professions. Since I didn't raid on the warrior, it was just a way to craft and sell arcanite rods on the AH to enchanters...
---
I even made the mistake of going armor smith and then barely using it. The axesmiths though, Arcanite reapers sold as hotcakes...
---
If in doubt though, herbalism/skinning are always decent money makers. Basicaly dual gathering professions.
---
Gross
---
I think a big issue paladin tanks have is they passively lower the raids opening dps. The way vanilla threat works has the opener being VERY important (which is a part of the reason fury warriors are tanking on some private servers). 
---
Without a taunt or huge threat dump, your raid is basically going to have to wait like 30 seconds before they can start dps.
---
You seem enthusiastic about paladin tanking which is good, and a majority of the time you will be leveling and therefore able to tank fine, but when it comes to raiding you just have to be aware you directly make it harder for progression so you will have a hard time finding a guild.
---
Ah, good times when Alliance kiddies don't understand the blue totem is the totem of death.
---
He's responsible for like half the kills, and almost all of them are from WF bursts.
---
At 60 you can make “flasks” which are highly prized by raiders for their big buffs. Other people can use them, but they have to buy em off AH or bring the mats to an alchemist.
---
The difference is minimal.
---
I'm not your guy, buddy...
---
In-flight "Request stop" option. Has anyone heard if this option might be implemented in Classic? Would be much more convenient than having to log out and log back in if wanting to land earlier. But it might fall into the #toomanychanges category.
---
What do you think about this option being in Classic?
---
Verdant keepers aim was badass. It was basically christmas once i got on my hunter. Sure it would be replaced at 60, but it would still be good until then.
---
At least it’s not trap
---
I could imagine some knucklehead complain about you using a skinning knife. Though that is quite the nice list of stuff. Do the scrolls stack with each other or do they overwrite? Else getting a full set of stam/str/agi/int to suit your build would good.
---
&gt; How is it a strawman argument? 
---
By giving the impression of refuting an argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented.
---
No changes! You need to play with 2005 era computer.
---
I still haven't managed to find a BiS list for pvp, does it not exist? Should I simply aim for pvp gear once its available and whatever weapon from raid?
---
I remember it, 2005, un'goro crater just outside the camp.  
---
pyroblast on one of those tar monsters ( fire vulnerable ).  
---
the screenshot was my wallpaper for ages
---
Not sure of altf4ing stopped you at the next stop in vanilla, i think that was just on older pservers. Could be wrong but i seem to remember just being locked into it, though connected FPs were only added very late, so it wasnt really experienced much.
---
I plan on making one once I get to 60. Had a priest healer back in tbc that was stacked. 224+ spell power. Had the fishing hat and best gear and enchants you could get. Little guy is still 19 but can’t wear half the gear anymore due to blizz upping the level requirements on some of the low level gear.
---
You don’t get any XP from bgs
---
Good to know!
---
If you're unable to see how sharding is using modern technology to solve issues from 12 years ago, then you're a doofus.
---
I wonder what your comment has anything to do with what i said .
---
Twinking is great fun.
---
lmao im hoping the pathing is updated as they also have said and DM king farming is not possible
---
You should start skinning/herbalism and then get Alchemy (drop skinning) OR you should start skinning/mining and then get Engineering (drop skinning).
---
There’s really no other logical path, unless you’re talking down the line with alts.
---
Most of the streamers I’ve seen are EU based!
---
Woosh
---
Weather blizzard does what?
---
Would be great to get a live view of faction distribution on each server. Or even just - “the alliance needs your aid” beside a server that is becoming slightly horde heavy. 
---
I know it’s not very classic like but it would be cool to help faction balance on pvp servers.
---
I totally know what you are saying, I raided and pvp’d heavily back in vanilla. I continued in tBC and wrath, but when Cat was released I knew it was time up.
---
This time I’ll played a couple hrs a night, questing and playing on a gaming laptop, so I can still watch tv and chat to the wife. 
---
I am hoping to get to 60 no longer than 6 weeks. Who knows, maybe it’ll take longer.  😂👍
---
That’s what I was thinking too. I went alliance with my first character ever and want to see how different a horde character would level.
---
Maybe later in Classic you can include a any% category to see what’s the fastest possible time to hit 60 with full rested xp, mob tagging etc etc.
---
Ya there is 0 emphasis on leveling. You might as well be playing a single player game now if you choose to level manually. I try Wow every expansion and will continue to. Since MoP I haven't lasted more than 1-2 months each expansion. For me to seriously come back to the game the servers would have to feel like a community again. But for that to happen sharding/LFG tool would have to go which just isn't going to happen sadly : /
---
&gt; it's not a change in business model direction but rather an attempt to take ownership away from pservers.
---
A big part of it, I think, is also that Blizzard has taken a lesson from EA etc and are worried about their image.   
---
Blizzard used to be *the* gaming studio, people felt they did literally *everything* right. WC1, WC2, and StarCraft were all lauded as the pinnacle of RTS, then came WC3 and they pushed that envelope even further and brought crazy good story and cinematics along for the ride.    
---
Then they released the WoW trailer and people went fucking nuts, and the game even lived up to the hype, people overall didn't really care about the botched launch because it was *Blizzard*. They were excused by the mere power of their reputation.
---
Fast forward to today and they have merged with Activision, they utterly ruined the entire Diablo franchise (despite fixing D3 later on) and made WoW into a mess the old guard of Blizzard fanboys doesn't recognise.  
---
What Blizzard is left with, and which I'm sure they realise, are demographics with zero loyalty to the Blizzard brand. They have little to no reputation left. When Hearthstone released people were like "yeh, sounds about right for them."   
---
They are little more than just any other game studio. They have fallen unreasonably far. These days their only real claim to fame is StarCraft 2.
---
Classic is their attempt at actually getting back some of the fan-relationship, IMO. Perhaps even to gauge if there's still room for "the old way" of doing things or if the gaming market is simply... changed.
---
Do reckoning attacks on paladins have a chance to proc weapon on hit effects up to 5 times with one auto? Ex: if I have Thunderfury on a pally and I use a 4 stack reck bomb on someone, do they have a chance to get hit with the tf proc for each stack of reckoning and the auto?
---
I’m saving this for later. Thanks!
---
Hey, not sure if it would work for you exactly, but I’m also in EU, from NA west coast and my guild is looking for people. We’ll be raiding ~9-12pm PST which will be 6-9am CET(5-8pm UK time I believe?) , if you or anyone else is interested just send me a PM and I can link you our discord.
---
I bought the game and couldnt play it for over a year until my parents bought me a new pc
---
Watching Monkeynews videos and paying attention will help you much more than these comments. 
---
Rogues beat warriors, at least at higher skill brackets, it’s the nature of class balance. Both players are extremely high level, and there’s arguably no better rogue and warrior than those two
---
Thinking won’t be an issue at all. Heirlooms allowed thinks to become so op!  To go get a proper twink, took a lot of time and gold, which no-one will have for 6mths +.
---
I can’t even remember if vanilla had an xp on/off toggle.
---
Which is why they are the slowest way to level. =P
---
That music just tripped me out so hard
---
...fuck.
---
I hope they do!
---
Yes, but look at the shadows. Huge difference
---
I would raid MC on medium/high settings and 1280x1024 and about 10-30fps on average with the current setup:
---
CPU: amd athlon 2500+ (1.8ghz)
---
GPU: Geforce 4800 titanium
---
RAM: 512mb or 1024mb I believe.

---
Is leatherworking useful while leveling for a druid? Will it provide me with much grear that's better then what I get from questing/dungeons?
---
They aren’t a way to level
---
&gt; Maybe even make a separate post with this video just in case.
---
Done! :)
---
It’s like saying not playing is a way to level.
---
Made a new post :)
---
Funny how you get downvoted for thinking logical.
---
Wait so content will be phased. If i get tier 2.5 gear will it disappear in a few months when it goes back to the first phase? Or will AQ just not be available anymore? Or is it just like phasing it all in and it wont cycle? (To my understanding private servers phase like that where it’s cyclical)
---
My brother and I plan on duo leveling priest/warrior at launch, we’ve been practicing duo leveling several times now following Joana’s guide (horde). There are many times we just have to grind out nearly a level to get to the next required level point in the guide. Is this just something we will have to get used to due to the split group xp? I feel like it isn’t even double the grinding, it’s closer to 2.5x. Might be mistaken. 
---
Guess my question is how does efficient duo leveling differ from efficient solo leveling ?
---
As someone who never got to experience it, why the HECKING FRICK did they remove it?
---
Not playing is actually a faster way to level than BGs, because you can accrue rest exp while your are logged off!
---
On the contrary, that starter is perfect.  
---
It's clean, clear, and has a quick and smooth animation. It displays the brand name of your channel but doesn't do so in a way that pisses me off or makes me downvote the video because you thought a 1 minute introduction was necessary.  
---
The main content of your video began literally 2 seconds in. Very few content creators can boast about that.  
---
Keep the starter animation.  
---
PS: This is critique from a person who generally thinks most content creation, streaming or youtube videos, are cancer for the game. Take that however you will.
---
Best tank pets were the gorilla for Aoe warstomp or turtles Cos of shell shield. This reduced all damage by 50%, but generated no threat. 
---
You need players to watch aggro a lot more than they do with a player tank as a pet is harder to taunt (growl) back. But healing, from mend pet and group heals make it possible.
---
I used my hunter to tank ZF and the sunken temple, Scarlet M. Didn’t try any level 55-60 instances but did off tank a few times if the main tank died. 
---
A turtle can get upwards of 15k armour by 60 and can take a lot of damage.
---
Lol I love seeing people call things a Strawman argument just because they don't understand how it relates.
---
you don't go for mental agility. you need the points for inspiration.
---
This is great. I always level fishing and cooking to max. They are a big benefit for leveling and better food for pets.
---
Crafting professions like Blacksmithing, Tailoring, and Leatherworking are useful not because they provide gear that's better than what you can get, but because they're consistent. Sure, you can usually get better gear in dungeons but you have to run those dungeons and get lucky enough to get a drop. With leatherworking you're guaranteed to get consistent upgrades so you aren't rocking level 20 pants at level 40. During leveling think of it as a way to stay up to date with gear rather than making better gear.
---
Keep in mind that Classic will be based on BFA's engine so lots of that old hardware might not be supported anymore.
---
Uhmm, so you guys would be playing on an EU server?
---
Showing precedent for fixing problems is not a strawman.
---
No it’s going to be an NA server since I’m the only one from my group living in EU. The ping might be a turnoff but like another person said, people play from NA to EU pservers all the time without much of a problem
---
special retail snowflakes complained they got sand in their eyes......
---
I had a GeForce 2 MX. I know your struggle.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMusZf0tcZVMgz0to
---
If I don't want to go dual gathering professions, what would be the most fun and useful profs to take while leveling a druid? 
---
(Knowing that I can't use alchemy pots or engineering gadgets while in form.)
---
You can get a potion from a vendor when darkmoon faire is up to get darker nights again 
---
https://www.wowhead.com/item=124640/inky-black-potion
---
also ve is pretty useless in pvp, especially if you're not in shadowform anyway. it eats a gcd that you could just use to flash heal.
---
The justification they gave for making nights brighter was something having to do with people who could only play at night being at a disadvantage. I never bought that.
---
No idea about the weather changes, though. Might have just been messed up in the spaghetti-code and unable to be fixed.
---
So you're saying that running on more than 10 FPS increases skill?`
---
I always thought more cinematic was more better.
---
Could you not make guides plsase, you’ll ruin the experience for the new players.
---
Obviously. Not sure why I’m getting downvoted, some of you are going to be crying “ninja!!!!!” when someone rolls need on a freezing band lol
---
But we arent going to run a client thats over a decade old, it's based on something much more recent.
---
Hunter related question :
---
Do you use serpent sting? When? How? Why?
---
At no point in vanilla have paladins ever been used to main tank forty-man raids. So saying that they have in the past is just wrong. 
---
To break it down for you, paladins cant tank raids in vanilla for the following reasons:
---
No taunt - With no taunt you cant tank swap the relevant bosses in BWL/AQ40/Naxx and more importantly, youre relatively worthless as a reserve tank because you wont be able to snatch the boss of the dps if the active tank dies. All tanks in vanilla rely on taking damage in order to gen threat including paladins, so being second on the threat table isnt an option either.
---
Mana not rage - If the fight lasts more than two minutes then youre immediately worthless as without mana, your threat generation falls off a cliff and you'll rapidly lose aggro to others.
---
Lower Threat Per Second (TPS) cap - As if your limited duration threat wasnt bad enough, paladins have the shittiest tps capabilities of any tank. The tps list goes fury warrior tanks, bear druids, prot warriors and then far behind are prot pallies. This limits your raids dps as the limiting factor stops being the dps' ability to do damage and rather their ability to stay under your threat gen.
---
Crushing Blows - In order for prot paladins to be uncrushable you need two, time constrained criteria to be true. You need holy shield active and you need to have recently been crit for redoubt. These two things mean that you are never 100% uncrushable. Sure neither are druid tanks, the difference here is that paladins have nothing else to cover their crushability, whereas druids have a metric fuckload of armour.
---
Itemisation - Paladin tier gear is pitched at healing for the most part, with T1 and T2.5 being ok for spell power based ret pallies. None of this tier gear offers defence, block or other mitigation unlike a warriors. Now due to the warrior tier set being so good, and blizz settling on warriors as the main tanks, the offset pieces also blow for plate tanks, so as a pally you struggle to get enough defensive gear to be truly tanky and when you do, it doesnt really contain the right stats for you due to a lack of int and spell power.
---
Raids are 40man - This is your true limiting factor, you need forty like minded people who are willing to gimp their own gameplay in order to facilitate yours. For prot pallies to be viable, you need to have a raid group that are willing to lower their max dps to avoid pulling aggro and to slow down their initial progression and clear times for you. This isnt sudtainable, it removes the fun for others, so even if you can find forty supportive people initially, I garauntee that theyll either burn out and quit or boot you in favour of a less shit tank class.
---
Yeah, I'd rather not play on NA server:D, I figure worst case scenario I'd find a casual EU guild that raids on either Friday or Saturday, 'cause those are my free days. Tnx tho!
---
I had an Athlon XP 150+ (1.3GHz), a Geforce 2 MX and 768MB ram. 
---
Looking back, its a miracle I even attempted to heal in MC at the framerates that rig gave me.
---
I agree, however is the idea of Tri-spec not to be able to provide Offensive Support? 
---
This is the spec that the Classic PvP Discord has listed for Trispec - [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusmZf0tZVMgu0d](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusmZf0tZVMgu0d)
---
However there is a large amount of points in there that slightly confuse me! For the cost of one global, you can place VE on a target and stay offensive, while providing healing to yourself and others. It is going to be a small amount +70 per tick of mindflay, but that boosts your renew + gives you that extra bit of breathing room?
---
Please yes
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMusZf0tcZVMgz0to](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#bxMusZf0tcZVMgz0to) Is the spec that I had considered changing the PvP Discords one? I feel like its even more powerful if you are a Horde Player!
---
It's also rumoured that Thrall did some autotune tracks.
---
that spec is shit on many levels. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMrs0bZbhtMZVMGdcd
---
this one is much better.
---
On rogues and druids to prevent restealth, when you news to kite, to keep a constant little dmg and agroo
---
I get conflicting info on what is and isn't in the current client.

---
Will leatherworking provide me with good gear at 60 to get be started on my pre-bis?
---
I made a post about it some time ago.
---
On blizzcon demo there was the new soggy ramen combat text so i am really worried if they will put back the old one for release
---
Great visual guide!  I do have one suggestion, though.
---
For the First Aid quest "Triage", I think perhaps adding the breadcrumb quests might be of some help: "Alliance Trauma" from the First Aid trainer in Ironforge and "Horde Trauma" from the First Aid Trainer in Orgrimmar.
---
you aren't a real classic fanboy unless you downgrade your rig to twenty year old hardware.
---
So I see you have the Mind Blast points but I feel like the amount your going to cast it, those points are better else where! 
---
I considered mana burn, because I hear that it's good to use Vs Paladins however that is more of a horde only opponent and I'm not sure how much Mana Burn spam you'll be doing otherwise? 
---
I'm rather inexperienced in decent premades and I have ZERO exp in premades as a priest so I'm looking for ANY and ALL advice/criticism
---
That was fixed more than a year ago on all the most popular pservers... I don't know how this myth still persists.
---
I simply disagree with your whole post. If someone puts time and effort into making their lvl 19 character kick ass and then park them in WSG that's great for them. Just because you get spanked by that other 19 doesn't mean there needs to be some radical change to stop you from getting frustrated when you die to them.
---
I played part of Vanilla on dial-up with the lowest graphic settings......graphics aren't what makes WoW what it is. It's the people.
---
Nah I just called a Straw Man a Straw Man.
---
Devilsaur leather gear with hit rating is pre-B.i.S. for rogues,  feral cat druids, and a holdover for hunters who don't mind the armor drop from mail, to the best of my knowledge.
---
As a warrior, if you are not speed rushing, consider Alc/Herb. Potions are SO useful for a warrior, they will cut your deaths, downtime and ttk
---
92 is half of 99
---
44 is half of 60
---
I cannot WAIT for a Friday night, get into my comfy clothes, get a stoned as stoned can be (Canadian), put on some good tunes and level up my fishing in some gorgeous spots.
---
I prefer classic due to the softer feeling to the graphics. It feels more dreamlike and nostalgic.
---
Also, most threat meter addons are broken for pets.
---
I’ll make sure to remember that bow for 50s.
---
Not last priority, you are probably third at worst prio amongst all healers
---
Good luck killing a Mage.
---
Oh I didn’t know that, that’s good to know! 👍
---
You need like 125 skill to make lvl 10 greens, also at max lvl u dont get anything special from bs that others dont
---
Nah, they're just going to force us all onto random servers against our will, obviously.
---
....of course they're going to give us a list of server names beforehand.
---
Yep! Lots of good gear at high levels. As someone else mentioned, the Devilsaur set is pre-BiS for ferals.
---
They ARE back to an extent, but I'm fairly certain the effects aren't as intense as they were in Vanilla.
---
I can't say for certain but pretty sure that even with whatever random path finding it will still be possible. The boss isn't suddenly gonna walk up walls is it?
---
Leatherworking / Skinning is a good choice for druids. Helpful gear along the way and Devilsaur set when you get to 60.
---
But it definitely not part of a normal rotation considering it uses a global cool down and has quite a heavy mana cost, right?
---
You can't effectively go mining + herbing. you can only track 1 thing at a time so if you went both you'd have to be constantly cycling between tracking nodes and herbs.
---
BGs (especially Arathi) won't be available for months anyways so your point is kinda moot. People will have plenty of time to twink. A lot of people will have 19 twinks shelved before Arathi is even available.
---
Bs and lw are shit. Just find some simp that trained it to 300 if you need certain BoE items.
---
Cant MS straight off just from charge, so that's already broken your argument. Regardless of that:
---
Counterspell to pull the warrior into combat, no charge due to combat. Has to intercept or waddle.
---
Intercept? Blink. Warrior is now playing waddle demo. 
---
Doesn't intercept? Frost Bolt &gt; nova &gt; frostbolt+CoC shatter, Fireblast if not already dead.
---
If mage somehow fucks up and doesn't stay out of range, ice block until nova or blink are back up.
---
You literally can't lose to a Warrior without engineering toys/trinkets vs a non toy/trinket Mage.
---
I was just about to reee no changes, but this looks really really dope!
---
&gt;Blizzard have specifically said they will not use phasing. It would be totally unacceptable to use phasing.
---
I'm talking about having 6 patches, 6 phases instead of the 12 blizzlike patches.
---
&gt;We don't know yet how graphics will look. I hope it will look as authentic as possible and Blizzard did talk about that at Blizzcon.
---
We already know there will be new graphics with the option to toggle oldschool.
---
&gt;This may be a necessary evil to handle the lagre influx of retail players, aka tourists, that will just check out Classic for a short while and then leave. Sharding is a dealbreaker but acceptable for a limited time at launch to handle this specific and unique problem.
---
Neccesary yes, but it is still using modern knowledge to deal with vanilla issues which is what you said blizzard won't.
---
&gt;This is a necessary evil because Blizzard don't have backups from earlier patches. It's also content from actual Vanilla and not content or changes from outside Vanilla and that makes it ok. Not optimal but ok.
---
Some backups exist. 
---
&gt;Making this change would be us using our modern judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago. And that's bad. We want to avoid that.
---
That's the same thing that sharding does. The exact fucking same thing.
---
God I hope so.
---
I need my full night effects back.
---
That solution is exactly what Blizzard did to normal BG's later down the line. It worked perfectly. The only difference was the 'exp off guy' as a present to the twinks, to allow them to continue their style of play. Though most twinks hated this, causing the community to question the motive of twinking back in the day.
---
I agree with your post 100%.
---
I haven't heard about it and I doubt it will be implemented. Regarding #nochanges, I think if you're going to remake an old game there should be a compelling reason to make changes to it. So lots of behind-the-scenes stuff to get it running on modern machines, but there isn't much justification for QoL changes.
---
Do you have a source for them saying they'll change any pathing?
---
That isnt interfereing with no changes. Thats the type of weather that was back then. Blizz then tuned it down after a few expansions :D So itd be authentic
---
Countdown to classic podcast touched on this topic in a recent episode. One of the arguments that stood out to me was that everyone would roll need in this situation as a way for “ninja insurance “. Someone could say they needed it but then go and sell it afterwards.
---
O
---
Pepega
---
mindblast is your main damage spell, but u are right, the talent is not a priority. its just filler points coz there is nothing that would give you more (any) benefit. also manaburn is cruicial not only vs pala, its also strong vs other priest and just a good spell in general.
---
in premades on horde side you will probably be asked to go for a pure healing spec since priests are the only good healers for pvp and shamans are mainly dps. on alliance however the palas are the go to pvp healer and you will have more freedom in your spec.
---
however remember that trispec is not a dps spec. its a supportive healspec with the focus on gaining as much utility as possible. your damage will be not that much better, and your healing quite a bit worse, than a holy/disc spec. you bring much more utility though, so its a fair tradeoff.
---
I love the classic view and the ultra, too.
---
I‘ll pick Ultra, too.
---
And I couldn‘t agree more with the „good game“ part.
---
Correct. The nights arent as dark either
---
data miners, is this in the beta build?
---
Or you can just compare joana's clear to a private server clear, it's gonna be pretty identical in how much damage he does, how much damage he takes and where the mobs are.
---
I also think need on Boe items is the way to go, since you can always ask the winner after if you can have the item (or sell it for cheap if money is a thing, like during the leveling process).
---
This would be my personal approach. Need on Boe's, but I would offer to buy the item at half AH price or something.
---
holy shit you are salty
---
Even still, why not just have it as an option in the graphics menu? Weird decision for them to remove it entirely
---
Not sure why you got downvoted, this is pretty good advice.
---
So just furthering that, what should be my focus as a Trispec priest on the alliance side during a premade? 
---
Equally, is there more room for shadow priest on Alliance?
---
Those effects were damn good for back then. I want them back!
---
Definitely. Also, a great way to learn your class.
---
Lvl 19 twinking was WAY more popular than any other bracket twinking.  I predict you can get fine bg matches at the levels from 25-49 in general.
---
After watching this video (and without looking at what settings there actually are), I think I’ll want to play at max with the better foliage and somewhat better textures, but with the old school water. I think it just looks more lively and attractive than the plain max water.
---
Whilst Vurtne was good back in the day he wasn't facing off against very good opponents, take a look at these mage videos for a better idea of Mage PvP:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_OoUNtunIw
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyeoT1owdFo
---
Please leave an option to turn them down/off, too...
---
Standing around at the ZG entrance, waiting forever for the raid to get started, *in the rain* was a bit of a miserable experience...
---
&gt;I'm paying my sub I'm entitled to wins, fully aware that I'm queuing with shit gear.
---
Get a grip and stop crying, boomer fuck.
---
Please blizzard include the vanilla weather effects in classic wow. It makes sense. That is all.
---
I believe it was handled server side so it was something they were in control of.
---
I remember checking my main's /played at some point in TBC, was 120 something days back then.
---
classic models? they're letting us choose whether we can use old character models or new?
---
You need high level, rare or faction rep enchants before you can make good money. While leveling you might get an enchant to weapon that give a glow effect. These sell for a few gold cos they look cool.
---
Wait.. those are the actual old vanilla weather optics?
---
I thought the ones we have on pservers right now are the original ones.
---
That looks so amazing!
---
First Aid is going to be one of the biggest differences going back to vanilla that I cannot wait for
---
Real asmr
---
To what extent? Will Classic need BfA requirements considering the old models and graphics? Are the textures rendered by the new engine to look like the old ones?
---
Its shamefull how little focus is put on weather from Blizzard, I hope to see atleast a blue post on how they are going to restore the weather effects!!
---
totally man
---
I REAAAALLLY hope we get the original combat text font and feeling. It feels kinda meh on retail.
---
definately going for max settings. not sure about the water yet though. would love a mix of 50% old water 50% new water. kind of a mid way
---
Will you need to buy something /have the physical game for Classic or can I just download it and pay subscription?
---
Wrong, twinking was huge in vanilla, I know because I sucked in vanilla and I had 2 twinks lol
---
That's exactly why I want them *on*. But we are two different people.
---
I believe you will need to download the EU client so none of your old chars will be there but it’s still your same account. I moved to Australia a few years back and miss my first char and my TCG items. :S
---
I will be very upset if they don’t. Vanilla is gonna be all about the immersion. Trump is president, I’m tryna live in Azeroth.
---
Holy shit you made my day with this.  It's so hard to get a solid critique on things because the only input I ever get with my channel just starting is from friends.  That's not really the best place to draw critiques from because they'll never tell you the truth.  Tbh I was 50% on the fence on whether or not to post this because I know how volatile the reddit community in general can be when it comes to certain things, especially content creators posting their own content.  I knew that if there was one sub to post something like this in, it's r/classicwow. Thank you so much for your input, I'm going to hit the editor ASAP and experiment with some sound tweaks.
---
dispel. priest is the only offensive dispel for alliance and premades often bring 2 palas for their healers. so if you don't bring at least 1 priest whatever the spec you will be at a huge disadvantage.
---
I tthink even before WSG. This is why I mentioned that low level bg's in Classic may never have the chance to be a thing
---
This doesn't even make sense.
---
I’m in this same situation except in Australia. Daytime is my only time available for raiding. Just got fingers crossed there’s enough people in the same boat.
---
You burn the rested xp to fast. Sure you get 1.5 levels of bonus exp. But what does that matter if it takes you 10 days of not playing the character to collect it. You could get 60 while you wait for rested xp.
---
Sub only is what they said at blizzcon.
---
That’s good to know I had no intention of leveling first aid, being a healer it seemed redundant.
---
I used it while grinding all the time. Arcane shot is the one to avoid.
---
Did you really just insert trump into a wow post?
---
Just have to have a subscription. If you're paying the monthly, you'll be able to download and play Classic.
---
Oh boy. There’s so much to know but that’s what makes it fun. I would just pick a class and research it so you’re not starting off completely blind.
---
Someone posted a screenshot of classic Vs retail Elwyn Forest at night a few days ago and they were essentially identical.
---
classic view. #NOCHANGES
---
Its probably just in game w/o a way to change it.
---
Well that is shit
---
i would love to see this
---
Plus you can’t listen to podcasts or anything as then you don’t hear the sploosh.
---
For those who don't know what "quid" is, it's sterling pound. Not to be confused with the euro.
---
Depends on what your goals are. Personally I always try to speedlevel to 60 and see what time I can get. If speedleveling your character is a goal id suggest: not taking professions (even if you get your mount later as a result), get good add-ons,  and follow a good leveling guide. If you didn't want to rush to 60 I'd say go do every dungeon once just for the fun of it, and maybe some low level bgs. As for when you ding 60, id generally focus on getting your pre bis and getting ready for raids 😁
---
Yeah I remember playing this game on 9 fps lol.
---
more useful then retail
---
I mean, I like immersive effects.  But I like being able to see what's on my screen more.  I downloaded a darker nights mod for Skyrim, and then promptly got rid of it because even carrying a torch was essentially useless for helping me see.
---
So, the important question (to me, at least) is: How dark did nights get in vanilla?
---
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iD2U9PplwaA/hqdefault.jpg
---
Theres quite a noticeable difference. That print is also in a more open space. Its even more noticeable when its on closer spaces.
---
Game is slow, time consuming and it has delayed gratification. Enjoy it, take your time and make friends.
---
Great little video, well done!
---
More immersive but not intefearing. Theres some good youtube comparisons I believe.
---
I can’t upvote this enough. It’s kinda make or break for me.
---
or how about just wasting mana... yeah cast that max rank heal as we now out of combat and im bandaging at 80% hp. or how about when the healer says mana after every pull and is at 60% and proceeds to drink till 100% jfc im so happy me and my brother are duoing heals/tank
---
Enjoy the shit out of the journey. Even if it delays your lvl60 by weeks. You have time. Have fun, gank be ganked spend 3 hours doing dungeons anything you are having fun with your mates. You don't have to be max lvl to play and enjoy the game in vanila
---
Thank you!!
---
I just noticed due to your other post (wasn’t it yours?).
---
I‘m totally surprised by that fact, these weather effects look simply amazing.
---
If we could have those I‘ld be happy like Clyde if he got Cartman‘s tourette.
---
One of many RPG aspects which have been slowly removed destroying the true character of this once great game. May it return to its true glory.
---
This was super interesting to read through. Just wanted to say thanks.
---
Leveling professions is part of the leveling process. I'd gladly delay hitting 60 by a few days of IRL time if its means I have my professions at 300/300.
---
Wow. Is this really how it was in vanilla?
---
as a tanking druid be sure to always put regrowth and rejuv on yourself before you pull and then pull with moonfire or fearie fire then go bear. (this is when your not chain pulling groups and pooling rage) this is so that you heal yourself at the beggining of the fight saving some of your healer mana and it also creates threat through healing.
---
It was mine yes :) People requested I make a separate thread so I did. 
---
Haha same dude! The old weather effects were awesome.
---
Why?
---
I'm not sure as I wasn't in the closed beta for wow. For a few months after launch it was the main addon pack people used.
---
In PvE, for the most part it is. You might find some situation where you have the time and would rather save mana to heal. 
---
But for PvP it’s essential. You won’t have time to always sit and drink and your mana will be a precious resource.
---
nah man this is pure fact
---
If they don’t add it in there’s gotta be an add on you can download or change something in console no?
---
As you're obviously into Prog Rock, have you given Pink Floyd a listen? Some of their stuff (like the Dark side of the Moon album) are great for just sinking into the music and gaming on autopilot.
---
Yes of course that's what you do. Why wouldn't you do it? It only takes a little attention and costs you nothing.
---
You forgot a really important tip that should be in the top 5 or top 3:
---
GET larger BAGS as soon as possible.   you rightfully acknowledged that looting and selling everything is key and not buying minor upgrades is smart.  But there is one exception,  larger bags are an investment with a really good return, and are absolutely mandatory for efficient levelling.  
---
I advice people to get 4x 6 slots, and then upgrade to 4x 10 slot and finally upgrade to 4x 14 slots.  (the 16 slot bags will come when they are lvl 60).
---
You can collect cloth and have them made or just buy them.   higher lvl friends are also a good source, people kow bags are essential and often want to help out a newer player with free bags, a 'better'  gift than just gold
---
If you ever decide to go dps smite at 60, let me know I know quite a bit about it.
---
There are a few for beginners:
---
- Vanilla WoW is a slow game. Don't be in a hurry to get to 60. It won't happen quickly and there is a ton of content to enjoy along the way. The world building is a lot of fun. The people who talk about efficient leveling strategies are the ones who have gone through it a lot, but in my opinion even they are doing themselves a disservice by speeding through the content.
---
- Pick a class you'll enjoy. You spend a lot of time with a character, so forget what's popular or what's strongest or whatever. Find a class fantasy and / or role that you like and go with it.
---
- Don't be afraid to reroll your class. If you find you aren't enjoying the mechanics of the class you chose, then go check out something else.
---
- Don't neglect  your professions. You can have two primary professions and everyone gets access to all three secondary professions (fishing, cooking, first aid). The primary professions are good for getting gear and (usually) making money. The secondary professions are real money-makers as well as being useful.
---
- Group! The real selling point for Classic is that it's a social game. Most of us are nostalgic because of the friends we made while playing.
---
Solid advice. Thank you!
---
IMO in the current live version of WoW, there really isn't ever a night cycle.  It's either sunny or slightly less sunny.  Please bring back sketchy STV night ganking.
---
At least take cooking and level off Beast meat. You dont NEED fishing to get it to 300, its just more efficient (but a thousand times more boring).
---
Relatable too
---
I forgot how intense the weather used to be. Seriously hyped for classic!
---
Because to them, the game begins at 60.
---
OH MAN you're right.  I always forget how important filling all your bag slots are.  It's something that comes natural to me at this point that I just straight up forgot it.  DOH
---
Registered recently on Blizzard EU forums. It says ' You need a level 10 character to post on the forums '.  
---
How do I get level 10?
---
The nights are as dark as they were Vanilla in almost every zone. Some zones are brighter on BfA and some are actually darker.
---
awesome, now this is a subject that's much too lengthy for text, so when you have a chance lets talk in classic wow discord voice channel.
---
Completely disagree. Streamers provide so much more eventfulness to the world
---
It could be an option that allows players to turn it on or off.
---
Some games like Path of Exile have removed options like "disable shadows" because they said it would look shit when someone streams it lol.
---
Need to subscribe, create a character, and level it to level 10.
---
It's probably a measure to prevent spam. Lvl 10 takes like 1-2 hours to get.
---
This is the one I'm in.  Was posted here months ago.

---
Everyone needs on valuable BoE when in a random grp
---
Tailoring and enchanting is always solid.
---
Everybody is going to need bags, and wands will be in demand by every caster.
---
I’d say Stoneform is the best pvp racial for Rogue since you can talent Sprint to break roots
---
These visual guides (class spell guide included) are so much easier to digest than a table or wall of text. I'm excited to see what else works in this format!
---
race for 60 and min max every step of the way
---
Are druids any good in lv39 twink bracket?
---
I predict that herbalism won't be as good in classic as it is on private servers. The population will be 20% of that of the big private servers, the only reason herbing is so good is because there are 20 guilds per faction raiding BWL and above. On classic that number will be a lot lower and I also predict people will be way less tryhard for the most part since consumables aren't really needed for any content, even naxx. Most old vanilla raiders I've talked to scratch their heads at the consumable whoring of private servers.
---
K, ty!
---
Just being funny
---
Old water on the rivers looks better imo, but when you are looking on the ocean new water is much better than this obvious copy-paste texture.
---
Even without splitting group XP there are certain level ranges that run dry from quests and you need to grind.
---
For instance, the mid 40s basically require grinding a good 2-3 levels.
---
If you see yourself up mentally for this, it's not so bad. Once you grind those levels, quests start opening again.
---
Motion designer here. Your intro is tasteful and quick. Keep it.
---
Good relationships aren't good because they are easy. They are good because you WORK to make them that way. If you are committed to this girl, than use your actions to show that
---
I played official Vanilla back then and private servers through the last 4 years...
---
Ho man the memories
---
Surprised you didn't mention the most important thing for being a tank in vanilla. Shooting a mob and then running behind a wall so they come to you and don't accidentally agro other mobs.
---
There are already minor differences between that guide and Joanna's alliance starting zone guides. Given that there isn't a whole lot of flexibility in the starting zones I'm expecting (hoping for?) some notable differences after darkshore.
---
Right?
---
This looks so intense, it creates a completely new hype within the hype for me!
---
I want this!!!
---
Not to be a choosing beggar, but this nice wood-effect one is much lower resolution than the original.
---
So can't zoom in nice and crisp.
---
A bit of a back story.
---
This was my warlock Alt made during my vanilla days named Shanikua/Nezi. I once bargained my main (Undead Warrior) to tank a ZG run if the next pug group our local celebrity Jaedan set up he would carry my fresh level 60 Warlock. Flash forward to the Tiger boss and this beast of a mount drops and I roll a crisp 99, I start getting flooded with PM's with offers to buy the mount for 500-600g. Due to how rare this drop was I decided to keep the mount and become the second one on my server (Illidan) to ride through Orgrimmar. The other gentleman who had this mount and I would just stand together near the AH as people would oogle our mounts and we finally became the popular kids. Since then I have road this mount on every character and still find it to be my  favourite. I'm excited to test my luck in the upcoming Vanilla ZG but also hope some other character will get to experience and fall in love with this mount like I have.
---
DotA makes me sleep.
---
Frost mages are tricky, yes, but it's really no big deal. Also not only does Charge generate rage upon cast, but as soon as you stop next to the enemy there's an instantaneous white hit weapon swing, which generates additional rage. And in between casting Charge and going to the target, you've already popped Bloodrage so you will *always* have enough rage for a Mortal Strike.
---
r/gra
---
That would be positively delicious. And it'll probably never happen, both because Sylvanas is Blizzard's golden child and because they seem to have forsaken^1 the rank and file in favor of the story only ever happening to big name NPCs.
---
^1 ^Pun ^fully ^intended
---
Not for resting XP.
---
I'm going to multibox level a rogue and druid at the same time.
---
I'll get two 60s in slightly longer time then it would take me to get to 60 with one. I imagine they will allow char transfers at some point as well, at which point I would retire the duoboxing team, and save the $15/mo on the second account.
---
I didn’t notice this on the build reports. I got my post taken down since I posted Tips video. The option to scale the weather intensity wasn’t in the settings menu. It made me worry.
---
Pretty sure, although I'd prefer they didn't. But people have been asking for the option since it's only viewable clientside.
---
In regards to brightness of it looks identical to me. The cloud being in the middle and reflection of the cloud makes it seem off but look at the ground. Use paint to swap the boxes positions and you'll see it the same.
---
I guess I'll post this again.  
---
Most of the zones in BfA are roughly as dark as Vanilla nights. There's a couple exceptions; Theramore on BfA is quite a bit brighter and I think it might have something to do with the  phasing from the Mana bomb scenario, it's like they never went back and fixed night in the pre-bomb phase.

Weather effects are back but they're not quite the same. The snow I've seen isn't the same but the rain in Zuldazar gets quite intense:

---
There's also a heck of a lot more zones with weather. Back in Vanilla, I think there was only around 10 zones with weather and now it seems like almost all of them have it. It was even raining in freaking Culling of Stratholme (WoTLK dungeon) when I was leveling my Shaman:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/c2culxU.png](https://i.imgur.com/c2culxU.png)
---
Considering more people played and subbed during retail Vanilla, I see no reason why this won't happen again. Especially with global subs.
---
Yea the clouds matter a bit there but there are better comparisons that shows a difference. Esp in certain zones. So overall the vanilla nights were much better imo.
---
imo there are few things in life as satisfying as a big fat Vanilla WoW crit.  Especially in PvP
---
Cringer became the mighty Battle Cat.
---
I think this is an educational video. the first couple tips I would just bunch in one. Save trade items food water / sell garbage. Except gold that is very good and important to stress. Then bring the AH thing together you mentioned it twice. The once “sell rare items and stuff on the ah” couple seconds later you then say don’t use other then to sell. I would just bunch and and label it AH. Don’t use is a strong thing. I would just label then use go down the list post rare items trade items. But don’t buy. Things like that. I’m also a seasoned player so that’s why I see it that way. Also as a player who has done a couple runs I find the travel quests are easily held on to until there green chances are you have to fly to SW or even in the case of the beer quest from red ridge you will likely hit all the places collect you beer to begin with (other then gold shire) but still. Just my thoughts soo I went a little ham:p good job
---
Max settings. The vanilla experience for me comes from server community and gameplay, not shadows and water quality. 
---
That said I do prefer the older character models and I’m glad those are staying.
---
They should have just made a 15-hour day or something, so it desynchronizes with real-world clocks.
---
Think of the 40v40 battles in the Field of Tears in AV at 100fps and 1440p
---
\*nerdgasm\*
---
Hey what did you use to get ahead of the crowd in latest fresh? Just a long first day or something special 1-20?
---
&gt;I'm not really dying to play because of nostalgia, I want to play because it's simply a way better game.
---
I just want to play it because it was an actual mmorpg unlike whatever retail has become.
---
Ho bfa, look at that empty orgrimmar entrance

Haha me too. New Mulgore is amazing!

Didnt classic run on like 1gz CPU with 2gb of ram?

Fuck technology has come so far...
---
Just have the option to enable/disable weather effects 4Head?
---
No, it's from a Pserver - Nostalrius.
---
Ya that thread is great. There are several recordings posted if you look through. Yesterday I spent a 12hr flight watching someone's 1-20 run...
---
YES! Thanks for posting!
---
Now we can play the game
---
even the modern WoW engine is pretty shit at handling particle effects some times, in Legion there were a few enemy attacks that would annihilate your FPS if you looked at them from the wrong angle
---
Also the spurs for mount speed.
---
Slight correction to what /u/localhost87 said:    
---
You do not need an active subscription. You can play up to level 20 without a sub, since it's considered the trail phase.     
---
So, to post on the EU forums it would be enough to have a starter account for the European region and then level a character to 10.
---
As suggested:

Thank you

Like I said, counterspell prevents the charge entirely. Jumping+moving prevents the white hit too even if you did somehow get charged.
---
Good point! I am actually going to lvl along with my IRL friends, so the question was more if it was worth it! But that is a really good one, and who knows, maybe our friend circle will expand!
---
Things like this make me scared it just wont hit that nostalgia spot that im hoping it will
---
Tanaris wind, came blowing' in from across the sea...
---
But if you don't play, then you never get to use said rested exp.
---
The night shot that is incredibly different is the crossroads. That’s maybe the only one where I like retail more. Classic has a very neon green glow to it. 
---
Regarding weather, I hope blizzard brings it back the way it was with intense sandstorms and rain.
---
Hey thanks!  I know there's a lot of consolidating I could do but for whatever reason, the number "30" popped into my head when I first started thinking of a video like this, and never really thought about doing less or more.  I'll admit I had to stretch a couple, maybe 20 or 25 may have been a little more prudent but I just had the number 30 in my head and it stuck.  You've got a point with the travel quests for sure, that tip was just born out of my inclination to seek out easy XP when I first started playing. 
---
 "All I gotta do is go talk to this guy for this quest?"
---
20 mins, 2 flight paths, and 1 zeppelin later
---
"...well fuck"
---
Since there will (probably) be a toggle you can do that in water areas.
---
Most of the game is no really around water though so I'm glad we get sole lighting updates on the max settings and whatnot
---
63/skull level bosses. 5 skill per mob level.
---
Logging out and back in definitely worked to drop you at the next connecting location at some point in retail vanilla, couldn't say for sure that it wasn't patched before 1.12.
---
This is simply not true, see the poster above for actual classic v live comparisons and you will see that you are demonstrably wrong.
---
Yeah it was quite funny how twinking declined in popularity the second they couldn't just stomp non-twinks anymore.
---
I think BFA minimum requires a GPU that can support DX11.
---
What if new graphics was an option?
---
That’s what I think is charming about it. It’s like real life. The fact that you had an experience and feeling that was unique in that moment shows how effective and immersive the weather system is. Otherwise it’s just the same old every time. 
---
Bring back the weather!
---
Hell even just a 20 hour cycle would do the trick. Good idea!
---
I appreciate the advice. Thanks!
---
If I resub now to retail and buy a wow token and keep it, will I be able to pay for vanilla when it gets released? I'm thinking about paying for a sub now and keep myself busy until vanilla comes out.
---
But if twinking just made you want to create a twink character, then what's the difference to just having twinks in their own BGs? Or are you claiming that most people don't follow that logic?
---
Would you say grinding solo gives more xp/hour than grinding duo? I know duo will let us finish certain quests faster, but maybe if we have to grind we should just leave the group for it?
---
Cover the basics. 
---
Buy your spell ranks that will increase your damage. Don't forget about talent points. Get at least one gathering profession.
---
Read up a little on the class you pick. Things like knowing to get a wand and wand stuff to death as a priest or to go sword as a rogue and to have good weapons as a physical damage class, they can go a long way to speeding things up a bit.
---
That's pretty stupid. Chances are if someone is getting viewer numbers that would actually affect the games appeal, then they would have to be dedicated enough to streaming to have a decent rig.
---
&gt;When alcohol is involved, I’m a fucking blast!
---
I'm sure that's how you remember it!
---
Does anyone remember the weather effects from Final Fantasy 11 online? The weather actually effected magical abilities. If it was windy, fire spells would do more damage, if it was raining they would do less, things like that. Obviously I don’t want blizzard to do that, but just a cool memory. It’s no WOW but I loved that game.
---
I almost want to get a private 1.12 client running to compare it to Classic and retail, myself. The atmosphere of vanilla was half the reason I fell so in love with it.
---
This + a list of guilds and which servers they are rolling on. Personally, I would like to avoid any super competitive world first guild.
---
Ty, kinda surprised wow retail hasnt implemented them as basic features tbh.
---
It was probably done for PVP readability in competitive which is a shame as the old animations were nice.
---
Classic HAD a Legion core. It's running some BfA version now, both games will use the same client from now on.
---
It took me 27 days play time to level my original orc hunter. World pvp is just too tempting
---
Thanks, do you have a ui addon in mind already?
---
Yeah but constant bitching about retail is big karma
---
I appreciate it as a sport, just can't enjoy watching it,sort of like golf or tennis
---
Classic Winds is a fucking legend and I can't wait to see the first episode of this series.
---
One of my favorite classic content creators, just because of stuff like this.
---
It will be a lot harder waiting until everyone is 60. It is easier to compete with a mob around your level than level 60s ganking you.
---
Personally, I can't wait to pvp leveling up while everyone doesn't have a full tier 2 60 to log into and kill me with
---
I don't believe there's been an official answer on this, but I would think yes. If Classic and BfA are on the same subscription, then the token system on BfA should give account time for Classic as well.
---
IIRC there were a few items that could be used like this for attacking with Firey enchant, and later crusader.
---
I live in the same city as this guy, see him around here and there, always thought that was super cool back in the day
---
Thats not ideal at all
---
I'm planning on herb/alch - it's been immensely helpful, even on my druid alt on a pserver.
---
Don't think health pots (which you're right, can't be used in form). Think troll's blood potions, defense, agi, str potions. By level 27 you can be rocking +8str and +8agi 24/7 for basically no cost. It's the equivalent of upgrading a couple greens to blues.
---
Heya murk
---
Tell us how your first alt began and we can go from there. Thank you for being so vulnerable
---
&gt;I'm talking about having 6 patches, 6 phases instead of the 12 blizzlike patches.
---
So you are just making a Straw man again. Your argument is that Classic will not be an exact replica of Vanilla and some changes are required so that means that all changes are ok. It's an dishonest and ignorant way of debating, Twink? That's the topic here, Twinks in Classic...
---
&gt; We already know there will be new graphics with the option to toggle oldschool. 
---
First of all, no we don't know that. Anyway, this is a Straw man argument. You are refuting and argument I never made. Blizzard have said that they want Classic to be as authentic as possible and they want to avoid using modern day judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago. Graphics in Classic has nothing to do with this. They are using a modern client to solve modern day problems.
---
&gt; Some backups exist. 
---
Yes some backup exists and they have a complete backup from 1.12.1 and that's why they are basing Classic on that patch and trying to make it feel as authentic and historical as possible with what they have. How is this in any way related to adding changes from outside Vanilla to fix a "problem" with twinks from 12 years ago that was part of all of Vanilla and TBC? It's a Straw Man.
---
&gt; That's the same thing that sharding does. The exact fucking same thing. 
---
First of all, we don't know that they will use Sharding. They MAY use that. Do you understand this, they MAY use it? Also, they are not solving a problem from 12 years ago, they are solving a problem TODAY, with the UNIQUE situation with millions of retail tourists that can log in for free and try Classic on top of the massive Classic Hype. It's NOT using modern day judgement to solve a 12y old "problem", it's using a modern day judgement to, for a limited time use a custom feature, to release a game with millions of people logging in at once. Also, this has nothing to do with Twinks. Get it? How is it "The exact fucking same thing" to use sharding, if that even will happen, at launch and to add changes to Vanilla that removed Twinks for Battlegrounds?
---
It's just another Straw Man.
---
It's all Straw Man arguments from you. You have said nothing about Twinks and nothing you have said changes the FACT that Blizzard want Classic to be a historical and as authentic as possible and they want to AVOID using modern judgement to solve problems, like for example Twinking, from 12 years ago. Sharding, launch, tourists, is a modern day problem, not a 12y old problem.
---
REEEEE NO CHA-
---
oh...oh well I love you, too.
---
I will probably be participating in multi characters bc work life and being able to play times a week just seems appropriate
---
I think my understanding is that both BfA and Classic will literally run in the same launcher, with a switchover to Classic happening sometime after you actually enter the game and log in. If that’s the case, then you would probably require BfA specs to play classic.
---
Blizzard pls
---
I also liked it, sound and all
---
MTG Arena has been a good way to pass the time for me
---
I just like the graphics because it feels aesthetically fitting for classic, part of the experience for me.
---
Commenting for kater
---
Jesus...no changes please Blizzard!
---
In Vanilla that entrance you'd get yelled at for blocking the dueling zone, horde would be lined up everywhere along the edges, people doing dumb stuff, chatting.
---
Gonna be a wait for that.
---
Most guides skip most dungeons. As a priest/warrior combo, dungeon groups will come easily. Gather dungeon quests and do those, and you should be able to avoid a lot of grinding.
---
Weather is fucking be beautiful in most older games. I remember the original PlanetSide had similar weather effects. Don't believe the sequel does.
---
I’m having the same problem, finding any game to hold my interest is impossible at this point it seems
---
I guess any Vanilla PvP from a Warrior/Shaman will do.
---
[Here's an example in Pat's PvP video](https://youtu.be/RGBnjELkgok?t=141)
---
[Unbreakable Shaman Windfury PvP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja1j7xWpB3w)
---
I've been really interested in seeing someone try out raiding with a Smite priest &amp; ret paladin combo in the same group, see what kind of numbers that comes up with.
---
Find something to help you relax and wait patiently.  I've turned to other games from the era, or just before.  
---
Diablo 2/3, Baldur's Gate, but mostly: Everquest. They released two new Time Locked Progression servers back at the beginning of march and I've been thoroughly enjoying Mangler with a friend. It's helped me relax and not worry so much about when WoW: Classic comes out. I know it will be here eventually.
---
Hey thanks!!
---
For hunters, sure. Probably not faster solo for a priest or warrior.
---
That &amp; OSRS has kept me occupied
---
i love these old weather effects. i hope we get them in classic.
---
Just my opinion but you come off as much more believable and mature in this video, and as such I enjoyed this version much more.
---
I'm right there with you buddy. The first time I played original WoW was during my high school summer break. I had to work during the summer and I remember that all I could think about during work was rushing back home to play WoW where I could go kill some crocs in that island full of crocs in Loch Modan and then skinning them. I was obsessed with skinning dead crocs...
---
It's insane how addictive so many elements of this game is. This past week I've been on vacation in a tropical paradise glued to my laptop/smart phone reading and doing research on this game.
---
Shadow priest is awesome. If you’re on a PvP server it’s hard living as holy/disc but that’s amazing in PvE too. Can’t go wrong with spriest for PvP and instanced people with be cool with you. Raids there’s 1 spriest to buff warlock dmg. So if you can live with that, I’d say go for it! Thing I didn’t like about spriest is the range of your channeled spell is pretty rough vs mage and hunter. If you can get close and fear bomb you can do an amazing amount of damage and gearing a shadow priest enough to be dangerous is not hard.
---
I think your confusion is coming from seeing this as a direct argument when it's more of a discussion. 
---
He wasn't trying to refute the original argument. He just listed examples of how Blizzard is not following the design philosophy expressed by Ion in that quote. That is a salient point and absolutely has a place I this discussion because it calls into question Ion sincerity regarding that design philosophy.
---
You could just... watch for the visual indicator.  I always have my in game volume off in WoW and it's never stopped me from fishing.
---
Thanks i guess, but as i Said in a comment, this is not my video.
---
I don't get why people wanna watch someone else play classic and even give them money to do so. What a waste of time.
---
I hope Ol’ Blanchey is okay.
---
You can just make the macro that cycles between herbs and veins and spam it while you're running around.

Oh lol. Reddit mobile is not showing me any comments in any threads right now so i just assumed it was the OP posting this.
---
That's fine, that's why I'm asking for a toggle and not strictly updated graphics. I want everyone to enjoy their experience the way they want to.
---
You can purchase the alterac swiss there but giant eggs and zesty clam meat are mob drops, farming or AH only.
---
If they are hooking up the blizzard armory api to the new classic servers, it would be possible to build a simple interface on this website where you enter a realm and character name. Then have the server call the API to check the character level. It would bypass the need for screenshots and such. 
---
I'd build something basic myself, but the blizzard api tokens require authenticator setup, which I haven't done at this point.
---
Also, depending on the API outputs, you could do the same for professions (Ex. first to 300 fishing).
---
weather effects need to be the same as vanilla. I was on retail yesterday and the rain in Silverpine was a joke.
---
I know this would be taking it too far, but I'd absolutely love to have the "alpha night" back where you needed to bring a lantern to actually see better around you.
---
Because it isnt mana efficient and does terrible damage at higher levels. Decent early on, but starts getting worse and worse.
---
I've tried and they refuse to. What the hell :(
---
Good, I'm not the only one. :D

Dwarf or gnome rogue with the intention of frequent world and BG pvp? 3 min stoneform aka cloak of shadows type spell vs. rogues, hunters, warriors, and shadow priests or 1 min CD .5s cast escape artist great vs mages, hunters, and anyone trying to kite/run.

Trying to think which would be more useful overall, esp as a dagger rogue.

For those who don't know what a sterling pound is, it's the money that you use to buy fish and chips, a pint or an oyster card.

You are correct. It will be a different realm choice after you log into the bfa client

This trinket is broken in pvp but boy, ain't that a grind to get it
---
Certain nms only spawned during certain weather. Pretty sure it affected crafting and fishing too.
---
Did u eat deep fried butter too?
---
I agree, and it makes sense I suppose -- the game is super old, so there's only so much you can do to make it look better.
---
Do you have a link to joanas lvling guide.. I remember using it back in the days of vanilla, haven’t touched the game since tbc but now been dying waiting for classic
---
I'm guessing the leatherworking suggestion is for crafting Nightscape Tunics (or whichever piece it is that people do). So many people take skinning now that you can get Thick Leather very cheap and turn a profit. If you spam enough you can get a lot of people just CODing you the leather a bit above vendor price.
---
Not sure how the profit will compare on a smaller population Classic server vs. private servers though.
---
I messaged you
---
I almost can't spot a difference except for the water looking like plastic on max settings O_o
---
RIP my eyes I guess.
---
I don't even think it rained in Silverpine back in Vanilla.

In the crossroads videos, there is a bunch of stuff missing in the 1.13 version, look in front of the inn, many boxes and random little doodads missing, how come?
---
There are parts on Un'goro that suck but overall it's a great zone.  A moderately high number of quests that you can complete by basically just looping around the zone then turn them all in for a huge chunk of quest XP.  Very efficient zone in terms of XP/hour provided you don't get ganked every 5 minutes.
---
Wait so if the game is on modern engine will my fps be shit in raids??
---
Yep, this guy's legit
---
What do you mean? Of course there are. First boss of MC you have to pop a resto potion to get a debuff off of you. 2nd boss is easy just stay out of fire. There are certain bosses that aren’t just move here stand here there is more to it including using consumes at certain points and stuff.
---
I mostly play at night! It’s not a disadvantage thing, it’s just that it’s pretty hard to see and it’s hard on your eyes if you only ever play at night :)
---
A setting for it would be wonderful.
---
We have a “setting” for it in modern WoW, called the Inky Black Potion. Makes the game super dark and spooky, but just for you. :)
---
The threat will definitely make for great rage/comic moments at release since this mechanic disappeared from every single MMO. Not as strong as old ones at least and WoW was the last to need a threat meter.
---
Installing Omen, waiting for War to put his debuffs before starting to dps and heal will really break some people minds.
---
We'll see I guess.
---
Get ready to get ganked a lot after hitting 48+ if playing on a PvP server.
---
It depends on the dungeon and your faction. Scarlet Monastery is really inefficient for Alliance due to travel time to get there, but Stockades would be an okay use of time if you can get a group quickly and have all the quests. 
---
Uldaman is a good dungeon to run as Alliance, as it has a large number of quests and is easy to access. Sunken Temple has class quests which many people favor doing. Other than that, I think the others are all slower than questing.
---
Twink only BGs kills twinks completely. There simply are not enough to sustain that. You want twinks dead. I enjoyed having twinks and I know for a fact that blizzards change killed twinks which is why they reverted the change but at that point the damage was done. I still have my original 19 twink and 39 twink and I'm excited to create them again. I'm sorry you got wrecked in low BGs but it does not ruin the game.
---
This is not true at all.
---
please gives us the heavy rain! its so fucking immersive! who would not like that.. its a huge part of vanilla immersion.
---
It depends what class you are honestly. Grinding solo as a warrior would be a lot slower than grinding solo as a priest because of the additional downtime. Priests have almost 0 downtime if done correctly, so grinding is easy for them. Although I dont think grinding together would be SIGNIFICANTLY slower, so if you two enjoy grinding together moreso than grinding solo, I would go for it. Myself, I prefer grinding solo because I usually throw on some netflix and just auto pilot, but you may prefer something else. :)
---
Just my opinion, everyone is welcome to their own.
---
Agreed.  1-30 is always pretty easy.  I find 30-40 to be the worst.  Huge zones like Desolace with no mount yet and the dreaded STV.  After 40 things get easier and in the late 40's-early 50's things get a lot easier as good leveling zones like Un'goro and the plaguelands open up to you.
---
Good luck, my girlfriend has agreed to give it a try as well but has already warned me it’s going to be “short lived”. I’m destined to game forever alone. Unless something crazy happens and world of Warcraft is more powerful than I thought..
---
Some people only have video games to live for
---
Halo reach on steam soon brothers
---
Fully depends on the group, warlocks will like you and want you
---
Take a break from worrying about what you cant control, live a little instead / Quote from the movie Passengers.
---
Well I played 35hours and got 1-35.
---
As for getting ahead of crowd, I 2man quested to level ten then immediately went barrens. Most important part of being "ahead" is not to be higher level, but to do quests that other people are too low to do. So by doing barrens at lvl10 instead of completing durator and going barrens at 11-12, I was ahead of others in doing the quests.
---
A lot of it seems to boil down to increased visual range. The vanilla visual range was a lot shorter, so the far-off terrain turns into a very dark blue.
---
The money you can make from Savory Deviate Delight makes it feel very worthwhile at the beginning. After that it gets a bit depressing, yeah.
---
mate, you are not alone
---
OMG , now I want to play Baldur's gate 1 and 2 ...
---
How are Druids (cats) and Shamans?
---
That’s the thing, I love the Netflix and autopilot method haha. I was playing a hunter though so I imagine it’d be much different having to hamstring kite and pay a bit more attention as a warrior. I just want to be the most efficient and not sure if duo is able to do that :/
---
I played a healer for all of vanilla, and I enjoyed it. You have trouble farming things. You will always be the first one blamed when you wipe, but you will also be very popular and in high demand, if you are good at your job. In pvp you are very reliant on finding someone to heal, pref a well geared warrior.  
---
In short, if you keeping people alive and being liked healing is good! If you like punching a dragon in the 'nads roll something else :)
---
Looks really good! Nevertheless, down the road, I wouldn’t mind (an option to choose) improved graphics.
---
I would say, make a big deal of the small things to make the beginning seem interesting. For example if she gets a bag drop, be like whoa that's super rare to drop this early! When she gets level two/three. Make sure you get really excited and hype up getting a new ability and how cool it is. Might make her wanna stay along for the early ride and get hooked into playing with you :)
---
It’s not an opinion. It’s objectively wrong. In Legion, dark nights were brought back to where they used to be. The clock cycle is active and working, and has been for almost four years.
---
Play Sekiro
---
Yeah as long as there are 16 slots, seems people like to have 1 shadow priest. You aren't going to be TOP DPS but you bring a lot of other benefits and smart people will see that. You just have to make yourself stand out and be desired as a player.
---
Regardless of which you choose you’ll be happy you picked one sometimes and see times when being the other would have helped. 
---
I can’t stand the look of gnomes, but a sneaking dwarf looks rediculous.
---
Hate to break it to you but the game isn't out yet.
---
&gt;He wasn't trying to refute the original argument.
---
I agree! He made a new argument and refuted that.
---
&gt;He just listed examples of how Blizzard is not following the design philosophy expressed by Ion in that quote.
---
He wrote, and I quote: " how exactly do you plan on explaining". He posted this to me directly and then posting a list of things that in no way has anything to do with actual gameplay "problems". Everything he listed are either unknown or necessary. So it's a Straw Man argument. He gave the impression of refuting an argument that was never presented. The argument, well, the factual quote and source that I posted, was that Blizzard want to avoid using their modern day judgement to solve problems from 12 years ago. Like for example fixing the "problem" with Twinks in battlegrounds.
---
Gnome for sure.. they are the meme'iest!
---
A lot of people were probably on 512meg to 1gb.
---
Go orc, with shield + 1H and engeneering and try [this spec](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdhbZxxzhZxbtc0h). You should be a pain for rogues.
---
new graphics looks like shit, its too bright
---
You're referring to something different. 
---
Back then the night and day cycle were synced with real life day night cycle. At night some mobs are more power full in vanilla, for example the pinewood village at night turns into elite warewoolfs, while at day they are all humans. 
---
It's also depressing for people to always play in 1 cycle. 
---
To fix this they have lowered the day and night cycle to a quarter or half the time (I don't know for certain).
---
what's that addon from [this](https://i.imgur.com/hLhtlBk.jpg) pic? specifically, the one showing your character's face at the bottom of the screen with her healthbar/mana beside it
---
Not only is this a complete overreaction but utterly impossible to stop.
---
Imagine having leveled from 20-29 and you picked up some semi decent gear along the way.  What separates your gear from twink gear?  How do you differentiate between a non twink and twink?  
---
It is a really bad argument and a waste of your time asking to remove it
---
Perfect. 
---
From what others have said, eng is only good for PvP?
---
The demo has an old login screen. It's a different client altogether, not the BFA launcher.
---
I imagine with this it will just be a separate download on the Battle.net launcher like every other game. They aren't going to make you download BFA to suck up HDD space just to play classic, which is a much smaller download client.
---
Once you get the hang of it you can autopilot hamstring kiting pretty easily. But I dont think grouping is faster than soloing unless you really strategize it well. I always prefer solo questing but it seems I get roped into questing with guildies during new launches, which is fine too. But for me solo is always much quicker.
---
At a glance it’s pretty much the same. Which is good or at least I think it would be good for this sub. 
---
I’m going to be playing Max settings anyway but yeah.
---
Sounds good!
---
Of, you didn't get the Beta invite? :(
---
To be fair, tailoring provides best in slot items for certain level ranges for locks, priests, and mages. 
---
I don’t remember any bs gear last time I leveled a warrior that made me level it up specifically for that item.
---
I haven’t done too many hunter/Druid/rogue/sham runs, so I’m not sure how good lw is.
---
I love to indulge in a good single player game before embarking on an MMO journey, and Sekiro is top tier.
---
&gt;To fix this they have lowered the day and night cycle to a quarter or half the time (I don't know for certain).
---
No they haven't. There is one day/night cycle per 24 real hours.
---
It depends on what you are trying to achieve. OP is talking about having multiple characters, and leveling in a rotation while rested is the most efficient way to do that.
---
Sounds like a good time to get into a new book or perhaps a TV series.
---
Again, in my opinion, as someone who played Legion as well as Vanilla, the night/day cycle in Vanilla was much more noticeable.  Perhaps it's due to the overstimulation aspect of recent Xpacs where you're constantly looking at a mob, npc, spell effect, or dialogue box.  Perhaps it's due to the amount of downtime in Vanilla compared to recent Xpacs, where I was much more inclined to sit and look at the scenery and ambience.  Who knows.  Downvote all you want, but all I know is since Cataclysm, the entire game in general has been brighter, more saturated, and less dark.  It's neat that everyone is posting comparison screenshots and what not, retail is obviously darker than it was in previous expansions, but like I said, in my opinion, the day night cycles completely unnoticeable.
---
This.
---
Even if you can use the BoE, you're better off selling it and putting that gold towards your mount professions
---
Thank you - much appreciated
---
Daoc has better weather effects than wow, and had clouds in the sky when it rained/snowed light or heavy, you couldn’t turn it off either. Never heard anyone complaining it slowed anything down, and we used way worse computers.
---
Why not level them together then? Dual boxing can be fun, will make it easier to level the warrior, and you will save time overall.
---
 Nostalgia bomb.
---
Nights of playing until 3am, running through strangthorn vale in the night rain with my headphones on and the room dimly lit... Mountain Dew cans and nature valley oats and honey bars powering me through the raptor quest line... seeing a night elf warrior ahead so I go into stealth to get into the best position........ can’t wait for this summer to be a 30 year old with responsibilities and sleep deprivation.
---
I wonder about people who having been playing wow since it was first released and those who are going to play classic and plan on it for the long run...
---
When you're in your 80s or 90s thinking back on your life or telling your grandkids about it, how are you going to feel about spending so much of your youth sitting in front of a video game. And the times you aren't playing it your constantly looking stuff up about it.
---
I have a friend like this. The few times he actually comes and joins us to go out he has nothing to add to our conversations. He literally experiences nothing except going to work and playing wow. It's a shame I think.
---
I'd say that the gain is far from small. It greatly increases the efficiency leveling in rested.
---
Just Tap and let a hot tic on you.
---
As a healer I hated locks who tapped to 5% life. 
---
- stop giving me a heart attack.
---
Those OG devs knew whats up
---
Its a different client yes but its based on the BFA client. Also BFA and Classic will be in the same folder, sharing most of the game files. But at the same time Classic wont be as hardware demanding as BFA because Classic zones a lot less complex than the zones in BFA.
---
why didnt you just download more ram?
---
You can do both, especially if you plan on leveling on of everything like I am.
---
Yes it does. There are multiple threads that explain its 4h30m cycle.
---
Right. But for leveling, most of the BiS gear for any given level is going to be from some source other than a crafting profession. But you can usually craft something good for every slot and it's guaranteed that you'll get it as long as you have the mats.
---
At 60, Truefaith Vestments is BiS for holy priests until ... AQ, I think?
---
Bingo! I will be doing the same, though may keep my second account going for occasional dual box farming or AH muling
---
I'm just playing a private server to burn the time
---
you can even do that in retail. If you turn the water settings all the way down to "low" you will get the old water.
---
What do you experience on a regular basis that you believe adds meaning to your life and a goal? 
---
I’m just trying to figure out what mine is right now. A little lost.
---
&gt;Twinking is a product of knowledge that didn't really happen in Vanilla but will happen in Classic on a larger scale.   
---
&gt; Twinking was a rare thing in Vanilla and only really took off late TBC 
---
Twinking was not that rare in vanilla though, I remember standing in Org and I had people coming up to me asking for gold for twinking all the time. I had my own twink characters aswell, both 19 and 29 and I always had other twinks in the BG's with me when I played on my twink characters.
---
&gt;When the exp fix was bought in low level battlegrounds became a thing again. This is one of the few things I fully agreed with Blizzard doing. It made as section of the game playable for 100% instead of 5% and actually made bgs a bit more worthwhile while leveling as you no longer fealt like you were falling behind. 
---
Dude what? Did you even play BG's at all? They all became a boring cesspool of 90% of players running around with full heirloom gear and since Blizzard literally couldn't balance low level classes because it would destabilize higher levels, you always had a class that went completely ham in low level BG's. Disc priest for example, they could kill anything they wanted with penance while being immortal with their shields and I don't think Blizzard did anything about this for like two years.. and when they finally "fixed" priests, hunters became overpowered like hell. If you had two fully heirloomed and enchanted geared hunters in one WSG group it was impossible to lose.
---
This kind of complaining is the reason twinking is dead now and scaling is a thing. Having elitist things in the game is not bad, if a player spends hundreds of hours farming gold, leveling a character and farms for blue gear in dungeons.. then yeah, he deserves to be better than a person that just hit 10 and only has two green items to his name. But you know what? Maybe that person that got obliterated at level 10 thought it badass and looked forward to making his own twink later on? 
---
It's all about the "interesting experience" in a game like WoW and retail's "interesting experience" for low levels vanished years ago. It's now a boring stale grindfest which is most likely the reason for you being able to buy max level.
---
It should just be a feature of ElvUI. You can look into ElvUI but it's very complicated at first so it may be good to find someone's preset on the internet and just copy it. That's what I did and I've been making minor adjustments as I understand the mod more.
---
Well he shouldn't, but second boss (caster) might not do circles around the the boss platform, and will kill you despite the kite route
---
if classic means classic it will be a thing but people will be wise to it so expect more twinks
---
It’s fine to phrase it as an opinion, but your original statement was phrased as if it were factual, which is not correct. STV on live is currently just as dark as it used to be. As I said, the nights were restored in early Legion.
---
After like 32*
---
You should link those threads so I can correct them there too.
---
Xodexx
---
It was wrong on private servers and in fact fixed later on (on most popular one). So it does not scale at all.
---
A lot of things are the most “optimal” only a small portion of people will do the content which requires you to optimise. Do things for fun.
---
Furthermore as evryone will be low level and doing the same quests grinding mobs in areas that don’t evolve quests is the best way to level and a fun alternative is doing dungeons with friends but it is extreemly slow just a lot of fun.
---
Tips for dungeons as a dps you can’t start dealing damage on a target untill you see 2 sunder armours you will wipe the dungeon... (yes even from rfc and deadmines)
---
The way to generate threat in vanilla is sunder armour for warriors.
---
Last tip it is verry likely the only way you will be able to level early on is grouping up with a healer and grind level 5 mobs untill you are ahead of the curve. (Shamens can solo lvl 5 mobs from level 1)
---
i think i understand why people get so upset about religion now.
---
Really stuck between druid or paladin healer. Do any of you have any thoughts on which of the two I should play (or maybe which one to play first at the very least)? Also professions for each. Thanks. Note: I have a guranteed spot in raids regardless.
---
God that's sad.
---
Quetion 1: Can someone explain exactly how tier set 2.5 fits into the mix of things? I understand it comes from AQ40 boss tokens, but why isn't it just called tier 3 and then we have a separate tier 4? 
---
Question 2: How big of a stat difference is there between each tier set? Can a Tier 3 wearer easily dominate a Tier 2 of the same class? As a Hunter, would I see a 20% damage increase with each new set, for instance?
---
Question 3: Where do the PvP high and low tier sets match up vs the raid sets?
---
To be perfectly honest I put maybe a week's worth of playtime in Legion, and most of it was spent on Argus, which isn't very good means for comparison anyway.  I played BfA for all of 8 hours, until level 114, and quit.  If there are zones in retail with darker ambience, I haven't seen any.  I'm basing my opinion on how the game was during cataclysm and mop, which you have to admit, were much brighter than Vanilla.  Obviously people shared OP's opinion and the nights were restored as you said.
---
How do people sign up for raids within a guild normally? Do you have 50+ active raiders and just have a sign up sheet where whoever joins first for their class gets in? Or is it a fixed 40 every single week?
---
F
---
Escape Artist is a bit better for BGs, but Stoneform is a lot better for world PvP. Mainly because fights are less frequent in world pvp, making it likely that stoneform's longer cooldown is a non-factor. Also because in world pvp just using stoneform, vanishing and leaving (or at least stalling by line of sighting and bandaging) is a legitimate tactic while in BGs that type of self preservation is almost always a waste of time that makes you contribute less to the team.

cant speak for every guild but we had a page one our guilds website. You would sign up when your were available and was down to the class leaders (or deputy) to assign spots. certain people had free passes guild leader/mt etc, things in our guild would eliminate you or put you at the bottom of the pile. Missing a raid, not bringing the required pots etc.

Depends on the guild. For hardcore progression guilds, they're usually the same group every raid. For semi-hardcore guilds, there's likely a core group that's definitely raiding every week and then room for adding on a few spots. For casual guilds, there's frequently either a sign-up on the guild website/subreddit/whatever or just some announcements and then a free-for-all when raid time rolls around. That last seems chaotic, but casual guilds are casual precisely because the members don't have the time or inclination to commit to being online for a raid multiple times a week. In my casual guild in vanilla, we frequently had to PUG a few roles on raid nights because we didn't have enough people join from the guild even though we had 80ish players who were pretty active throughout the week.
---
I've started reading the Warcraft novels and it actually quenches my thirst for the game. Instead of living on Reddit or forms I just pick up the book and start reading.
---
It's so cool to understand the history and lore about the events leading up to WoW. Currently on  Beyond The Dark Portal, so equivalent to Warcraft III I believe.
---
Same here!
---
Probably the same way you will feel thinking back about the time you spent in bars or watching football or whatever it is you like to do. People tend to forget that we all have those things that interest us and just because my thing may not be your thing doesn’t make mine any more or less irrelevant or time wasting than yours is to you. Furthermore, these are the times we live in now where people will reach their 80s, 90s and beyond having played video games every day of their entire lives and will think nothing negative about it at all. In the future, we may be questioning how our grandkids can stay plugged into their virtual worlds for their entire lives when ‘in my day’ we just spent our waking hours playing ‘normal’ video games...

AQ40 set was only 5 pieces. I can only speak from a warrior pov but it wasn't a pure tanking set like tier 1, 2&amp;3. It was more of a DPS tanking hybrid set that had a pretty good balance of tank stats and DPS. Not many warriors thought it was good for tanking, but it did have a lot of agility for dodge that I think a lot of tanks overlooked.
---
I'm not certain about other classes, but I'm quite sure after AQ, feral druids were able to compete for tank spots, presumably because their AQ set had the stats for it.
---
The difference between tiers was pretty big, I'm not sure exactly how much but it definitely made a difference.
---
When PvP sets were first released the blue set was about as good as pre-raid bis, and r14 was about as good as t2. Later on when AQ was released, the PvP blue set was buffed to be on par with t1 roughly, and r14 was buffed to compete with AQ40 gear. That being said the PvP sets always had less offense and more Stam than pve sets.
---
If they could add Benny Hill that would be a milestone in gaming history&gt;

Probably due to priorities.

Yes, I've removed the comment. I've read multiple threads and people seem to be conflicted on this opinion.

One wiki site actually mentiones a 24h cycle.

Q1: AQ to the community was seen as interim content and not a true 'step up' in diffculty, the bosses (until huhuran +) we cleared by most guilds in the first few weeks, compare that with BWL razorgore was nails due to the required organisation and vael ...well when your MT rage quits never to return says a lot. the itemisation at the time catered a lot no conventional specs druids genesis set is the prime example, a wet dream for pvp but utter crap for HC resto druids at the time further adding to the notion of it not a true tier

Additionally they allow you to pick up even more quest items, have more consumables handy and even keep off-spec gear such as a shield/sword when you gotta tank more than a few mobs.
---
Second best option would be to keep buying the most available white/green gear you can find from vendors to keep up-to-spec gear and stats.
---
How difficult would it be to level enchanting 1-300 at level 60? Planning on leveling with a gathering to make extra gold but would like to be enchanting in the end. Would I usually buy mats or solo dungeons to DE the drops?
---
They don't stack, just refresh uptime.
---
You’re the idiot, look up monkeynews and watch a good warrior do the kiting. People who make ignorant comments, blah
---
Upvote the shit outta this!
---
Sounds like a plan! I'll send you a pm when I get my headset
---
I’m going to have to disagree, have you listened to gabba?
---
Completely agree, doesn’t look any different whatsoever to me.
---
Eh, no one will be buying that during the first few months while most of the server grinding to 60.
---
I was eyeing prot/holy for leveling. But I honestly don’t know pala very well anyway, so it’s more like I like the idea of playing a healer that can return and has good support spells. I used to heal as druid and always hated that I couldn’t rezz more than once. It was a good challenge to push me to heal better, but sometimes you just can’t save everyone
---
Nah, it’s mandatory for pve tanking strongly recommended for dps, and very useful for healers. It’s an OP profession. As a healer though, you certainly don’t need it and it not profitable.
---
YouTube skarmtank and watch his pally tank video. You can be an underwhelming tank for 5 mans but you’ll go no further. And you’ll change no ones perception of paladin tanks in classic
---
What's rogue specific about that?
---
Q2: vanilla is very different beast pvp wise to retail. Skill and class reigns supreme here. A very skilled player Xsjado (troll rogue) went to school with me he rolled an alliance priest and remember seeing him dueling a T1 arms warrior while his level was 40 it took a while but he won. Gear is a boost but not a the rate in retails where its oh the guy in crafted pvp blues loses to the guy in rated pvp gear.
---
Actually, they are.

I made this comparison quite some time ago. There was indeed a time when blizzard screwed up the nights, but that bug has been fixed for a couple years. Furthermore gamma changes and bad monitors may have contributed to the feeling of the game being darker. 
---
Looking at the images some zones are lighter, some are darker, and some are much the same. Most of the differences come from color changes, such as in the barrens and tirisfal. There are some zones however that really suffered, among them Thousand Needles.
---
Now there is one thing I'm actually worried about in the game, and that's shadow quality and moon brightness. From the images I've seen it has changed. Shadows is mostly subtle and it's unknown if anything can be done about it, but the moon as lost it's brightness.
---
the heavy rain gives huge immersion to the zones, just makes them so comfy and mysterious. How could someone not like that?
---
How does eng help healers?
---
What?
---
Then you might enjoy it - was quite some fun with my GF while leveling together and sitting next to each other
---
If I recall, around the end wrath they started heavily updating the game engine. This included the lighting, I remember everything ended up being noticeably brighter after that.
---
They also got rid of a lot of the weather effects around that time, I don’t know why. Probably also something to do with the engine update and they maybe didn’t get around to updating that part of the engine.
---
They may have passingly justified it how people are saying, since people would complain they don’t want darker nights. 
---
I think it was only in legion or bfa that really went back and updating the lighting again, because it actually looks really good now. Like, it’s pretty dynamic just in terms of there being moving lights in the world. 
---
Also, there is a potion in game now, you buy from dark moon faire, that will make the night far darker than I ever was in vanilla. And so if you want an even more immersive experience than vanilla had, that option is available.
---
Enchanting at 60 is the best way to go, in my opinion. It costs too much gold to do it along the way since you're destroying all of your green/blue gear instead of selling it. At 60 you can just grind through most low- and mid-level dungeons really quickly for drops. You'll spend less time farming for those mats to level enchanting than you would trying to farm for gold for your mount at 40 or, worse, than you would running because you don't have a mount.
---
I suppose the night thing can be argued based on settings then. Most of those prints shows the vanilla side being slightly or more darker on most of the pics tbh. 
---
As long as we get old weather and the nights that we all want we should be fine then :)
---
No blizzard only has chance to proc clearcasting once per cast. Else AoE farming would be ridicules.
---
I like how seasons affected the weather too. More frequent fire weather and less rain in summer, etc. Felt like it took forever to unlock SMN. FFXI was a chore but damn was it gratifying.
---
Yes exactly.
---
Make a bank save all your greens you get while leveling. Dust comes from armour and essence from weapons. it is a very expensive profession, depending on your server economy buying the materials WILL bankrupt you.
---
My tip for you is to grind as much as possible between questobjectives, and questgivers etc. With that you get those invisible exp’s and grindingtimes will be much shorter (especially if you dont level i group...). 
---
I followed the guide on the nostalrius pserver up to lvl 40 before the server shut down, and found myself skipping some steps and grind instead because, sometimes the guide wants you to do some quests that are heavily crowded (mostly the ones which has the lowest questloot drop rate or slow respawn rate). 
---
In vanilla/classic grinding is something that just has to happen from time to time, either from mobs out in the world, or from dungeons. You guys have a killing combo for worldpvp tho, so you should have a lot of fun grinding in those neutral zones!
---
Not bad. This is done great
---
lmfao i think i check it everyday once or twice but really I have so many friends that are checking it I dont even have to lol
---
If by huge difference you mean minimal difference then I agree.
---
Just play a private server, if you go in with the idea that it's a perfect leveling experience then you're gonna be disappointed post 25. People who are as excited as you quit the fastest.
---
I think it depends on how well your main class can solo low-mid level dungeon content as that will take a decent chunk of time. 
---
One thing you can do is first level a bank alt to level 5 and learn enchanting. The alt can disenchant any level items you collect that way you are collecting mats as you level your main.
---
I'm going to do all of them, but I also plan on taking my time and being well rounded when I hit 60. If you're looking to get to 60 faster, then forget Tailoring and level your first aid. It's a critical skill for a Warlock (or any class, really) to have for end game.
---
Saying goodbye is always the hardest part.
---
I quit in 2011 and after playing from vanilla to Cata well
---
it was hard but had to be done
---
Can confirm, corny GM joke.
---
Yikes, another bad meme spec.
---
For paladin it’s engeneering.
---
Engenering bombs are the only thing a paladin can use to aggro mobs from a comfartable distance.
---
That and engenering is the best profesion in the game in pvp it goves you an extra stun and it gives a lot of extra dps for pve and is a good money maker om a fresh server.
---
Vendoring iron bombs makes good money on a fresh server
---
The problem with this picture is lol people getting 60  in 116.8 hours
---
also this applies to a strict set of classes, hunter/lock maybe mage.
---
It will end up being 200+ hours for everyone else. Also lets not forget this is if you are consistent and efficient 
---
I wouldnt even look at this for reference to be fair.
---
Your approach: leave her alone to experience the game unless she asks you questions. I would recommend not questing together right at the start. You'll have the temptation to just say, "it's over here" or "kill these things" or whatever. Part of vanilla is that you have to figure out what to do. Forget questhelper mods; they remove the connection to the world.
---
Also prepare yourself. Vanilla WoW doesn't mesh with everyone's gaming desires. She might just dislike it.
---
You should never bother with blacksmithing while leveling. If there are specific items you want to go for at 60, usually Arcanite Reaper (if you get it early) or Lionheart Helm (good luck with that one), you should level mining and save all your mats on a bank alt. Chances are you won’t bother skilling BS once 60, or you simply won’t get the patterns you want/need before they are obsolete. I’d recommend just keeping the mats needed from 1-300 and skilling it if you get them
---
The rest is usually just resist gear or very specific debuff items.
---
You can replace the sound with one that is easier to hear. Should still be possible in Classic.
---
Would farm Arrow - \[Doomshot\] from (LBRS Shadow Hunter Vosh'gajin) or Bullets - \[Miniature Cannon Balls\] from (Stratholme living the Cannon Master Willey). For either PvP montages or High end fights like KT &amp; C'thun. Should have plenty untill then if you run them once the releases.
---
Wow is going to be out before that will
---
THIS so much! Please Blizzard! We want weather effects!!
---
* At launch, don’t waste your time in the starting zone. Instead, resort to exploring the landscape for XP. 
---
* Vanilla is about the journey, not the end. Set your mentality accordingly.
---
*Chat with people whenever possible. My most memorable experiences is whenever I chatted with groups. Hell, that’s how I met some of my closest internet buddies today.
---
I didn’t get too far into the game, but I loved the world and the races and absolutely loved the soundtrack.
---
Its been fun playing on REDACTED. My guild killed Nef and Chromag for the first time last night. I know its all going away soon, but i've been enjoying the perspective on how the game plays at 60 before the real servers come out.
---
Reach? :puke:
---
This is probably what I’ll do. Thanks!
---
To be fair though this doesn't take into account that you get more xp for similar tasks as you level.  So yes while level 44 is the 50% mark for total xp to 60, at level 44 you now have a mount so can travel faster, and quests are giving 3-4x the xp that quests of the same effort were giving at level 5 etc...
---
I did the same crap working at my first job as a cashier in the super market in high school. I didn't have a car yet, so I had to walk across town in the 85 degree weather to get there and back, and all I wanted to do was get home and get back to the grind. Having that first job really made me appreciate time on WoW during that summer.
---
Healing aggro is a thing
---
I can only eat bowls of nails.. with no milk, what class am I?
---
My fear with this strategy is that I won’t have enough gold for a mount at 40 if I’m making no money on all the greens and blues I collect
---
I read on your site there that the average to 60 was some 30 days of playtime. Was it really that bad? I mean, my first and slowest in 2005 was some 14 days on a priest, and I thought that was bad.
---
I'm replaying Warcraft 3. I'm on the last level now. 
---
Idk why I thought this would hold me over till classic....
---
Warrior
---
That's actually the name of the Warcraft II expansion
---
Absolutely. I'm still a little worried about lightning and stuff, to be honest \^\^ If I ever get to testing the game, or once it launches, I'll probably make comparisons between different zones just to make sure. 
---
But at this point I'm happy if we get as close as possible. So as long as there's no major screw-ups (like Tirisfal lacking it's original sky color) everything's alright.
---
Bingo
---
1. what she wants
---
2. what you want
---
3. the one both of you want
---
4. play when you want
---
Play a tank or healer unless you are okay getting kicked to the curb in groups.
---
I Mained a hunter in vanilla and tbc and after a few years of always being the cockroach in groups (despite being skilled and geared) you are always viewed as dispensable, and you are.
---
I’ll never play another class that cant heal or tank.
---
Since my hunter I’ve created a Druid so I could tank or heal in TBC/WotLK and a shaman  for healing. 
---
It’s a great sensation to be WANTED and NEEDED in groups, so my $0.02 would be roll a class that can heal or tank.
---
In regards to leveling, you can dungeon basically at any point, and people who can’t find a healer will take in a lesser geared or leveled healer.
---
I am the epitome of 2 words.  What class am I?
---
Damn nice, even got some awards for it! I shoulda done it myself but I feel you deserved it more since you linked the original vid.  Thanks for sharing, let's hope Blizz sees it!
---
Master chief collection reach first
---
First of all, congrats on the dream husband-wife duo play!
---
Second, hmm... perhaps you should set aside a character JUST to play with her. Like, if she's not there, you're not playing on that character. That way, it could be like "Mr. and Mrs. Tauren" or something, and they're always together. Could make for a sweet-romance-RP, if you're into that. Your other characters would be separate, so if she quits or something you have other stuff you can play reliably and not feel bad for putting the pause button on that character. Honestly, that's what I'm doing with my wife. I'm getting her the free version when classic comes out so she can try it with me, and if she doesn't like it no harm done.
---
As far as addiction, well, you're both adults. You should have the willpower to know when to put a game down and focus on real life things. If not, that may be a sign of a deeper issue you shouldn't be solving on reddit, haha.
---
I will alternate daily until I have a favorite.
---
Thanks all for the heads up - I’ll probably go mining + engineering then
---
My wife and I played together in wotlk (a little different, i understand) and my strategy was pretty simple.... have a toon to play with her, and in case she quits\plays less\plays more (Wasn't an option at this stage in our lives) i always had my main "non wife" toon.
---
I obviously can't answer how much she\you will play, or how likely she is to gain\lose interest. Druid healing is okay for wpvp, and paired with a rogue should do great.
---
I wish you the best of luck, we're trying to figure out the same thing!
---
&gt; Shaman can tank
---
You lost me here.
---
Please don't spread this bullshit about shamans being able to tank.  While it may be technically true it's not practically true for anyone levelling one up.
---
Don’t roll a shaman. Being invited to groups every second and offered to be summoned makes the game feel too easy, like retail wow.
---
I stand corrected. Thank you!
---
Anno 1800 looks reeeeally good
---
Warrior (Fury) Main: Skinning when leveling, mining once have mount and BS later.
---
Bank alt: Enchanting
---
What is the most beneficial alt to level at this point, Mage/Hunter for gold or Tauren Druid (feral?) for herb picking &amp; alchemy/transmute cd?
---
Let her do the starting zone BY HERSELF. It's designed to teach you how to play and you might be a helicopter BF if you hang around too closely. When she hits level 10, it's fair game.
---
You're the literal mascot of every raid. You might get all the loot within 4 runs since no competition is around - which makes it super boring. 
---
Each role you do will do any other class as well, you will probably be fored into healing spec eventhough the other specs are viable as well, but you'll be surrounded by min/maxers which want to spare those 5 seconds on every boss kill.
---
These splitscreen comparisons are bad. Compare like with like.
---
I remember mine as well, 2005, Searing gorge: mind blasted a dark iron dwarf in the western tower overlooking the cauldron.
---
The only issue about this sub - personally - is people nagging, bickering and complaining about Blizzard and their decisions endlessly. Why can’t people just be grateful they’re working on reviving Classic? It’s a difficult task, yet people act like Blizzard is indebted in them.
---
Need if you need it, greed if you don't.
---
The exception are US servers, where you always need regardless
---
These redundant tasks made Vanilla what it was. It's personality,if you will. I guess the whole aspect of making game mechanics hard consequently makes the game experience more enjoyable/rewarding. I never felt inconvenienced by holding shift while playing, it was a game function. Back then, millions of gamers held shift without complaining. Nobody quit the game because they were forced to hold shift.
---
Get skinning and vendor leathers up to thick hide, it adds up. Get food from mages.
---
Agree :) As long as its in the ballpark it should be fine
---
Hi, /u/noobstan
---
[https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor\_system\_(pre-2.0)](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_system_(pre-2.0))
---
This site is quite comprehensive and accurate in explaining the system itself (regarding your last question of 12/13 vs 14).
---
Most of those I played with early on, at the launch of battlegrounds, had plenty of time to gear up already. The honour system was not released until a couple of months in, and the BG's took another couple of months. So most of us were MC/Ony geared to some extent.
---
Prior to BG's it was all ganking in crowded spots. Many useless hours spent at tarren mill trying to get unmitigated HK's on people roaming the area, seldom resulting in anything useful. I can't remember it making a huge difference with regard to reach rank 11+.
---
Most of my group, save for those aiming for r14, raided in the evenings 5/7 days a week, and spent some 6-8 hours the before/after on BG's. Unfortunately, we almost always had some 30-50 minute waits for each round, and that was often spent farming consumables or looking for world pvp kills.
---
Unless the honour system is tweaked as it has been on many private servers, job+obligations don't go well with rank 14. Rank 12 I'd say is however doable if you dedicate weekends and evenings to it.
---
Hope that gave you some kind of answer.
---
Haha the creator of the vid deserves it the most but I'll take it :D 
---
Ye lets hope the Blizz reps lurks here and sees the reception!
---
I had my own twinks back in the day in different brackets. Mainly because doing pvp in those brackets was pretty much impossible without twinking, or you'd just be in for a bad time.
---
&gt; There simply are not enough to sustain that. 
---
I'd argue quite the opposite. With all the hype and the knowledge, I strongly believe there will be plenty of twinks once Classic is a reality.
---
Also I never said I want twinks dead. I understand the whole point of it is to be able to stomp other undergeared and underleveled players who don't stand a chance. But having seen pvp at the level cap during multiple expansions, twinking just got really boring. I argue it's not only the exp lock change that killed twinking, but all the other pvp content in addition to the change. 
---
During Vanilla the pvp content was pretty basic. You either world pvp'd, or did BGs. Arenas and later on ranked BGs changed that. Suddenly you had this more or less level playing field in a pvp setting. Atleast I completely stopped twinking during TBC as doing arenas was just much more interesting and enjoyable.
---
If twinks were put in their own bracket, it would put them at a more level playing field and benefit the playerbase as a whole. You still have different level brackets and different "depths" of twinking, i.e. how much money one is willing to pour into the twink.
---
They already are.
---
After like 20*
---
So i was a druid and it was the early days so i did some dumb things.
---
1) I was running round in a resto spec, starting raiding and was full t1 with some craft boe epics before i started pvping. not that it mattered I would be tring to bear and cat people to death and wondering why i was losing every fight.
---
2) I didnt once, i hit the required ranks/reputation for the bg factions I got the designed for pvp gear. I would raid 4-5 days a weeks but prior to the raid i would in a premade pvp group flag carrying i managed to reach rank 13 fairly easily without trying too hard.
---
3) cant speak for this era as I was level 30ish when bgs came out and the world pvp scene died.
---
4) Pocket healers turn that bwl geared warrior from a nuisance to kite and cc into an almost unstoppable wrecking ball. it was symbiotic relationship, where you both could over power your foes in 2v X where as solo u would just die when u went oom. yes you both got the same honor.
---
5) see answer 2. but I and a paladin ran the premade pvp scene at the time so i was hardly ever pugging
---
Look, is it something most shamans are going to do? Probably not. Is it something an inexperienced player should so? Also a no. But it is 100% possible and might be fun for people to do as they play with their friends.
---
Just like in vanilla
---
Good point.
---
Classic graphics isn't going to capture how much my PC back then had to chug to get over 25fps on 800x600. And frankly, I won't miss that.     
---
So I'm just gonna slam it to ultra.
---
You’d grind AV rep until exalted, once you’d hit it you’d be at least rank 5/6 usually with a few very good pieces of gear, then start committing to wsg and rank up. For classic, raiders will obviously have the advantage since most raid pieces are also good pvp items
---
No it wont.  It'll be a different client install, patch '1.13.x' which is based off bfa's (originally legion's) client.  It won't be a case of loading up BFA and selecting a classic realm.  Likely it'll be a case of either a separate game in the launcher (most likely) or just a dropdown option on the wow game tab like you have with PTR vs Live.  But one thing is 100% sure, it won't be the same client.
---
I honestly highly disagree with everyone saying need. The appropriate response is to greed it unless you actually intend to use it. Need should only been done for things you intend to equip. Otherwise you’re an asshole.
---
Unpopular opinion but this isnt something people should be happy to admit.
---
Dont forget the loading screen tip "take all things in moderation even world of warcraft" 
---
Maybe you need to take a break from the internet in general
---
Also ask yourself why you want enchanting. There's certainly nothing wrong with picking up a profession just because you want it. But if you are looking to make money recognize the fact that you'll have to get rare recipes from either raids or from rep grinds. There are easier ways to make money if that's your goal.
---
It's amazing what we here in this community are asking for as opposed to the retail demands. Classic will be a hit. But only for the true wow enthusiast. I think the there will be a sizable pull from retail to classic as first but only the dedicated will stick around. I believe that the classic wow community will thrive. While the toxic and anti social crowd of retail will start to falter.
---
&gt; Also BFA and Classic will be in the same folder, sharing most of the game files.
---
No they won't be.  It'll be a separate install just like PTR is.
---
And then can't run the game because it's based on bfa client.
---
I’m almost too afraid to ask
---
dam thats amazing hope they let this in
---
I mean this bug was still in the game in Wrath.
---
this could literally be any class.  tank/spank, food/water, fear/dot 
---
shapeshift/escape, bubble/hearth etc
---
What
---
Seems like a post that could be solved by talking to you wife and figuring it out on your own.
---
I think choosing a server is going to be a huge shitshow to be honest.
---
Yea classic in its nature with how it works will filter out a lot of impatient spoiled people so at max level it'll be really nice tbh. Just getting to 60 is a feat in itself.
---
There are 2 flaws in the calculation.
---
(1) Earlier levels take way less time than later levels.
---
So in the beginning you are done after 2hours with the day where at the end u might need up to 5 or 6 hours. Not counting time to find dungeon groups and travel to the dungeon (hello SM as ally!)
---
(2) attention: exeggaration! By the time you hit 60 everyone else already is done with content a d quits. 
---
So ye the theorycrafting is nice and good worked out but sometimes reallity hits the theory quite hard.
---
do you pronounce it Gold-sheer or Gold-Shire  (as in shire from Lotr)
---
https://youtu.be/OJkaD3pmAs4
---
1. Happy wife, happy life. 
---
2. See 1.
---
It helps the raid as a whole. You use sappers, bombs, chickens, etc to assist with raid progress. It’s the key profession that actually has a direct impact on combat in a raid. Try-hard guilds will likely mandate all raiders are engineers.
---
&gt; In my mind BoEs were always an 'everyone-greed' ordeal. Regardless if it's a straight upgrade for one of the party memebears.
---
Why wouldn't everyone just hit Need then? This removes the chance of someone "ninjaing" it.
---
SPriest is great, but their Mana efficiency is their downfall. A lot of the time you won't have the mana to finish off the second person in a 1v2. Mages and locks don't have that problem as much.
---
Thanks!
---
Perfect! Thank you
---
I think I saw a video of one years ago, don’t know where to find though..
---
Hunter or Warlock
---
Either way, 1.5 of your bags (probably more) are either going to be filled with soul shards or arrows/pet food - either way, enjoy your grimped inventory for the rest of your life.
---
Go look at some videos for wow beginners, there's quite a lot of stuff that you can do (too much for 1 reddit comment) and knowing what you're getting into can be really useful
---
The youtube algorithm may screw me, but hey, that's what r/classicwow is for yeah?
---
the random slow downs are fucking annoying
---
Everything points towards druid, except this:
---
&gt;but you'll be surrounded by min/maxers which want to spare those 5 seconds on every boss kill.
---
Just screams Shaman and people getting picky with their totems.
---
Don't play a paladin, it sucks to be the best healing class in the game with insanely good buffs, the only magic dispel other than priests, fastest most mana efficient heal in the game, instant full heal, two different immunities, and more armour than most warriors.
---
I stopped playing path of exile because the shadows in that game made my GPU hit 100c, every other game it doesn't get hotter than 80c under load
---
Oh sweetheart... Seek help.
---
I plan to until lvl 5-6 then first bank toon has a job to do for first month.
---
Shamans cannot tank effectively, it’s a gimmick spec that doesn’t really work well and is much worse than all the real tank specs. 
---
Feral can definitely tank earlier content with ease and for dungeons they are often better than warrs. They will get murdered in the later raids tho
---
You could not turn off xp in vanilla
---
Lol if you played on NA during nostalrius you were only playing at night time too.  Was never an issue
---
No matter what and how you play, it should be fun with her if she is having fun
---
Mage is the best/easiest to 1vX. Rogue is runner up. Warlock is very capable of it, but you need to have the right pet out for the right situation. Hunter is good for 1vXing melee, especially rogues, but struggle with the likes of decent casters. SPriest and ele shaman are great 1v1, but have Mana issues so taking on more than one person might not be possible at lower Mana levels.
---
I like the lighting change, although the colours look over saturated? (but i am looking on a phone screen in bright sunlight
---
Civilization 6 is doin’ if for me!
---
Are you suggesting straholme exists on a different planet?
---
Breaking me down is in pat pvp 2 high warlord tho :p
---
In what phase will the debuff slots be increased from 8 to 16?
---
Exploring Duskwood with a torch was something else.
---
Monkeynews has mad skill, best gear in game and shows only his wins (as every PVP video of course).
---
Warrior is the hardest PVP class in the game. If you don't raid to get the good gear, you'll never go anywhere in PVP.
---
Damn pocket healers and wf totems ;)
---
Seeing this I'm happy to not see the old water textures.
---
this
---
Hasnt this been already answer by blue post? it will launch with 16 debuff slots
---
Don't try to rush to 60, unless that's your thing.  Unlike retail, leveling up is a huge part of the game and very fun.
---
Sometimes memes should remain dreams.
---
Neither of those are flaws in the calculation (I even specifically addressed #1), but reasons to not use the method. For #2 in particular, I said that I saw this as a method of engaging in low-level world PvP with all classes, not as a method to get to 60 quickly. I have very little interest in reaching 60, as the game radically shifts in a way that I do not enjoy once there are no more levels to gain.
---
I appreciate the criticism, however.
---
Actually, that's a legit good reason. I guess I had too much faith in most people.
---
I wish all the warrior proponents showed their PVP videos so we can see.
---
Yeah i know about Monkeynews but I want to see **your** video.
---
Indeed!
---
Shaman tanking is mostly a gimmick but if you have patient friends it can be something fun to do up into about ST/ Mara (after that it becomes a bit of a PITA).
---
 However Feral tanking is 100% viable in raids (especially since we are getting 1.12 pvp gear). Go look up Taladril. I've literally seen Feral OTs in MC &amp; BWL and there are some encounters where they are actually the optimal OT or MT including in Naxx.

---
I felt this way about my Baron Rivendares Charger, I rode that thing everywhere on my pally. The Black Proto eventually replace it but all through the end of Vanilla and BC I loved that freaking mount.
---
I really want this on classic.. just wow
---
True that.
---
Is the extra attack generated by warrior sword specialization affected by the "attack power weapon speed normalization" or not?
---
If you're lucky to get into the tutorial levels. Lots of people start out in hard mode at level 1.
---
Don't play warlock. 
---
In addition to farming consumables before raids, you have to farm soul shards. Then port everyone in.
---
Gorilla stomp is one minute CD.
---
Screech owl / bat is better for AOE threat.
---
Haha classic pvp video were indeed overly edited sometimes.
---
The board game? It's a good one. Try mage knight sometime you won't regret it
---
Holy shit watching this video gave me goosebumps. Would have gilded you if I had any to give.
---
I have never seen the two moonwell animations next to each other before.  I actually think I like the classic one more.
---
20 gold not 20 slot
---
like 3fps during AQ event
---
This :)
---
Haha! that is strikingly familiar! ;)
---
It shares a cooldown with your aimed shot, which is your main damage ability
---
4 hours to reach lvl 3 ? Medical assistance needed here, u/Joana_WoW just collapsed !!! :D
---
I've read "Rise of the horde" and all three books of "War of the Ancients". I recommend them all highly.
---
Yes! I love the old weather
---
I disagree
---
it's not Classic wow unless Duskwood is creepy dark at night.
---
Yeah I'd just caution figuring out what she wants to play. Just let it happen naturally and enjoy the time spent playing something together that has a special place in your heart
---
I’ve seen Monkeynews and my opinion still stands. A good mage shouldn’t lose to a warrior, not even monkeynews
---
whoaaa. This looks so good, why would they ever remove it?
---
Looks to me like you're just used to lower quality graphics. It seems more intense/dark because the visual range is much lower making background objects appear very dark.
---
It was pretty good. Although I'm a bit surprised how much of the video is spent on the first 20 levels.
---
It’s truly a disease like I have never had, not even seen before. I can tell you that I have it, and have it real bad too. I do the same thing as you, refresh reddit, the official forums, mmo-champion forums, and someone recently introduced me to barrens.chat. It’s sick.
---
Man, I'm so fucking happy to see this...
---
I was really afraid that Classic would keep some of retail's new-ish looks, even on "Classic" video settings. That they would just slap vanilla gameplay into retail looks. But it's just as I hoped it would be! The 1.13 looks almost (exactly even, maybe?) the same as 1.12, and the maxed settings are just cool immersive things we couldn't get back in the day due to our potato computers - denser grass and better lighting. Personally not a fan of the new water, but I can see some folks preffering it over the old one!
---
Damn, this is some good shit.
---
It's not greedy, it's scumbag-proof.
---
"This is an upgrade for me, please let me use it." and then sells it on the auction house.
---
Nope.
---
I wonder how difficult it'd be to make an addon like that. One existed back in WoD that let you change any zone to whatever you want but mannnn the lagspike it gave whenever you zoned into anywhere
---
I thought it launched with 8, and got increased later on. If it is like you're saying, then that is awes IMO :)
---
Yeah, it makes sense to, there are a lot of people who value their privacy and don't want that info out.  But in a game with so many players there's gonna be things that pop up, there are 3rd party threats, and being able to determine ownership can get real sticky when someone has shared their info with 8 different players, one of which some how leaked it to a gold farming company...  
---
When accounts get recovered, the original stealers occasionally try and get the account back to, so having the correct info can really save an account.
---
That's particularly fitting as I'm planning on rolling horde and Tauren gets +15 to herbalism.
---
And dungeons, raids and huge cities? AQ event was way too powerful for blizzards intro video. They had lag you can see so no wonder you had so little fps.
---
Yeah, the first 20 levels for priest was about 15 hours of gameplay for me (trying to work on my speed leveling so, meh) but I thought it would be cool to make a series reviewing these first several hours for each class to help people from alt hopping pre end game.  Thanks for watching homie!
---
Something tells me you will be disappointed when it comes out, you are raising the bar too high. The reason the game was so awesome in the beginning is because it was new, lots of exploring to do. You will see, its going to feel like a race and the feeling of discovery will not be there. It is still a great game, don't get me wrong, I am also hyped but it wont be the same as 2005.
---
Rude as fuck.
---
1. Will all usernames be new? Is it first in first served?
---
2. I plan to train a rogue, is it as slow as people say it is compared to other classes?
---
No. Goodness you love your false dichotomies eh?
---
There;s a major logical difference between "all truthful criticism is hateful" and "some truthful criticism is hateful". I believe the latter. You seem to believe that things that are true cannot be hateful, in other words "no truthful criticism is hateful". If that's not what you believe, then great, I'm glad you're not falling into black and white thinking. But from everything you've said so far, it seems like that's your position. If we can both agree that some truthful criticism can hateful, then there's nothing further to discuss.
---
Are you finally able to understand this, or should I break it down even further for you?
---
Actually back in Warlords of Draenor they massively improved how creature models load, and over the years their engine has improved Particles aswell. Due to those things being in the Classic files we see here, but with old models and particles, it should actually run amazingly. I hope someone gives us some FPS comparisons with a butt-ton of spawned in dummy NPCs
---
Compare the round objects, they are still round. Only the top and bottom of the "paper" are squished.
---
Thanks homie!
---
Yeah, not sure about 2007 having 2FA yet, if it did it will still in it's infancy.  I remember I got my token from a Blizzcon swag bag and still use it to this day for my Blizzard account!
---
That title without context could have gone very wrong lol!
---
You're right I'll add this right up!
---
Vanilla means vanilla.  No updates, no changes, graphic, stability, or otherwise.  Version 1.0, no fixes, all the bugs, or nothing.
---
I am really glad you enjoyed reading it!  I had a great time recalling all these great memories and it was fun getting to share them with the Classic WoW community!  I hope it helped ramp up the excitement about it's release for you the way it did for me! :)
---
i came here to make this same post!
---
i am restless, unfocused and withdrawn, the only game i think about is classic wow lol
---
i feel this buzz of excitement like im a kid and its christmas again
---
i felt too embarrassed to post it, but am glad you did!
---
just like some people said its rock paper scissors. Mage will eat a warrior, hunter will eat a mage etc. A rogue with all cds up in the open world is pretty scarry.
---
Internet speed back then wouldn't allow it sadly
---
Two of my favorite and most played classes in Vallina and TBC. The truth hurts. FeelsBadMan
---
let people enjoy things
---
people deserve an escape from hellworld every now and again
---
Yeah they are definitely completely viable in most if not all of mc/bwl
---
For sure. Just looking for ideas to manage it that haven't occurred to us yet.
---
lol what grandkids
---
They ditched night due to it being annoying if you only played at night. They've readded it in BFA to some zones, my Aussie friend absolutely hates how dark it always is... I love it when I wake up early enough to catch it though
---
&gt;attack power weapon speed normalization
---
I cannot say for certain, but most attack power normalization happened in patch 1.8 which is well after 1.12 so I would lean towards it not being affected by normalization. Also as a general rule, many things in vanilla weren't normalized (hence classes prefering a slow/fast weapon for certain specializations).
---
That is quite true; thanks :)
---
Let her play alone until first dungeon at lv 15
---
I'd personally put the first few talent points in wand specialization instead
---
This is great. I think this is what I was thinking but it was hard to formulate the whole plan. 
---
As far as addiction, she did play with me briefly during Warlords for a few months. And she liked it so much she hated it because it drew her in so intensely. We will have to keep talking about it.
---
Yeah? I don't prefer one to another I'm actually curious how what differentiates the two. I agree that Perplexity edits his video alot but he makes good CC plays. Having played a rogue I can agree that CCing multiple targets isn't all that hard to do but I guess knowing the timer on Combat of your adversaries to Vanish Sap is quite skillful. Monkeynews is something no doubt about it. I'd like to know more if you don't mind the time !
---
It was not that uncommon but I used to love my Hippogryph from Zangar march reputation. Rode it til I mostly ended WoW with MoP. It was just a big catch-up game with daily farming. Could get this better and cheaper on mobiles. :(
---
For not flying of course the tundra mammoth from Dalaran. Also incredibly useful.
---
1. While we have no offical word on it yet, that will almost certainly be how it'll work.
---
1. The first 10 levels can be a bit painful since you're not able to dual wield weapons until then. Getting to level 20 and being able to use poisons also makes it a bit easier. Overall it's not really that bad, but getting good weapons  can make a big difference.
---
Lol that's funny. Didn't even think of it
---
90's kid here.
---
you are not alone.
---
why watch someone else play a video game when you could be spending that time playing it yourself? 
---
its like when you'd go over to a friends house when you were a kid to play video games and your friend was playing a single player game. and they wouldn't give you a turn so you just sat there watching them play. that sucked. I'm an adult now, I don't have to put up with that!
---
Original vanilla launched with 8 and it was increased to 16 in a later patch (until becoming 40 in burning crusade), but that was a technical limitation as opposed to an actual design decision. Ion they're going to just make it 16.
---
\[For more information see the video explanation from blizzcon\]([http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=35m45s](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM&amp;t=35m45s))
---
Yeah, I would have too if I wasn't playing for fresh server build.  If you have a guild that are going to rush wands early, it will definitely be better for wand spec.  Unfortunately, it likes like I'll be my guilds wand bitch so I went the Life Tap route for better grinding pre-wand.  Thanks for watching the vid homie &lt;3
---
Oh yeah! I have that album, and The Wall (of course).
---
That is a dope comment sir. I'm actually aware of all of these things but having it laid out like this makes things more understandable for my brain. It also makes me want to keep on going Warrior. Yesterday I was having my doubts and thinking of going rogue but this reminded me oh how badass being a warrior is.
---
Yeah I feel you man but I think it won't be that bad. Roll what you want fam!
---
Absolutely.
---
Well they are ideal MTs for Patchwerk and Thaddius. There's also some good arguments around them being ideal MTs for speed runs given their higher TPS (although I've never personally been in a competitve speed running guild so I cant speak to this more than it being something talked about).
---
Never noticed the gnome, always thought it was the dwarf shooting the fireball...
---
No, lol.
---
Fucking Rogue.
---
There's another comment of from someone saying the complete opposite. I love both players I just don't know who to believe now!
---
This is the real answer. 
---
In addition to your Shadow Weaving (which is useful), you also take Mind flay and Shadow Word:Pain debuff slots which is sub-optimal and will get knocked off, just like you mentioned. To make it worse, 2 out of 3 of your damaging abilities can't crit (World buffs are way less powerful for you), and all 3 of them have bad spell damage scaling coefficients.
---
Mind flay is a short range spell which puts you closer to the danger zone and makes certain mechanics (like AoE fears) unavoidable. I am not even talking about the mana issues and the amount of effort you'd have to put in to stay afloat. 
---
Everybody wants to play spriest because they are very powerful in 1x1 PvP scenario. But don't expect a warm welcome in PvP premades (oom issue is real) or raids.
---
Oh shit no way, damn I am a believer then!
---
You'll be spending large amounts of time at reduced movement speed.
---
Your unique skill is unappreciated and a bitch to become an artisan of.
---
In raids, healers will meme about never healing you.
---
Your raid sets look so good that your peers envy you.
---
You are the most nerfed class in the game.
---
People in this sub are so quick to join another "modern wow sucks because x" train that they don't even bother to see if its true.
---
now im curious, why is there a demon hunter lookin dude in the mix?
---
I played till TBC with one 512 stick.
---
Yeah... that’s one of those professions I typically end up enjoying - especially finding all the quested recipes and hunting down the rare vendors... I practically had the achievement before that was even a thing
---
Feral tanking on Horde isn't as good as on the alliance, so if you plan to raid with your alt, I would say mage.
---
Also reconsider Engineering instead of Blacksmithing, it's almost a must have for DPS warrs.
---
You could also go Herb+Eng and not need an alt that bad.
---
Standard etiquette for valuable BoE items is for all group members to roll Need.
---
If one class absolutely needs a valuable BoE and they are my friend and rolling in a group of friends, I would insist they equip it during the run.
---
In a guild raid, I would have everyone roll Need, except in the case of BoE tier 1 pieces (bracer and Belt IIRC) where I would handle like a normal BoP item.
---
&gt; dungeons
---
fine, 155fps or something
---
&gt; raids 
---
Believe me or not, I was told to respec to balance and at least give aura. But well, no loot for me.
---
 &gt; huge cities
---
Stormwind - OK as long as I was looking down (not at the players)
---
Someone told me to look at the sky, would get a solid 18fps that way, but still I found it easier to navigate looking at the floor
---
Ironforge - well, I don't think it even once loaded completely. I recall asking people where is any repairer in Ironforge, because I ran all around and didn't see one - because they didn't load yet. After 2 minutes, I started to see them all around. Anyway, it was impossible to measure FPS with this amount of RAM I had, you know, wow used my 5400 HDD as RAM, so you can imagine. Nobody knows how much the actual FPS was, because it was constantly frozen. I recall having to slow down typing, because WOW couldn't process 3 letters per second.
---
Back then, I was dreaming of a 7600 HDD......... LÖL
---
I remember getting my first 2GB of RAM. That cost me all my pocket money savings for like 2 years, because it was some old DDR or something, 2 times more expensive than the common back-then DDR2. And I even had to tune down the timings, because my motherboard couldn't handle it and kept crashing. But well, it was 2GB. I was surprised how smooth everything was... even though it was just 18fps :Ð
---
Now, I hope 8GB plus SSD will be enough.
---
&gt; AQ event was way too powerful for blizzards intro video. They had lag you can see so no wonder you had so little fps.
---
To be honest, Apollo 11 onboard computers wouldn't even play the cinematic in 800x600. Now, even bitcoin miners are barely enough to run Windows.
---
yOu WoNt GeT IntO RaiDs kids actually think Druids are good for nothing. 
---
You may get overwhelmed being able to Tank, Heal or DPS in 5 mans up to lvl 60 and having to learn how to weave Cat/Bear/Human spells and skills together to be the best duelist in the game. 
---
Going Druid out of spite because I think half these min-maxers probably don't even apply the same sentiments in their own lives but want to gatekeep 15 year old content that was beaten by morons that had never played MMOs, on Dial Up connections with overheating onboard gfx cards.
---
First time I saw the rain in STV I half-expected to be struck by lighting and instantly killed
---
Hell yes Brother, Hell yes!
---
I've tanked my fair share of dungeons and even though some people aren't as good or smart. I always complete my dungeons with them part of the team. Gotta have patience and show the right path.
---
No its druid, "literal mascot" because they're an animal.
---
Druids are not very good at world pvp / bgs early on and you need to be very skilled to play them effectively.  Hunters are the kings of world pvp and do very well in bgs.  I would say hunter main and rogue alt.  Rogues with gear / enchants from a main character are amazing levelers and world pvpers where the other classes are still decent with gear.
---
Let her play whatever she wants, you can always make a choice that complements hers. 
---
Skilling feral druid allows for tanking and healing, so that’s a pretty good versatile choice. You can always specialize later on
---
Any of those would fit very well with the group.  Mage would be a better fit though.
---
Lol I think I invented that move in arathi basin (probably not lol) i used to mind control people at the lumber camp and make them jump off the cliff. I lol to this day just remembering. Specially funny if you shadowmeld and take them by surprise.
---
Oh man that rain in STV... makes me actually feel like im soaking wet.
---
Hunters are world pvp kings and have a lot of flavor alliance side.  A dwarf's stoneform is a wonderful utility but nightelfs can invis pot / cloaking divice and run to eat/drink in meld.
---
they actually have zone scaling now. almost every classic zone scales to 60 so you can do the story in every zone and you wont out level it.
---
Wow interesting. Thnx for a detail explanation. Yea 8GB and a SSD should be enough :)
---
I think I had 4x 256 iirc
---
Only the greedy ninjas are telling you to roll need. If its an upgrade for the party member and they need it pass it to them and watch them equip it. Gold is easy to make reputations aren't.
---
What's the difference between feral tanking on horse vs ally
---
Ele/Rest hybrid shamans are wonderful in pvp  and can be used to raid heal as well.  Paladins in solo pvp aren't very good and druids need triple the effort for the same results.
---
retail wow is doing it for me!  Honestly, I started playing retail again just because I couldn't stand the wait, lol.
---
Tbh when I was a kid (30 now) I enjoyed watching other people play games as much as I enjoyed playing them myself. One of the things I enjoy about twitch is I get to see how high level gamers do things and analyze how I can apply it to my own gameplay.
---
Watching other people play MMOs can be pretty boring in terms of gameplay, though, but I wouldn't have found out about Nostalrius if I didn't check up on WoW streams on twitch and see people trying to stream it there.
---
Those things are nice, but here are the really great points.
---
Enjoy the bulk of your leveling experience being right click, seal, judgment, seal, alt tab for 40 seconds. Second monitor on leveling a paladin should be a listed system requirement.
---
Paladin buffs are great, and there are many. Enjoy casting them one at a time and refreshing them every 5 minutes. It makes the 40 man raid experience wonderful as you spend literally 40% of your time going click, hotkey, click, hotkey down the list of 40 health bars you've jammed somewhere on your tiny allotment of pixels you call a screen.
---
I think he means the Online Magic the Gathering version.
---
Love Inky Black Potion, always so peaceful to have on while levelling or doing some grinding. [Also makes Spirit of Eche'ro look amazing!](https://imgur.com/aCzAAix)
---
Weird how I've not seen druid mentioned, you can root people whilst dealing with others with hots and dots, crazy amount of utility and having innervate lets you be a monster in sustainability.
---
perfect
---
I have not come across this need on all boe culture before. At least not on EU. Also bound to lead to bs need rolls "oops sorry thought it was boe, /shrug" 
---
Greed literally means you're rolling because you wouldn't mind it for the AH, alt, DE etc. If someone needs it then they have the right to have it, not difficult to verify. I'm fine with having the odd sly ninja 'off spec need roll because everyone else greeded' if it curates more trust in the group.
---
WOTLK only up to addition of dungeon funder. But otherwise I agree.
---
And as a Drain Life-spec lock, I hated being healed the MOMENT I tapped.
---
Healer I'm trying to actually help you a little, please stop wasting your mana on me!
---
/script PlaySoundFile("Sound\\Music\\ZoneMusic\\DMF_L70ETC01.mp3")
---
This needs to be present..
---
Hey /u/Joana_WoW any progress on an addon for your guide?
---
Im the only one who can can make cow noises and turn into a retarded sea lion. Fun 2 level but as a dps its hard to gear up and its not really usefull in raids
---
Halo
---
Idk about SM but I did a full run of Blackfathom deeps with me as a Hunter, a shadowpriest healing (Was DPS prior, but healer left together with the tank) and a DPS I don't remember, I think it was a warlock or Rogue.
---
It...Worked. Very slowly, one mob at a time, CC everything else, but it *did* work. I was pretty happy about that working out, as was the rest of that group. To this day, BFD has a spot in my heart.
---
&gt; and then alt tab for 40 seconds because you do no fucking damage.
---
And you miss or get parried a good quarter of the time.
---
Risk of rain 2 helps
---
If a game that hasn't even come out yet is ruining your life already, you don't have much of a life to begin with.
---
I just hot and forget locks.  Tap to fast and you die.  Your problem.  Tap a bit is ok but if you drop to 5% your already got a big incoming heal as my ui is telling me your losing hp fast.  
---
I’m not observing the game I’m observing where I stand and the health of my group/raid.
---
I don't want to sound nitpicky; but everything is a bit more colorful. I like color don't get me wrong I live in a city and everything is gray so :p But I don't know even though this is an upgrade I feel like some things are too flashy. I suppose it is because of the newer technology for reflection. For instance the poles look a bit more colorful in Astranaar and Goldshire which makes them look less worn out. Also the bricks of the Goldshire inn is oranger. Anyway minimal difference I'll get accustomed to. Also the old World of Warcraft logo with darker blue was better :)
---
Ive been through it before. It was frustrating but worth it once she calls you from work saying " can we just stay in and play WoW tonight"
---
You see, on one hand addons like Cata and MoP made bosses crazier and classes more difficult - on the other, they made the world easier to conquer than ever before and made most of the content braindead as well (except for release Cata HCs and raids, those were *dope*) while the game also catered to casuals in other ways via homogenization, shorter dungeons etc.
---
I really dislike that. A social, big open world MMORPG can still have cool and unique Boss mechanics and classes needn't be crazy homogenized, you can leave them unique and interesting but still give them more to do than "Frostbolt-&gt;Frostbolt-&gt;Repeat till boss is dead".
---
I'll most likely play Vanilla and enjoy it, but man, a lot of people seem to enjoy instant gratification and simple gameplay. If Blizz ever stops doing that without making a new game, the people get mad (See: Cata Heroics)
---
just dont forget about trash blade, sword of omen and vanquisher sword and youll be aight
---
Yeah see I'm fine with that.
---
A Drain Life pretty much healed two ticks as I leveled, so I'd always do that. Keeps my HP/MP ratio consistent.
---
Then I get Rejuv'd and Regrowthed or Renew'd and Flash Healed and I feel like a dick.
---
He said better, not equal
---
see you in a few months bby
---
To be honest all the other classes are completely boring to play in pve. spam one button and maybe press another to just keep up a buff or something. Have fun with your snore fest classes, probably gonna roll rogue, warr, or mage just because it's "high tier and meta." Learn how to have fun in a game bro. With good prep, feral dps can be on the top of the damage meters, and it's actually fun to play.
---
Wow that does look amazing!!
---
Here I was hoping it would actually be a *Deer* friend. &gt;_&gt;
---
Don't play a mage. Seriously. The incessant nagging for water, food and portals are nothing compared to the boring sh*tshow that is your role in raids. Spam one button, be it frostbolt or decurse. Do not play this class.
---
This blew my mind
---
I like it, just wish it had a no-dungeon toggle.
---
This is what I'll be doing as well.  I'm planning to have one character I only play with my group of friends, and one or two more to play when they're not online.
---
Are you joking?
---
When farm content time comes people gladly sit out. It just depends how big a roster you have.
---
unironically, yes, that is a demon hunter. Its some Easter egg thats in every single 10 things you didnt know about classic wow video but i forgot the actual details, but thats how i know about it
---
Suikoden 1, 2, and 3.
---
Why do people always list soul shards as incredibly bad things? Do people really hate playing a class that has good support abilities like summoning people or giving out healthstones? I'm genuinely asking since I'm planning on rolling a Warlock and those things don't sound too bad at all.
---
Half life 1
---
Half life 2
---
Half li... oh right... nvm...
---
Yeah but talenting sprint means that's you're going into the combat tree which isn't the best for pvp. Stone form is still king though for alliance.
---
This is still an ignorant comment to make. Agreed that he has the best gear in game for quite some time, and I won’t disagree that a mage “should” win every time. By the metric that they are essentially the counter to warriors. Also the fact warriors are in fact the hardest PvP class in the game in this context. I have main’d one for years since classic on most private servers. But to think warriors can’t just as easily get a two crit spike from HS and MS and completely delete a mage is somewhat ignorant to think. Also I’m not usually one to call another an idiot, it’s a game for fuck sake, but in response to you doing the same to belittle someone else. Don’t be another toxic player we have plenty in this day and age man. If you know more than the next guy then let it be known, without additional name calling. Unless he’s a prick of course ;)
---
What if you just popped your CDs in a fight then get ganked by 3 Ally? Will a good rogue vanish and restart the fight once his CDs are available?
---
It's not really all that different than people watching other people play sports or whatever on TV. Granted, I'd never pay a cent to watch any streamer play a game, but there have been times I've really gotten into watching someone else play games like Cities Skylines and Factorio.
---
Right. Had at least 2 dreams in the last week and i'm playing games on hardcore mode to prepare
---
Minecraft (new update coming out on Tuesday even!) and smash Bros are holding me over.
---
cata, mop, and legion
---
Druid  
---
Trained at: 60  
---
Cooldown: 30 min  
---
Requires: Elderberries (20 silver reagent)  
---
Puts you to sleep for 20 seconds, during which time you regenerate 25% of your mana.  
---
This wonderful new spell solves the druid mana problem!  You can start praising me for fixing Balance Druids.  (Please ignore that it replicates a level 35 potion with worse cooldowns and effect.)
---
Rogue ?
---
Gotta pad the heal meter
---
I didn’t like TBC and never played WOTLK....so I’d say many trios are better than these.
---
AOE
---
AOE II
---
AOE III
---
Easily one of the best ever.
---
If I recall is that Demon Hunter was planned to been released durning Classic/TBC but was later scraped and then emerged again to be added in Legion
---
Don't play hunter. Seriously.
---
You will never get to dungeon groups as a DPS, you won't get good loot, you will want everything because it can be upgrade for you but better suited for rogues. You will have absolutely sub-par damage through almost all raid content, there will be like 2 of you invited in the 40man raid and just because of one shot on some bosses.
---
You also have to manage your pet, you have to be careful not to pull anything with it or something or you will be called "huntard" forever. Wait, you anyway will be. Most of hunters are dumbasses and you will be disliked with them by everyone.
---
All that and for what, option for pretty much afk-ing the levelling, which is anyway fun otherwise and the most boring PvE rotation. 
---
Oh and one bag always full of ammo and you'll have to constantly buy it. And also you need engineering otherwise you're shit in PvP, so you'll be broke all the time.
---
This and the sweet Human crit sound. Nothing beats digging into an orc or tauren with a big MEEAAAAAH!!! or HU!!!
---
aaah! So that is where its from, i thought it originated from private servers. 
---
Lol I am not supprised Americans being this greedy compared to Europeans.
---
Was 1.8 really after 1.12?
---
There is an add on called vanilla guide, but you can find a plain text version of it on the github. If it’s your first time doing 1-60 and you don’t remember the location of any quests, you can probably do 1-60 in 8-10 days. Prior experience drops it to 6-8. Not the most optimized but still really good.
---
Bfa is the first expansion i havent even bought.  Played legion till i hit max level and unsubbed.   Did the same with wod.
---
Last expansion i played and stayed subbed was mop... and that i barely played.
---
Nothing about bfa appeals to me, which is sad because i always wanted an azshara heavy expac, it just came too late.
---
But ill be resubbed on day 1 for classic and probably never touch retail.
---
He’s an idiot cause he asked for 1 v x.  The guy responded with a 2 v x.   Cmon
---
Horde is the fastest bar none. Alliance leveling kind of sucks.
---
Hi, /u/BigGermanGuy
---
You need to know the route to get that. If you can route something out that’s easily obtainable. If you’re playing a hunter you can do 1-30 in 16-20 hours.
---
Every time I've seen a BoE Epic World drop be it in Vanilla or private servers everyone would freeze for 10-15 seconds and type some sort of  "Oh shit ! " while in Vanilla everyone always greeded even with the fear of someone with the ninja mentality ( **I ninja'd a Skull Flame Shield from UBRS back in the day this way** ) while i did it for my friend as he wanted it to tank with still a scumbag move however generally on private servers I've noticed if someone asks if they could need and equip right then and there people allow it ( T**his tends to happen more earlier on than later of a servers life** ) if people say no everyone hits Need. 
---
TL:DR - It's a grey area, Never hit need or greed the second a big ticket item drops attempt to talk it out if that doesn't pan out tell everyone to need on it and roll. People always go on about how vanilla is " All about the community " and " Muh rep " but sperg out when it comes to BoE epics and default to the douche mindset, Respect and trust go a long way in Vanilla.
---
Same, the old color vibe seems so much comfy.

I’ll be honest I didn’t even bother to read his comment, that’s my fault. I thought you were being an asshole for the sake of it so if that’s the case then alright. If they seem good hearted though then calm your tits man lol fuck em it’s a 14 year old game

You literally write "current version" not cata or mop.

This was so good I bought the sword.

---

You dropped this
---
Masterfully done!
---
We definitively need the old weather effects. On retail you currently get rain out of a clear sky, the fog needs to be there.
---
Preach.
---
Good idea. Several videos pop into mind that I can show her to give her options.
---
Options are good.
---
The time it took to get r12 or r13 was all completely dependent on the server.  
---
The time from rank 10 to rank 12 for me running in 100% wsg / ab premades was probably 12-16 hours a day, 7 days a week.
---
2 of those weeks I hit 99% on rank 11 because you have to be in the top 20 or so honor earners on your server, and we were on a high pop server with 3 premade warlord groups running against each other.
---
Losing full weeks twice at 99% killed my motivation for anything past r12.  I really wanted to see my guy named General so I poopsocked another week of 16 hour days, got my General title, bought my gear , and quit the pvp grind.  
---
I'm glad to hear some people only had to play nights and weekends.  If you're serious you might want to go for a low pop PvE server and hope there's less competition for the top spots.
---
Is Trispec a Memespec? I was under the impression it's fairly well established.
---
Let’s be real though, most people have a second monitor with YouTube or twitch going or are just listening to something other than the game itself the majority of the time.
---
I’m all for the weather though for sure
---
Where do you get that inky black potion? I need to get stacks of that for all my toons.
---
The extra swing is exactly that:an extra swing. It shouldn’t be affected by the AP speed normalization, but I don’t have proof to back up this claim. 
---
Keep in mind that before the normalization, *abilities* would scale from the weapon speed on top of scaling from the weapon damage (where slower weapons=more average damage), which meant slower weapons were way too strong. I don’t think it affected sword spec, because sword spec is nothing but an additional weapon swing.

Resistance gear is only necessary on a handful of fights. I think other posters covered them (Geddon, Ragnaros, Huhuran and Sapphiron). Also, a shadow resistance set would be a great way to embarrass every Warlock and Priest on your server in duels.
---
I think it's more important to know how to mitigate elemental damage without using any gear. You might not use fire resistance gear on Vael, for example, but you want your Paladins and Shamans to use their buffs for 60 fire resistance. For Onyxia, the entire raid can pop a Greater Fire Protection pot before the pull to make learning phase 2 much easier.
---
Those are just 2 examples of how you can cut out a significant amount of damage without sacrificing any of your raid's DPS.
---
I'm logging into the trial account and playing like 10 minutes every day...lol

Pokémon Red, Blue, and Yellow
---
This response thread is literally the only time I’ve ever seen it. Never experienced it once during Vanilla. Kinda sounds like there are tons of ninjas here.
---
Sounds perfect
---
lol so true
---
Ill just need to enjoy the experience while its there and temper my emotional attachment to my toons.
---
On opposite day
---
i would say paladin, did try the druid and had some things i really didnt enjoy. It might get better in later content i only raided in MC with my druid, but that was a pain and booring as hell.
---
Cons of druid healing in raid: 
---
- Same hots are not stacking in vanilla (like in TBC or later), which means you can have only 1 renew (for example) on 1 target, if another priest would use another renew on the same target, then it would just simply override it. In our guild only 1 resto druid could use hots on the tanks (the one with the most bonus healing)
---
- Hots are not so good in raid healing as priests/shamans/paladins most of the cases dont care about your hots just simply use a direct heal to heal up ppl.
---
- As regrowth cost way too much mana, your only way to go is using healing touch to heal ppl, now as the max rank healing touch has a 3.5 cast time (i think even with the 0.5 sec talent) it wont do much against the rest of the healers whos playing with 1.5-2 sec cast times, which means even your healing touches will be useless if u dont lowrank it.
---
- you find yourself in a position to spam rank 2-3 healing touches on ppl all the time and sometimes throw a combat res
---
- also for this low rank healing touch spamming tactic you must reach the maximum bonus healing you can gather to maximize the healing those ranks are doin, so your preraid bis items will be purple/pink/blue cloth items, what is a huge con if you like to watch your character and enjoy the awsome gear you reached, also T1 druid is useless
---
Cons of paladins in raid:
---
- buffs + reagens, even the greater blessing is only 15 minutes long and you have to buff every single person with it, not like in TBC where you could buff 1 class in the whole raid.
---
- T1 is kinda useless too as i heared
---
In the same boat.  Will be maining a Warrior with Hunter/Lock/Mage alts that I kind of rotate through to keep them on rested XP.  Also a Druid that I play exclusively with my wife.
---
The way I see it, if she catches the bug and wants to play for real, I won't need to group with her anymore.  It's either something we'll have fun doing together, but always is a side-project to my main, OR it's something she'll become enthusiastic about as well, in which case I'll let her forge or own journey to 60 and only provide help from my main if it's needed.
---
Dang it! Stole my comment!
---
Iv pretty much always had a beefy computer but during WOD when you would have the legendary ring with hero and mages with crystal sometimes I swear the game would just freeze.
---
&gt;At launch, don’t waste your time in the starting zone. Instead, resort to exploring the landscape for XP.
---
 yeah just to have no gold to train skills or have no gear at level 6, when its time to go back and quest again...
---
The paladin is the slightly stronger healer in both PVE and PVP (and can rez) so if healing is what you really want to do then I think paladin is the better choice.
---
I think a vanilla druid is really more of a niche pick. The primary things it offers over other healers are:
---
* Can tank 5-mans
---
* Good flag carry in PVP
---
* Stealth with heals allows for strong world PVP and 1v1 potential by resting
---
* Unique Utilities (battle-rez, innervate, nature-swiftness nuke heal).
---
* Strong solo potential (2nd only to hunter)
---
If those aren't really your jam, then you're much better served with a paladin or priest.
---
I'm in a similar boat. I really like the idea of playing a paladin in Classic, despite maining a holy paladin in WotLK and hating it, which confuses me.
---
Nonetheless I'm still torn between Shaman, Paladin, Druid and Warlock. I kinda really want to finally play dps for once in my entire WoW career, but I feel so useless not healing or tanking.
---
In my head-lore the oranger bricks are because elwynn gets its supply of clay from redridge.
---
Tell them you are enhancement.
---
Troll mage with herbalism. Real gamers will know why.
---
I had a friend who played the ptr that had the weather effects like rain. There was so much hype and excitement, they dropped and it was such a cool feature at the time. Definitely added to the immersion.
---
I'm looking forward to this almost as much as the game itself.
---
Well a pretty good portion of the gear is from raiding and dungeons, so probably not
---
Those kind of people enjoy the idea/concept of Classic. They don't really want to play Classic.
---
oh, hah ofc
---
Just get an owl with screech. Better aoe tanking with no cd
---
No you wont stand a chance against others. If there was pvp at launch then maybe it would be a diffrent scenario.
---
WotA is kinda meh but RotH and the sequels up to Lord of the Clans are amazing reads.
---
But interacting with humans (not online, obv.) fucking suuuuuuucks. I'm not even joking. It drains me of everything and is the reason I want to do everything alone.
---
What class are you playing? Typically stamina is king in pvp, so gear with more stam is prio, for the most part. Other "bis" pvp gear is really item based and dependent on whether or not it's on cd, or what you're attempting to do in pvp. Like for example, you might want rocket boots on, goblin rocket helm, reflector trinkets, etc, over traditional gear.
---
Almost! Aoe3 was garbage, so I go with Aoe - Rise of Rome, Aoe2 - Age of Kings, Aoe2 - The Conquerors.
---
The new City of Heroes private server (and all of the related fallout/ drama that's been surrounding the previously "unknown" source code from 7 years ago) has been a fantastic distraction, lol
---
No problem! I'm thinking of reading these books myself. Are they all part of the same series? At this rate, I'm not going to make it to the summer if I don't find something to keep myself busy!
---
I mean, the first 3 crash bandicoot were not bad.
---
Same for Ratchet and Clank.
---
I appreciate you a lot
---
I actually REALLY like the new rain effects on retail, but I do wish they were stronger like in vanilla.
---
Everyone use to do this. But... did you ever mind control people OUT of the BG my walking them through the exit portal at their main? ;)
---
im in this camp right now
---
Water totem quest chain.
---
Wouldnt you have to be close to their base? How did you managed to not get killed?
---
Launch  for you will be awful dungeons being the only readily available gear available, once the honor system and BG come out you have the opportunity to earn rep and gear from pvp. Until such time you living on BOE world drops and crafted gear.
---
At least get the blue gear from pvp. After that, you’ll need a weapon that you can find either in the ah, or craft (warrior can get the arcanitr reaper for example).
---
That’s decent enough
---
You typically give enchants out for free while leveling, or have people bring you mats, still for free. You won't really make money, at all, other than the random tips you get, which might recoup some of the cost of materials.
---
My best bud / coworker are already planning our time off together lol. So excited to relive the glory days. PvP server, troll hunter(him)/UD rogue(me) duo, same as before. For The Horde!
---
Which means it was also in classic?
---
Wtf! Same here!
---
try which class you can handle and dont wipe the raid 😊
---
J mean, if it's not common you will be one of those guys that sells the rods to the enchanters.
---
It's hard to appreciate anything in life when you've already tried heroin.
---
You cant really expect to finish much elite content with a hunter pet as main tank.
---
Ele shaman has way too high a skill floor for you to manage.
---
Aside t fact you'll actually be healing in pve content and responsible for killing/buffing/ and healing in large scale PvP, actually acquiring your gear and convincing other spell casters that sp ring or trinket should go to you over them  is nothing short of an uphill battle.
---
Why don't you try something simpler like a mage DPs instead? Sure you don't get mutha fucking lightning, and god tier melee buffs, but you'll face a hell of a lot less adversity.
---
Why even bother, its not like you'd make it far as elemental, anyway.
---
"Raid or Die" as the vanilla saying goes.
---
ding ding ding!
---
That doesn’t help me one bit. I don’t want to get into fights just following other people around. I want to go into each fight knowing EXACTLY what I need to do as my role.
---
The game is about powering your character up and grouping in a dungeon is about teamwork and helping each other power up. Every man for himself and screw everyone else is the mentality of modern wow that has mostly ruined the social aspect. 
---
Though I did forget to qualify that epic boes are different because they are an actual gigantic, somewhat game altering chunk of gold. Pretty small amount of blues that will sell for enough gold to be deemed more impactful than the upgrade it would be for someone if they actually need it.

Find out which server Monkeynews, Perplexity, Stormx, etc are going to roll on. They are all EU and pvp oriented, so their servers will be guaranteed to last.

You're doing well. Even as a WoW veteran who has played on and off since Open Beta, I enjoyed it :D
---
I decided to write myself a personal guide of leveling notes. I now have a solid plan to level 30, and an outline to 60. I have a professions plan mapped out for a main character and a bank alt. I listed addons, macros, keybinds, Talent Point progression, 10 level itinerarys with notes for each location, a list of levels with notes of when spells become available. It turned out to be a very fun task so far. I have combined tons of knowledge from videos and guides. When I watch a video I just keep my notes ready and add tips to it that players have found over the years. I thought I knew Vanilla, but I was wrong. This time I am prepared.
---
1. Int is super valuable when leveling as a feral with a partner, take stamina afterwards atleast to have a tank gear ready, since she will be stacking those agi and strength pieces the gear that is left is still really good for you. 
---
2. Impossible
---
3. It would be best to simply accept that your druid is tied to your wife, that will make it easier with the entire leveling process and emotion connetion to the druid, it wont feel like you are only helping her (as you will be at the same level) and only if she ever says she is going to quit it forever will your druid be released from her shackles.
---
We are leveling druid  - mage, my partner played nelf hunter on private servers, this time she really wanted to play nelf mage but finally abandoned night elf characters for the mage class fantasy, she said that she'd rather be a spellcaster and hand out water and portals then a melee as throwing spells felt more right then stabbing people in the back. If she does not like rouge be open about switching and make sure to include what would be the differance between playing a rogue and for example a hunter. Adapt the plan along what she enjoys playing, so even if its awesome to have dubbel stealth if she does not enjoy her class enough it might be better to reroll and cut your losses early, we leveled a warrior to 19 before she rerolled, I releveled a druid with her ner character and it feels like that was the right decision.
---
On all "oh lets run left here" or "left get to that point on the map" or "I want to see Thrall", take her up on it but kill most green - orange mobs you run into, we kind of ran out of quests we wanted to do and i know that if we had bypassed less mobs (to get to cool places or explore on her whim) we would not have had that issue. If she wants something that is kind of unobtainable explain why it would take a long time, when you can do it in the future and give her something fitting in return, like visiting Tyrande or the boy king in stormwind.  If there is something I'd do again is to talk less about efficiency, sometimes i responded to adventures with explaining how long time and what we would loose from doing it, in hindsight that was stupid as fuck, while she deserved to know its an investment she often did not want to be a hassle and therefore abandoned the plans when she heard about the amount of work involved for her request even if we kind of could add it into the route a bit later or kill a lot of mobs on the way.
---
Ah, the ole shrine of tig o bitties.
---
I would say paladans can tank 5mans too ;) 
---
Otherwise right on!
---
It's ok, it's the trend in this sub to hate on retail, they don't care if it's true or not.
---
Need the old day/night cycle back and we need the weather effects!!!!!!
---
Tough call as they both have their own upside and downside.  Druid will prob have an easier time in most things outside of raid healing(i.e. farming, leveling, travel time etc).  Pally however is a raid healing monster especially when single target healing with mana efficiency.   Another perk for pallies is the ability to use all types of armor for int/+healing gear.  Also the pally mount at level 40.  
---
As far as professions go I'd suggest deciding whether you need gold making professions to start but alchemy/herb is always a good choice for raiders.
---
it's stupid because it's not true, they removed the option when they stopped supporting dx9 (dx11 never allowed you to disable them)
---
Just like that I had hope and you took it away.
---
Back when Blizzard made good expansions, based on good lore... After that, only stupid dragon (and destroyed Azeroth), KungFu Panda land, Orc conspiracy....
---
Exactly my words. The old weather effects are soooo great and better. Day/night cycle is better too. Pls Blizz do it. I do noet want to have in clasdic that stupid Legion/bfa weather or day night effects. Thx.
---
What class are you going to play? Which spec?
---
I guess it depends how stubbon you are on dungeons. Some of your best farming is from dungeons you can solo (Dire Maul North, Mara). Not only will this get you great gold, it'll get you some decent gear since you won't be doing any group content.
---
You'll likely go as far as your pvp rank takes you. If you grind to rank 10 and get the blue PVP set, you'll be competitive. Hunters do fine in early content\low gear, but as phase 3-6 especially hit you'll see a huge dip in competitiveness most likely.
---
Go mining\engineering - you'll need all the help you can get.

Hi, /u/TogarTheGreat

If i remember correctly astral essence's were the bane of my life when i leveled it in vanilla. The levels which items can produce these is narrow and around the same time people are frantically selling everything to buy a mount :(

That's right! I'm the \[spoiler\]warrior!\[/spoiler\]\[spoiler\]/cry\[/spoiler\]

Yea dude I feel the hype aswell!  Im really interested in how they are planing to do the realmsetup like crossrealm stuff (hopefully not) and what languages it will be... Im living in germany and hope they'll do european realms!!

Not a big TBC guy - Vanilla is the one.  All expansions are just not good enough.

---
"At 41yo you're not supposed to play games for children".
---
Of course it isn’t vanilla.  It can never be.   I think this is a very honest attempt to match the original game.   Theyve made many changes to try and replicate it as best as possible.  Unfortunately they can’t copy past every single thing times are different. Some things like sharding have to be utilized.  I just hope they are utilized right.
---
I'll just take the one on the left thanks.
---
Who the hell are you? Definitely brand new to the classic scene. Blizzard has already proven their loyalty to the classic cause. Get your pessimism out of here. WoW classic will be the best thing Blizzard has put out since vanilla WoW. 
---
Loot trading has been resolved. It’s only there for raids. Meaning, if you get a guild like vanilla raiding required, you won’t even see it. 
---
Sharding? They’ve said it won’t extend past starting zones. It won’t affect world PVP. 
---
Blizzard is dedicated to recreating the experience. If they weren’t, we’d already be playing a butchered version.
---
Better? No. But on par as equally epic?
---
Mass Effect 1/2/3.

Fallout 1/2/3

Neither is a bad choice, but I am partial to the dwarf because stoneform is so strong. The ability to line of sight, clear dots, and re-stealth as combat drops is super powerful because it essentially allows you to redo your opener. And since diminishing returns barely exist in vanilla, that extra cheap shot and kidney shot opener is enough to trivialize many fights that other rogues would lose.
---
I totally agree. We aren’t playing on big beige box monitors with 10 FPS anymore. Vanilla with a face lift is going to be so great
---
WC3 Vanilla BC
---
It wasn’t the story, honestly wouldn’t care to play through the expansions but I’ve chalked it up to changers to dungeons and insta grouping. The 3 tier raids. The talents, idc I liked my little reward each level. The socializing incentives. And annoyed at no toggle mog system &amp; mass amount of mounts. 
---
Ultimately gameplay not WoW to me so can’t bring myself to play it through.
---
no

Omen was a TBC addon, i havent seen Omen backported for vanilla yet. The vanilla threat meter was KTM, but youre right. I will also be maining a warrior come classic, tanking in arms/fury spec while leveling. Hope people understand what they need to do, for me to be an effective tank.
---
If they dupe the group then that’s ninja looting and getting blacklisted for being a scumbag was a very real thing. And like I said, that was pretty rare anyway, but let me pull out the world’s smallest violin if you lose out on the chance to get 20g after wasting 10g on posting fees trying to get a haul. Dungeons are for powering up and helping your teammates power up even if you don’t know them, go farm gold if that’s what you’re after.
---
Epic BoEs are a different beast obviously though as they can actually sell for a game-life altering amount of gold and that gold will be far more impactful than the upgrade would be for someone. Even amongst a group of rl friends I’d say an epic should be all-need unless everyone is already rich from farming or something
---
+1 aoe 3 sucked, don't think we ever played that more than at one LAN and went back to AoK.
---
Yeah, judging by the varied reactions it seems really dependant on server population and competition. Did you do your grind before or after they relaxed the requirements for the top ranks?
---
Going for a low pop pve isn't an option, definitely want to be on a pvp server. Going to be hard to judge which one of those will be low pop on launch. Will just have to give it a shot!
---
hes wrong, trolls is arguably the best race for spriest. shadowguard also works vs ranged btw and is a much stronger spell than dp.
---
better game .... now thats very hard
---
better trio ... lol easy
---
Ive mained a warlock since tbc. 
---
You use one soul shard per summon, and 1 healthstones per.shard. there are no summoning closets or healthstones Wells. 
---
You have to individually trade healthstones to people. 
---
With that being said I love warlocks too much to play anything else. ;)
---
I'm rolling a druid to accompany my missus. There's also a plan to run every quest in every dungeon together. She hasn't decided what she wants to roll but she can be whatever she wants and my druid will pick up the slack. We're not that bothered with raiding, but seeing as my own end game goal is T0.5 I got plenty to do without it.
---
I'm not new lol. I literally played the game in vanilla and was there in the threads discussing this when Blizz had Nost shut down. And I did just watch a nice bit of theater where they "affirmed" their commitment as well.
---
That's great, if you take them at their word. I don't. So I'm left waiting on the actual game to be in a playable state to properly judge it.
---
Blizzard has no loyalty to anything except the almighty dollar. Understand this. They are a business. They aren't doing this for fans. They are doing this because some bean counter figured up it would actually be easy money on the table, like people have been saying for years.
---
The devs making it? Sure, they may care. But one word from Activision and they WILL implement whatever feature they are darn well instructed to or they would be fired, up to and including a cash shop and token.
---
Perhaps I'm quite cynical about the whole thing, but I have ample reason to be.

I'm leaning towards mage but I'm wondering, how do mages handle rogues stunlock?

Tryhards galore, fuck all faction uniqueness, a dead promise (Purified Ashbringer), even clowner leveling clownsuits and paying exhorbitant amounts of gold to be able to fly so high over one of the most beautifully designed maps that you only see a skybox and fog beneath you.  
---
...At least the music was good
---
Sharding is being added because it does help keep servers from lagging out and crashing. 
---
My position is probably a bit extreme, but I'd prefer some of that to altering the orgiinal experience one iota.
---
This is a choice to improve latency and stability. They don't HAVE to implement it. The original game didn't have it. You know what it did have? More subscribers than the current team ever will :)

I hope I am not the only one but I really hate how much darker Classic looks compared to Vanilla. Any darkish areas become very dark in Classic. There was always a more open and lighter feel to the color and lighting aspects of Vanilla and the darkening really messes with the feel of Vanilla IMO.  
---
If it doesn't bother you that's great, it just sure bothers me.
---
Need on BoE to sell is ninjaing, and an asshole thing to do. If you intend to sell any type of drop at all, press Greed.
---
Need on a BoE to use it is perfectly fine, but it is then perfectly fine for the rest of the group to demand that the needer equips it so that it is bound and can't be sold.
---
The graphics in the beta were excellent. The art team perfectly walked a very fine line between cleaning up the rough edges of vanilla while completely preserving the style and feel of the game. Very much agree with you.
---
The problem is you will literally spend an hour or more before the raid just farming soul shards because the other raiders are simply too lazy to walk to the raid themselves. You will have to dedicate 1-2 bag slots solely to hold those soul shards. Remember that in vanilla bag space was about half of what we have now. A 16 slot bag was "big."
---
More people need to see this. It's truth. Everytime someone sparks up one of these threads, it convinces countless people that fake news is truth. When really it is a false narrative that has been debunked at every turn.
---
Shoot me in my face. God that one sucked.
---
Even though I kept playing post-LK because I had a good time with friends I've always hated the streamlining of abilities. At least BC and WotLK added to and balanced the stuff your class had before. Come Cataclysm and if your character had ANYTHING that didn't add to your rotation BAM it's gone, no fun allowed. Also it completely killed Thrall for everyone.
---
I'm leaning towards mage, how do mages handle rogues stunlock?
---
I'd say do a little research on how you're going to spend your talent points while leveling up. Respecing can easily get expensive and you're going to want to save up as much gold as you can to buy your riding skills ASAP. 
---
For example, as a Paladin, I plan on leveling with points primarily in Ret and respecing at around level 45-50, which will only cost me 1 gold.
---
I remember my wow playtime was similar to my time played on mw2 multiplayer so ~35 days.
---
Last time I played pally was on original Nostalrius and some of the talents were kinda bugged, and I also went full prot so that I could AoE farm with all the Thorns type effects that I had.  That said, if you're looking to be more of a hybrid, [here's the build](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#sE0uzxZVhtIxzm), and here's the order I would suggest:
---
5/5 Div Str,  5/5 Div Int, 1/1 Consecration, then into Prot
---
5/5 Redoubt, 5/5 Toughness, 1/1 Blessing of Kings, 3/3 Imp. Righteous Fury
---
After getting Consecration and Imp. Righteous Fury, you should have no problem tanking.  In the build I linked you'll notice there's one more point missing.  That's so you can either take Divine Favor in Holy to be a better healer, or Holy Shield in prot to be a better tank.  If you end up going Divine Favor, I'd say it's worth it to drop 1H Weapon Spec from prot entirely, and just focus on more Holy talents, like maybe Imp. Blessing of Wisdom or maybe even Spiritual Focus.  If you're unsure, or you think you're about 50/50 on what you wanna do (tanking and healing), I'd say just go with Holy Shield.  It makes you a much better tank, than Divine Favor for a healer.  I think the most important part about healing is making sure you get a different set of gear for healing (or at the very least a couple good pieces of healing gear to supplement your main gear).
---
Spiritual Focus is good for PvP of course, but I actually also took it for my deep prot build because when you're AoE tanking a shitton of mobs and they're all hitting you and doing tons of spell pushback, you can't hardly get a heal off on yourself, UNLESS you have Spiritual Focus!  Imp. SoR I have no idea.   IIRC it was one of the broken talents on Nostal, so no one took it. Another thing about Nostalrius is that the damage from Consecration scaled off of your AP... which is fucking retarded, and so we only really ever used rank 1 Consecration, as it was just more efficient mana wise.  But even without that "bug," I'd say there's probably still some validity to only using rank 1 Consecration for tanking.  Maybe open up your pull with your highest rank Consecration, when it wears off start spamming rank 1?
---
It's been a while and I wasn't an amazing pally by any means, but that's my 2 cents :D  Sorry for the novel but I figured you might be interested.  Also, don't take Improved Hammer of Justice;  when I hunt you down in WPvP it will make our interactions much faster &gt;:D
---
Actually, on the EU realm I played on a couple of months, there were a lot of twink dueling outside Orgrimmar. It was very cool and people were very friendly. It’s was a nice community
---
But then they changed BGs back to being XP off player alone, and lvlers alone in battleground, which kill it
---
Some might think twinking was stupid, but it was some of the most fun I’ve had in WoW in a long time. It reminded me a bit of vanilla, where you had a good geared lvl 60 character, and could dominate all the freshly dinged 60s, combined with characters having less skills at those lvls, so it seemed more vanilla like (some would go a bit too far with twinking for my taste, but keeping it loosey goosey, then it was fun)
---
I'm really on the fence about this. On one hand, I really want the nostalgia to hit me like a train. Also, I really want the spirit of the game to be preserved. 
---
On the other hand, what if the improved graphics make the great game even more enjoyable? 
---
I'm actually curious to see if I'd enjoy classic with modern wow graphics and animations. At the very least it'd be a pretty novel experience. 
---
All things considered, I'm leaning more towards leaving it as it was, however as long as the intense weather effects are left in tact then I'm happy. One of the worst things they ever did was downgrade weather effects.
---
AC is one of the most disappointing games in history to me. The first AC was so amazing for it's time but then the second one was a carbon copy and I feel they never improved with each game. Same old missions every game.
---
Yeah, it is so weird. Need is for upgrades to your character, greed is for selling, off-spec, alts and such. BoE does not change that. If the group demands that the Needer binds the item, that's a very reasonable demand.
---
MtGOX?
---
There's a vendor for them through the Darkmoon Faire portal. I think they cost 3 gold each and last an hour or two.
---
Halo: Combat Evolved
---
Halo 2
---
Halo 3
---
&gt;Devilsaur Leather can potentially be 300g per hour depending on the market. You would need to be in control of the spawns though.
---
Is this a thing you expect to be able to do in Classic?
---
Hi, /u/richterlevania3
---
Stellaris helps for me. That and YouTube videos. ....videos about WoW classic.
---
not wrong lololol
---
Need on something you don't need. That's ninjaing.
---
Which zones are you seeing rain fall out of a clear sky?
---
Cool, I'll have to pick some up next time the DMF opens.
---
I agree.  The specific look of the game is kind of a tertiary concern to me.  What I want is the slower, more rewarding gameplay and the sense of community it fosters.
---
&gt;We wont see def-stacking in Classic as we saw in vanilla because the cieling will be higher
---
They are changing the defense cap?
---
The best way to do it is to roll normally (roll Need only if it is an upgrade for your characters main spec), and then demand that the Needer who wins (if any) binds the item on the spot.
---
&gt; 7. Dungeons
---
Dungeons with randoms generally has a very high rate of failure and terrible experience when done without quests. There is no single item upgrade from dungeons in the game that efficiency wise justifies gambling with your time as much as running dungeons. If you're desperate for something critical like a weapon on a melee class, buy one. 
---
However, they are very fun and a nice change of pace from doing quests. There tends to be at least two players in each dungeon group who are way too low level, so to compensate you should be going in right before most of the mobs turn gray to essentially carry the whole thing. 
---
I do collect all quests for the good dungeons, but again, it’s up to you whether you feel like bothering or not. Depending on how actively you play, rested experience more than makes up for the potential loss in experience from dodging dungeons.
---
Im very happy to hear that, i always hated that way of playing, just felt wrong to sit down. All the more reason to go arms
---
Stamina is very important in pvp. For many classes the pvp set will be your best in slot. There are exceptions though. For example, an elemental shaman will want to stack spell power which might not be available on all the pvp gear, and holy paladins might want to mix in some +healing since their set isn't healing focused.
---
There's also not necessary a definite persccription for best in slot pvp. Some people, especially rogues and mages, might choose to just go full pve raid gear and be glass cannons since they can use control/cc to stay alive.
---
Raid and still die... a lot...
---
Haven’t played diablo but the others are all fantastic examples.

Let me know if you guys are looking for a UK/EU Guild that's mostly adults.
---
Fair enough. But is it really that bad though? I'm definitely not planning on joining a guild where everyone refuses to move on their own and expects me to summon 30+ people. Plus there'd be like 3-5 warlocks in the guild helping out with everything as well. From what I've heard in other threads going in with like 20 soul shards should be plenty, since you can get soul shards from trash inside the raids as well.
---
You think hunters have the most boring Pve rotation?
---
Have you played a mage? Or a warlock? Far far worse.
---
mages counter rogues stunlocks, cos they can blink out of it, aswell as they can block an get out of it.
---
Hillsbrad, unless they've fixed it within a couple of months.
---
Dat Goldshire on max settings tho
---
Bro I play a very high pop private server currently, and you CANNOT find a AQ20 pug without the Crossbow of Imminent Doom being on rez/priority for warrior tanks. So as a hunter pugging it’s basically IMPOSSIBLE to get it unless it’s a gold bid run and you are wealthy af. Lol
---
He's by far most known as a troll hunter, even got a (hunter) quest dedicated to that character. That should be reason enough to play Horde this time around, even if it is a few hours slower.
---
Except for smart warlocks who will keep a curse on you, use searing pain, and drain your mana bone dry.
---
Surprised to hear your thoughts of this. Assassins creed 2 took all the novelty fun elements of AC1 and refined it to really turn Assassins Creed into the powerhouse franchise it is today. AC 1 was a great game but very repetitive.
---
Fram what I have seen in the images here on Reddit I agree with you, looks appealing yet familiar!
---
What private server is this? I loved that game.
---
I always roll the way the party rolls, if everyone else is rolling greed then I do too, and pray to god the last person doesn't hit need. I do wish everyone would just need on epic boe's though to eliminate the possibility of loot drama, if you assume everyone is as honest as you are you're going to have a bad time.
---
Okay, I can't comment on Hillsbrad but every zone I've taken screenshots of  rain in came from an overcast sky.
---
This! After having played vanilla on unofficial servers, one of the things I am the most excited about is the face lift!
---
No, Magic Arena is a new online version for MtG.  More comparable to Hearthstone and other online card game's clients and business models.
---
Hybrid tax doesn’t apply here. The best class in vanilla with the best looking gear. There is a lot of competition in raids.
---
That actually sounds awesome to me. Makes people appreciate you more when they get summoned (at least they should) :)
---
I want this!
---
What exactly is the original Outland?
---
Graphics doesn’t really matter all that much to me. I may use the upgraded ones or I may not. It doesn’t really affect gameplay.

I agree with your first point completely. I've really noticed that the water look seems to be a point of contention for a lot of people. I agree that the old water is charming but the modern wow-water looks stunning in my opinion!
---
Trying to wrack my brain to jar some memories loose, but I...don't recall fighting the red dragonflight in STV 😂
---
to see a speedrun with some other class would be nice. Like priest. or grinding from 30-60
---
I would actually argue its Halo 2, Halo 3, and Halo Reach, just because Reaches forge mode is God tier
---
And you can't queue for them from anywhere.
---
Whole lotta epic
---
Does anyone have any good resources for grinding spots in each zone? I’m trying to create a list of good grinding spots to use if there is a ton of competition for questing mobs in a particular zone. Ideally this resource would be tailored to Alliance.
---
I’m all for weather!
---
 maybe it’s just me but I honestly hated playing in dark zones at night.  I loved playing at night in some of the brighter more lit areas. Maybe it was because my monitor sucked but I always felt like the brighter the zone the easier it was for me to play.
---
Haha what? Did you even play the games? Ac2 is so different from the first in gameplay, combat and even climbing it's not like it's the same game. Each game is very different.

"updated graphics in the form of foliage, weather"
---
"classic with modern wow graphics and animations"
---
"The art team perfectly walked a very fine line between cleaning up the rough edges of vanilla while completely preserving the style and feel of the game."
---
There will be no updated "foliage" or "weather" (in fact there were absolutely no showing of weather so far, we hope/presume it'll be as it was and if not, it's a bug and should be fixed).
---
It'll not have *any* modern wow graphics and especially not modern animations.
---
I'm *pretty sure* they don't have an "art team". They certainly aren't "clean up the rough edges of vanilla".
---
Classic will have Vanilla graphics. It uses 1.12 Vanilla data. That means *everything* will be as in Vanilla 1.12. All the world, models, textures, animations, particle effects. They are working painstakingly to recreate the look.
---
Yes, there will be *optional* improvements, which come free with the updated engine. These are the updated shadows, water and larger detail and ground clutter distance (and a few other minor things). All the "Classic" button does in the interface is to set some of these options to approximate the max settings in Vanilla.
---
But the point is, Classic is the *recreation* of Vanilla. It's *not* a Remaster, like for example Warcraft III Reforged.
---
Please see the "Restoring History" panel at last Blizzcon for the details: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKkP8LryYM
---
To be fair, you can't play retail wow (seriously) while being anti social either. Any sort of end game requires a dedicated team of some kind. From 3s in Pvp, to 5 man dungeons, and all the way to 20 man mythic raids. Even in open world I kept meeting the same people because I tended to interact with everyone I met and remembered how they acted towards me (I was RPing on a non-RP server, killing people of the same faction because that was part of the RP I did) 
---
When I played retail a year ago I had no problem with the social aspect of WoW, anyone who claims that part of the game is dead is either not playing or would be anti-social in classic as well.
---
Interesting, thank you for sharing your thoughts. I think for myself at least that the the nostalgia will be very strong regardless, it is just that the immersion will be much stronger with updated graphics.
---
What's your thoughts on this?
---
Alliance PvE tbh. People are nicer, towns are pretty, quests are better (Ony attunement), I’m going Paladin and blessings are ...well, blessings. More aesthetic races. The story is more centered around you in Vanilla. Questing zones are infinitely more appealing on the Alliance side. 
---
Alliance is simply comfy af.
---
and weapon chain
---
I haven't played recently enough to have seen the water first-hand, so my mind very well could be changed!  But in all the pictures/videos I have seen of it, it just looks kinda... flat.
---
Good luck buddy. I've tried telling her "But Brad's wife tried it and she actually enjoys it," I've also told her that we can just start off slow and ease our way in. Still no luck. I might just end up telling her we can try something in mine too, but we'll see how it goes.
---
Wait... wrong sub
---
To people that want to dps: Watch your fucking threat!
---
That's fair, I will experiment with the old settings but I strongly suspect I will end up using the newer ones for the most part. I agree though, gameplay first.
---
Warlock is just as spammy, it’s up to the preference of the player. Mage is overall a great pick for leveling and generally just soloing content. Mage in raids are some of the best dps in raiding as well. It has to do with shatter procs. If it wasn’t frostbolt it would just be another frost spell to proc shatter.
---
I think being caught without any of your cooldowns up is death for any class.
---
I think this game climaxed with Ulduar. Mechanically, it was the perfect raid. None of that bullshit easy normal hard mode garbage. One raid and your raid was able to add difficulty. It was perfect. It was the last best thing WoW had going for it, because it was already beginning to degrade with the majority of content being easy, ubiquitous, and inconsequential.
---
Witcher series.
---
Also you have to wear a dress
---
Classic &amp; BC is significantly better than WOTLK.
---
The leveling is atrocious you will never be only one and without a good weapon you dont feel quite right.
---
I'm not sure immersion is totally reliant on the graphics tbh. I think it has more to do with the games ability to draw you in and keep you interested. Flowing gameplay and interaction with other players is what makes me feel like I'm part of the world.
---
What do you take as a second primary? I am thinking I'm going to do Tailoring/mining. I want to be able to switch from mining to engineering, I think. Mining/Eng sounds all right but I hear tailoring is huge for once the bloodvine comes out, that will be BiS for a while. So I'm having a tough time trying to figure out what path to take. Do I then need an alt to supply my main with ore? Or make sure I have everything to max it out and then buy materials I need?
---
You can’t recreate vanilla as it was, and I don’t think anyone seriously has been asking for that. It has always been assumed that classic will be some version of 1.12 which was just a tiny portion of retail vanilla. 
---
What the classic team is doing now is recreating the game in an updated client as best as they can with the 1.12 framework. The way they have communicated their philosophy gives a lot of confidence in their willingness to recreate the vanilla feeling as far as practical possible.
---
It does and it also makes you appreciate the good tanks and healers who you know use your healthstones to survive to prevent wipes.
---
Black Flag was amazing.
---
For real? It's the exact same to me. You are given a mission to follow someone around. Next mission is to kill them. Repeat. Some chase missions here and there. IDK, just didn't do it for me. Side tasks and stuff were mostly similar too between games. Felt like the whole game was based on admiring the really pretty map, and cool combat animations. But for me the novelty wore off during the first two games. I only briefly touched 3 at a friends house, and I got black flag for free. Thought it was exactly the same game again, just different setting and characters.
---
I'm seriously thinking about making a post with this idea as the main topic. Just a great idea; I was thinking the same but didn't know how Blizz could integrate it, brilliant.
---
The specific weather in the zone was decided sever wide, but that does not mean they can't include an option for the client to render the effects that came with the weather.
---
They even had a weather intensity slider for a while, don't know if it is still there.
---
well you should know better then.
---
Spellbreak has been doing a good job for me
---
In what ways were they different? It's been a long time since I played AC1 and 2 but it's a pretty common opinion that all the AC games haven't evolved any
---
You should at least run MC to get rhok’delar.
---
Okay, I remember seeing a post a few months back highlighting the updated water look and I remember I found it gorgeous. I'm happy that all of these things will be optional up to each player.
---
I said "very end game" specifically because this is reddit and I KNEW someone would chime in about how druids can tank up so a certain raid tier.
---
Your buffs last 15 fucking minutes and cost money to use

Elwynn forest is one of the best tracks in the game. The soundtracks for each expansion are great and they are on iTunes.

Warriors wear mail at lvl 37? lol not too hard to see warriors should roll need on them.
---
I had 256mb ram when playing wow first year. Sure, It couldn't handle more than 10 players concurrently, but it ran god dammit!
---
Either Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow or Pokemon Gold/Silver/Crystal
---
For undead shadow priest, are you supposed to Inner Focus with devouring plague? It seems like it would be a decent combo since they're both 3 min cds and DP has a large mana cost. Also, does the 25% increased crit chance apply to all of DPs ticks?
---
So, here's what I would suggest honestly. 
---
I don't think you can do well in PvP at 60 without doing any dungeons. However, I think you could have a lot of fun as a level 29, 39 or 49 twink. (Note: I've never had a 49 twink, but have had a blast with twinks at 29 and 39). If that sounds appealing to you, I would recommend Horde and fishing deviate fish from the barrens. I did that once as a druid for about 6 months and got twinked out without using a main. It can be SUPER fun.
---
... Then again, I suppose even then you do want to do SOME dungeons for the gear. But you wouldn't need to do many, and then you can just rock BGs away to your heart's content after that.
---
Looks like Karazhan backdoor to me.
---
Twinking is sort of a result of people being bored at end game. I don't think we'll see proper twinks for quite a while. I'm talking about twinks being fully enchanted, leveled professions and having BiS gear, which for many require BoE world drops or being carried in dungeons. It can get very expensive, very fast. You couldn't turn off XP in vanilla so it required careful planning as to not gain too much XP if you wanted certain dungeon/quest gear, which usually means being carried. Also, you couldn't queue for BGs anywhere as you had to go to the actual instance portal or a Battlemaster.
---
Thank you for your thorough contribution, I see that I had partly forgotten what it was they were doing here. 
---
My point, however, was more in terms of  the "improvements" from the engine update and how I was excited about these. Thank you for linking the video, I might go back and watch it again for a refresher.
---
I feel you dude. Most of my mind is just obsessing with Classic.
---
I have that one for free sometime when uplay store was handing keys out. I only lasted a day with it and never launched it again. Just the missions man, they were the same from AC1. I give them props on the awesome animations and environments, though.
---
You could possibly farm to rank 10 wearing complete shit greens by being worthless to your team until you finally get the blue set, but your off set pieces will mostly be shit.
---
Fact is a massive portion of gear comes from raids and dungeons and completely ignoring that source of gear will set you back, some slots are barely covered by PVP items and even then that doesn't mean they are going to compete to a warrior with a might of menethil ripping through your team like a lawnmower.
---
Well Druids are the optimal MT on Thaddius and Patchwerk, as well as optimal OTs up to that point.
---
Draconic deflector is best looking
---
Had to check the vanilla wowhead comments about this mount.
---
Can you believe that their were discussions about how someone who doesn't have an epic mount yet should have dibs on the Tiger? :-)
---
Those crazy vanilla people!
---
Blink and iceblock.
---
Man when DF hit I was so excited. I thought it was nifty. But then no one wanted to talk to each other anymore and it didnt matter if I really liked playing with someone in my group. Then it felt dirty.
---
Dude Reach PvP was crisp too no lie
---
It was before they relaxed the requirements.  That being said...I loved the shit out of the whole grind.  Playing with 10 or 15 friends all in the same boat as you, winning 6 minute wsgs and 5 capping in ab (until we started fighting the bwl / aq geared raid teams who could tie us up in a wsg for 3 hours) was the best.  I just realized I'd fail out of college if I kept it up.  
---
The premade vs premades were always the best but it really hurt your honor per hour to play those games so people had mixed feelings on them.
---
The grind up to champion is very doable though so I think that's where I'll shoot for this time around.  Unless I decide to take a week off work to push rank 11 for the awesome battle mounts.
---
Such. Quality. Memories.
---
No CDs as a rogue means u can't even 1v1 similarly geared people. So you can kill someone every 5 min more or less.
---
Simple question: wanna join my pvp guild? Hahaha
---
You know, I'd rather play Kung-fu pandas again on retail rather than piece of trash BfA. At least classes were fun.
---
Mario 64, sunshine, galaxy, odyssey. Three in an extra for good measure.
---
The original game also didn’t have hundreds of thousands to possibly millions all logging in the second the game launches trying to do the same thing as every other person.  If there was a choice to have it or not, anyone who can even do some basic critical thinking would understand it has to be there, unless they can provide a better alternative.
---
Absolutely, I so not want to give off the impression that immersion stems only from graphics, far from it, it's rather that with the great gameplay and sense of belonging in the world from vanilla wow. This is why I think modern engine on vanilla wow will be the bomb!
---
I'm intrigued. It seems like the debate between "changers" and "no changers" was resolved in the time I hadn't been following, and changers won. Odd how this entire ordeal seems to have been forgotten? I guess most of us purists split after Blizzcon or something when stuff from other expacs was confirmed to be in. I didn't get the memo, obviously, and at this point I'm trying to decide if this faux vanilla WoW is going to be worth playing in spite of the changes.
---
Plenty of people did ask for exactly an authentic vanilla. Sure they won't be releasing patches as vanilla did, but 1.12 could have been a very close replica of the original game if they wanted to go that route. They aren't, or at least not what I would consider to be authentic. 
---
Authentic to me means the closest possible match to the original experience. This means no willful choices to add anything which wasn't in the original game, or exclude anything which was. The only deviation from this is when they simply cannot, as in literally cannot, replicate something. 
---
Loot trading and sharding are choices, not limitations in their ability to replicate the original game. They could have excluded both, and opted not to. In my book the reasoning for adding features not in vanilla WoW is irrelevant. Doing so at all means it's not authentic.
---
Will the game be better for it? Well that will surely depend on who you ask.
---
Was on 256mb during the first 6 months. Avoiding the more popular cities, boats, airships and flight paths was a struggle. 512mb was such a joy.
---
I don't think Rogue is favoured against any class in 1v1 duelling. Sure they're super strong in wpvp,  but duelling outside Orgrimmar where you know a Rogue is coming? I don't know man, who do they beat?
---
There’s nothing special a Rogue has to do that requires a dedicated guide. This is vanilla raiding.
---
I'm not gonna downvote you or anything, but integrating social media into everything is the devil.
---
The difference should hopefully be that with the new shadows they disappear at night. The old ones were just „painted“ on the ground.
---
I didn't raid warlock during classic to be honest, I switched in TBC. But even with 25 man raids, there was a LOT of summoning. I would usually farm ~50 shards before raid time, use some to summon late people so we could just get the raid on the road, then summon more people because they had to hearth because they forgot food or needed to change specs or whatever else. Then after every boss summoning more people because they wanted to hearth to enchant and gem their new gear.
---
The other problem is boss attempts. During farming it's not really too bad as long as you're diligent about using drain soul on all the trash. But during progression, you might summon a demon, then use a soulstone, then throw up a soul well, on every pull. That plus summoning people back to raid for repairs ads up quickly, and you have no trash to replenish shards on.
---
Vanilla didn't even have soul well, so you have to make a healthstone for potentially EVERY member of the raid! and having multiple locks doesn't help as much as you think, since in vanilla different levels of improved healthstone would let health stones stack.
---
He’s wrong. Warriors hardcounter rogues.
---
\&gt; Also reconsider Engineering instead of Blacksmithing, it's almost a must-have for DPS warrs. 
---
How come? Do the bombs give that much DPS? Or is it things like Battle Chicken? It could be useful anyway since I will be on a PvP server.
---
I have no problem leveling an alt because I have way too much free time. Not sure if I actually want to play on that alt or just use it to supplement my Warrior.
---
Icecrown patch was good overall. Dungeon finder made sense. LFR is where things really went downhill.
---
Naw he was intended to be the hero class for the night elf warrior per Kevin Jordan. They later scrapped the idea of hero classes until death knight, which ended up being a different iteration of “hero class”.
---
I'm no expert but it seems like a proper skill match up at regular levels. idk. You can probably come out on top as long as you don't let your counterspell get faked out and you don't feed a lot of time/mana into his grounding totem. A more skilled shaman that times his stuff better will probably have the edge. again, I'm no expert on this.
---
It doesn't have to be there. It just won't be pretty if it's not.
---
The consequence of not having it is mass server crashes the first few days until players filter out into other zones, and the interest slacks off a bit, and I get that.
---
I accept such an outcome as preferable to including sharding tech. Because that tech will do long term damage to the immersive experience.
---
We dealt with nightly rollback crashes in vanilla. I'd say that this would unintentionally be yet more authentic replication of the original experience. And I'm ok with that.
---
Old weather would be amazing!
---
I agree, but Icecrown was still pretty good. Honestly Wrath was my favorite time in the game. Even though the raid buff homogenization was a mistake in my view.
---
Updated graphics have male orcs shooting their bows diagonally, it is out of the question for me personally. Why they have to go an change everything on every level when "updating" is just annoying.
---
Sorry but wife and happy life don't go together.
---
Thats what I loved in the game, sometimes you really had to improvise to make it work. Especially because sometimes you just did not find people to join your group. Made for awesome groups and fun at times.
---
I am pretty sure DOTs can´t crit in classic.
---
The problem is it doesn't get that dark until almost 1:00 in your own time zone (if the server is on your time zone). Really sucks.
---
Being a niche best on a couple of encounters here and there does not a good tank make.
---
That sounds like a very fun combo! Healing is good times and you and her might have a really fun time in WSG if you feel like PvP!
---
I looked at the pictures you took of the rain. It isn't just the sky but the fact that the environment looks too bright because heavy rain doesn't have the same fog effect as it did in vanilla. Heavy weather, whether that's rain or snow- or sand storms, impaired your vision a lot more.
---
Sadly healpet was channeld in vanilla. Loved the hot in BC.
---
oO
---
As someone who plays with only ambiance sound this is very much desired.
---
Wrath had the most fun classes to play, BC had the best overall raids imo and vanilla had the best continent. Honestly I just miss how pvp felt like in wrath, that shit was so much fun. Classic wow will be fun but the classes just arent as much fun to play and the pvp being a consumable fiesta kinda kills it a little for me, I will still enjoy it for what it is, vanilla is still fun as fuck, much better then what we got after wrath, from cata and onwards the rest just sucked ass.
---
I completely agree that the updated engine and what optional improvements it can bring is welcome. :) I like the Vanilla graphics and Classic will show it in the best possible light.
---
I just despair a little when post after post waxes about how Classic will look and people start to drift into expecting a complete overhaul (like the comment about "modern wow graphics and animations"). I'm sure it'll continue, unfortunately. The end result will be either people tricking themselves believing that Classic does look different ("better") than Vanilla (although apart from the aforementioned shadow/water/etc. options the small lighting differences are there only because of different time of day when the screenshots are taken). Or they'll feel cheated when they discover it's "only" Vanilla and not a remaster.
---
Ah well.
---
I know arcane missiles is great against grounding totem. But they have a lot of burst, and can heal pretty decently once they're geared.
---
Aga
---
This is solved by a group of roving warlocks soul draining everything they see.
---
make sure to not just buy every spell, a lot of classes have some kind of useless spells or ones that aren't very useful until the later game and the costs really start to add up
---
We have more confirmation of the opposite. Thank god.
---
It's a hard counter. I don't play mage but i play an arguably worst class againt them, alliance disc priest lol. Good ele resto shams will destroy us both in a 2v1. That being said, on this  server it is consistently playing in premades against people like perplexity, goth, stormx etc and shamans of their caliber. The likelihood of the majority of shamans being a) that spec b) that geared or c) that skilled is slim to none, especially considering how low the number of shamans are in general on the biggest servers in the last four years
---
Elwynn forest music and the the Barrens music both gave me shivers with how much they take me back. Amazing times.
---
Grab a sword and join the Horde!
---
Despite it all, I cannot ignore my hunter roots.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
I miss that game. Pm a link?
---
I picked Warrior because I thought in the Beta he was like the Barbarian in Diablo.
---
Took me 7 days when I was 13 and didbt fully ubderstand English. No addons.
---
If most people are 3 days slower than that then Im shocked...
---
I really hope they make public the release dates for the respective phases soon. The first 2 or 3 phases, anyway!
---
Just make sure they are rank 1 arcane missiles :)
---
Managing your rank 1 stuff is crucial..so easy to go oom as a mage.  
---
Rank 1 nova for lockdown, rank 1 frostbolt for al almost instant slow, rank 1 arcane explosion to blow things up (can't remember when it stopped but I know during vanilla 1 aoe could kill all of a shaman's totems)
---
Yeah that’s classic for you, to give you some idea, some players even go as far as to making conscious decisions on the spells they cast in a given situation.
---
Got a link?
---
Quake 1, 2 and 3
---
For which class/spec? If you happen to mean Rogue, they have a great website at [https://shadowpanther.net/](https://shadowpanther.net/) that has gear lists for PVP armor and weapons.
---
Very often when loging in you get a whisper for transmute.
---
Great! I'll just f5 this site until it's out then :D
---
nah it's more the way lvling feels. for me it's extremely anonymous. you are right in terms of endgame content, but lvling wise it feels super shallow to me, to say the least.
---
What a shit post
---
Well, now I kind of know you haven't played AC2 atleast, and especially not Brotherhood or Revelations or any of the other games :s
---
Would love to see the balance from each server.
---
Ele shamans do not hard counter well played mages. Talented frost or elemental mages are a pretty even fight. AP fire or PoM fire mages are a pretty strong hard counter to shamans.  
---
Ele shaman are only a hard counter for mages that don't really know how to approach a shaman fight.
---
I do plan to port my guides into an in-game addon, but I cant start working on that until Classic Beta (or launch) happens.  I am preparing for it by gathering programmers and doing a lot of planning for it though.
---
I meant priest heal for instance
---
I want baron charger
---
priest disc/holy, might switch between hybrid, PI or trispec according to my mate and my gear
---
What are some passive ways of making money with twinks?
---
Tailoring Mooncloth on 4 day cooldown.
---
Transmuting Arcanite Bars on 1 day cooldown.
---
Any more?
---
Ah lord the feels
---
&gt; even got a (hunter) quest dedicated to that character
---
Which one?
---
No, that’s crap dude, you play whatever the hell makes you happy. Age doesn’t matter my friend. Some of the best players I’ve met were in their 40’s.
---
I'll actually play priest heal, shadowpanther is great thanks! wish it was declined for other classes as well
---
I relate to this so much. I rolled a mage named Yams, do i go back to that name or stick with SquidEthics. The decisions..
---
I can see the source of your frustration, especially since I contributed to it in a way, and I hope people will start to get more realistic expectations as we approach the summer.
---
And ....saved the post. Not that I re-check  every 5mins or so.
---
Tag me if you ever find the answer to this, my friend. I have the same dilemma.
---
I wouldn't have an opinion if I didn't play them. AC2 was the last one I played at least half way through. When did it come out? that was when I last played it. 
---
And no, I didn't play revelations or brotherhood. Only 1, 2, 3 and black flag.
---
enchanted leather and enchanted thorium from enchanting if you're masochist :)
---
Perhaps some context is in order https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=97
---
I doubt it happens but correct me if I’m wrong, do you think old school GMs should return for classic (or retail as well)?
---
Unlikely scenario, would you accept it if they would offer you to become a GM in Classic?
---
Been using basically the same name since 2005 although now it's shortened from 'Daesilith' to just 'Daes' since nobody can pronounce it smh it's like silithus
---
I will be checking this everyday for news and info. Thanks!
---
I am in favour of graphical updates, as long as they are optional, but any animation or model updates I think would be a bad idea. I hope these changes you are describing with the bow animation will be resolved before release.
---
Hi, /u/Maxisfluffy
---
Or "who uses Engineering better".
---
Why masochist? Low profit margin? Long cool down?
---
Donkey Kong Country 1-3
---
Isn't that literally the case for any class 1v1 whatsoever?
---
Oh I understand. Thank you for the detailed explanation!
---
Many mages tell me it's not a hard counter, but a matchup you need to learn well in order to beat them
---
Elementium Reinforced Bulwark &gt; all literally no competition.
---
For the quest alone its worth doing it. Plus its the only? Quiver with 15% haste.
---
I plan on playing a shaman. Is there healing gear from LW that I can use. Or should I go herb/alch?
---
If they rerelease Wrath later, I hope they still add LFD for 1-60 since it’s hard to find groups for that content when leveling in expansions, but they should keep 60-80 content social and real, witbout the lfd feature.
---
So many runs. So much disappointment.
---
I have a hard time with this comment because AC1 and Black Flag were fundamentally different games. If you didn't teach the point where you got your own ship, you didn't even really play the game. And if you did, there's no way you could say it was the same game.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/quest=7503/the-greatest-race-of-hunters
---
The item that starts the quest is a book with the description "A tale of a female troll and her pet". It was introduced in tbc I think, the hunter version of the Dire Maul class quests.
---
Thank god. I was getting worried there for a second
---
The difference is like night and day.
---
Join a PS to get used to the feel and pass the time. Also builds hype.
---
I like that no one has convinced OP to not roll a warrior. The only comment evening mentioning makes them sound more badass lol.
---
Down vote me all you want, the OG halo trilogy is better than what bc and wotlk did with vanilla
---
Definitely vendor on a fresh server. Might consider ah for an older server but I just find it faster to vendor it all. Nice part about vendoring it is it definitely covers your  food and water expenses
---
I think making 5-man heroics harder, or adding Mythic (not +) would go along way for Wrath. And making Naxx a little tougher too. 
---
Other than that, 10 man raids were still pretty hard compared to modern day normals.
---
This post truly deserved the gold it got.
---
KILL IT WITH FIRE!!
---
Haha thanks, appreciate it!
---
Thanks :)
---
Spriests too busy being oom to heal
---
shadow priests, ret pallies and enhance shamans are fine and good to play. Anyone who always brings up their negative subjective opinions on such things might as well hold up a sign saying "look at me I have brain and attitude problems in real life too"
---
Hopefully its out soon!
---
Do the vanilla name so you could potentially run into old pals
---
Yeah I agree with this.  There’s utility and effort that doesn’t show up on a DPS meter.  I suspect a legit guild of good people will be aware of that and value it.  There’s a lot more to a DPS spec than pure numbers, in kk opinion.  Play what you want and if you are competent and try hard it will be fine.
---
I want to find a guild that'll let me get it on my shaman. I plan on no lifing it as much as possible in order to be able to craft and get it.
---
I don't remember. I remember getting to a part where I was sailing my own ship and got into a little ship to ship skirmish but quit pretty shortly after that. No I didn't give black flag as much of a chance as AC1-3. In what ways is it different though? I recall still having to find these vision towers like you always do, tailing, and chase missions and similar combat mechanics.
---
I'm not referring to story or anything if that clears anything up? Really I'm just stating my opinion of the game. Don't know why I'm defending myself so hard here lol.
---
insane cost to level, with tailoring if you push for it you can pretty much guarantee that you could gather enough materials to get 2 characters to 250 tailoring. Enchanting is well turbulent at best and you will have to burn the profits from things like mooncloth sales on essences, (you should get enough dust from Armour d/e) and then only to find a very small demand (more demand for thorium than leather) but it is another profession cooldown.
---
Respect
---
Cool! Thanks for sharing that. Perhaps you could write to blizz for alpha/beta access?
---
I played the demo and to be honest there is barely any difference to the old client. Sure nice shadows and foliage, after 2 hours you stop caring and it feels the same like the old client. 144hz was amazingly smooth tho.
---
Seriously though, big WF crits are sooo satisfying.
---
I mean yeah that's the case for any class fight though. I have never lost to a single mage as an ele resto sham, and I'm not great at them. You just counter everything regardless of your skill level. Obviously you won't always lose but with all being equal with the exception of class balance, RNG will be your only friend
---
 Feels good.
---
GTA, GTA3, GTA5
---
They, just... Give you that feeling.  🤡
---
NOPE.
---
No problem :)
---
People absolutely buy them early. They might even be more valuable early since a lot of people put off fishing for awhile, so you have less competition.
---
And "the first few months"? That's a ton of time. A lot of people will be 60 within the first month, and people love to pop deviates during raids.
---
It's not the most profitable thing in the game, but it's not nothing.
---
Like I said in my other comment, the issue is when you're stuck on one boss for potentially hours with no trash to drain. Also, different grades of improved health stone can complicate matters.
---
doesn't count Halo ODST is the one before reach.
---
Good news for warlocks then? Can bring shadow priests immediately right?
---
i'm trying to resist the urge to play a private server, it's difficult :/ i need to save myself for the real deal.
---
I don't play on Pservers but I do remember that at some point they added like a 6 second grace time for buffs on rezzing at the GY.
---
If someone remember's the patch where that happened feel free to correct me. My memory is foggy about BGs in vanilla since I focused on WPvP mainly.
---
Inspiration from this video.
---
WE'RE GOING HOME BROS!
---
I have to disagree, imo MoP had the best classes, good raids are spread across the expansions, but i have to agree on the continent, no expansion had a more living, fun and adventure filled continent like vanilla
---
It was a hidden invite only server that had original character data that recently got leaked and shut down. But it had ran under the radar for years.
---
I am in no position to type out well thought out posts on my phone but it’s your idea now. Go for it.
---
Id guess pally buffs works better with bear than shaman totems
---
Then play Katana Zero. So many good games recently.
---
Dude that would be great. It simply is unfair for caster classes compared to Rogue or warrior or even hunter who don't have anything to buff. Crossing fingers
---
I'm not a hardcore vanilla purist, I dont ask for much, but this, this is what I want more than anything. There's nothing more immersive than real day and night lighting and real weather effects. I've got some amazing memories of getting poured on in Elwynn with that beautiful music track going, exploring a world brand new to me. Makes me choke up a little just thinking about it.
---
I knew there were gonna be answer like these, simply hoped they wouldn't come that fast. As I've mentionned; do you have any explanation to your position? What is backing is fervent refusal?
---
If you were given the option, why would you gimp yourself out of visual range and add more distractions to your screen? 
---
I would definitely prefer the old school weather effects being in-game, but not as an option.
---
The game wasnt meant to ALWAYS have a sidekick. So any classes you choose will be fine. Dont min max it play what you want to be. Ask her about class fantasy what does she want to BE because months of doing the same thing gets boring as shit unless you're really into it. Dont tell her what they do tell her what they are. Like nevermind saying hunter what a hunter does, let her know it tames beasts and is an archer. Stuff like that. From the NE thing I'm guessin yall are rolling ally. Show her the racial mounts and their character models. Do it that way and you will have tons to talk about and lots of fun together. Wife and I are also going ally. We talk about classic every single day and are so pumped.
---
Don't worry fam I made the post but mentionned you &lt;3
---
There were complaints for the Oceanic servers for sure. Where I am in Australia it is always night (in WoW) when you are playing and it kinda sucks. I’m not surprised they changed it but a client side opt in/out would have been preferable.
---
i assume he means the wc3 outland, which was mostly hellfire peninsula like as far as i can remember, no nagrand, no netherstorm (although this can be explained as kaels doing, he may have changed it in the time between wc3 roc and tbc), no zang (this one is just like nether tho, just with nagas instaed of kael), no terrokar and no blades edge and shadowmoon
---
There was a macro I'd use as a priest that targeted totems in whatever order you chose (grounding, mana tide, earthbind) and then a use of wand. You'll need to bait the grounding totem and wand it before you poly.
---
Night elves get 1%dodge and cows get more base health. Honestly I prefer the more hit points. Bears have more hp than warriors anyways. Great for BWL Bosses that hit too hard.
---
I heard they don't like the sequence scripts either.
---
We shall see what they filter out.
---
Imo gnomes look fine in gear as long as you hide your helm, they are proportionate aside from their large heads. 
---
I feel like you do about seeing my gear, but it never bothered me as a gnome except for helms like I said.
---
[Skullflame Shield](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=1168/skullflame-shield)
---
Man I played throughout the entirety of Vanilla and have no recollection whatsoever of any sort of weather effects. Maybe my graphics settings were so low I never saw them?
---
Priest.
---
Shadow is just a bad Warlock. Other than Shadow Vulnerability, what else do you bring to the raid that a Warlock couldnt do better?
---
Healing is literally whackamole. I barely remember any of the numerous raids ive done in WoW because having 40 lifebars on the screen at onces covers pretty much half your screen. 
---
Also, as a healer you will be blamed for everything. Rogue stood in the fire and died? Your fault, you should have healed him. You pull an extra pack and die? Your fault for not being efficient with your mana.
---
Also, Pokémon Gold, Silver and Crystal
---
That's what I felt playing a ally mage on pserver recently.
---
It's not nearly as bad as facing a priest or a warlock. Shaman really is a skill matchup, and generally assuming you land a good CS you will win. You need to burst down the shaman putting him on the defensive, and he will go for a heal. He WILL try to fake cast it and try to get your CS with a grounding, but grounding is delayed so it's your mistake if it gets you.
---
best specsis elemental and especially pom pyro is a huge counter, because you can do some instant spells and scorhces then blanket CS into pom pyro fireblast oneshot.
---
Agreed! I had this on my human female warrior while running deadmines. It looks even more massive on female, IMO.
---
&gt; was talk of adding the benny hill theme whenever the flag is picked up in wsg
---
Why must you put things in my mind that will never be?
---
use new name with new Account
---
Or red, blue, and stadium.
---
I’m looking for east coast too planning to roll pally
---
Your dots do not crit
---
We Alliance Priests made do with Desperate Prayer.
---
Care to link those? I’m in the same exact boat.
---
Fantastic, I'll PM you our discord server
---
Offspecs unite!
---
Hi, /u/Satterman223
---
TBC was the wound that started to kill WoW, Wrath is the one that finished it.
---
Paladine are better and have more options to gear. I have mained both. Be a vanilla paladin if you like to main support. The 5 min buffs are great and friendly to others as you grind to 60
---
The Tank and DPS are all Warriors.
---
They love Windfury more than Shamans.
---
Fuck tbc. Beginning of the end of wow's greatness. Fuck wrath subsequently too. #nochanges #vanillalife #downvotes
---
What’s so hard about this? The only rogue specific thing in vanilla is suppression room in BWL and that isn’t a boss fight. You do literally the exact same thing as every other melee dps. You dps, you move out of the fire, you kill adds when told and you kick spells when/if it’s your turn. Just like all the other melee DPS.
---
Oh wow, hoping one of these would end up being from my old server. /wave. Priest from Ez back in the day, seeing Muffin Militia triggered some memories! Thanks!
---
yes, but can you take a joke?
---
It should only proc on the first cast, not on each tick. It is a common private server 'feature' most likely due to the quality of tooltips in vanilla.
---
Or that is my understanding of where the research settled.
---
The colors in astranaar are completely differents.
---
The building on the left was redish and it is fully purple in Classic.
---
Also Vanilla is way more dull. Classic is flashy, colorful, bright and cartoony, I don't really like that
---

worry not, for I am equipped with the finest knowledge one can obtain, the official BRADYGAMES® Battle Chest Guide to the World of Warcraft! see you on the front lines  fellow azerothian!
---
Warrior, it's the class of soul and no matter what I play in other expansions warrior is always in the back of my mind...bummer they are going to be FotM tho :(
---
Idk if I'm going gnome or troll and I'm having an existential crisis over it...I love gnomes but trolls are absolutely pimp and I like horde more as a faction but the joy I feel slaughtering people as a 2 foot whirlwind of death is unbeatable...but then trolls in rank 13 look so good D:
---
Rolling with my old characters names. Had to. SWAGGGG
---
I can see where you are coming from,  that was just my personal experience. I didnt enjoy the first season of MoP because it was infested with KFC but you're right about classes being fun to play. I would rate it third behind wrath and BC in term of pvp class design but im biased since these are the 2 expansions I personally enjoyed and played the most overall. Vanilla will still be a blast tho, engineering and consumables kinda ruins pvp a bit for me even though I will use them.
---
I too am interested. Everyone asking for a way to play. No response!
---
Honestly though is it like 100 people at peak times
---
This is a great one.
---

---
Wow I played MK yearrrrrs ago wow
---
NOPE
---
A sound plan. Thanks for the response!
---
Pet management and rare pet taming is probably the biggest turn off for me in these classes.
---
Cant wait to play warrior again in classic. I remember when arenas first came out before BC doing 5v5 arena with 5 decked out warriors and killin it.
---
Lmao you ?
---
We are in the US Mountain time. Would love a guild though with similar situated folk.
---
1. How big of deal is the absence of normal resurrection on Druids (While leveling and in dungeons)?
---
2. How many enchants can be stacked on a melee weapon? For exemple: Base enchant, Crusader, Poison/stone, windfury?
---
Yeah, I know it works every tick on p.servers, just wondering what about is that point in patch notes then.
---
Correct. Being able to tank encounters effectively and competently makes a good tank. 100% a warrior should probably be the MT for most encounters. But a Feral can MT many encounters just fine, and the make great OTs. They also are arguably the best tanks for speed runs do to superior TPS.
---
I really enjoy PvP. But it makes her nervous. She might let me take in a few battlegrounds though to try it out.
---
 **&lt;Chaos Theory&gt; - NA \[A\] EST PVP Server** 
---
**Introduction** 
---
Greetings! &lt;Chaos Theory&gt; is a mature Alliance, PVE focused guild based out of North America (EST). Our goal is to work toward raiding progression as a raid team. We will be playing on a PVP server for Classic WoW.  
---
**Member Expectations** 
---
As we prepare for the Classic WoW Launch, we are looking for new members to help us build our core. The main requirements to joining the guild are active participation in Discord, a good/positive attitude, and a desire to progress. We are actively looking for all classes and roles, so now is the opportunity to join at the ground level and help build something special. 
---
 **Specifics in regards to desired classes/roles:** 
---
* Druid (Tank, Feral DPS, Heal) 
---
* Hunter (BM, Mark) 
---
* Mage (All Specs)
---
* Paladin (Heal) 
---
* Priest (Heal) 
---
* Rogue (All Specs)
---
* Warlock (All Specs) 
---
* Warrior (Tank, DPS)  
---
**Raid Schedule – Early night EST Raids!** 
---
Our raid schedule will be 3 days a week. The core raid days will be Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursdays from **7pm to 10pm EST**. If we complete content early, we will take days off if there isn’t additional content available to clear.  We plan to use a hybrid **transparent** form of Loot Council.  This will include open dialog with the entire raid and potentially a rotating member of the council.
---
**Next Steps**
---
 If this sounds of interest, please join us via Discord to proceed with next steps.  We currently have a Discord and Guild Website ready for your enjoyment.  We are looking forward to adventuring in Azeroth with you this summer!

I downloaded the 1.12 client and found a private server to play on. It's actually pretty active and it's helping me get my fix before the real game comes out.
---
Rn im between warrior and a paladin.
---
Warrior just has that *something* in it that drives me towards it.
---
Paladin is nice because its kinda like a mix of warrior and priest + i like healing but aaaaaaa.
---
I am having the exact same issue. I am so stoked for classic there is nothing that is satisfying my need for a good MMO again.
---
Buy one with what exactly? 😕
---
Yep, also going to burn out my F5 key on this. Thanks OP!
---
Does pre-bis dagger rogue do significantly less damage than pre-bis sword rogue?
---
That's great, that's just what I wanted to hear! I didn't get the chance to try the demo unfortunately.
---
Hmm
---
Retail client nighttime definitely feels more immersive than 1.12.1 (on emulated server ofc, but shaders are clientside anyway)
---
Though, I recall them making some QoL change for nighttime somewhere in vanilla - they said something about low-contrast monitors, if I recall correctly
---
anyway, on both 1.12 and 1.13, the landscape in nighttime is not much different - only tinted.
---
On retail - the lighting is genuinely reduced.
---
Alright let's define "amazing reads". Are we talking gravity's rainbow or lord of the rings here or is just just a book you'd read in the airport to pass the time between layovers?
---
Used the same name for 14 years. Going to choose a new name because this is a new experience and I'm trying to view it as its own separate experience.
---
Warriors will be FotM until all of the weak are weeded out ;). I have never been a fan of gnomes. I like being tall!
---
When playing shaman i've always found scorch to be an absolute pain to deal with, i don't know why you would rather use missiles.
---
The only thing I have to live for is a stretch. I still go to the gym every day and maintain a social life. It's just that wow classic is the only thing I'm actually looking forward to right now.

The nights ARE darker on retail, than on bboth 1.12 and 1.13 (blizzcon demo)
---
Though, on early vanilla, they were even darker. But they changed them somewhere in 1.something, because old monitors couldn't display the night correctly.
---
Now, the paradox. Will they make changes to the code, to make night more immersive, as it was on CRT monitors? Or will they make nochanges to the code, to make night fell exactly as it was on CRT monitors in 2004?
---
If you could only/primarily play after work or something then Azeroth was (literally) a very dark place. While this could be beautifully atmospheric in Duskwood or similar zones, it could also just make the world feel smaller and gloomier if it was the only way someone experienced it.
---
Couldn't agree more! I still use this on my holy pal
---
People that give unconstructive responses like that probably have no intention of actually discussing anything. 
---
There are a lot of NPC’s on this sub like this guy that only reply to threads with “NO CHANGES” even when the thread is suggesting a change that would make classic more vanilla than it otherwise would be 🤷‍♀️
---
Reach forge mode was awesome but Halo CE was the OG and if you got 4 XBoxes on LAN then it was epic. Best campaign in the series also.
---
As someone who likes to enjoy some beers or maybe some weed(yay canada) while playing games, I definitely learned the hard way that Sekiro is really not for me. I couldn't even get past the chained up ogre near the start of the game.
---
I guess I like the irony because IRL I have always been taller than average, so I'd hear "wow you're tall" a lot...so playing a gnome is a funny inversion of that I think.
---
I'm talking amazing in the warcraft context, in which it explores the origins of the Horde. Lets not get pedantic shall we.
---
Can't wait to play on true 144hz Vanilla. Private server client always had some weird micro stutters or screen tearing when you tried 144hz, and needed tweaking to make work.
---
&gt;What do I find? Blizzard adding in stuff from WoD(sharding) and Wrath(loot trading).
---
Imo people who oppose sharding didn't actually play vanilla, but rather popular private servers with crowded launches, and now figure that's how it must have gone down in 2004 and 2005. Vanilla didn't have a thousand people in each lowlevel zone starting out at once, all racing to questmobs or scouring for nodes in an attempt to 'corner the market'. Compared to many private server launches, leveling up in vanilla was a fairly peaceful affair.
---
I feel the same and you should not get downvoted for stating that.
---
After 20+ years of gaming I still don't understand where the fun is in taking away the challenges in a game by replacing it with a walkthrough. Your cat could follow a walk through. To me this always feels like a false accomplishment, but if some people want guides to give them a hand and to reach achievements earlier and easier, they shall do it. I have no fun using them and I learn nothing as well.
---
I just find it super boring to use guides and stating a view like that should not end in being downvoted...
---
Wrath up until they introduced LFD. That is the point when wow became shit outside of raiding.
---
I've thought about it a lot. Some things have to give, I'm ol with sharing starting zones at least rather than fighting for 30 minutes to get 8 pieces of wolf meat.
---
Wow in the day didn't have much competition, of course it wont ever have as many subs as before. A lot of previous no life neckbeards have real responsibility and kids now.
---
Do people even use that shit on retail? Last I checked it was just a meme and the only people that used it were cringe lords.
---
Be social, dont go in with a solo lone wold type of attitude. Talk with people when the opportunity provides, join groups, get into peoples discords and talk with them. The game is good on its own, but the social aspect is what makes the game so amazing. The game requires groups of people to do most things at end game and youll be with people for this all the time, so you should embrace this early on and get involved with guild voice chat and stuff like that. There will be times where youre going to need help , and they will need help which you can offer yours.
---
Nah work still had super easy heroics, multiple raid difficulties and homogenized classes before lfd
---
Man, I forgot how cool Tauren females look in Plagueheart. The headpiece on them is one of my favorite wow looks.
---
This was the beginning of wows downfall. LFD was horrible for the game.
---
BC have the worst raids imo, simply because you are forced into ranged/warlock/hunter comps to pass the first two tiers at current content. BC is meta raid comping above any other expansion, the value of melee is really low for most of the expansion etc
---
I play them because there's no goddamn way a gnome female is carrying around a huge two handed swords, much less swinging it.  
---
in Wrath I dual wielded Armageddons on my gnome female warrior and I'll never forget that.
---
but can this community go 1 hour without putting down people's class choices
---
Optional HD textures would be sooo nice.
---
nah i dont remember where i found it, will updated this if i find it again...however i read since classic is using the most updated engine of wow with new and improved pathing its going to fix alot of the exploits that were possible (i.e. DM:N king farm doesnt work on retail due to boss not being as dumb, BRD fire boss)
---
Dungeon finder was abhorrent.
---
This is EXACTLY what I fucking knew would happen. I said warriors are the only truly viable very end game tank and someone JUST HAD to chime in about fucking druids. No. Just sit. You're wrong. Druids can tank low end raids and yeah maybe a few fights in naxx but that DOES NOT mean you get to call them viable end game tanks. Show me a guild that uses druids on 4H and I'll cede the argument. Just wow.. I fucking knew there'd be a pedant attack when I posted that.
---
THAT TOO! A gnome with Ashkandi is going to look so hilarious and I love it.
---
I’ve seen this 200 times and NEVER ONCE have I noticed her.
---
Imo tbc had better class design and pvp.  Wrath was a burstfest
---
You will be greeted with a blade.
---
You should not even be taking the shatter talent for raiding, and most raid mobs can't be frozen regardless.
---
Diablo 3 has horrible.
---
Female human mages are hnng though
---
Aspartame is one of the most researched nutritional substances there is, and no dangerous effects have been found unless ingest insane amounts.
---
I was 30 back in the day. You'll be fine! ;)
---
I remember bunking off college to go and but these when they came out! So good!
---
I’ll be real with you chief, I didnt downvote you. I disagree with you, but I’m not the one downvoting you. Maybe your opinion about the game isnt exactly popular on a sub dedicated to it.
---
Also Pokemon Diamomd, Pearl and Platinum 
---
(IMO, so many memories).
---
I too would like to see TBC without flying mounts. One of the key points people seem to overlook is that flying could potentially be replaced by flight masters at outposts around Outlands. I've seen Tempest Keep and their dungeons mentioned a bunch of times, but their situation could have Alliance/Horde outposts on either side of the spaceships to solve that issue. Some content become irrelevant, e.g. the Netherwing island (at least for obtaining the nether drake). I certainly like flight paths and I think it's sad to see them being useless when you get a flying mount - a bonus about them, is that they give you a (mostly) short break where you can do other stuff IRL.
---
Didn't hunters just shit all over rogues in vanilla regardless?
---
Anyone can pvp with any gear?
---
Its been a while but I remember people being able to use some kind of monetary system in the game.  Maybe something that uses bronze, silver, and gold....
---
Lol how much of this is a joke and how much of it is a hard reality?
---
You know just yesterday I was reminiscing about the old times and remembered how you'd get random whispers from people you've never even met before asking you to heal dungeons.
---
Trying to name my character Trump before it’s taken
---
Warriors scale really well with gear, without it they’re pretty shit. You don’t need a group so much as a healbot.
---
Don't roll a rogue. Leveling is going to be a pain in the ass. You cant deal with more than one mob at a time without popping a cooldown. You need to be meticulous with your pulls cause you have no real AoE. You're good at running away, but that doesn't give you that much of an advantage. When yiu get to 60, youll lose your weapons and raid spot to warriors. But you have ganking, which is nice until the opposed faction gathers a squad with the sole purpose of hunting you down.
---
So true. I forget how to do it, but you could pull up a list of all shamans in a specific zone and just have a copy paste and launch it to all Shamans. Lol
---
That’s not really what I meant. I was asking if I’ll have a bad time in PvP without crazy gear if I have a dedicated group
---
This!
---
I gotta disagree. The fact that there are cross realm pugs is evidence enough for me to not even bother to play retail
---
I hate to break it to you but druid is actually one of the lowest dps in the game. Warriors actually do over twice your damage in naxx. It's not 5 fewer seconds for a kill, it's the difference between actually getting the kill or not.
---
Be careful what you wish for
---
Just to be different than the previous comments, I’m looking forward to playing an Orc Shaman. I was alliance for the vast majority of my wow time (up to legion) and I am looking forward to the greener grass on the other side.
---
So average gear + healbot = strong? Or just meh until gear
---
I haven’t played since roughly 2008. I had a Tauren Druid and wanted to do it again but was thinking Warrior.  Opinions on Warrior or Tauren. Semi casual play style.
---
Loved this one but could only dream of actually obtaining it when I used to play during vanilla
---
"Demo" as in the Blizzcon demo client, right?
---
Anybody know of a guide on Druid macros/keybinds? I want to play Druid really bad but I’ve had a hard time with finding a comfortable way to bind spells between the different forms.
---
It has some nasty looking spikes for sure
---
Haha no problem! Do you like the recent reddit post bit, or think it would be better without it
---
I mean, assuming you aren't talking about rolling around in level 52 world BOE greens, i'd say if you have something like the dreadforge retaliator, and a pocket healer (or better), you'll be fine for phase 1 &amp; 2.
---
I'd sure as hell swap an epic weapon for a blue + a healer hypothetically speaking, not that the two are mutually exclusive.
---
No worries. If it wasn't your cup of tea, that's cool. Obviously, Ubisoft kept on with a formula for a lot of things that are consistent throughout the series, so there's going to be some repetition in mission types, etc.
---
In my mind, though, Black Flag is the defining entry in the series (future games failed to capitalize on the diversity of gameplay mechanics, story and replayability), and a big part of that is that they really stepped up adding a lot more kinds of interesting game play: the ship to ship combat was incredibly complex and became more challenging over time. The gameplay, hand to hand combat and stealth systems are at their best and the hunting/crafting mechanic was interesting without becoming a massive timesuck.
---
The story is also the best of the series, but you mentioned that wasn't an issue for you.
---
Been playing on a private Wotlk server :) going to relive the wow I had when I was in it full time raiding and all that before I delve back into my teen years with classic
---
I think it's great. As someone who is in no rush to 60 and usually has 2-3 characters, it really helps with those slow leveling areas.
---
How many people are already getting in fights with their SO over WoW /being on the cpmputer?
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
This could be the worst idea I’ve ever read
---
I'm waiting till 40 and have my mount to fucking do it.
---
You must've played on a dead server or not at all during vanilla. Mannoroth was full of twinks.
---
Warriors are very gear dependant and will suck ass if they don't have someone dispelling/healing them if thats what you're asking
---
IIRC, the priest Confessor's ZG set (or trinket?) has some kind of bonuses for smite priest.
---
Gamers understand, but non gamers it's another matter. People are so judgmental.
---
I'll live my life in the shadows like a drug addict :D
---
I'm a software developer so I can always say I spend my time on a side project :o
---
The issue with displaying faction balance is that you assume players will preferentially join servers with poor faction balance, and on the side of the less populous faction. This is not necessarily true.
---
Players might very well just avoid all but the most well balanced servers, consigning the rest to slow depopulation and death. Or they might well decide that they want to join the "dominant faction", and thus exacerbate the problem.
---
Faction locking introduces greater issues, most notably because it blocks new sign-ups from playing with friends. And that is a surefire way to lose potential subscribers, IMO.
---
Sure I have nothing against dresses but it is somewhat limiting to not get to wear cool armour. I'm sure female mages would agree.
---
With OK gear and in a group (somebody healing them) they can be very effective and still an incredible nuisance to deal with depending on their skill level. Obviously if you have exceptional gear they will be harder to kill and dish out more damage making them powerhouses in BGs. 
---
So maybe you won’t be making YouTube videos of you blowing up the other team but you will have success and be a viable tool with a group
---
Don't play a Warlock for one simple reason:
---
It's gonna be a fucking pain in the ass having to manage all those soul shards! Not only do you have to keep using Drain Soul on every mob due to the Improved Drain Soul talent which gives you 100% mana regen for 10s after every kill. But you have to either use a macro or an addon to constantly delete the shard or your bags will be full.
---
Not only that but you have to make sure you get the last hit otherwise it won't work (admittedly this might not be an issue in Classic).
---
Also, during raids you'll have to stop halfway through and you and all the other Warlocks have to teleport out of the raid to go farm 40+ soul shards while everyone else waits. This is because Blizzard chose to remove XP gains from the trash inside raids so you can't Drain Soul them. And to add insult to injury, the Dragonkin outside Onyxia's lair are all lvl 40's, so they'll be grey to a lvl 60. And there aren't enough mobs outside of Blackrock to go around for more than 1 Warlock.
---
And like a Hunter, you have to sacrifice a bag slot for a soul pouch. You don't *have* to of course, but it makes farming shards 100% easier and the biggest soul bag holds more space than the biggest regular bag so you are kinda forced to use one anyway. 
---
Finally in raids you're relegated to the position of curse bitch. Either Elements or Shadow. And only the class leader gets to use Agony, and subsequently do the most damage. Get used to Mages laughing at you.
---
Why would I have to be careful wishing for weather affects to be as they were back in vanilla?
---
I think that's a great point. It really sucks the RPG element out of the game when instead of being this class with all these options you just pick a spec and are locked into 1 single rotation for every instance of combat.
---
I've been checking bis gear lists and while im sure they make good pieces of gear they are very rarely bis according to these sites. I plan on playing holy paladin, are these sets useful in anyway outside of filler pieces? Are they useful for pvp for the armor?
---
It should run better since they've been optimizing the game a lot, and even more if it gets dx12 optimizations.
---
With you, bro.. I'm so ready to no-life Classic the wait is killing me. We're close though...
---
You should both make alts that you can play when the other is not there.
---
You can use the alts to either be the class/race you wanted to play, or they can be alts to benefit your mains. You can run around and gather mats for your professions alts when you wife isn't around.
---
Overall, just play how you want to play the game. Otherwise it might feel more like work than play and you might lose interest if it's not a class/race you enjoy.
---
https://youtu.be/7HClxMq3aDI
---
Agreed.
---
I remember leveling a hunter and doing 1v2s often. 
---
Like I once freeze trapped a warlock and killed the warrior, then killed him. They were like 5 levels lower than me. But it felt really cool at the time.
---
If you hit 60 fresh with greens you’re goin to be pretty garbage, low damage and high miss chance. You’ll notice it during leveling and that won’t change at 60. Until you run your dungeons and get a solid amount of BiS gear. At which point you’ll deal a fair amount of damage, and hit much less if at all depending on your hit %.
---
You’ll continue to scale with gear, more so than any class. Also the larger the gear discrepancy between you and whoever you’re fighting the more you’ll dump on them. 
---
Only issue is warriors can be controlled and kited to an oblivion and essentially make you useless. No matter how good your gear, if you can’t get to your target you’re shit outta luck. This is where your healbot comes in, dispels CC and keeps you alive so you can run around crushing everyone. 
---
TLDR; shit gear + healer = you’re shit, decent gear + healer = you’re strong, great gear + healer = you’re the scariest thing on the planet. 
---
But remove the healer from any of those and you’re gonna have a tough and annoying time
---
I'm going with Herbalism. I'm going to make myself a Robe of the Void at 60 and then drop Tailoring for Alchemy. I'll have a supply of low level mats set aside to help boost me up. I'd like to raid endgame and everything I've read indicates that farming consumable is a key activity to prepare for raids, so I figure I'll be in good shape if I can make them myself. 
---
I can sell herbs while I level to supply my income if necessary, but I don't have to worry about buying a mount either!
---
That's why I basically lived in Thunderbluff back in the day. Plus the bank and AH are closer to each other.
---
Feral druid: "meow"
---
This is reddit, the answer is no.
---
Very interested in this, if you have any info!  I loved original CoH!
---
... pretty much ever guild with "decent" player regardless most of the specs clears vanilla content so your argument is invalid.
---
Or have you ever seen any vanilla boss enrage cause of too low dps
---
Consider this: the conscious management of Mana is something that separates classes. Non Mana classes, plus druids, don't really have this problem, nor shaman's and paladins (to as much of an extent anyway). The fact that you'll drop half your Mana on rebuff for cloth casters is an important part of the game.
---
You may want to reconsider your spec, your buffs you use, or how you interact with the other players to counteract this. If you're a lock, Mana tap after and use a macro to ask a druid for a downrank rejuv.
---
I look forward to striking terror into the eyes of many horde with my dwarf rogue =]
---
Oooh! Time to start a new world!
---
...and despair at any of the resource packs I use ever being updated for 1.14.
---
Why is it so dang hard to find a good medieval pack that gets continued support? :'-(
---
Very cool story, and from a fellow Illidan-ian as well!
---
Is the server up?  Nah, it's still Illidown.
---
1. Usually makes no difference but occasionally very annoying.
---
2. You can have 1 permanent enchant and 1 temporary buff. So one of  Crusader/+15 Agi/Fiery and one of Poison/WF/Sharpening Stone.
---
That shield "of natures wrath" is the best Ele shield until 1.10 when people can kill lord valthalak
---
Don't remember the details on 2, but for 1 it's not really that big a deal. It's a bit more running if someone dies mid-dungeon, but ... so what? People need healers, so you'll get groups easily and it's better to have to run in case something goes wrong than it is to have to wait longer to even start a dungeon because you can't find a healer.
---
Loved the video. I’m not in any rush, I’ll certainly be running plenty dungeons but there was plenty I’m guilty of that I know I shouldn’t be doing - AH I’m looking at you.
---
Yes it's perfect for DevP. No other spell really costs that much for it to be worth it. If you're really desperate for burst you can use it on mind blast for the crit but the dps gain is very low really mana is a far bigger problem for a spriest and IF/DevP helps out a ton in this regard.
---
Warlocks only have one buff to cast though. Demon armor doesn't cost that much mana does it?
---
Check out Hand of Fate 2 on steam. Been pretty good so far
---
Yes, please please please.
---
The cooldown management is also one of the fun challanges as a rouge, like do you need to use vanish? Or can you find a way to restealth? Gouge/slow deadzone stealth for example.
---
Sounds like you should just play retail wow since you dont like challenging content
---
Of course I've seen bosses enrage, I played in the old days. My guild also had enhance shaman, feral druids, and other shit specs with us so of course that shit happened occasionally.
---
Yup, several things came to mind. Most of em involved butts.
---
Same dude...
---
i just created a group for us with this amount of hype, to stick around and socialize + exchange info..
---
https://www.facebook.com/groups/346507426221783/
---
gather the community and lets get it on!
---
It’s hell to solo level as a warrior (at least until 40 but even then), it’s godly to level with a healer.
---
They also want people to be able to quest 1-10. Those of us who played Nostalrius launch never 4get. Tbh though I prefer having a ton people at launch it just makes it so exciting to me.
---
It realistically means you'll have 5 or so debuffs to play with. A shadow priest can take up 3 by themselves so yeah... it's nice but it's really a very small change. It doesn't mean all your warlocks can go affliction and do full DoT rotations lol.
---
If they want it to be 1.12, they really need this. Weather was such a nice thing they added during vanilla :)!
---
I don’t think my laptop can handle anything above vanilla but it’s nice to have the option for sure.
---
So I think this is a really solid idea that needs some tweaks.  I think that the lock has to have 2 criteria to make it work (and maybe some more but I haven't had much time to think about this).
---
1 - They can't lock out people with characters on the server already, and I think players with characters on the server should get a limited number of invites for friends who want to join them.  Anyone else, however, would be locked out of creating a character on that faction.
---
2 - The lock should happen early on.  As another commenter pointed out, if it occurs once the balance is 80-20, nobody will join the side of 20.  I think it really needs to happen at about 60-40 so that people won't be dissuaded by joining the smaller pop faction.
---
Digimon world, Digimon world 2003, Digimon world 4
---
Because fucking everything takes soul shards. Wipe and need to resummon a pet? Soul shard. Want to summon? Soul shard. That 6s cast fireball is also a soulshard and so is shadowburn. You just need too many. You shouldn't have to use a pve farmed resource just to activate insta casts in pvp. So dumb. And I don't think soul shard bags existed in the beginning.
---
It isn't unreasonable to use Inner Focus to get a free Devouring Plague, but there are better uses. I tend to make a macro to use it in conjunction with a Greater Heal because it's a large mana cost and it can crit.
---
They need to have an auto assign server function.   
---
Let players choose the realm but if they have no preference of playing with friends on a specific server include the option to let blizzard assign you one based on the current faction split and general populations automatically. 
---
This will mitigate singular faction heavy servers and the impact of tourists in one swoop.
---
My friend you must listen to me. You must. Right when you hit level 10, go straight for 5/5 tactical mastery. Can stance dance and immediately disarm and melee that attack you. Can also charge, zerk stance, intervene if they get away. It will make your life astronomically easier.
---
The racial bonuses are trivial compared to getting Blessing of Kings.
---
Damm you, found myself singing the song while I walked my dog and thinking of wow
---
I've read that 3 times and still have no f*cking idea.....
---
Ay, no worries man. Even I still get patch information wrong from time to time.
---
I got two questions, so whatever you're willing to answer I appreciate. 
---
1) Regarding end game DPS meters, how do classes fluctuate across the different tiers of content? I'm not a minmaxer by any means, but I was speaking to a lock friend the other day and he was talking about how much better warlock dps gets into AQ and Naxx and showed me some examples, so it got me curious as to how that is for the other classes. (I only raided into midway through AQ40 in original vanilla and never had a dps meter addon, let alone gave a fuck about any of that back then) 
---
2) How good do crafting professions (LW, BS, Tailor, Eng) work when it comes to making money? I only did gathering profs when I played and never had a crafting profession. I'm not necessarily looking to make a lot of money, just want to know if it's possible and how easy it is. I'm going to do a crafting prof cause I want to, even if it's a gold sink, but I just want to know what I'm getting into. The only discussion I hear about it is that enchanting can make hella gold once you max it and get recipes, and I know a little about engineering, but I don't know shit about the others.
---
&gt;'m definitely not planning on joining a guild where everyone refuses to move on their own 
---
Yes you are. Do you really think you're going to make it to the instance and NOT start summoning people so you can start earlier?
---
That T2 Judgement gear isn't going to get itself.
---
This is my own initiative and contribution to the big community which is seemingly just getting bigger and bigger! Feel free to join, invite your friends and so on! Discussion and tips and tricks is the thing here!
---
Why are people still using spybook?
---
There are like 2 gazillion other mages you have to compete with, and most of your gear will look like shit.
---
In the old days I agree, but compared to the knowledge of today you kill bosses easy
---
At least you got fancy bags for all of your class related crap.
---
But they will, updated graphics and foilage will shift the landscape in wpvp, as you can hide in bushes which someone else cant see.
---
Or even something along the lines of. If you played on X,Y, or Z servers.. join server #14.
---
It's the same as asking for balanced classes. You'll never have it.
---
Unbalanced factions often drove one faction to push harder due to being the underdog and lead to server firsts, more focus in BGs due to wanting the win from longer queue's plus there will always be one faction with more on any given server than another.
---
Not to mention, depending how skewed it is and what the ACTUAL login metrics look like (not just created character metrics) it could often mean more fun in WPvP simply due to there being more of the opposing faction available to fight at any given time. This also has the opposite effect.
---
There's a million reasons that have already been discussed in many threads prior. The bottom line is that these things sorted themselves back in the day.
---
Serious balance issues that don't get sorted are usually found in pservers.
---
It depends on the exact level and on mob you're fighting really, it's pretty obvious when you're playing. If something lives long enough to get full use out of it and using the mana won't slow you down and it's a mana efficient damage option at the time? Then yeah it's probably a good option. It often isn't though. The maths changes constantly as you get new ranks and get gear but it's very easy to see how much damage each of your spells do and how much they cost so you just work it out as you play.
---
That´s mostly because levelling changed completely. Back in Vanilla, it was about exploration, getting to know this new mysterious world and overcoming obstacles together.
---
Can´t really do that when it´s your 10th character and instead of 50 people levelling in the same zone, there are 5 (2 if we removed cross-realm...which is actually something they did for RP servers and there were times when I went through entire zone without seeing another player on Argent Dawn).
---
Man I could write an essay on the amount of stuff that did such a good job of contributing to world building that made WoW so good, and weather is a huge one. Seems like retail WoW has lost sight of this aspect almost completely. 
---
Can't wait for weather and day/night rotations.
---
Yup
---
Thats too far. The game should be vanilla. No updated graphics. Thats how the game is meant to be played.
---
Instead of making it so people cant make characters, wouldnt it make more sense just to restrict how many of a faction can be online at one time? Between 50 and 60 percent of the servers max pop?
---
Enjoy doing the shaman quests not
---
THPS 1, 2 and 3
---
Nope. Gave mine already.
---
Not to mention it's been discussed to death. This subforum and even the official forums just keep going around in circles with bad ideas.
---
If everyone kept up and didn't want to hear their own voice we wouldn't get repeat threads and keep beating dead horses.
---
Take that name and never play the character.  Your server will be better off for it.  Trade or zone chat full of political non warcraft talk is cancer.
---
/moonkin dance
---
Regarding 2: The crafting professions definitely *can* make money if you know what you're doing. Tailors make a ton off of bags, especially early on in a server's life. I know leatherworkers make good money on the Devilsaur set, though you'll be competing for the leather if you choose to farm it yourself. Check out [Frostadamus](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwvBlnNJoP8EEUnR3laqbGg) on Youtube. He has a series about the different professions and is a good starting place for moneymaking.
---
Our server had the entire alliance camping the portal and killing every single horde player for an hour when it was released. Such a great time it was hilarious.
---
I've watched a lot of private server guild videos though and they all have like 2-3 druids in the raid, all healing.
---
I'm pretty sure it's impossible to hit 60 inn4 or 5 days. IIRC Joana's record was 116 hours /played to hit 60. So, I would expect at least 7-10 days before realm first 60s.
---
&gt;Diablo 1/2/PoE(or GD)
---
I beat super meat boy but okay there bud
---
This was not my experience. If I got the drop on a hunter it was usually game over for them.
---
All the pserver try hard warriors will be spread over many servers and regions. 
---
Many others will drop out by level 30 in the levelling process, I think warriors aren’t gonna be as common as people think. 
---
Many of the wotlk and later people playing vanilla type content for the first time will be in for a rude awakening when they roll their ‘leet deeps warr’.
---
That's funny, this picture is where I decided I wanted to roll a dragon.
---
I'm playing through Warcraft III again to hype myself up for the story and setting for WoW classic.  Might scratch the itch.
---
Where on Earth are you getting updated terrain and shit from? People are only talking about character models, not even animations for god's sake.
---
10 million in the first months? I don’t think that’s likely at all.
---
Still gonna use the same name tbh
---
Yes but if they knew you were there, they had so many ways to fuck you over. And at one point their pet would actually follow you even after stealthing.
---
i have no friends
---
Yeah that’s gonna be a no from me dawg
---
Top kek
---
Great vid 😎
---
Mages had the weirdest variance. They were frost in molten core because everything was immune to fire. Then fire and arcane were nice in BWL, and by AQ40/Naxx they had so much crits for rolling ignites that you wanted your raid to have like 8+ mages because the ignites would all roll together and do thousands of DPS
---
really nothing can be done at this point to recreate vanilla launch. It will be very different this time around considering the wealth of info available and pservers.  People had no idea what they were doing during launch. 
---
Faction balance is a bit tricky.  I don't think showing the faction balance is necessarily a good idea but possibly capping the faction population.  so if the pop cap is 3000 than cap the faction at 1750 or 1800(arbitrary numbers)?  Still allows for faction imbalance but doesn't completely destroy a server.  Streamers are going to bring a whole new dynamic to the game that just didnt exist back then.  Eventually Blizzard would need to offer free transfers from dead/faction dominated servers to more stable servers with low to moderate population. 
---
 A server completely dominated by one faction has a lot of people waiting around forever to join a BG while the other faction has most(if not all) 48+ flightmasters camped.  So i think having some type of server sign up pre launch could be a possible solution.
---
tl:dr----a prelaunch server sign up might go a long way in mitigating the number of dead and faction dominated servers.  Whether or not this happens classic launch will be very different during the launch phase of vanilla.

---
Have you played on private servers tho?
---
Sigh I really dont want to get in an argument with you dear internet stranger.
---
I surely and non ironically agree: yes fury does way more dps than feral, but that's not what you have ferals for. Does a warrior buff his group? (Beside AP shout) - no. Does he provide anything else? Well maybe offtanking sometimes and getting hit way harder than any feral hybrid..i really dont wanna go too deep in the topic
---
People will share accounts. 
---
Person A levels while person B sleeps and vice versa.
---
If you have a pocket healer assigned to just you, youll be invincible 1v1
---
I used to just /who shaman barrens and look at their levels to decide who I sent a whisper too. I'm glad people back then were usually pretty nice about those kinds of whispers and a lot of the time actually went to the dungeon with you!
---
Searing pain you say? Aside from rare instances you won't lose 1v1.
---
Sure homie. Everyone got his opinion, it's okay to disagree :)
---
............The druid brings nothing except for mark of the wild. Not really getting your point here.
---
My actual main is a Draenei Shaman i've had for ages, so I need to reserve that name and think of something else for the character I intend to play Classic on.
---
These are the struggles.
---
There are some addons for floating damage numbers that allow you to add things like skill icons and different animations/fontsizes iirc too for crits.
---
I really enjoy that, but that's mostly because Vanilla damage numbers were just that much more satisfying in comparison to those over the top 7-digit ones.
---
A lot of it is pretty true although your DPS in MC is actually quite good and in BWL it's acceptable, not great though.  After that it really lags behind.  You do have trouble getting 5 man groups though, even though a good hunter is a big asset to a 5 man.  Problem is a bad hunter is a big liability and there are more bad ones than good (because it's so easy to level) so people hold it against the class in general.
---
The bag space thing imo isn't a big deal because hunters probably have to carry close to the least amount of alternative gear.  When healers carry DPS and situational items and tanks carry DPS and tank gear, hunters pretty much have one set for everything.
---
Also people will shit on you if you try to roll on gear that isn't mail agility gear or a ranged weapon in a 5 man.  People are just kind of selfish and dicks.  In raid things like Drake Fang Talisman which is BiS for hunters for a long time will go to rogues and warriors first usually, as well as weapons.  Other than that Hunter is lucky because they use their T1-2-3 sets in full so they aren't competing with other classes for those (well, t1-2).  So as a Hunter in MC you'll be one of the first classes to finish your main set but you will need to wait to get non-rhok weapons until everyone else has them or better.
---
We had a similar experience. Pretty much the entire area was alliance so we had that gate on lock. It was so fun
---
Judging increases your downtime. You should just put up a seal and autoattack.
---
No really. 60 levels of no on demand damage buttons.
---
Worst combat class in the game, and it isn't even close.
---
Answer my question: did you play on any retaim serv?
---
You’ll need tailoring at max level certainly for a Priest until you out level the gear through raiding. Even then you might want to hang on to tailoring for the bags to sell which require leather. So taking skinning while leveling is a good option.
---
Pserver fresh launch always have players hitting 60 in under 5 days played. They have it down to a science.
---
The Classic servers where entire guilds from pserver head to will see similar results baring the inconvenience of not already having their entire addon and macro load out ready on day 1.
---
Please blizzard, if you really want Classic to be true to vanilla the old weather effects is a must have.
---
Rogue
---
Shaman
---
Priest
---
There will be like 5 people who do that. This guy is saying that tons of people are going to hit 60 in 4 or 5 days, which is absurd.
---
It's objectively true. Of the 14 viable specs, they have 3 of them.
---
0/0/0
---
Fury Warriors and Rogues will typically top meters all the way through, but as melee, they normally have more mechanics to worry about that can kill them, so that should be considered. 
---
Mages are solid throughout, but warlocks will top them as you get to late tiers. Warlocks are lower than mages, but scale much better and as you said will overtake mages late, and can beat out the melee in select fights. 
---
Hunters can compete in the area between mages and warlocks early, but their DPS suffers later. At least 2 will always have a spot, though. 
---
Shadow priests are pretty bad throughout, you will normally only carry one to buff the warlocks, and maybe none until BWL. Balance druids have major mana issues, and you pretty much won't see them. Ele/Enhance shaman don't really see use as well, as a resto shaman can provide their buffs with cetain specs. You will almost never see a Ret pally, they might be able to wield the Nightfall axe and keep up judgements, but a hunter can wield the axe better and holy pallys can judge just as well.
---
Obviously fighting 2v1 will make things easy, but no, ungeared warriors aren't very useful at all. While leveling being geared shouldn't be an issue. As long as you do dungeons now and then you are fine, as for 60, it can be hard to get gear. Getting a big phat 2hander and just random blues/greens will do a lot for you, something like the arcanite reaper if you have mining and don't mind spending some money will do great. Another option is a 2handed sword from stat live that with 1.12 itemization will be really good aswell. 
---
With that, you will be fairly strong in grouped pvp for a while until raiding gear takes over.
---
I’m only experienced with Paladin and you want Mining/Engineering for that. Don’t forget your first aid, fishing and cooking too.
---
Yeah, there won’t be a lot, but there will be a few
---
I don't believe any of this.
---
Good point..changing the rules :)
---
These a great points, they were my untold concerns.
---
Have a Healthstone, Soulstone, and Bandages on you at all times. Buff Demon Armor, Life Tap, and then bandage or use Healthstone. You can also Life Tap and use Death Coil to get your health back. If you are that concerned about having so much mana try a Imp mana battery build and take your phased Imp's mana.
---
I love that, putting a brand new expansion and content on hold for that long to kill those idiots. They tried charging through on mounts but it never worked 😁
---
1) Most of them remain relatively static except for warlock and hunter. Warlocks don't quite pick up until ZG where they can finally get some spell hit, and hunters taper off steeply after BWL as they barely improve from beyond tier due to weird itemization. Mages will also appear to skyrocket in AQ40 and Naxx but it's mostly because of the way ignite works. Mages do get better when they can spec fire but it's not as big a jump as people think. They'll see one mage doing 1600 DPS in some screenshot and not realize that a third of it is from the collective ignite stack. In the end, the top four DPS classes are approximately equal and way ahead of everything else.
---
2) If you can get a rare recipe that people will pay you to use, you can make some good money with crafting. The thing about rare recipes is that they don't stay rare forever. Enchanting is a bit more dependable because people will always need things enchanted. Without some sought-after recipe, actual equipment crafting isn't a particularly great moneymaker, most people would be better off just farming gold somewhere. Engineering can make some money with bullets and some of the PvP gadgets, but there's nothing too expensive in engineering and most people will probably have the profession themselves. Alchemy is quite nice as well, especially if you can get a flask recipe, but you kind of tie yourself to herbalism when you're trying to make money off of it.
---
How far in naxx did you get in vanilla? You know, back when it actually mattered.
---
It's been a while since I played my lock but Demon Armor at the highest rank eats alot of mana. I think you need to summon a demon if you sacrificed it or if it died before. Also detect invisibility was a buff.
---
17/17/17
---
Not crucial at all
---
Valid points. I think doing this would be perfect.
---
Interning theory and all of that could potentially happen, however I think  Blizzard hasn't planned past the time line they've released and will just adapt as the game develops meaning no one can predict anything beyond that point and all those points would only occur if the population grew that much which is a huge uncertainty In itself (who knows if the next greatest mmo is released in 3 years). In my opinion at the moment blizzard are just trying to re create classic as best they can to bring as many as possible back to the game (returning players are the main audience) and they then have 2 mmos to maintain attracting 2 different auidences.
---
 However I agree with your concerns about realm balance issues especially in pvp realms. One can just hope they have smart mechanics in place as its an issue they'll probably foresee. The competitive nature of gaming has certainly increased and it could ruin elements of the game if too much of it crept in but I think the balance of the amount of casual players there will be would help with that.
---
First aid, yes. The others, no
---
I'd just let her do her.  Let her toy with various classes and try not to pressure her into trying to keep up with your main.  Any pressure on having to level up a specific class can lead to disinterest.
---
Join her with your alt when / if she wants you to.  Class combo efficiency isn't all that important to a new player.
---
Remember nearly everyone had changed mains while leveling up after figuring out what class they really enjoy playing.  That process took months to figure out for most people.
---
What talents though?
---
Leveling a profession once 60 is an absolute slog without the ability to travel quickly unless at 60 you can buy all the mats from the AH to level up a profession.
---
You can do what you want but I'm not rushing leveling and leveling all of my professions while I level.
---
PepeLaugh
---
What about how many mats to get from one upgrade to another? (Ei: minimum 75 linen to get from regular bandage to heavy)
---
Something like this, just haphazardly scattered about
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/AuAMBc1HhYPAA84QiQ
---
Should you pre shield a tank before they pull?
---
Marginal for some. Some classes have so much utility that using a GCD on Eng vs their own abilities was more of a choice and not a benefit. One of the best priest pvp'rs I knew was an alchemist because of this very reason.
---
Basically you are generalizing when I was specifically referring to a mage vs shaman fight with the unique additional counters that could assist the mage likely more than the shaman because Elemental spec likely holds the edge over mage by default capacity.
---
early on though, like within the first few weeks the servers are live...not too many people will have money to buy these items.
---
You won't get to use majority of your DoTs on main targets in raids because mages and melee need them to carry their sorry asses.
---
Yeah that could work; although would it be more important to fill servers first then go on to the next or simply assign people to realms so there's alot of average populated realms?
---
I dont know if it wins, but Morrowind Obivion and Skyrim are up there.
---
You don’t use downranked heals running dungeons on way to 60.
---
5 rogues, "xXganking squadXx", PvP of course
---
i tried my best and i think https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LhhcZxEhZEb00eu is wis talent build overall
---
Hey guys! I was an avid player of WoW back in the day, off and on from around 2007 to 2011. after branching out to console games, I'm interested in learning about WoW again and how much it's changed since I quit. what websites should I check out to see what's happened since I left and if it's worth it to play again? (and of course, whether I should go with classic or not)
---
Spyro 1/2/3.
---
I’ll assume you’re talking about tier sets because I have absolutely no clue what you’re talking about otherwise. 
---
From my experience, T1 is hybrid junk that no spec wants, T2 has the raw stats for PVP healing but doesn’t see much use in PVE, T2.5 is beastly for ret PVP and T3 is BIS for healing in PVP and PVE because it’s T3.
---
60% mana is not gonna get you through most pulls.
---
Ooooh increased range. Very interesting thanks!
---
I raided as melee during TBC and I absolutely agree that it was unnecessarily frustrating, but nobody was forced into meta cheese comps for T4 and T5.
---
I had a dell optiplex that could actually play the game pretty well... until the gauntlet in aq40 anyway. Oh man it was really nice seeing the game in glorious 5 fps in that hallway.
---
http://armory.twinstar.cz/talent-calc.php?cid=1&amp;d=vanilla&amp;tal=0532032002000000005050302020000000055000000500200000
---
Yeah this kind of idea is unlikely to happen but one can hope I guess.
---
It did sort itself out back in the days but, I ended up playing on Illidan - US as horde when I started in wotlk, was lucky enough at the time that there were a decent amount of alliance players. But as time went on it simply was no fun anymore as it was 98% horde.
---
Let's be optimistic for the best :D
---
They're really just something fun to do if you want. Probably even most people ignore them, you don't have to do them by any stretch.
---
A lot changed compared to back then. I know you dont wanna adapt to new times
---
"Your time is over old man." XD
---
Nah kidding have a nice evening mate, all the best :)
---
Dungeon finder was the final blow to socialization in the game. It "made sense" only to investors catering to the massive amounts of casual players....who then dropped the game when cata launched with hard dungeons.
---
As others have stated, it's not a priority when leveling. Raiding is when fishing and cooking become important, other than trolling dungeons on easy mode.
---
So if you rush to raid, that is likely your rush to get it done. If you do it leveling vs a late game grind, is entirely up to you.
---
&gt;  BC had the best overall raids imo 
---
I echo these sentiments. Gruul's, Mag's, Kara, SSC, TK: The Eye, Hyjal, BT, Sunwell.. all bangers in their own right. So many amazing memories of TBC raiding. WOTLK was pretty amazing too, Ulduar /drool
---
You should definitely start yanking. Can recommend.
---
The thing is though, I've had it happen in the past and recently on pservers with mostly everyone rolling greed and then a class who clearly can't use the item rolling need and being like "oh, I'm gonna mail it to my alt" or "oh, I thought I could equip that" and after the run, you see the item end up on the AH.
---
It's just safer to roll need, to avoid dumb shit like that.
---
eeeeeeeeh that would go against the idea of playing a game. I mean we bought the game we pay monthly for a game, if I have 1 character on 1 realm I wanna play it. If any realm balancing mechanic would happen I unfortunately don't think that would work out very well.
---
It *was* true for a while. At some point it was fixed but imagine the perspective of someone who played while it was too bright. All they remember is that the nights were wrong. Hopefully they're seeing these posts and learning.
---
1 thread below
---
But see I'll be out of there before you have your twink. I'll be waiting for you on my 60 (;
---
Create a fantasy team :)
---
Okay?
---
If you feel the need to comment then say that it’s already been discussed to death.. saying pointless shit like “nope” doesn’t tell anyone anything, it just makes the people on this sub look shitty and dismissive lol
---
If you are saccing your demon, that's a big time, mana and soul shard cost to get it back at the GY. If the demon survived your death though, I remember it respawning with you in BGs. 
---
Also, detect invisibility was pretty useless aside from dispel fodder. And if you're casting it for that, don't forget unending breath.
---
Not being able to get a dungeon group is untrue. Hunter CC is reliable and their damage is good in dungeons. Their damage only really falls off in the AQ40 patch.
---
You'll be infamous in a day.
---
Who's the healer?
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LhrcZxxhZEMxI0h0b](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LhrcZxxhZEMxI0h0b)
---
&gt; 10 man raids were still pretty hard compared to modern day normals.
---
A lot of things back then were hard compared to the faceroll crap of today.
---
But 10mans in WOTLK were literally designed to be easier than 25mans, hence why they had lower level loot. My personal experience in WOTLK, 10man was way easier. My guild's 10man group cleared almost every bit of hardmode/heroic/achievement content, whereas the 25man group never got heroic LK or heroic Anub, nor any of the harder Ulduar stuff.
---
Totally agree; Free transfers would be great if a realm goes sour. Pre-sign ups would work great too.
---
Fishing and cooking aren't crucial at all, **but** they can be really good money makers. There are a bunch of guides showing how you can fish the mats to level cooking. If you're the type to watch a movie on a second monitor or something, you can fiddle around and level fishing at the same time. Not important, but it can be a big help to your finances if you do it right.
---
I'm always a fan of taking a crafting profession that benefits your character directly, so leatherworking/skinning or herbalism/alchemy are good choices for a leather wearer. Herb/alch will probably net you more money along the way because consumables are ... well, consumed, so the need will always be there - especially right before new content is released. Skinning is a good, efficient way to make money as you level. You'll mostly be vendoring the leather you skin if you don't need it to level leatherworking, but it's a big boost to your cash flow if you do some farming of skinnable mobs.
---
The feel.. :(
---
I'd argue First Aid is a *huge* benefit to classes that can't self heal (Rogue, Warrior, etc.) while leveling. At level 60, I'd argue almost all classes should have maxed First Aid for the occasional use (or common use, for some classes) while raiding.
---
Fishing/Cooking matters less as you can buy those items and use them easily, albeit it'll be expensive if you're pushing hard for raids.
---
&gt; I think this game climaxed with Ulduar
---
Ditto. That's when I left the game, right before the Trials raid came out and when I hung out with friends who were still playing I realized I wasn't missing much. Though ICC did look pretty neat I will give them that.
---
NA?
---
It's not that bad, but unless you can get Felstriker, the pre-bis swords are a lot better than the pre-bis daggers. The Dal'Rend set is really, really good. Lobotomizer won't be available until Phase 3 when AV opens. While MC does have three epic daggers, it also has Brutality Blade, and there's Vis'kag from Onyxia.
---
Combat daggers isn't far behind swords, and even theorycrafts ahead in some tiers, but Seal Fate daggers requires high crit to work properly. You shouldn't try to play that spec until at least the end of BWL.
---
That sounds badass. Imp Mana battery. Im a noob I didn't know anything after all.
---
Salt shaker on 3 day CD for LW. Keep in mind that those moneymakers are lvl 35+ since you need to train the profession over 225, which requires lvl 35. 
---
Iirc 19 twinks on pservers would fish a lot to make their money for gear/enchants.
---
I want people toi cry on forums and people to make strategies to kill us 😁
---
Not crucial but if you are playing solo it’s a decent way to make some gold. buff foods are crucial to raid progression - for all those other players.
---
One thing I've observed on a new private server is that a lot of people take "take skinning and another gathering profession" seriously.  This depresses the price of leather sufficiently that it's sometimes worthwhile to buy up leather and turn it into vendor trash.
---
Unending breath haha!
---
I guess I buffed Invis in to find rogues in AB.
---
pala, priest, wl, mage, warrior
---
Do not play a prot warrior. 
---
When DPS don't manage their threat it's your fault.  When they do pull threat they run away instead of bringing the mob back to you.  No one uses focus target, so unless you are very verbal the mage will critical a fireball on a mob you have little to no threat on.  
---
You have to learn to stance dance, and manage a resource that isn't there in the beginning of a fight, when you need it most and is there in abundance when you don't, at the end of a fight.  
---
It's your fault when things go terribly wrong, even when it's not, and when things go smoothly you don't get the credit. 
---
Leveling is super slow.  You won't die, but your dps is shit. Even with shield slam fully buffed, it's just painful. 
---
The hunter will always forget to TURN OFF FUCKING GROWL, and you will lose threat to a pet, who will then die and there will be a mob running around that you have to reaquire.
---
Yeah! This sub is for posting about “when is the release date?!” Or maybe comments regarding the latest 15 minute tips out baby video on 5 alpha screenshots - how dare you bring this kinda low-quality content in here!
---
&gt;Huge population at launch
---
&gt;Lots of people quit because of PvP
---
&gt;Retail WoW still dies for some reason
---
This is the first suggestion out of the many that I stopped and agreed with.
---
Cooking is really easy to level, and it gives you some more quests as well. So there is no reason not to level it. Fishing on the other hand is a pain to level. Good gold though.
---
Lock
---
Mage
---
Pala heals
---
Bear tank
---
Warrior dps
---
As others have said, everyone needs first aid. You can definitely ignore cooking and fishing if you want to, but if you have some downtime and can semi-AFK the game (i.e. if you're watching a show on a second monitor or something) you can do some fishing. There are some good guides that show you how to fish up the mats to level cooking at the same time. There are good buffs from cooking that raiders like to use, so you can make some pretty good money if you have the time to level it.
---
Mgs1-3
---
No I'm not. I'm not saying I wont be summoning a few slackers, but definitely not 30+ people. That's just a shitty guild with shitty people :p
---
Nice callback to the middle-school days.
---
I vote for you. That’s a pretty shity build
---
Can I have some water? 
---
Now imagine it every 5 minutes.
---
Drake something
---
Mute of world of Warcraft have some vids with him
---
Tauren or Human Warrior? Not much into min maxing, just curious what you guys think regarding faction experience etc.
---
In the first few weeks of the server being live..no one will have the money really to spend on BoE blues, so they will most likely be upgrades for any class that can use it when it drops. Like you said, when people have differing opinions on this (and from the looks of it in this thread, many varied opinions) it can lead to issues. All rolling need is just safer and causes less headaches.
---
As for BoE purples (say, edgemasters or stockades where they are bis or major upgrades), you can sometimes swing it with a good group to give it to the warrior who needs it but sometimes, you'll let that warrior roll need and then last second someone else will also roll need (when you've all agreed to let the warrior have it) and they win. And in instances like ST or BRD...it just leads to bad blood, usually an instant kick for the ninja and lots of lost time trying to find a replacement.
---
Probably taking all the weapon type specializations would be the worst build, something like [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BPPxEz8AA\_AAQA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BPPxEz8AA_AAQA)
---
All the content stacks, just like original wow vanilla, and the progressive servers that came after. No content will be removed or unavailable when more phases come along, that would just be stupid haha.
---
You need to fix your cooling setup. GPU should not come even close to 100C on any load.
---
I just watched an interesting video on the potential benefits of duo leveling. Seems like it could potentially solve some of your problems. If you were willing to main your dwarf priest it could definitely open up some strong options.   
---
It would align both of your schedules. So if you were worried about her getting far ahead of you your play time would be regimented. If your wife wanted to play when you were not around she could work on professions. Duo leveling would also soften the learning curve. The game can be pretty unforgiving and it is not very fast paced for those who are used to modern games.   
---
I'll toss the link in this post if I have sad anything intriguing I recommend checking it out.

It's literally the only way to pug efficiently in classic.
---
Havent seen much love for druids, (my vanilla main) I'm too scared to level one again Haha. So much time
---
I just wait and see what everyone else does. If two or more people stall a conversation will start. Probably the only thing I’d get my knickers in a twist about would be an Enchanting recipe cos I’d genuinely need that.
---
herb/alch sounds awesome i actually think i'll go for that. somehow i overlooked alchemy. had my eyes focused mostly on the likes of engineering or enchanting but blah.
---
I saw that post about the secondary profession guide which got me thinking about this originally.
---
Having no normal rez makes no difference for leveling itself. In dungeons it can be a bit of a pain in the ass, but you can just always try to group with a paladin or shaman if it's a huge concern. They're good classes in dungeons anyway and you can easily make sure there's one in most of your groups. I mained resto druid on N*st and nobody ever declined to invite a druid healer, but there was definitely a few times where it was an issue. Not too many times, though.
---
I agree. I'm playing at night which is an evening in server time and I very rarely get to see azeroth sun or night. It's pretty boring indeed.
---
Imo bears are ideal in early game. They do so much damage. I prefer bears to warriors

Okay cool! Thank you for clarifying. I don’t know how I got it in my head that it’s cyclical or whatever. I hope you have a good day and thanks for posting the phase list!

Free character migration for offered at least as early as 1.11
---
I think a decent portion of the eventual rebalancing of server/faction can be done by having a prelaunch server sign up with factions capped to allow moderate imbalance without one faction getting completely dominated. A decent number of servers that died in vanilla were completely faction dominated before they died.
---
I had an alt on one such server in vanilla and was on the dominated faction.  Ended up spending all my time traveling because taking a flight was a good way to die after landing.   Completely eliminating server imbalance or trying to achieve server balance is not a legitimate goal or very likely.  But i think a good portion of it could be preempted prior to launch.  The rest as you said will sort itself out
---
Pretty much all of it is a joke, really(in my experience). Played and raided as a hunter in vanilla, not private servers, and had a great time with zero of the troubles like that.
---
There were plenty of dumb hunters rolling on basically everything(saw one roll on Dreadmist Sandals because he wanted more intellect), but not enough to stop anyone from inviting hunters to groups.
---
I do wonder, though, what effect private server communities will have on how people replay through classic. In that case, there could be issues with everyone trying to minmax everything.
---
Does anyone know how the FPS is gonna be like on max settings? Obv the old 1.12 client is gonna be smooth AF on todays hardware but I'm wondering whether my 2015 macbook pro is gonna pull it off with the new one.
---
gotta remember to bring dem mana pots.
---
I’d worry more about server reputation and less about AH resell value.
---
Call of Duty Modern Warfare, Call of Duty World at War and Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 was an amazing trio but yeah, still doesn't come close to these three
---
Loving the shadows on the roof of Goldshire inn. Max settings all the way for me.
---
Some would call that 2v1 :p
---
Good luck getting the drop on me mate - I'll be tracking hidden all day once I get it. Coupled with the fact that I can't ever stand still in combat, it should be fairly challenging to get an opener. Meetcha in STVietnam, friend.
---
That sucks for you. I know lots of people who have wonderful relationships with their spouses. Many married couples work incredibly hard to selflessly provide for each other. All of this is to say that wife and happy life are not concepts in opposition but often synonymous.
---
Yeah
---
Temporary faction lock when theres over 5% difference.
---
Not crucial, but can boost you a shit tonne while leveling and save you a fortune when raiding. Food buffs were great. 
---
Also, they are fun things to do when sitting waiting for raids to form/start or when you have 10-15 mins to kill.
---
Metal gear solid 1 2 and 3
---
I too play games that way, and just finished my 4th run of the game. It's surprisngly easy and short once you get a hang of the combat. 
---
Definitely give it another shot, for the Ogre specifically it's just a test of being able to dodge his 2 different grab animations. That's basically the entire fight.
---
On PS I’ve been through a couple as a healer and it was fine...once I could actually get the pet to show up on the interface.
---
Wow vanilla, wow classic, future wow classic 1.3
---
As early as 1.11 blizzard offered character migration, it was a thing in vanilla.  Just seems a portion of it would be avoidable by a prelaunch sign up.  It would also allow for guilds to get more organized for launch day knowing people who choose a server late after launch wont get seperated from their guild/friends
---
That is mostly what it's for. You can pretty much think of it as a talent that says "DP costs 0 mana." You can use IF for other things as well but mostly in PvE where you might end up having to be a healer.
---
Dots don't crit so you get nothing out of that, but it can be used for emergency heals if you're really desperate.
---
I’m showing my age here but I’m going with:

Street Fighter 2
---
Street Fighter 2: Champion Edition
---
Street Fighter 2 Turbo
---
It’s WOTLK that lets the Warcraft trio down of course. I spent a lot of my time in WoW doing Heroic instances with friends in TBC so you can imagine my disappointment with Wrath.
---
Silent Hill comes close, Streets Of Rage comes close.
---
I think that kind of thinking started with cross-realm battlegrounds. Enemy premades had high warlords that I recognized.

My concern would be being dependent on the skill of your healer.
---
A healer isn’t going to give you 2g if you die because he’s busy grabbing another bag of Doritos
---
He's probably referring to the files that were discovered earlier this week on one of Blizzard's CDNs for an internal alpha.
---
Yeah, until you are skinning Core Leather or Devilsaur Leather, skinning is just for vendor trash. However, if you're farming/questing in an area with lots of skinnable mobs, it's a significant increase in your gold per hour. And since you're not going to be fighting over nodes like herbalists and miners are, it's easier and more efficient to get skinning than one of the other two. 
---
Of course, like you said many people take both skinning and herb/mining. I'm a fan of crafting professions, though.
---
I really like tauren warriors theyre kinda like a blackhorse fan favorite for warrior class while some people say humans (males) have weird melee attack animations so Id say tauren

Yeah I hit dodge and he still hits me anyway. CLosest I got was just holding B and running in for one attack then running out like a bitch. I feel like too many enemy attacks in that game perfectly track your character and aren't just weapon swings in the air. Because of that the defensive side of the game is to me way harder than in dark souls.

Any tips for Smite leveling? All the guides I see recommend wands that are dungeon drops or ‘just buy them on the AH’ (yeah, with my spare 200g I have lying about).
---
Fairly sure there's a rule against political figures' names.
---
You can change the tab distance in the game files. This is extra important for range classes, less so for melee. 
---
I did it in vanilla (I think, maybe it was BC) after reading a firing post.
---
🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
---
Really? Dang
---
I considered adding a "x50" or w/e next to each cloth icon, but decided at the last minute to leave that out, due to the inconsistency of luck when it comes to skilling up while it's Green and Yellow.
---
"I hope they do" I didn't read as only specific to the weather haha. Blizzard can scare me sometimes with their decisions
---
So?
---
Save it for later when prices go up, you'll still need gold for epic mount and raid consumes.
---
And it's not like people stop leveling and doing dungeons after the first few weeks...
---
This is what it's like on an empty server
---
Not saying don't try it, but it just takes one report or a forced name change.
---
Tauren are really big, which is kinda cool. Some doorways will be too small for you to go through while mounted. The AoE stun is a fun unique mechanic as well. 
---
Humans are the most common race and aesthetically pleasing for many. You also get easier rep grinds than any other race.
---
Wotlk is better lets face the hard facts here
---
First aid is mandatory for every class
---
Cooking is nice to have while leveling, particularly for melee DPS classes. 4-12 stam and spirit seems small at first, but that extra spirit really makes a difference at low levels.
---
Fishing is a great way to level your cooking, and can be profitable as well. It's always been a bit too boring to level for me personally, but I totally get why people like it.
---
Engineering is typically suggested if you're going to be a big PvPer. Enchanting is a huge gold sink because you have to destroy greens/blues along the way and unless you get the rare patterns at 60, you're not going to make much money. Tailoring is good for selling bags and some resist gear later on. Leatherworking has some good sets (devilsaur is the one people tend to go for) that will net you some money *if* you can farm the leather/get the patterns. I think Blacksmithing has some good stuff, but I've never been a plate wearer or melee fighter in vanilla so I've never looked too hard.
---
Herb/Alch is always a solid choice.
---
WoW you had some nice stuff! Also, is everyone on reddit really young or was I playing the game with a bunch of 6 yr olds back in the day and I just didn’t know it, Although it would explain a few things...
---
I leveled alts with 2 friends during vanilla and we went prot. warrior, priest and rogue, we had heaps of fun and did some 3-man dungeons but time-wise is was not very efficient.
---
I would say go for it if you feel like it and have a friend eager to play a healing class.
---
Tbh I haven’t tried smite leveling. I played as shadow priest from vanilla to cataclysm.
---
M2! Also loved the Giant Yeti inside the manual
---
Thanks for reposting my song! It was a lot of fun to write. I was informed it's actually pronounce 'Kuthoon' but please forgive it 😀. Thanks for the positive feedback
---
I played on a Pserver a long time ago and decided i wanted to go tank at a round 50 to get into dungeons easier, worst mistake I made. It wasnt that safe because I couldnt kill anything and the mobs could definitely kill me. I instantly regretted it.
---
We did the same thing, as the horde tho.     Such a great time
---
Yeah some people have, they're still leveling though...
---
The thing with prot warrior is that when you increase your survivability by 20% but you decrease your dps by 50% you end up taking a ton more damage to kill one mob. Why do you think you wouldn't miss with a 1h? You have the same miss rate as someone levelling normally with a 2her.
---

Sorry lost my pills..LOL
---
i tested it from 35-40 and let me tell you it is mind numbing, you take less damage on a swing but you also get hit 10x more because you also do no damage, so it doesnt even work out much better in your favour, you also have pretty much no rage because the mobs dont hit hard enough and again you dont hit hard enough either. all around not a fun time unless you want to extend your already slow levelling speed.
---
This is the picture that made me roll a demon hunter
---
I'm really not sure why you are so hostile. Druids can tank 4H in Naxx40. This will be a small % of players but you claiming it isnt possible makes no sense when you seem to have not kept up with the wealth of knowledge the community has absorbed over the last nearly 15 years. Is it the most min max thing ever? No, probably not unless you're doing speed runs.
---
If you would like to learn, feel free to go check these links out. The Discord link is filled with plenty of people who would be willing to explain my point better than I.

https://discordapp.com/invite/uscwdeP

I’ve always played both Priest and Paladin (got both to 60 back in the day) but time wise I feel I should stick to one. Decisions, decisions...
---
What is min/max?
---
The vanilla nights were fairlt bright and nothing like the inky black potion. That is a myth.
---
Using the same old 3 names.
---
Would you swap over to Engineering and be tailoring/Eng? And just keep farming ores until you can like boost to 300 and then some? Or keep it so long as you get good money from selling them?
---
Thank you for the response. Yeah I gathered that if the group is decent, there will be no need to rez to start with but I find it a bit awkward not being capable to do it as a healer.
---
I'm hostile because I tried to work my initial post in such a way that I wouldn't get such a ridiculous WELL AKTCHEWALLY post thrown at me, but here we are. Look man druids are shit compared to warriors. I'll cede that yeah they can do some low level stuff but they don't hold a candle to warriors in terms of dps or tanking.
---
Which class is the least gear dependent for PvP?
---
Did you PvP? How was that? I’m torn between Paly and Priest (I’ve mained both since launch).
---
For those who don't know what an oyster card is, its a card used to pay for access to someones arm pit.

What level can you get the PvP trinket at in Vanilla? I can't remember and can't find a source on it anywhere.
---
I'll see you on kelthuzad's corpse when my guild kills him. Oh wait your guild will be stuck on raz or something because you wanna play your meme spec.
---
Warlock / Hunter
---
:)
---
They can’t tank well but they are great healers.
---
Thats a big if, and a good rogue can get caught out by a lucky flare, but rogues aren't as helpless in this match up as people make them seem. Faps and engi gear, improved sprint, crippling poison, and being able to predict an opponents behavior (like how 99% of all hunters will cast FD+frost trap as soon as your first cheap shot wears off) all make it a lot harder for hunters to just shit on you unless they're really really good players (which is fairly uncommon among hunters).
---
1) T2.5 isn't a "full set." It only has 5 pieces, and it's generally itemized for the specs that T1/2/3 aren't. Like DPS stats for warriors and healers. For pure DPS classes, some of the sets are just on par with the epic PvP set while some of the other ones are weird, experimental mysteries like the hunter set with spell power.
---
2) It's a somewhat big difference, but it comes down more to key PvP items from any given tier. T2 is better than T1 but not so much that the T1-wearer couldn't possibly compete, but the T2 player may also have his BWL class trinket or one of the overpowered Nefarian weapons. The raw stat difference between tiers is only like 10% or something.
---
3) Assuming we're getting the upgraded 1.12 versions: the blue PvP sets are pretty much on par with T1, but itemized more for PvP with high stamina and little to no spirit. For some classes, this is better than their T1. If your class' T1 set is for a different spec than yours (e.g. arms warriors), the blue PvP set is obviously better. For the pure DPS classes, you can pretty much expect the R10 and T1 sets to be roughly equal but with a bit more stamina on the PvP gear and a bit more DPS stats on the PvE gear. Note that for mages and warlocks, the two-piece PvP set bonus remains BiS possibly throughout BWL.
---
The epic (R12/13) set is a different matter. The 1.12 version of this gear is on par with T2.5 and for many classes has very similar stats. It surpasses T2 in raw stat amounts and is better in PvE for some classes, especially DPS warriors. The hunter gloves are BiS for all of vanilla. It obviously isn't very attractive to healers and tanks, but for DPS specs it's top-tier gear all the way until Naxx. Your spec's T2.5 might beat it but not by much, and probably not the whole set. It looks like this gear will be available as soon as people can hit the requisite ranks, which could happen before BWL opens. That's going to be... interesting.
---
Absolutely not.  In fact shielding the tank in general is bad.  I limits their rage generation and can easily cause them to drop aggro or be rage starved and not be able to taunt if they do lose a mob.
---
My old pals were old dudes that for some reason let 11 year old me into their guild/vent/raids. They are probably in a nursing home by now (kidding, late 40's max). Also I don't think anything would make me want to be called "Trogg" (troggdor as many called me) again :P
---
Cross-realm battlegrounds was to alleviate queue times and help balance out realms that had faction imbalance. Plus, you can't queue for battlegrounds as a group (I don't think) so it's not affecting socialization.
---
Dungeons on the other hand, went from having to talk to people and form your own groups, getting to know other players, to...click a button and have the game do it for you, instantly teleport you to the dungeon and match you with 4 other people from different servers that you're never going to see again after the run, and the run itself is silent because of that.
---
They need priest cloth gear

You know I thought I was remembering wrong cos several times on PS I’ve asked and tanks have said shield makes no difference. And I’m thinking, I sure remember it does but then it was a long time ago... Thanks for confirming!
---
[Good for literally nothing.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#LV0cZxx0VZx0xIxG0b)
---
I feel that. I think they had to make enemy tracking stronger to combat how many more defensive options the player has. Blocking is better (no endurance bar) and there's a jump with iframes. If the enemies were as slow and non-tracking as older souls games, the balance would be skewed too far on the easy side. 
---
You can easily beat the Ogre's ass by staying in his face the whole time. Another thing you can try is using a Gaiichin's sugar to stealth around him and stealth deathblow his first life.
---
Max shadows darkens a lot of objects, wich dulls that vibrant, cartoony look to places like Elwynn where the trees are in their own shadow. I might use lower shadow settings for that reason.
---
It certainly wasn't efficient. I used a shield the whole time. I was 13 and did a lot of dungeons. I also did not know you could change your spec until like level 55. 
---
I had some weird build like this: https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BP8MzEwABMMD9Bw
---
I think the logic was that I discovered I liked tanking around level 30 and tried to put points into Prot once I had some sort of understanding of what tanking was supposed to be.

I was stuck on the ogre for a while as well before I decided to do some back tracking and explore the night time zone in the past (can't remember the name of the zone). I found a flamethrower attachment for your arm somewhere in that zone, decided to try it out on the ogre, and was able to beat him very easily with it. I think the game tells you at one point that enemies with red eyes are particularly vulnerable to fire.

---
Can you still get the rep tabards as a lv19?
---
That definitely makes sense from a rogue standpoint. However, I think at launch you'll have rather low rate of success by ambushing people, as every single zone will be swarming of people (and rogues want lone, vulnerable targets). As duo rogues you won't be able to compete with hunters when it comes to leveling speed, so you'll be stuck in the big zerg.
---
I miss Wtlk a lot and tried one of those private servers, but the amount of cheating is unbelievable, I went to a battleground and there were people flying around, one guy was off screen unknown why.  That put me off and I have only played retail since. In saying that, I’m so looking forward to classic coming out.
---
From my experience on a private server it looks like fishing could be a good money maker, but it's a pain to level. Cooking on the other hand is quite easy to level although I only made average profits from it. One thing that's nice about cooking is that the food is helpful during leveling, especially when you are playing the pathetic class known as "warrior", every bit helps.

Running into a streamer and having it negatively affect you is like .02% of your gameplay. It's mostly beneficial because they have good communities and keep the servers from dying.

I can't wait the seasonal events like the Summer one from the start of this video. Private servers don't do all of them, and I don't remember fully exploring all of them back in the day, lots of fun novelty items.
---
Do not do that.

Do not.
---
Mage hardcounters Elemental Shamans. You can lock them out for 10 seconds with your CS. 
---
You’ll hardly see any Elemental Shamans in pvp because they’re quite bad without gear.
---
No problem. Even if it's a bit gimmicky, smite priest can be a great deal of fun, especially when paired with appropriate gear and support from friends (namely a disc priest and a ret paladin). For example, one advantage smite priest has over ranged DPS specs is that neither smite nor holy fire have missiles; upon completing the spell cast, the enemy takes instant damage. This means placing yourself in obscure places, usually in AV or world pvp, will allow lots of free casting time before the enemy is able to locate you + properly react. Hiding behind tree stumps  is surprisingly effective lol.
---
I did..
---
Because it's harder to be a good warrior than it is to be a good rogue, but that's just my opinion on wars skill cap vs rogues
---
Stormtalon hc just has we hit 50 was fucking epic. Its honestly the best 5 man fight I ever did, 6 hours on a seriously tight dps check in leveling gear. Some of the best nerd screams I've had on that kill.
---
Wildstar is the only time I've seen a bunch of high level raids (top 100-500 wow players) struggle in dungeon content and I really wish there was more like it
---
WOTLK sucked
---
I could say the same thing about sports. Some people are entertaining/better than you so you can learn.
---
If you think that's what my comment was, go check out the links I posted and come back. The question has never been whether they "hold a candle" to warriors. The question is general viability as a tank.
---
You keep saying "low level stuff" but the druid tanking guide has screenshots of him either MT'ing or OT'ing pretty much every encounter from 5 man dungeons all the way through to the end of Naxx with only a few notable exceptions. My guild has run a druid OT that will sometimes MT depending on the encounter and it's honestly really fun.
---
That's ok I don't want bfs textures but better shadows/lighting all day
---
Nah WOTLK sucked from the start anything that's allows day 2 naxx clear is a shitty game
---
Gimmicks are a must for this old gamer!
---
Ez ret paladin
---
&gt;The question is general viability as a tank. 
---
Alright, in an effort to end this shitshow, I'll admit druids are viable tanks, if you consider ZG or BWL to be "very end game". Happy?
---
Unless they reverted this in some xpac (haven't played since TBC), the day / night cycles were unlinked in a Vanilla patch. I think it was 2 hours / 2 hours or something similar.
---
Living the ret dream.
---
Viper sting and melee train is a reasonably convincing reason to avoid playing priest
---
Come back to reality man
---
If you want to include OT'ing in AQ, and OT'ing in Naxx with a few of those fights MTing then sure.
---
Cooking is easy to level and really nice for that spirit boost while leveling
---
I believe it is was rank 2 for the trinket, so you could get it as early as level 10, however, since pvp ranks are coming in the second content release, you should be able to get it at whatever your current level is with some minor wpvp

That's a lot of handy information :D Thank you very much. By the way don't worry, I'll be picking Imp Hammer of Justice + Imp Lay of Hands for a second life to ensure that the fight lasts forever (until you're OOM/out of abilities :p)
---
Isn't it 4 seconds?
---
Also, ele/resto is by far the best pvp spec for shamans in 1.12. What else do you want them do play?
---
Paladin. Boring and slow to level. Not a real tank, no taunt. And if you do go tank, you will have to drink after every pull. Warriors wont want you in their parties if you are ret. Ret does no damage. Holy is just spamming flash light. Cant decurse. No slows (unless you use frost oil or something similar).
---
Well, I think the trick is that it doesn't.
---
I was an undead mage when I played (from classic to WotLK).
---
I think I will be sticking with mage, because I love being DPS and the convenience of portals, conjured food/water, easy gold farming is too good to pass up.
---
I am planning on switching it up by going Alliance this time, probably gnome for escape artist and increased INT. Will make things feel different even though I'm playing the same class.
---
That's insane
---
That's treason, the male orc bow animation is one of the best in the game
---
No way :O
---
Completely agree! I hope for even more (optional) graphical improvements in the future.

Oh, I think you may have missed my intended point.  As LW, you buy the stupidly cheap leather and then turn it into finished goods for vendor trash, generating both LW levels and money.

This is highly optimistic and barely feasible so don't take what I'm saying too seriously.
---
I really want current WoW to collapse. I want Blizz to start from classic and rebuild the game so many of us loved. New content. An alternate world. Something new. They built a massive game over 15 years, and now they can see what they did wrong.
---
We don't need a bunch of new cities to hang out in. We don't need content curation. We like challenge, we like classes that feel unique, we like RPGs.
---
They have a huge opportunity here to continue the legacy of THE BEST MMORPG. There has been a WoW sized hole in my heart ever since MOP came out. I haven't found any MMO that even comes close to beating WoW, but I just can't play current WoW because it's missing so much of what I used to enjoy.
---
Remember when WoW had 12 mil players? That's the WoW I want. Something Blizzard is proud of, not a game that panders to new players for profit. 
---
I've been saying for years if Blizzard started World of Warcraft 2 I would play without question. Now they are basically  doing that. They have a chance to build another massively successful version of WoW that is the oversaturated in content, places, and empty space.

Pre-60: Smite-spec holy priest
---
At 60: 21/30/0 healbot
---
For alt: SM-Ruin warlock all the way.
---
I like to embrace my class fantasy and role, so I only do minor reconfigurations of a spec to change from leveling to primary at 60.
---
Well we don't know what macros will work so there's no point asking for that. You know your main bar switches when you change forms right? So essentially there's 12 keybinds that automatically switch for your forms. You have to be careful what you put there though because you want to keep on eye on all your cooldowns like sprint/bash/innervate/rebirth/charge/feral regen all the time, you don't want them to disappear when you're in a different form.  
---
It requires a little bit of thinking about but you have literally hundreds of hours to work it out while levelling and acquiring new skills so there's not much to gain from worrying about it now. Hope on a PS as a 60 if you really want to go into Classic with it all figure out.
---
How do I pick a realm (PvE) once launch day arrives? I don't want to pick one with a name I like and find out I wasted my time leveling on a dead or soon-to-die realm or that I picked the wrong faction on a 1 sided realm and having no guild to raid with. Do we even have the names yet? EU if it matters
---
Was that on the Alleria server?
---
At least Ret pally would give the occasional proc train that would one-shot something.
---
Having melee classes rage quit duels was my pastime though. I think my record was like an hour before the dude finally gave up.
---
Oh man I had the exact same PC.
---
The one I'm on hasn't had any issues like that from what I've seen. I'm only level 30 with one toon and 12 with another but it seems pretty legit and I know it's one of the popular ones. Has a good community so far and I've been enjoying it. It's scratching my itch till classic anywho 😅
---
Same with my group. Our 10 man group was so good and the rest of the guild would get jealous to the point where we had to start rotating people into the group to get them achievements and stuff. Whereas when it came time for 25 man stuff the guild couldn’t get their shit together.
---
WC3, Frozen Throne, Vanilla
---
Vanilla (2004-2006)
---
Nostalrius (2015-2016)
---
Classic (2019-???)
---
MGS2 aged insanely well when it comes to the story, it's mindblowing how much of it came true ~15 years later.
---
I joined WoW in March 2005. About all I missed was the launch itself, which I hear horror stories about to this day. Something about a boat and server crashes and a letter about it that became a meme.
---
For my part, this isn't about the launch experience. If I thought for a second sharding wouldn't be expanded I'd not care much. It will be though. Once implemented, it'll be used anytime they so desire. Ironforge on Xmas? Sharded. Stormwind on busy nights? Sharded. 
---
Any case in which "too many" players congregate will be sharded. It makes no sense to use it "just for launch" when the conditions surroinding launch will exist at other times.
---
In fact they never said it would be only a launch thing. Though I understand where people got that it would be. The post is a "Weasel word" post, intended to convey that impression without actually saying that.
---
Druid is pretty much the bottom class of vanilla. They aren't terrible but they have very real disadvantages, which is why druid is the least played class on every server. I never recommend it to anyone who doesn't already know that it's what they want. If you're in doubt at all, I suggest not going for the druid.
---
Lol the guild I was in killed Kil’jaeden, and the top dps was consistently the two rogues (me and Clipse).  It was rare that a warlock, mage, or hunter would take the top spot on a pure dps fight like Brutallus.
---
Gonna level as deep prot pally (with consecration) 11-31-0 and then switch to holy/prot hybrid for endgame 30-21-0.
---
Why is arms warrior using a shield?
---
Replay Warcraft 3. This WILL do it for you. Promise me.
---
TFW you’re really from the barrens
---
Yo try Warframe fast and fun. Just keep killing shit and fun with friends
---
So did each race originally get slated with a “hero class” for specific classes? If so, is there a rough list of what their raw plan was?
---
Oh, yeah, I totally misunderstood. My bad.
---
That's a good idea for cash flow! I hadn't considered it, actually. Maybe I'll add leatherworking to my bank alt along with enchanting. Thanks for the idea.
---
!remindme 5 days
---
I feel like you’re doing it wrong.
---
Hey guys,  
---
Naxxramas holds a special place in my heart due to its significance in Classic history and the large amount of mystery and imagination surrounding it due to the massive amount of players including myself that never fully cleared it back in 2006. 
---
Boss Guides are my bread and butter but for this specific video series I really wanted to raise the production value to pay homage to my favorite raid and I'm looking forward to that day that we finally return to Naxxramas - thank you as always for checking out the guides.
---
I don't know that the zerg will be that bad, which is almost disappointing after levelling through STV on nost/ND/LB as duo rogues. Yeah sometimes fights got turned around by 5 more horde jumping in, but for the most part people died so fast that the likelihood of that was very small. Hell it was fun to have stuff like that happen, even if we both died we'd be laughing about it.

Don't play mage. You'll break your 1 key.
---
Please provide a source, I’ve never heard that before and am interested to know if it is true.
---
Nvm, I'm retarded. Misread what he said, think I was really tired when I responded lmao. 14hr 30min is doable to 21 yeah.
---
The Sims 1 &amp; 2
---
Nah you're right, I misread what you typed and was really tired when I responded.
---
I remember twinking/leveling up a warrior over three expansions and I would say maybe 1/10 hunters were actually good. When you did find one however, they were so fucking hard to win against. I would routinely end fights with absolutely no cool downs and 10% HP. If I didn't have those cool downs or a topped off health bar I was just fucked.
---
I was a bg hero during vanilla, do you think it will be a fine addition to my understanding of the game since I didn't raided at all back then? And I want to try to play the market this time around and I want to be prepared :P
---
Those have to be some of the worst rogues I have seen.
---
I bet this is how rogues will farm honor in phase 2, though. Perhaps 3-4 rogues with 1-2 druids in a group.
---
Nope!  For reasons others have listed. 
---
Save shields for ph shit moments like your fade is on CD and you pulled too much.
---
Thank you for posting this, this topic gets brought up all too often with partially incorrect rumors getting repeated. I've had to multiple times drop my own comparisons showing that tanaris sandstorms, STV monsoons, and even rainy dark nights in darkshore still exist. It's just that we're rarely ever in the zones long enough now to notice.
---
There was definitely a bug with dark nights, and I believe there were sharding/phasing issues with weather, but I don't think they were ever gone for long.
---
I've been thinking that these guides should exist by now so really happy you've made a start on them! Clear voice and good editing! 
---
 Setting them up into Raid Playlists would be really helpful to navigate! 
---
Great work dude!
---
I'm don't think so, iirc all the gear was too high for level 19s
---
Maximizing your char with minimum effort
---
&gt;Attemptor at everything, master of none.  
---
&gt;Note also 1 point in deep wounds to take up a debuff slot but not be high enough to ever be good.
---
Now this is the kind of thinking I like!
---
Had this as my background forever
---
It's the bad ones that don't heal anyone. Admittedly most players are quite bad.
---
is owl really the superior pet?
---
Drakedog
---
&gt;druid/paladin
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Either way, 1.5 of your bags (probably more) are either going to be filled with healing or tanking gear - enjoy your grimped inventory for the rest of your life.
---
Depends if they shard or not. If they dont...yea, explore will prob be best.
---
I got to level 52 leveling as a prot warrior on E* before all the drama happened and it turned into LH. It was interesting sometimes, especially later, but slow to kill things, slow to get anywhere, and you really can’t fight stronger targets without help despite what being a tank would make you think you can do.
---

---
2 rogues team basically says ur bad at wpvp
---
What are the others?
---
thx! can't wait for the dl to finish \^\^
---
Of course! Still can't believe it's a real thing again
---
Still using the same name. No problem.
---
Why on earth would they release realms where you start on 48 for tbc? The whole point people like TBC is being levelling is still core to the game just the end game was a little more organised.
---
Temporary faction queue when there is a 5% difference. Locks are stupid, you don't create a game, sell it to people, and then prevent them from playing. A 2 min queue on the other hand is very little inconvenience to someone that is set on playing with friends/guilds on a particular server - but it will be enough to make someone that doesn't care switch to another server.  
---
The key is to implement it straight away so it keeps a tight 55/45 max imbalance on any server at the start when people's characters are being created and when they are low level. Trying to implement it 2 months in when people are level 40-50 will not work, people are already too invested in their characters and won't want to reroll.
---
I think most people including myself weren't really focused on ranking up at the time. The PvP system was very new and it was sort of a little bonus to PvPing. Most of us got gear from raiding and would treat PvP as a bonus. 
---
I was on a low pop server with one faction being much more represented, so there wasn't as much of "Tarren Mill vs Southshore" going on. I do remember there being a lot of fighting when WSG was released, as we had to get to the portal in Ashenvale to queue up.
---
I never really took much notice of my rank before BGs, but I did hit rank 11 sometime in vanilla without much effort and got the sweet Night Elf mount on my human.
---
I was very tempted to make a rogue and do exactly this with my life.
---
Found the guy who got killed by a pair of rogues
---
And more than once
---
It will be a long while before we see old Naxx. Nice guide though.
---
If possible I'll play with max settings and classic water.
---
That sounds like an updated animation, not graphics. The graphics updates include things like dynamic shadows and (subjectively) better lighting. 
---
Here's Orc Hunter play from the demo. Maybe my memory is foggy, but these don't look like new animations:
---
https://youtu.be/qB31HQbbF44
---
So you can't get it with ultra settings?
---
My old wow name is too bad to use. Like early 2000s hotmail address cringe bad.
---
Don't do it. It doesn't even really help you tank dungeons because before level 55 or so the hardest part of tanking is getting enough rage to actually use your abilities, and prot isn't going to help you with that.
---
If they would make all zones look like new Arathi Basin in BFA I would puke probably every 30 minutes playing there.
---
Bubsy
---
Bubsy 2
---
Bubsy 3D
---
&gt; safer at least with how little damage you take
---
So how much less damage do you take from prot talents? Its like 10def and 10% armor. The other talents give more threat and stuff.
---
It could just be that warrior is so bad that nobody plays one, so nobody can say that warrior is their own class like OP said it had to be, so nobody tells of Warrior's flaws.
---
(:
---
Awesome, Subcribed.
---
Eh I did it, was very chilled and my goal was to spend a high number of hours in instances to learn the layout and improve my speed. Will probably level an alt the same way again. 
---
I main a holy priest though so I have a thing for leveling up *wrong*
---
Who wouldn’t want to shoot fireballs out of a gun? ;)
---
Well basically they just took the wc3 heroes and so for warrior it’s easy night elf is demon hunter, orc is blade master, Tauren chieftain, dwarf mountain king etc. and this would be in PLACE of the talent system. 
---
Then they realized that this idea wasn’t really viable and too hard to balance or not reasonable to do with class race combos. 
---
So they came out with the talent system instead so you could feel different from other [insert class here].
---
The memories, I miss the THUG series as well.
---
Don't play as a male Night Elf warrior, only I get to roleplay as a demon hunter
---
What an idiot
---
Definitely better, for me Wrath is were everything got worse.
---
I believe this was on Muradin
---
-Climbs a ladder-
---
"What a thrill..."
---
Playing Lost Ark with a VPN until Classic comes out. Its the only MMO worth playing until Classic is out. Single player games dont keep my attention for long.
---
No. There are certainly hard counters in this game. Soul Link warlock hard counters elemental shamans, all paladins, and mages. Elemental shamans are a hard counter for druids. Mages and spriests hard counter warriors.
---
Top notch content my dude, well done.
---
I see you, xxlegolasxx
---
I really enjoyed twinking after I stopped playing. Why? To shit on noobs? No! 9/10 people in every BG were twinks. The reason why I and so many other people enjoyed it was that we could play in a locked state. You had to level your character once (in my case to 29) and farm your gear once what is was really easy with a max level char. After you did that the item state was locked. So you could hop on your twink and PvP real quick just like you fire up a single round of counterstrike without worrying about others getting better gear. We all had. Blast in friends accounts with our twinks without having to sink any time into the game besides pure casual PvP. Everybody who queued was a twink anyways it was really fun.
---
Back in Vanilla I rolled an Undead Warrior. I was 14, before wow I had been playing Runescape and Diablo 1 &amp; 2. In those games, I was always Sword and board so naturally I wanted to do that again in Vanilla. 
---
I did manage to level all the way to 60. I didn't know any better back then, I did a lot of dungeons, a lot of mindless grinding of lower level mobs because I had ran out of quest for my level and attempting to kill a mob one level above me, felt liked a death sentence. 
---
When I finally hit 60 I had 27 days played. 
---
Back then I was a lot worse of a Player than I am today, so is everyone else. The average 'gamer' has improved immensely, so it wouldn't take you 27 days to get 60. 
---
However I really don't recommend it. Warriors can Tank excellently in any spec during leveling. Slap one a shield when you want to do group content and dungeons, but do yourself a favor and level as Arms or 2H Fury. 
---
The experience is so much better.
---
You don't have to see it, tho. How would you even know that someone else is playing with new models unless you were actively asking everybody "Are you using updated models?" every time you encountered them just because you were looking for a reason to be mad (And even then they could still be lying).
---
Why would I care? XD 
---
Allready killed KT with my meme spec - oh there were other guilds having the kill earlier, but they also did the fight multiple times on own private servers - which is pretty yikes.
---
Live and let live - all the best to you
---
I actually did have a legolas related hotmail address... I fucking hate myself.
---
Sorry but this is a pointless post. All 3 specs are viable for warrirors, so you are basically talking about going out of your way to make a shitty spec. What's the point?
---
I did in TBC from 1 to 70. It wasn't as difficult as vanilla, but still no walk in the park. But it was an alt so he was twinked to high hell for most of it.
---
I hate that they have mostly thrown away the meta plot. I want to know what Juno is up to.
---
I got full prebis within 2 days RL time. Minus pieces I had to grind gold for. You will have months before PvP rewards. You'll be fine.
---
Yeah you probably did it on a private server where everyone else was already geared and could carry you. Try asking to be a dps meme spec during progression and have fun getting laughed out of the guild.
---
Thanks man &lt;3  I use the Adobe suite to edit my videos.  I think I saw his shaman video a while ago.  He's a funny dude! Fellow memer for sure
---
It may not amount to much, but you did omit something here: Leader of the Pack for 3% physical crit chance to the party.
---
I would argue that the Sims 3 was amazing with its open loaded world and Sims 4 is such a downgrade without it.
---
Nothing beats the original Sims aesthetic and sound design though. Can still hear that buy screen music.
---
Diablo, diablo 2, diablo 2 LOD
---
Which is less dps than just having another warrior, rogue, or mage in the raid.
---
You just can't accept the fact that people were TERRIBLE back then - today you easily pull as much DPS in cat as a mediocre warrior back then
---
MOP had the best rotations for sure, but the classes were ultrahomogenized and the talent system sucked. Overall toolkit and how the classes fit together is a much more important part of "class design" than rotations.
---
They will not try classic?  Don't feel bad for them.  They're animals.  Whatever degree of hatred you feel for alliance/horde scum (whichever faction you choose), triple it and be glad to rid yourself of such swine.
---
&gt; Not only do you have to keep using Drain Soul on every mob due to the Improved Drain Soul talent which gives you 100% mana regen for 10s after every kill. But you have to either use a macro or an addon to constantly delete the shard or your bags will be full.
---
Imp. Drain Soul is such a meme. It's so trash and everyone swears by it. It messes with the 5 sec rule and gimps a lot of the effect of an already fairly short buff. You have to get the killing blow so you have to micro manage your pet _every single kill_. You have to drain for several seconds and stop wanding to make sure to get the buff.
---
Imp. Life Tap gives you more mana, you already regen more hp/5 through your armor and it doesn't trigger the 5 sec rule and you can just bandage up if you have to.
---
LOL! How much dps do you do as a cat, honestly? I guarantee you a warrior two tiers below you does just as much or more dmg.
---
Warrior Warrior Warrior Warrior Shaman
---
Imagine when the planets align and everybody gets crit windfurys \\o/
---
I think it indicates minimizing stats that don’t matter (like spirit on a war) and maxing things that positively affect you (like spell power for a caster)
---
Salut. Nu am avut cum sa nu observ numele Cadavru din screenshoturile tale si eram curios daca jucai inca pe atunci 1) ce varsta aveai atunci 2) ai avea nevoie/iti doresti niste parteneri pt classic daca vei juca cand se lanseaza?
---
I was commenting to address your attitude specifically, having no part in this discussion prior to that.
---
I'm not contesting your overall point.
---
Just please be careful with absolutes.
---
Don't forget the portal games in the same universe
---
Portal 1

Portal 2

Portal.. damn
---
I wish valve went back to making games which aren't Artifact. There is a lot of 3rd entry games I would love to see from them.
---
Nightassain. Because my
---
11 year old self couldn’t spell assassin.
---
I found cooking to be almost mandatory for warrior and rogue leveling, because first aid alone gave you more downtime than simply eating some food, getting a bit of stamina from it, and moving on
---
Was it that difficult for you to read what “the first two raid tiers” mean?
---
The goal is literally to find the worst possible spec for Warriors. Of course the spec itself is not useful in any way, but I for one think it's an interesting challenge. It actually turns out to be quite a difficult problem the more you think about it, as there are so many aspects to consider.
---
So Im not the biggest fan of questing -  is there certain points from 0-100 where its faster just grinding mobs? Or will you miss out on important things  (Gonna play warlock)
---
I see. I apologize for being rude.
---
It just sucks making 40 healthstones... the good part is most of your raiders are shit and only 8-10 ask for replacements the rest of the raid, but still you need 80+ shards to go to a raid and they barely fit in you bag... 39 summons, 40 healthstones, pet summoning and hearthstone replacements all because the other warlocks afk spam shadowbolt.
---
This will be my disc smite build when levling up.
---
For PvE? 2 of them, arguably one at endgame.
---
They made the ladder just long enough so you can hear the entire song
---
Wrath best lore (TBC worst lore until WoD, yes, god damn panda land was better than mutant alien space goat shamanic paladins)
---
TBC best raids
---
Vanilla best continent
---
As a Druid I enjoyed both Wrath and TBC for class balance and feel.
---
And he is a ninja. Its a ninja loot if you don’t use it on the exact character who rolled need. The response should not be let me ninja it before someone else ninjas it. 
---
Etiquette is and has always been you need the items you need and greed those you don’t.  
---
The need always mentality just breeds more ninja’ing.
---
Static Bosses like Patch/Maexxna/Grob around 750-850 :)
---
But anyway it really doesn't make sense talking to you - just accept the fact people succeed as well, with even playing the spec they want to play which isn't optimised and even have a whole raid accepting that. 
---
In the end you decide what kind of player/person you are. Aaaaanyway I know it probably wont make sense talking to you
---
“Infested with KFC”
---
Come again?
---
I dunno it depends on your expectations. If you have this all planned out for her to be a hardcore raider then stop now. I'm not saying she won't - I'm just saying we don't know yet how she wants to play, and if you're trying to control that or meet personal deadlines you might have a bad time.  I played WoW with my bf back when it originally launched and we had a blast - but we weren't racing to 60 or raiding hardcore.   
---
It's been studied that, in general - not everyone -  women play games to relax and men play games to compete. If you can understand and respect that I think you'll have a good time.
---
Awesome video bro! I loved it. 
---
I feel like I know you from somewhere tho... Did you play on the greatest vanilla priv server ever existed (wish I could mention it by name lol)? Warlock, right? If so, what guild? 👀
---
Not many bis items drop in deadmines though.
---
Do i need bfa + sub for classic, or just sub with any xpac?
---
Ah, personally I don't remember them being different at all compared to now haha, but a lot of people seem to remember it being darker. Memory or myth either way, the potion works if you want it to get darker I guess
---
Don’t forget what they did to the Draenai and Blood Elves.
---
Yeah. dungeons are part of his route.
---
I don't want that part.
---
&gt;Is it true a **dung** can take days to complete?
---
You probably should seek medical attention ! :D
---
I remember solo’ing ZG with my tank Druid. Got it on second run. I have a feeling I got it when I was level 70 though. 
---
Was it still available at the end of TBC?
---
the proper term is 'clown world'  
---
honk honk
---
Gee, if that's your mindset, I wonder how you view cata and the rest
---
sweet, more reason to be excited for classic

Great games, but nothing matches wow

Portal... aww, dammit.

&lt;Revival&gt; is a newly founded Australian/NZ guild that is looking for members for the official classic launch. Our goal as a guild is to take a semi-hardcore approach to the game and get as far through the content as possible with the time we are given.
---
\- Guild Type: Semi-Hardcore
---
\- Realm Type: PvE
---
\- Realm: Oceanic
---
\- Faction: Alliance
---
\-  Timezone: GMT+10 AEST
---
\-   Raiding Times: Sunday/Monday 7:30pm-11:00PM
---
\-  Loot Distribution: Loot Council
---
\- Guild Personal Private Server: Yes
---
\- Who are we looking to recruit? -
---
Currently we are looking for a group of mature adults with life commitments that understand the game doesn’t always come first and that will contribute to making our guild feel like home for everyone. We are also looking to find passionate raiders who can make a few hours a night to down bosses with the guild and gear up together as a guild at our own pace.
---
\- Extra Information -
---
As a guild we are not in a rush getting to 60 and would like our members to take their time getting to 60 and enjoy the content leading to max level - We have plenty of time to raid and will start gearing up our members as they reach the level cap.
---
We expect those who are looking to raid to read up on information regarding the bosses inside the raid we plan on clearing that night and to also have their own consumables ready to go for raid night.
---
For more information please message me through @Xiayn#5630

Apply on our discord - [https://discord.gg/g9eHKn2](https://discord.gg/g9eHKn2)
---
u can do all of wc3 in a weekend.  
---
classic wont be for another ~7 to 9 weeks.
---
On the realm select screen (use the Change Realm button at the top right of character selection screen) you will see the list and the server and their respectiv Type in the column next to their name, so it's really clearly indicated it is (it's written PVP, PVE, RP-PVP etc)
---
I did 1-60... by all means.. do NOT do this.

Yeah 10 was 95% of the time, easier, as designed. 
---
I really wish they just kept 10/25. It worked well in Naxx, the only problem is that both the normal 10 and hard 25 modes were *both* too easy for their easy/hard roles. 
---
Ulduar did it the absolute best. Still just 2 difficulties, but it had mechanically activated hard modes. Still just 2 modes, easy and hard, but added depth.
---
Then ToC came in 3.2, and shat over the whole concept of difficulty settings. I remember feeling that first ever wave of “this is kinda wrong, or just feels off and not like WoW” that would come with each later patch and expansion. There was officially 4 difficulties to do the raid in. Granted, 10 normal could still pose a challenge, but was MUCH easier than doing Ulduar when it was relevant. And then, there’s the problem of true difficulty. 10 was easiest, and 25hc was hardest, that’s easy. But 10hc/25 normal were kind of ugly in design. 10 Heroic was waaaaay harder than 25 normal, yet only awarded equal or marginally better gear. This kind of helped fuel the fire of 10 vs 25. 
---
And in 3.3, ICC just repeated that shitty system, but made it worse. You would just swap the entire difficulty of the bosses with a flick of a button, instead of being in an *actually harder* environment. 
---
Cata didn’t help, as much as it tried. 25 just became easier than most 10s, because of more mechanic and cooldown availability. And in Mists SoO, they added Flex, which was great at the time... but with LFR, flex, Heroic, Mythic, it’s just too cluttered.
---
I’m really looking forward to the 1-difficulty style of Vanilla and BC, but the 2-difficulty style of 3.0 and 3.1 is also great. It’s sad that Wrath could have been so much better imo, if they didn’t go from 1 to 4 difficulties in one xpac.
---
Only the sub, unless Blizzard changed their plans since Blizzcon and haven't told us about it yet.
---
Why would you give it to a hunter that won't use it in PVE either ?
---
Not sure the  exact levels but apparently grinding is faster from about 35-45ish
---
In all honesty, a  bloodrage, battle shout (in party range), and demo shout is perfect for tanking all the way through 60 in 5 mans.  Just sword and board and make sure your healer has mana and your spec will never matter en route to max level
---
You are cool doing whatever you like tanking
---
You are good to go!
---
Personally, I usually level with mining and skinning. And then I switch to what I need at end game depending on class. As a warrior I might keep mining and add eng. As a lock, I might drop both and get eng and tailoring. And yes, I'd save most of the ores and stones and stuff.
---
bro, they are going through making sure that lamps on posts had the same graphics to them as in vanilla.  I think the old weather effects is a gaurentee
---
My friends and I are going:
---
- Warrior (Tank)
---
- Rogue
---
- Druid
---
- Hunter
---
- Priest (Healer)
---
But I would think ultimate PVE dream team would probably be
---
- Warrior/Druid tank
---
- Mage
---
- Shaman (Heals)
---
Get the bonuses of all the totems like Windfury, Tremor, Strength, Poison Cleansing, plus a Reincarnation. Not too much gear overlap amongst the 5. Get the CC of traps and polymorph, Free food/water, Ports after Dungeons to quickly put relevant items on the AH and get back to questing.
---
Not sure questing but Shaman/Warrior and shaman/rogue would be pretty crazy duo-leveling while hunter and mage would do fine by themselves.
---
Nope lol
---
It's definitely happened to all of us xD. Part of the game I do suppose. just like level 60 comes after 59, rogues gank for days.
---
Crash Bandicoot 1 2 and 3
---
Itd ok  if not. But to give an option  to peopñe to toggle  them on or off so it does not impact other  players
---
This whole topic is why I'm an advocate for a slight change to the loot system.
---
Rolling need on an item should soulbind it to you right away. Even if it's BoE.
---
This change would make this whole topic moot. Would also have the added benefit of completely removing the incentive to ninja and make ninjas 100% identifiable, not that they could do anything other than vendor or de what they get. 
---
Please convince me this is a bad idea without just parroting nochanges.
---
Take any barrens chuck norris joke and replace chuck norris with warrior.  That's what classic is going to be like.
---
WotLK was the cataclysm of vanilla
---
Well, WotLK started it all
---
Going into prot will not increase your survivability by very much at all and will only improve your overall threat, but your threat shouldn’t be a problem at lower levels.
---
Even if you’re ONLY leveling through dungeons you should first go into arms to get tactical mastery, anger management and Impale. That way you’ll be able to charge in, swap to defensive stance and have rage to get some threat. you’ll also do much more damage 😋
---
After that you can go into prot to get big tanking talents if you really want to but it’s really not necessary. Going deeper into arms will make your life way easier outside of dungeons and going into prot won’t help you with questing and will only make a meaningful difference at the later levels since the only talents that are important are deep into prot.
---
Fact:   the amount of ground clutter on max graphics is so unrealistic.  with the amount of people trodding through the area there is 0% chance that there would be that much grass etc growing
---
Early prot talents are mostly mitigation, and leveling dungeons  don't require much mitigation beyond a shield. More importantly, you don't actually want much mitigation there because of how rage works. The hardest part of low level tanking, imo, is that you don't do a lot of white damage, so you don't generate much rage therefore you can't use abilities that create additional threat as freely. Taking damage also generates rage and you will need every bit.
---
So basically, yeah nothing hits all that hard to begin with and anything you can do you up your rage generation is really really helpful.

especially with all that dungeon wings on Dungeon Finder
---
I'm pretty sure we can talk about Nostalrius here since it was shut down several years ago. I was a Warlock. Guild was Blacklisted and then later down the road - Scuba Cops.
---
Don't play a warrior - everybody else already does.
---
You do not do close to 1k dps, but whatever. I literally watched a "best dps classes in vanilla" video yesterday and druid is lucky to break like 400.   [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBSnGwxmOSU)
---
I don't think that's even possible.
---
Who here can't relate?? Staring at https://wowclassiccountdown.com hoping time will go faster..
---
I cancelled my sub today, I've not played properly since before Christmas. BfA is a mess.  
---
My hope is that classic will be more successful than expected triggering some of the traditional game design philosophies to come back to retail.
---
That's what I was thinking too
---
Pick up tactical mastery for sure.  Pop into defensive stance during a pull and get a sunder armor on each mob.  
---
Revenge will most likely be up while you do this, which i believe it the most damage efficient use of your rage out of all the abilities you'll ever have.  Use it until you decide you want to swap back to combat or berserker stance.
---
Once you get whirlwind axe you'll be an absolute beast.  If you get it at 30, then gg.  You can do whatever tf you want and no one will pull aggro from whatever mob you're attacking.
---
Tldr:  dont be afraid of defensive stance for a minute just to establish threat.  You'll dish out more dps in the long term and make it less stressful for everyone in your group.
---
I play lots of Hearthstone. Nothing similar at all (except the card names) but I like card games.
---
Worst spec ever. Hybrid warriors spec are not a thing in Vanilla.
---
Basically you put 31 points in arms for PVP &amp; leveling, 31 points in fury for raiding as DPS or 31 points in prot for raiding as tank.
---
This is a proper warrior PVP spec : [http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIio0uE0zu0x](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMhxdIio0uE0zu0x)
---
Cooking can also get you some extra gold while leveling since cooked food sells for more.
---
Is that a dh in the back?
---
Grinding is going to to be quicker most of the time. How quick depends, I think it’s only worth grinding levels 35-45 like the other poster mentioned. By not doing quests especially at the higher levels you may miss out on some important items/upgrades
---
There is some evidence to suggest that the new character models introduced in WOD will be a toggle. They weren’t in the demo but they have been data mined from that alpha. Idk if blizz has said anything about them though. 
---
~0% chance for new animations and sounds.
---
I just don't want you to take all balance druid slots in my guild
---
Guild: Chilling with my Gnomies  
---
Includes only ONE Gnome...??  
---
Prior to Cata, Gnomes couldn't heal (they got Priest in Cata), so I remember there being a Gnome-only guild, but they would "hire" Dwarf Priests so they could do raids and such.  I believe Gnomes were the only race with this issue; all Races got Warrior, so taking wasn't a problem (the only race that didn't get Warriors was BEs, and they got them added later and had Paladins anyway), and every other race gets some form of healer:  
---
Humans: Priest, Paladin
---
Dwarves: Priest, Paladin
---
Night Elves: Priest, Druid
---
Orcs: Shamen
---
Trolls: Priest, Shaman
---
Tauren: Druids, Shaman
---
Forsaken: Priests
---
So all other races can do groups/raids of their race only with the exception of Gnomes (though some are more limited than others, such as Forsaken having only the Priest option.)
---
Jesus, please take the wheel for this individual.
---
Well written answer..... If only that was what he asked for.
---
&gt; how little damage you take
---
Have you actually looked at the prot talents? You get 10def and 10% armor (4-5% actual armor). The rest is mostly about threat. You have very little str and block value so block doesnt do much.
---
I don't wanna name my paladin Huntertiger. What a terrible name.
---
And would anyone know if I could adequately heal onyxia without divine favor?  That's the only way my plan would be screwed I think...  I hope Illumination would be enough if I'm also a good player
---
No there won’t
---
Same here. I will fill all 5 slots early on, and skill them up as I level.
---
You wanna take twice as long as a rogue? Play warrior with me my friend
---
i also wanna add even if brd and dm king farm is out, ZG is also a possibility but only for mages.
---
Bloodseeker from AV at 51 will last you to 60
---
So you're saying I should play a ret paladin? Nice.
---
Can you craft the lionheart helm with the recipe if you aren't an armorsmith?
---
Druid here. Full feral leveling 1-60
---
0/30/21 for phase 1
---
13/0/38 for phase 2 (full healer spec with nature's reach and imp roots, teaming up with a rogue to farm hks)
---
8/12/31 phase 3 
---
and for phase 4-6 it's too early to say. No idea if i'm even playing then or what i'm doing ingame at that point
---
^ they handle it better than most classes given they have a 15 (or 13.5 with pvp set bonus) stun cleanse.
---
I knew it!! Cool seeing you around bro! I was in Blacklisted as well. Think I played human mage back then, name Baeby. Had to leave the guild after a few months cuz of timezone issues. Excited as f for Classic!! See you on the battlefield, friend or foe 🔥🔥
---
&gt; arguably one at endgame.
---
Best tank and best dps, what do you mean one?
---
Same here. Nothing epic but it felt that way.  When my guild finally cleared BRD.  We all sat and posed in front of the throne and took screenshots.  It felt like something we had worked on for a long time finally coming to fruition.

Anyone got a cooking guide that doesn’t rely on fishing?
---
You don't need a tank; kite everything yourself.
---

---
Depends on the crowd you’re trying to run with. For casual play, sure, they’re viable. You can rock a ton of consumables and be high on the DPS meter, or wreck bad randoms in BGs. 
---
For hardcore play, where everyone plays at a much higher level, you can sneak in 1 Spriest after ZG, and no enhancement or ret - they only bring sub-par features to the table, compared to “pure” dps classes. A ret or enhancement can *never* perform as well as a warrior or rogue on the dmg meter, if they’re played at the same level. 
---
Now is the hardcore mentality needed to clear all content? Nope, not by a long shot, but it’ll make it easier.
---
The beginning of the end
---
I seriously doubt you did any of the hardest raids like Mimiron HC, Lich Ling HC etc.
---
I think you're on the money about a lot of this stuff. People aren't accurately assessing how popular this will be. EverQuest did something similar with their first progression servers over 10 years ago. They weren't nearly at the same level of quality that Blizzard is putting into WoW Classic, and they were seen as sort of a temporary fun gimmick. Nowadays they release a new progression server every year or two and they're at least as popular as the retail game. 
---
I'm not sure about 10 million subs though. I think it could be 5 million, which is still enough to surpass retail subscriptions I believe. I don't think the population will die quickly like a lot of people are predicting. It'll actually increase gradually for maybe the first year or so. That's just how these things tend to trend. Some people haven't heard about WoW Classic yet, some people are on the fence, some people will get pulled in by friends, etc.
---
The choice of playing a PvP server vs. PvE is going to be very significant. Phase 2 is going to be a warzone. There will be gankfests at BRM, Dire Maul, and every place where high level players congregate. This is also going to magnify the problem of faction balance. The faction that controls these spots is going to be the more populated one, so it'll be very easy to end up as a Horde player who can't go anywhere without being killed repeatedly, or vice versa.
---
Yes - speedrunning is going to be huge. Gold selling is going to be everywhere.
---
I don't agree that retail will die immediately but Classic will quicken its demise slightly. It's still going to be around for a long time. Retail EverQuest is still a thing.
---
And I also foresee Blizzard receiving a bunch of backlash for trying to monetize Classic, especially once they see how popular it is.
---
Oh yeah I remember you! Hope you're doing well dude! Best of luck in Classic.
---
I got that on a pserver on my paladin.
---
The group leader was like "you're the only class currently online in westfall who can heal and is lvl 18+, wanna come DM? We have 20+ group".
---
You damn right I went.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/7zluy0/how_night_brightness_has_changed_in_wow_from_335/
---
Nope, just a sub! It does include retail too, but you’ll have to drop box price on the current xpac to play to 120. Personally, even though I’ll be paying 15/month for Classic, I’m not gonna buy BFA. Maybe if the next expansion is a huge departure from modern WoW, I’ll buy it and play Classic and 9.0 at the same time.
---
Not me because I'm playing HORDE you stinky Human/Night-Elf/Gnome/Dwarf
---
I'm definitely gonna test both ways, but I think I'll be in the same boat as you; preferring a nice little touch up
---
I am definitely hoping for a period for players really have a chance to connect with their server.  We'll have to wait and see, but I am excited phase 1 and 2 will be very server based either way without BGs yet.  Don't get me wrong, excited for BGs also, but I love the early emphasis on world PvP and the early raids in the first 2 phases.  It's going to make it feel like a journey!
---
I don't know for sure, but I would imagine multi language support will be available.
---
&gt; A second monitor should be a listed system requirement for leveling a paladin.
---
You just specified why I fucking love to lvl a paladin. What other class can quickly browse the 2nd monitor while you kill a mob? Yeah, not really anobody efficiently.
---
True teamwork would be selling it and splitting the gold, or allowing one member to buy out the rest to keep it if they do want to use it.  That way everyone benefits.  Giving this stuff away is literally giving money away.  Roll need and sell.
---
In fact I'm pretty much of the opinion that the need/ greed roll is a waste of time and there is basically no reason for a greed roll in general.  If you want something need, otherwise pass, because if no one needs d/e ing should be an option.  If I'm with friends we normally all pass anyways then figure it out afterwards.  If I was in a pub, if just wait until last and see how every one else rolled.  If they all greeded a boe, I'd greed too to be fair.
---
You need to make a new healthstone and spellstone too. Sometimes you need to make a new soulstone and resummon your pet.
---
In the original box, one of the inside covers.
---
Our melee group was top dps in every raid for the entire expansion, but we really were miles ahead in the later raids.  Melee felt extremely strong the entire expansion for us.
---
Not sure why you felt the need to be so snarky man.
---
Warlock is the second best grinding class, or I’d even argue that they’re the best. So, really, if you can find a good spot with lots of close mobs, you could possibly level faster that way. 
---
I’d say do the quests that seem painless to you, that you can grind out anyways. Then just fill in the blanks with grinding. I’ve grinders for an hour or two from 7-10, 18-22, 30-33, and so on. Just filling in blanks where I can comfortably kill lots of mobs.
---
Tiny low quality GIF? Yep, that's blizzlike for vanilla.
---
You can hide behind their spawn building and mc them when they spawn at the gy.
---
So there are normal reams in classic ok, but since it will be day one is there a way of knowing if a realm will live or die in a few weeks? Like people deciding 'Ok gang! Sort realms by name and 6th top to bottom is the one we are rolling on!' or entire discord servers dedicated to balancing the faction ratios?
---
For an instance on EU Twisting Nether, Draenor, Tarren Mill, Kazzak are horde dominated and active while Silvermoon Outland and Ravencrest are alliance dominated and active. Then there are dead realms like Nordrassil, Bronzebeard and Bloodhoof where things happen only thanks to crz.  Was this somehow decided by the community that this will be the case or it happened by itself over time?
---
TL:DR How to pick a ream and not get gutted and forced to reroll on Classic
---
On kronos its capped at 5g, it makes me happy. If its 50 in classic so be it I wont complain but there will be a lot less healers and tanks I feel
---
My gamer name is still the same.
---
I don't think I'll be able to get "Gotcha" for my rogue again though.
---
Hopefully my think Hunter "idtrapthat" will be saved.
---
&gt; When they do pull threat they run away instead of bringing the mob back to you
---
Good reminder for newer players, especially healers. If a mob gets to you, run next to the tank!
---
I agree with all of this except hyjal. The first three bosses were a snooze fest. Last boss was fun tho.
---
I did. I was on an RP server playing a ridiculous undead character that even non-RPers would interact positively with. I bought some purple BoE shield at some point and basically tanked my way through leveling, with mining to occupy time between instances. I am certain I could have done all that in any spec, but it was fun and I enjoyed the flavor of it all.
---
No names yet, or any solid realm news for that matter. If it’s anything like Vanilla, it will be a gamble. But I think Blizzard is go My to under-estimate the hype, and make too few servers... so I wouldn’t worry too much about that, if you play on day one. 
---
But if you find out after a week or two that the server isn’t popping for you, it might be best to check forums, cut your losses and start over. 
---
Either way, the pop should only be between 2.5-4K, so even maxed servers aren’t going to be massive like private servers are.
---
He's getting wrecked by 2 rogues
---
That being *possible* means it is not the game’s fault. It should under no circumstances get hot enough to boil water.
---
Alrighty:)
---
You can’t even do half the fucking bosses with melee comps, there isn’t a single advantage to having melee over ranged. Your anecdote about a “good rogue” don’t change that.
---
With the option to bypass if you get invited by a friend, and those invites restricted in number as well.
---
I am not sure what they have planned now, but I would imagine they will be utalizing the customer service they have.  In a lot of ways it makes sense not to have customer service reps speak with players on things like harassment issues simply because so little interaction happens in those cases.  I do hope there is still room for the player to GM interaction in terms of helping solve the issues that require more of a human touch though.
---
I can't imagine I'd ever have the time to do the full time 40 hours a week like I used to, to many things going on now, but, hypothetically, if there was a way to work on a more limited and flexible basis I would absolutely love to.  I loved my time there, and it really would round out my classic experience! ;)
---
On a side note, I had this thought earlier that might be interesting.  I doubt they would ever do it, but I think it would be cool if Blizzard did a 24/7 live stream of a GM working and helping players resolve issues and answers basic questions.  Of course they would have to avoid resolving any issues with sensitive material in them, but I think players would love being able to see through the eyes of the GM and they would probably learn a lot about the game in the process.  It feels like a 2019 solution to celebrating the game to me.
---
A lot of the stuff like dungeon finder and LFR absolutely murdered the sense of community the game had. There's good reason so many of us are interested in Classic.
---
Here's hoping I can get a cool lore character as a name, or just an actual name. Would be nice playing on a character with a name like that.
---
Day and night in WoW has been synchronized to real time for as long as I remember.
---
I think Alli is more fun, but you can’t go wrong either way. If you can’t stand Orgrimmar, I’d say roll alliance, but if it feels like home, go horde. 
---
As far as racists, Tauren is a lot of fun. I’ve only gone Druid, but either way, War Stomp is *seriously* overpowered. AoE stun on a 2 min cooldown? In Vanilla?! That ability makes shitty caster packs better, helps interrupt heals, stray mobs, and you can use it on every other pull. Plus the health boost passive is sweet.
---
You definitely can, because we did.  And we were top on almost every fight.
---
Cheer up man, no need to be so hostile.
---
Thanks! I've got a Naxx playlist set up that I'll be adding the new guides into one for easy viewing.

Warrior is the worst performing class to level 1-60. If you haven't played in 10+ years you're looking at 12-14 days of /played time just to get to 60 if you play Warrior and then you'll have to farm gear the hardest out of all other classes because Warriors and Rogues are super gear dependent. You'll be top tier dps though if you manage.  
---
If you go Druid you're gonna be forced to heal because tank/feral/boomkin aren't welcome in raids or dungeon groups, but you'll have an easier time leveling and finding raiding guilds. Dungeon groups generally don't want druid healers because they don't have a normal ress like other healers, only battle res with 30min cd.
---
It is most likely NOT drakedog, he was only doing destruction. Sorry op i do not know this one

There were two times they raised the nighttime brightness. One time in vanilla, where it was just too dark and people with bad monitors had a hard time. Another time in Cataclysm. According to MMO-Champion:
---
&gt;During Cataclysm there was a revamp of the graphics system by adding shadows to the game, which required raising the ambient light in every zone, as the shadows made it too dark. This resulted in the night time having more ambient light than it used to.
---
Gonna roll Human Warlock for the solo ability of it for a casual Dad gamer
---
A good rogue can beat any class besides paladin dueling.
---
Of course you can... No one is going to notice that you didn't get a guaranteed crit every 3 minutes or so
---
Nah I totally know that, it was ONLY path of exile that did it. It never comes close to 80c under normal circumstances.  Something was bugged with poe causing my gpu to scream
---
You prefer the modern water then? I don't know why but the old style textures look better to me than the glassy modern water effect. It almost looks like it's ice instead or something.
---
Crazy production quality. Nice.
---
I think Twinks either make you want one or they make you never want to do low level bgs again. I think you are vastly overestimating how many twinks there will be. Twinks were not cheap and people starting out are not going to be focused on them at all. We will not see twinks until much later into classic after people have a steady income and a semi geared main. I promise you if Blizzard makes twink only bgs then twinks will be dead before they even start. I agree that Twink vs Twink bgs were insanely fun as I did some organized Twink vs Twink bgs but there was never enough twinks on consistently to sustain their own BG and there never will be as it is mostly just a side part of the game that some people enjoy.
---
Well as My lvl 120 mage is the first toon I created in vanilla and I plan to reroll undead mage again... my choice of name is pretty easy. :@)
---
Do you still have the PC that you used?
---
As others have mentioned, mana management is important for warlocks although they are arguably the most affected class by the revive "penalty". 
---
Ressing and rebuff/pet resummon time/etc can become quite an issue in contested areas.  If you're being camped by a rogue in STV for example, they are not going to give the 90-120-seconds it takes to ress on \~40%hp (and less mana), drink/eat, rebuff, resummon pet, generate another healthstone (which you've probably just used) and possibly also to re-soulstone yourself if that has expired and you're solo questing.  To get back to full HP/mana with buffs and your pet out you will often need to drink twice.
---
Part of the vanilla charm!

There is a fan mod of portal 2 on steam you could check out. (Portal stories:Mel)[https://store.steampowered.com/app/317400/Portal_Stories_Mel/]
---
It was a certain bug causing it; I have hundreds of other games I've played on this gpu without this sort of bizarre issue. I doubt it's still the case since this was years ago when poe was just starting out.
---
&gt;Also, does the 25% increased crit chance apply to all of DPs ticks?
---
No, you cannot crit with dot ticks in classic wow.
---
Thanks. And should a server die after say a month or two, will it get merged with another that's not dead but low pop or does it stay dead?
---
Look at this badass Nelf warrior with his full dreadnaught. Bet this picture triggers all the private server min/maxers.

The scientific approach! Nice. :-)

Look at that bullshit night elf model

There will normally be more than one warlock in a 40 man raid, so you don't need that many shards because you wont be doing it all yourself.
---
Yeah the summer event in the beginnin really mad the video pop
---
Running towards any ranged class, they are always going to try to get a warrior into combat. Shadowmelding drops their target, if time right will allow a warrior to get the charge. 
---
Doesn't work all the time, but 'useless in vanilla' is objectively wrong.

If you enjoyed BC, you will probably enjoy Vanilla. It’s like BC, but with a few pros/cons. Cons, the classes and specs aren’t quite as perfect and viable as a whole, there’s no extreme difficulty 5 man content. 
---
Pros, there’s one cohesive world with one cohesive community, the leveling experience is an even longer journey where more experiences will happen, strong faction pride, and there are more 5mans to do than any other version of WoW. 
---
Honestly, BC(2007-2009) was my favorite era of WoW, but Vanilla is excellent. 
---
I don’t mean to dissuade you from retail. But I can say, Vanilla and retail will share a subscription. So, it might be more money-wise to wait until you buy Classic, then if you ever want to take a break from it, try out retail for a bit. Personally, it’s a hollow shell of what it used to be, which is ironic for the amount of bloat it has keeping it afloat. I want to enjoy it though :/
---
Best decision of my Life and Will do it again
---
Or maybe it's not a false narrative but just people that have last played when the nights were actually way too bright.
---
You won't be able to make Feral Druid the beast in the DMG Meter that it can be.
---
Neither will you be able to show the true sacred power that lies in the Tankadin.
---
Fury. You don’t really *need* to be prot, and sometimes fury is more desired because you can produce more threat. 
---
Obviously prot is great for low-midlevel endgame.
---
OP here, since there were so many people in love with my Dig Rat video. I thought I would post The Secrets of Doomguard a very similar video to Dig rat :P
---
I reckon the survivability increase and dps decrease are much more like 50% more survivability and 40% less dps. Especially early levels before mortal strike/bloodthirst, rend doesnt care what weapon you're using, neither does heroic strike.
---
I did it at 55 once and just grinded dungeons getting prebis, it was fine at that point. Basically skipped all of the plaguelands.
---
More relaxed guilds, yes. However, warlocks only start ramping up to insane damage towards the end of the game, which is when a shadowpriest for shadowweaving becomes more crucial.
---
Exactly this, was one of the most amazing moments of my personal gaming history.
---
this right here boys. 
---
I was in 5th grade playing vanilla. I did not have good taste in cool character names
---
&gt;I plan to train a rogue, is it as slow as people say it is compared to other classes?
---
I mained rogue on N\*st. Rogue is bottom tier at leveling with quite a lot of downtime. It's fun to be able to stealth past a lot of mobs to get to that one specific unique mob that you need to kill for your quest, but you'll also never be able to deal with more than 1 mob at a time and spend time eating after pretty much every mob.
---
You don't have much to press besides overpower, heroic strike, and rend anyways before level 40. That applies to all warrior specs. High key worse than paladins before that point, at least they have judgement.
---
Halo, Halo 2, Halo 3
---
Not sure if better but Great nonetheless
---
Thanks for the insight.
---
Oh yeah, sorry. I had a brain lapse while typing that haha. Thanks.
---
That moment you love everything about retail wow except the mechanics and the operations of the actual GAME.
---
I’m in the same boat as you, brother
---
As others have said, Kings is king. But on the other hand, as far as solo play or 5-man content goes, war stomp is much more useful than shadowmeld, which is actually useless.
---
What are some of the disadvantages it as compared to other healers?
---
I remember this also. I was in a good guild so finding groups was never an issue for me so it was kind of a "neat" feature to add at the time. But it became apparent pretty quickly how peoples behaviour changed in dungeons after that.
---
Did it teleport you to the dungeon as well? I can't remember. Removing people out of the world was a minus as well.
---
You aren't supposed to name yourself after established figures. You can get a forced name change if you name your char Gandalf or Legolas or something too.
---
They don't like scripts that create a sequence based on logic. Castsequence is fine since it can't determine if a debuff is already on the target or if your spell gets resisted.
---
loot everything a mob drops so you can sell the trash items to a vendor for money.  or try to sell better items you can't use on the Auction House.
---
noob mistake when I first started was I never looted trash items from mobs.  as a result I had no money to repair my armour after it broke from dying over and over because i was a noob.
---
Baldurs Gate 1, Baldurs Gate 2, Throne of Baal.
---
My favorite part was the click execute haha.
---
I'd love to experience vanilla with updated graphics including new hd models and everything you already mentioned. It would greatly improve the feeling of the game for me and I am really looking forward to it. We'll be looking at the old world through new eyes! However I have to say I really like the old water and will probably leave it in the 'original state'. I can't really describe it but I find the old water to be very fitting for the game.
---
Can't really understand why people would want to limit us by removing the high graphic settings. If you wanna play on the old outdated graphics be my guest but don't expect me to do the same 15 years later. People take 'no changes' very seriously, to the point of fanaticism and I think it's pointless and uncalled for. 
---
Inb4 'play bfa hurr durr!'...
---
Deep Wounds definitely cares about your weapon, though. And it’s fairly reliable with imp. Overpower. 
---
However, why not just level sword-and-board arms instead of prot, then? It’s not like prot talents actually do a lot for you except making you better at fighting higher level enemies, which you shouldn’t be doing anyway.
---
So your argument is that you won’t take what blizzard says at face value. That’s fine, but not really worth trying to get into any meaningful discussion about since there’s really no common ground to work with. Just wait a few months once the hype dies down and see whether or not it’s the game you want it to be lol. I mean really what do you even hope to accomplish here?
---
I was thinking of farming gold for tokens but don't know if I can be bothered.
---
OP, I wanted to say thank you for this thread. I’m rolling a shaman because of this thread
---
I believe we aren't going to have moonwalking or walljumping :(
---
I know, I'm rolling a paladin out of spite!
---
&gt;Sir, you can't roll a class out of spite  
---
&gt;Well, then I just want it  
---
&gt;...You already said "spite" so...
---
Same here! Why stop with foliage and water? Add more visuals!
---
I appreciate the attempt at a response, brother
---
At least they would be able to use it for PvE if it was a slight upgrade from what they already have. I haven't been in any guilds that would prio hunters over Warriors (Or even the rare Ret paladin), but the hardcore PvE guilds would for sure.
---
Classic isn’t meant to be played with a adhd goat oriented mindset, you can do that for speed records or world/server firsts. But the phases make it not really matter, a few weeks of mc gear divided between 40 people isn’t really a big deal. 
---
Those few may end up with a decent gold advantage down the line, but with a hardcore play style that would happen anyway.
---
You should try to Hamstring kite
---
Switch the rogue and hunter grouping.
---
Double stealth is what I'm looking forward too.
---
&gt; You must use all 51 talent points.
---
Bakers dozens!

No I haven't for over a decade.

You'd be right cause the game was ass I never cared to play the WOTLK after season 5. Came back after LK was on farm for a year good times
---
Join a private server for now, that is what I did.  I just joined a private server to kind of figure out what class I want to play when classic drops and to keep my hype under control.
---
I play a resto Druid on a Voldemort server, and I plan on rolling Holy Pally in Classic. First , as a Druid, you have to accept that you are the worst throughput healer in the game. You have to be okay with giving the other healers your innervate. Druids have the most *powerful* heal in the game, but in general, they are weak compared to the other 3, but because of that, they’re easier to gear. 
---
Pallies are excellent because they have the most efficient heal in the game. They have less 5-man utility, like tranquility or nature’s swiftness, but can still do a better job at constant chug-healing.
---
You also bring a blessing to the raid. 1 Druid is all that’s necessary for Mark, but 3-5 pallies provide something fresh to the raid. Might, Wisdom, Kings, Salvation, and Light. Giving 20 or 40 people a buff like that is gamechanging. 
---
So as long as you are fine with wearing a dress, and fighting with 4 other pallies over the nicer more epic dress, you should enjoy paladin. But do play what your heart calls out to.
---
And he was not orc either
---
because it was found to still be incorrect as little as like a month or two ago when someone claimed to have broken joana's record and it was all still wrong?
---
Man, using voice chat in a fantasy game teaches you real quick just how inept some people are at sounding out words.
---
Yams on Eredar?
---
I hope there are 19 twinks. I loved fighting for the chest in gurubashi arena. I plan to help which ever twink guild is on my server.
---
No. Played on laughing skull, akama and sargeres
---
Just let her pick what she likes and I guess you can play something that compliments her choice.
---
I wouldn't pick for her, part of the fun is in making that choice for yourself.
---
Idk if it's specifically 14, but it's basically:
---
Warriors: Arms/Prot clearly best until later stages of Vanilla, when Fury becomes good.
---
Paladin: Holy/Prot, ret mostly just awful.
---
Shaman: Resto, others mostly just awful, and even resto ain't great.
---
Hunter: Marks was pretty much always the only good spec, iirc. Surv had some PvP viability, BM I believe was mostly always bad.
---
Rogue: Combat
---
Druid: Resto...sort of. Innervate bots in raids, 5man and PvP gods. 
---
Mage: Frost/Fire, I believe Arcane had a weird window of strength for some areas/fights in BWL.
---
Warlock: Affliction
---
Priest: Holy.
---
Mattelf...
---
Matt the Night elf rogue
---
/cringe
---
No.
---
The biggest downside to warrior is that they're MONSTROUSLY gated by gear in both PvP and PvE. While almost all classes are, they're pretty up there. Warriors are pretty likely to be by far the most popular class alongside rogues (people want perdition blade ambush 1shots in PvP), so it's going to be hard to get the items you want.
---
One of the biggest upsides to playing hunter like I plan to is that I imagine it'll be a much rarer class. Deadzone, pet feeding, ammo, etc, makes it not the most attractive class.
---
Mage for sure. You have so much control and your spells will hit hard naked.
---
Other than that Hunters, Rogues and Warlocks.
---
Ate you excited for it to be coming to PC? The while series!
---
Can you stay Arms spec and tank lvl 60 five man content ok?
---
Ya highly likely mate. Even on 1.12 pservers you can implement the modern models quite easily. It’s client side choice so up to you.  
---
Will it be against Blizzard terms and conditions, mmm probably will be so just be aware. I remember back in Vanilla people would swap out the Black Lotus model for a large bright white cube so it was suuuper obvious for them. Obviously that was dodgy af so tampering with the models is a risk.
---
Yeah I think it's one of the weaker ones.. mainly because of the core mechanic of the raid. If it wasn't that constant gauntlet style I think I'd remember it more fondly. I still think it's a pretty magical raid though and yeah Archimond was nucking futz! One of the most intense boss fights ever made.. ugh and the loot was so amazing in that xpac.. I really hope they do TBC next..
---
Just do it
---
Everyone saying Drakedog is wrong. Drakedog was an undead warlock.
---
Good point. Has anyone done the math on mana regen while leveling to see if 100% increase is worth it vs the life tap?
---
It's going to take a lot of getting used to with all this +healing gear. They threw all the best stuff on cloth pieces so it's like, "Wow, look at all this cool Tier gear! Out the window it goes!" 
---
I played Priest from Wrath through MoP, Druid for WoD, and Druid and Paladin for Legion. (Played Warlock and Hunter for Vanilla and BC).
---
I'm pretty over Priest but I still have a deep love for Druid and Paladin so it's really hard for me to decide because Vanilla is pretty time intensive compared to the later expansions.
---
Additionally, I'm running a guild with Loot Council. Which is tough because obviously every player wants an upgrade but you have to be fair with how you distribute loot. This makes Druid appealing because they are generally fewer in number as you suggest. However, as you also suggest, Paladins are generally more useful in just about every area.
---
Really tough choice.
---
Mate. Let us say it again: No software issue (malicious, unintentional, bug, no bug) should ever be *capable* of getting your GPU that hot.
---
I don't know if we are speaking Chinese. 80 °C is already stretching it.
---
You do you and nobody is arguing that PoE does not have a shit code base. If I were you I would at least look *into* what we are saying here. Some of us deal with these things for a living.
---
No memes i'll level dw arms this time around so ye
---
Only works with slow 2h
---
not necessarily minimum effort, it often takes a ton of effort too.
---
More like "no improvement is too small" meaning you'd take the minimal improvement to maximize effectiveness. .05% more DPS from a sword? Gotta get it.
---
Same here man. From Xarcriloth to Xarc for vanilla I reckon. Too many people just butcher it these days...
---
Funny you should mention that. That was actually one of the main contributors to me stopping playing. I’m the priest towards the left without a name over my head. I can’t tell you how it felt to play so many hours in order to get the best gear in the game, only to have it replaced by a green at level 62. Most of my guild stuck it out through TBC but towards the end it just wasn’t the same anymore. I quit during WOTLK and intermittently played all the expansions until now. I can’t wait to play classic again. But that being said, Kyotee was an excellent tank. Good dude too
---
IIRC KFC was a certain 3's team comp. Can't remember exactly what it was though. Think it involved a hunter?
---
I reckon I prefer alliance over horde when it comes down to cities, also I prefer alliance silhouettes. A group of humans, gnomes, dwarves and night elves look better than the horde. However individually, I really like Thunder Bluff and Tauren themselves, whereas human is kinda boring. So I'm not really sure to be honest.
---
I had to set weather effects to minimum back in the day so I would really like to see this make a comeback.
---
He’s a nub. He should be overpower-spamming with sweeping strikes up...what a nub
---
Didn’t even know it was still a thing, are the developing it and selling new stuff? Or is it like retro now
---
theres definitely new players that are new to wow as a whole
---
Cat is decent dps early on in raids, they get outpaced by everyone else though, ferals are probably even better than a warrior for off tanking, and Resto is obviously their typical raiding spec. Unless you’re in a hardcore guild it’s probably be easy to find a spot considering nobody plays Druid.
---
As for people min maxing I see a lot more complaints about min makers shitting on casuals for their choices than anyone actually shitting on people for their choices.
---
Would it really be more DPS to have the doomguard hit a friendly warrior than to just use it to attack the boss?
---
1-60 = 20/31 arms
---
...that’s all I got
---
Grinding random mobs to level cooking isn't a challenge. It's tedium. Also there were never achievements in vanilla. You don't get 300 cooking because it's just a hill to climb, it's useful.
---
Or just wait a few mins until someone creates a horde and join then. Less dev work.
---
1-58 Arms spec 
---
58-60 Deep Prot, tank dungeons for practice. 
---
Phase 1-2 most likely stay deep prot, switch to impale/prot if the guild is needing higher threat and healers can handle it. 
---
Phase 3 on, probably primarily impale/prot until I think they can handle fury tanking.
---
Is there a progression guide for warrior? Basically, gear and playstyle progression from leveling through gearing in dungeons and further?
---
Considering leveling a warrior with a friend (because that's what I wish I had chose to main all those years ago in retail WoW) and I wanna read up on what I'm getting myself into.
---
This list is so bad it’s not even funny, why do you people try to say this stuff when literally anyone who knows about vanilla can easily see how little you know.
---
Halo 1, 2 &amp; 3.
---
So in what world is 2 comments in a 70+ comment thread stating druids are a weaker class hateful then? How where those two comments shitting on druids.
---
its more like 50% dps to 7-15% survivability. The ironic thing is increasing dps increases survivability, but increasing survivability only increases total damage done by living longer, dps stays low.
---
Even if those changes made sense, people wont like it #nochanges
---
I have up to legion, never bought/subbed during bfa, so im happy lol
---
Donkey Kong Country 1, 2 and 3. Some people will argue which game was the best, but for me, each release surpassed the last.
---
People think warlock=drakedog, they obviously have no idea what they're talking about.
---
Yeah I stopped playing a lot when ICC was released.  I never fought the Lich King until Warlords.
---
slam is a good ability, similar to mortal strike iirc
---
Sure. But working a 9 to 5, come back home and check on news on the re-release of a 15 year old game that's gonna disappoint most of the people that are desperately waiting for it...
---
Idk, dude. It doesn't seem optimal.
---
ye its kinda relaxing
---
Man I hope so. I loved fighting for the gurubashi chest
---
Hi, /u/sudosamwich
---
Yes I am hoping for tbc as well!
---
This was pretty close to mine.  Deep prot with no  30 point attack, and no impale or enrage.
---
That’s pretty terrible
---
Funny post, but to keep it on topic:
---
As a feral Druid you simply have to go the extra mile if you want to play this class/spec in a way so you are not just getting carried by your guild.
---
**Tanking/Off-tanking**
---
Your primary role will be tanking and off-tanking. So you have all the consumables, gear (includes resistance gear which is expensive) and enchants of a tank. Plus you want to have a bag that is at least half full of MCP's for bosses/encounters, where you need to get ahead on threat ASAP or in between mechanics. Also gearing is tricky, because to get optimal gear you need a mix of "off pieces" that are spread around all over the game. Even if you do all of these things a Warrior will always be needed for specific fights and will always be a better AoE tank. An unbuffed feral tank is a middleground between a prot tank (casual/semi-hardcore, mitigation based) and a fury/defiance tank (hardcore, threat based) so you'll never be the "best" at either threat or mitigation but always a secondary choice.
---
**DPS as a Cat**
---
Your secondary role is DPSing in cat. Your DPS quite frankly sucks if you don't put in the work. Again, MCP farming and powershifting as well. Also you want DPS buffs and consumables and on top of that you need mana potions and some of the caster buffs that increase your mana sustain because if you stop powershifting your DPS will drop. If you don't have time for all these things you will always be sub-par on DPS. If you do, you still won't break top 5 regularly in a guild w/o slackers. Some of your gear pieces are shared with feral tanking but most of them aren't.
---
**Off-healing/decursing/dispelling**
---
You will also want to do this on certain fights, simply because it is more useful, so you gear up for this as well, plus consumables, enchants etc. You can heal the easier 5mans solo but apart from that you kind of suck at this role obviously. But you still need/want to do it sometimes if the situation calls for it.
---
**Conclusion**
---
As a feral Druid you'll never be the best at anything compared to specialized classes/specs, despite investing *more* than most others except if you are surrounded by inexperienced or casual players and you are the only tryhard. Don't play a feral Druid.
---
They using modern game engine so you cant just toggle it
---
It should come down to what you want to play. I think endgame Pally is more rewarding, but leveling is obviously miles easier as a Druid. 
---
Also, if you’re going to RL as a Pally, you can call a wipe and GUARANTEE you have wipe protection via Divine Intervention.
---
Rogues have to make their own poisons
---
I have 3 other friends that are going to play. I'm trying to convince them that we should all go Druid or a combo of Druid/Rogue so we can do stealth Instance runs and World PVP ganking.
---
Assuming horde, this is the correct answer.
---
Don't display the faction balance and make it so the locked faction get's free realm transfer to another server that isn't locked for your faction.
---
I see you are a warrior main that wants no competition
---
Does anybody have some tips and wisdom for being a guild leader in classic?
---
I plan to raid, but slightly more on the casual side for quite some time. I'll be running BRD a LOT, and helping guildies level until then.
---
Wow I never knew First Aid was so necessary ha. Thanks for the advice! Will put cloth in First Aid first, then Tailoring
---
It really doesn't help healers in pve. People tend to over-exaggerate things they read here. If they hear eng is good for tanks they will repeat it, even though it's all for one over-rated shield.
---
Yeah that sounds like a chore tbh.  Tokens aren't even that much atm (around 100k gold last I checked), but the whole economy is deflated.
---
Druids don't have the healing toolkit of priests, the utility and AoE healing of shamans or the raw tank-healing power and crucial buffs of paladins. HoTs don't stack in vanilla and aren't that strong anyway. Druid healing pretty much amounts to an endless stream of rank 4 Healing Touch which is fairly mana efficient but doesn't have anything over the other healers.
---
Sssaaammmeeeeee. Put some good time into Risk of Rain 2 but then I started playing vanillagaming private server to test talents and such. It's a 15X xp server so you don't waste alot of time.

No, since BOE have direct gold value.
---
I don't need freezing band, but I need edgemasters. X gold from selling freezing band then buying edgemasters is exactly the same thing.
---
The thing is shamans are so powerful that it is almost always better to have one in a group than not to have one, regardless of the spec and this includes raiding as well.
---
For example if you have a group with 5 melee DPS you can switch your best equipped fury warrior or combat rogue with a shitty enh shaman and still come out ahead on overall DPS and utility.
---
Yeah, imagine thinking every class gets a viable spec.
---
I know nothing about warriors (except how to keep your sorry asses alive), but if you look up Kargoz on Youtube, he does a lot of leveling guides. I can't attest to the accuracy, but it at least seems like he does his homework. He also has some discussions about duo leveling.
---
This reply makes absolutely no sense. I don’t even know if you’re trying to agree or disagree with me because it’s so far from anything I was talking about in my comment

Sweet, I'll definitely check him out.

I played a lot at night during vanilla on US servers and it was frequently day time. I very much recall forum threads from Australian players before the Oceania servers were available. Don't have any more than that...

I'm in the same spot mate. Decided to take up programming :)

---
Just did it. 30 mins in mulgore
---
You're right on waiting and seeing. It's the best thing to do here.
---
There really is no point to debating the matter. I'll either find classic to be a worthy experience, or I won't.
---
Truth be told, as much as I loved classic I will probably be better served moving on anyway when it's all said and done.
---
It’s pretty nice for farming.  No down time

Why you lying bro? Were you the bozo that bought my account? LoL
