When you leave group inside an instance it automatically hearths you out after one minute even if your hearth is on cd
---
---
---
You're the pathetic one posting about being jealous of a bald man who makes more money than you know what to do with. I legit cannot understand why someone would hate asmon. I've never heard a valid response. and neither is yours.
---
But isn't this just for the raids and dungeons? Like it shows you drop rates but only for the instances themselves? I'm looking for everyday questing information.
---

---
By then I want my Warrior at 60 and a Rogue or Druid half way there.
---
There was a bug with my recording software that wouldn't let me open the clams for some reason. Was kinda embarrassing, you can see me try all video. At the end I gave up and destroyed them.
---
The belt dropped for my guild with like 8 dps warrior present.. Me and 2 others had top DPS and i went high bid on it expecting an all in attack.. I won  it. With half my DKP spent :P They either doesn't know just how good it is or they are hoping for it to not be super rare as it was in vanilla hehe.
---
I've known him since we were 11 and I supply most of his work. I am priority lol
---
how about "lmao"
---
You’re on to something here.
---
Hmm I don't own Microsoft Office haha. Maybe Google Sheets will suffice once I'm home from work later.
---
It do be like that.
---
Fairbanks?
---
Its not the highest stat roll iirc, so not a crazy amount.
---

---
The 18 healing wands are about 100g on my server if that gives a reference.
---
+33 healing is the highest roll fyi and is the best healing wand in the game. Probably worth a few thousand gold.
---
Or maybe you didn't have the gold to buy the recipe off the ah, this they're fwrming the recipe. Nice try, though
---
This meme is overplayed or y'all are on imaginary land server where rainbow farts shit gold diamonds.
---
That doesnt mean shit to me, I want to play classic wow, not some shitty private server sweaty's version of it
---
The ability to make my pre raid bis robes
---
Horde only, sorry
---
This is accounted for in his calculation.
---
Chance to not see on next attempt^ number of attempts = chance to not see after number of attempts
---
Jesus, he actually got annihilated lol
---
So they're rolling in order to not spend 50g? How is that different from rolling to make 50g?
---
Print Screen is sooo 2018, man.  Get with the times!
---
NGL, Hovered my mouse over the robe to see the stats just now.
---
I'd forgotten about this dungeon and now I want to run it. Just need a few more levels to be able to tank it.
---
Where is Rexxar
---
That is an insane amount of free time to have and most people with full time jobs absolutely do not have that kind of time.
---
yeah I meant specifically in regards to the same faction
---
Might as well get a server transfer already. Seeing as he won't be able to play the game anymore....
---
I’m only 20 on my highest haha I’m new to wow
---
Lol you're beyond a waste of time
---
In my country it's normal for people to be able to take off 7 days without a problem (it's actually by law required to take 7 days of in a row once a year weekend included). For food, laundry etc. I just used online services, not really expensive (groceries actually same cost). Not having a social life for 7 days is a difference between not having a social life at all. 
---
Joanas record has been broken so many times since release, don't take it as something that is hard to achieve at this point in time. It took me about 9 days (RL time, literally end of my vacation) to max level.
---
In my country doing what I did is easy to do.
---
Did he kick the officer who ninja’d?
---
Why even bother with all that garbage then?  "LF1M bear BRD anger-ring" is way better.  Yet I've seen the same shit on my server too.
---
It's really just lazy pos warriors that want to get handheld through content as they fatfinger their easy rotation while wf totem/salv buffed.  I say this as a warrior myself.
---
I'll be honest, got half way thru and decided tldr. Sounds like shit dps who dont understand how threat works and when you have a shit healer who can't keep the shit dps alive it makes for a bad time. 
---
Not your buddies fault.
---
nochanges
---
Eh not very fun in my opinion. Even though this stuff can suck if I play PVE might as well play a single player game
---
Ah yes... the TRUE psycopath emerges.
---
Everytime in desolace you forget how to take screenshots on your computer?
---
i didn't think it was possible, but i've had sword spec and thrash blade go back and forth for 4 extra attacks.
---
Hey I've played with Onithruster before! YOJAMBA REPRESENT
---
Oh yea I forgot how playing an MMO solo is the point of MMOs. No matter that our pets and most important pvp skills are broken. And that we dont scale in group PVE.
---
But hey! At least we can run instances alone.
---
Could be an interesting machinima
---
Classicwow.live guide has you do dungeons and honestly I always seem to out level it a bit.
---
Seems at least decent for warriors / rogues who want to be a bit over level. I haven’t tried the alliance one tho
---
Use the direct short cut?
---
"You're just *jealous!*"
---
For real, how old are you? I ask that unironically, because your fanaticism for a bald man that lives in a pile of garbage and makes his living streaming World of Warcraft to nerds is disturbingly strong. Do you have no real friends that care for you? How much do you have to donate to get him to say your name on stream and get validation as a person for a moment?
---
Best of luck for both.
---
Yeah Druids have a trainer in Stormwind, but Warlocks and Mages have to cross continents to train in the Alliance.
---
I guess Shamans do too until they manage to access the Swamp of Sorrows.
---
I hope I am misunderstanding you and you are not actually saying it’s ok to take your phone out while driving if the traffic is slow or you’re facing a red light.
---
This shit is still normal oh gehennas
---
You realize how subjective that is, right? In my opinion dun morogh is by far the coolest zone.
---
You will learn as you go along. Healing dungeons in the beginning is ez pz.
---
Focus on the tank. Wand mobs to try to trigger spirit tap. 
---
Keep an extra set of gear with +healing for when you go in to dungeons.
---
Everyone will tell you to spec in shadow, and you can easily heal to near 60, which is very true
---
Because Imp slam basically gives you an attack at  1 sec for a 3.5s+ weapon, while delaying your next swing the same amount but not skipping it.  Whereas HS adds a flat amount while costing a full swing.
---
For faster weapons HS is better as the additional dmg is a greater percentage and loss of a white attack costs less rage than it does for a 2H
---
Something and 99
---
Why did you back up? Dude was cut
---
Thanks for the reply. In this case, I think only 1 of these is a mouseover, if that. 
---
Unfortunately, this isn't an issue of the macros being written incorrectly. That would be a pretty easy fix :D. I have a really solid understand of how to write macros.
---
You can get that off the auction house, that's so much easier, so why would you need to roll to get it?
---
This is how it was with my ex and my cod-playing friends. Had to take it slow but I enjoyed teaching them the basics. Not getting frustrated at the slowness is ver important and you might need a longer explanation like:
---
* WHY THE FUCK DO ANY OF THESE GORETUSKS NOT HAVE ANY LIVERS 😤😤😤😤😤😤😤
---
* What is soulbound
---
* What does a weapon skill do
---
stuff like that
---
 Next thing I know theyre the ones out leveling me. They grow up so fast
---
WoW and caring for small children don't mix well.
---
I don't think +33 drops atm.
---
This is, indeed, the correct answer. 
---
Whispers are purple, by default, while bnet pm's are light blue (as seen in the screenshot)
---
Yeah
---
Maybe, but that's because you don't understand basic economics, if you did you wouldn't disagree with me.
---

---
I expected the wife to be in bed with a felguard
---
&gt;I'll NEVER understand why some people play classic for the PvE content alone.
---
Because there's people in this world who enjoy different things than you?
---
&gt;PvP is what classic is really about, idk why you'd play  something like classic if you didn't have an interest in it.
---
For the hundreds of hours worth of non-pvp content the game has?
---
Heya, I am currently level 38 but I have less than half of the sum required for the mount in my bags.. So, where is a good spot where I can farm some decent money? It doesn't have to be a place to grind exp too, but it would be nice actually
---
This is fucking stupid.
---
none for stupid shit, sry
---
i use it all the time. combined with a sharpening stone, it really gives a noticeable boost to your weapon.
---
That is one of the worst priests ive ever seen lol
---
Report it as a bug, seems to be happening to quite a few people
---
I pretty much always have SS up, and yeah a pvp server, IMO succ is also the best pvp pet to have out. It helps me bait out wotf on undead for example. also '2' was kind of a hyperbole, it's probably 5 or so :p
---
I’m level 36 with 7 gold ... that solo warrior life, doesn’t help to level prot, doing the lord’s work. Praise be to Yevon.
---
Level 27 priest running from Thunder Bluff to Desolace to get the cookbook. Got ganked by a level 40+ rogue. That was all the action I saw this week.
---
did you get your dopamine rush?
---
Grinding devilsaurs is by far the most fun gold grinding activities because of the shenanigans that comes with it. 
---
To answer your question, anything is fair game in my mind because that’s the stance everyone else seems to take.  I’ve had lots of skins stolen and I may have sniped a few myself.

Set an auto walk key so you can run around easier. Could also get a left handed mouse with 12 buttons and just set all your major skills to that and ay left handed.
---
If its such an issue why play a Hunter? Or do you just like to complain?

Noone tricked you into rolling it and you had 15 years to decide on the ultimate class.

I'm not playing on the streamer fanboy server sorry

You're so right man, some people just have no shame.

They could get an alt to buy it out towards the end of the AH listing.
---
yeah i would never sell them on the AH. just spam trade and avoid the deposit and AH cut. "WTS Swift whatever 50g cheaper than vendor"
---
they save 50g, you make 50g. or make the margin whatever you want. 90/10, 80/20, whatever.

This is pretty much how I leveled fishing. While otherwise sitting on meetings, I would double right click and only glance to move my cursor to the bobble. Only clicking by sound and repeating.

I would never have noticed a chat.

Way too many things factor into that to give you a precise answer. Could be anywhere from quite a bit faster to twice as long, depending on how you approach the whole thing.

All time favorite arena video.  Talbadar was an absolute animal of a priest.

If this is true it makes me feel good about how wrong preexisting notions of compilations needed for MC are.
---
Were all of the players familiar with MC?
---
No way it’s almost a third of players across all popular MMOs, figures are probably skewed from people having multiple accounts being treated as multiple people or something, or maybe just a small sample of people studied.The risk of getting banned/scammed is enough to deter most people, couple that with the actual cost of these services, and I can’t imagine that more than 10-15% get involved. I have no idea really, just a guess, but 30% seems too high to me.
---
The same exact thing happened to me, Bow of Searing arrows dropped 30 mins after I bought my mount
---
France and Quebec both have laws like this that enforce the use of French but I don’t know the specifics either and how it relates to entertainment products.

Pre-BiS is more an ego thing than an actual requirement. You can clear these dungeons in mostly greens, a decent set of dungeon blues is more than sufficient.

100% sure he was laughing about it. I almost had him on the first pass; he was at 2% and I missed my auto attack. #PaladinLife

Why is it that I have zero opinion on gamergate or even know a lick about it, but always think the anti gamergaters (I dont even know how to define the sides, is this correct?) always come off as unintelligent industry rubes before I even know who they are? Im supposed to see them as the good guys but they all have really strange logic that makes me come to opposite conclusion of them every where I dont even try to find them
---
Edit: for clarification I mean conclusion on video games specifically
---
This will be Phase 5 with all the other more useful food recipes.
---
Actually i do
---
That depends somehwat on the laptop in question too. Back in old school SWTOR i raided on a macbook pro. The big two issues were that the grpahics card, which had no fans to cool it, was right under the wasd keys, and that the resting position for having your hand on wasd had the sharp edge of the laptop digging into your wrist. I actually had a callous on my wrist for a while because of that. Some laptops are just not designed for prolonged high stress use.
---
Good timing, he just finished his sentence. :)
---
Yeah, I was thinking that, but it’s still 60g gone in auction fees!
---
When I was leveling my shammy I would heal for dungeons and people would ask if I was resto and I would say yea....mostly. I had like 1 point more in resto than enhance
---
You realise like 80% of the player base isnt even 60 yet?
---
Good, leave. No one cares that you aren't in the group anymorem

They're going to be used for Argentum Dawn quests eventually, not sure when these are coming into the game, though.

Very little is needed to clear MC, certainly not specific comps.  Now speed running MC is a different story..

Google sheets has the same functionality as excel for these types of calculations.

Sure it is. Just go look on the auction house now, there's lots of boe's there.

Not everyone has good loot RNG. I bought pretty much nothing, a few more spells than I needed but not nearly all of them and I didn't have enough money until 41, after I spent a day fishing.

I see a lot if people having free gold/items, you don’t have a post about how you enjoy this game but for people kindness. They are buying your vote.

What race/class did yalls wives pick?

My GF agreed to play one time with me and I’m wondering what she will pick.

I dont think so

I'm arguing that dumbasses will then act like asking for a layer invite is "abusing layering". Read the initial parent comment I was responding to. Guy was saying this was proof that people in his guild asking for layer invites were abusing layering to the same degree.

Something tells me OP hasnt played WoW at all.  The reason is that they know nothing of both BFA and Classic.   They would still know about BFA if they had it and were subbed as well as having access to Classic. But they're asking about trying an MMORPG.  This suggests they have zero experience of either.
---
I’ve only got 18 gold at lvl 35, not sure what to do.
---
Friends... what are those? ;3
---
It's a battlenet message. Bnet gives no fucks about faction.
---
How do you come to that conclusion? All I see are comparisons on how the focus shifted and valid criticisms of both games.
---
eesh i'd take that poorly if that were me. I imagine he has other clients as well? Unless he's missed his deadlines that is..
---
First time gamer here too! My boyfriend got me into classic and now I'm a level 22 night elf druid and I just bought a gaming laptop (for school ok)
---
It is my class. Im not a min maxxer that picks based on what class is best. Sorry I forgot about the rule on this sub that you cant complain about blatant bugs.

oh wait, that rule isnt a thing. Let people complain. It is how things get fixed you clown.

And he still makes hundreds of thousands of dollars off of it. I love to hate on the dude (I do think he's a good entertainer &amp; I enjoy some of his streams), but he's living the dream of most people on this sub. Making insane amounts of money doing nothing but streaming WoW all day. I love the hate boner people have for him on this sub. This sub's hate for Asmon alone has earned him 1000's of viewers.

I mean, I've made more than that and I haven't played actively for the last 1,5w. Only logging in a couple times a day to update AH offers and make new stuff to sell.

Just know your shit with the AH and place your ass in orgrimmar and you can make that kind of money fairly easily.

Roth UI was taken over by someone else from WoD onward (me).  
---
There's a classic release on wowinterface
---
[removed]
---
Thank you!
---
I'm the author of Roth UI - there has been a classic version released on wowinterface.
---
6% or 9%
---
They should be able to, but that doesn't me they should or that they will on average. Your average player doesn't even come close to the mount by 40, that's just the statistic.  
---
 
---
Probably a good call vendoring your items. I've used sooooo many iron grenades and could've been vendoring those the whole time. All that silk and iron. But it seemed like the natural thing to do, especially being on a high pop balanced pvp realm.  
---
  
---
Also - your average player doesn't do each dungeon more than once unless it's a multiphase dungeon like BRD or SM. I bet you made quite a bit of money if you were doing each dungeon 1-3 times.  Having a steady guild also helps! 
---
   
---
What class do you play?
---
I've updated Roth UI (and the ouf it uses) for classic. (:
---
Yet you still buy food. I have never had to buy food, Ever. The exception being needing buff food and not having time to farm it when i raided. 
---
The gold saved from making my own with whatever I've had at the time is immense; let alone the profits of having random buff food to sell at any given point. 
---
Fishing need not apply, Just the normal grind can turn cooking into a profitable venture. It's just plain inefficient to to not have it.

Yeah I'm gonna need a drawtard to draw this for my entertainment pls

It's actually very easy to watch 1-2 Asmongold streams and instantly realize that he's a dipshit.

Haha

He did some cleaning on stream a while ago, I think he cleans his shit up once every few months. He's just really messy and dirty and he doesn't give a fuck about hygiene, I wouldn't be surprised if he showers like once a week. His teeth are rotten and falling out too. Pretty insane.

roll a druid, you will get defaulted all gear, and be able to tank dps or heal

we are on 1.12 too so druid tanking is legit for a lot of content

Can you draw up the whole situation mentioned in that post? It was pretty funny
---
No but $$$$$

No dude. He's right. You are just a miserable shit. This isn't a ninja. It's a mage with tailoring needing on a recipe for tailor. The fact you can't fathom that is pretty incredulous, given how many times the simple logic of it has been beaten over your uncannily impervious melon. Either understand how crafting professions work, grow some thicker skin, do BOTH, or just stop playing WoW. You are the problem.

There is a shit load of things I wanna do still and I'm BiS also. If you aren't driven to do any of the other content my best advice would be to do some away from wow until raids.

This is a fairly naive statement. Their infrastructure is fine, there are just general technical limitations with having so many clients in a specific zone. Things aren't always as simple as "throw more hardware st it"

If you like mockumentaries like the office or parks&amp;rec you'll probably like Trailer Park Boys. I'm on Season 8/12 right now and I've loved every part of it.

Me and moat of my guild have never done MC before and our reaction to half the bosses was "oh that's a boss?". Shit is stupid easy, doesnt mean I didnt have fun but there is no point denying how easy it is.
---
I think you should appeal this anyway. A Blizzard rep looking at your logs can see the human error of the timing between button presses not being perfectly in sync every single time and realize it was not a script or macro or anything.
---
I dunno man I just found myself super bored.
---
I'm very interested in the differences between classic and retail as games and dont shy away from long form videos. 
---
For example: if I made a video about classic vs retail armor sets and talked for legitimately 20 minutes about mismatched color sets of items and led with verbiage such as: unrefined, thoughtless, and disorganized to describe classic I would be missing an entire element of the game. 
---
Classic isnt skyrim. The constant computer generated fan art of their lower level characters and their mismatched gear shows that the chaos creates charm.
---
It would watch like a deep dive that lacks....depth.
---
That's what I felt the whole video
---
Yeah edibles are weird AF. I started off with em them. Sometimes I'd feel nothing, and other times 10-20mg would dome me. Edibles are super different for ppl
---
It wouldn’t, since the undead are the same species as human.
---
Yeah so right now I’m using WW axe and Ravager mainly but when tanking I usually use sword and shield
---
(1) Like the other guy mentioned, you can go to /luna settings, go to raid, scroll down to buffs and debuffs. Check it and select which position you want to show them around the outside of the raid's health bar (Top, Bottom, Left, Right). 
---
This will make all buffs / debuffs show up along the outside of the health bar. 
---
Or this way (I just found out yesterday) to make the buffs/debuffs show up inside the health bar. 
---
(2) Go to Luna settings, go to raid, scroll down to Squares. Check the position you want the squares to show up inside the health bar. 
---
I have mine customized so "Divine Spirit;Prayer of Spirit" will show on the bottom left corner of the health bar (I checked 'Texture' so I get the icon), "Power Word:Fortitude;Prayer of Fortitude" will show up on the top left corner, and Dispel is supposed to give a solid-colored box ('Texture' not selected) on the top right corner of the health bar if it's something I can dispel.
---
At least I think that's what Dispel will do. Just did it yesterday so haven't had a chance to test it.
---
Waiting an hour for mail to arrive is better than selling stuff instantly? Okay then
---
Even there!
---
What does it come out at, besides the runes? I think I spent almost 500 to craft and enchant my truefaith: 60g pattern, 200g mooncloth, 80g orbs, 40g pearls, 30 dye = 410; 10 dust, 10 shards, 40 essences, 20 fee = 80.
---
I also got about 10 runes while farming elites in winterspring for eye of shadow before giving up &gt;.&gt;
---
This type of information is hidden from the client on purpose. Any add on would just be a database like atlas loot, and the information would be based on observations, not true drop rates.

So far so good. It was only 170g and ended up getting  little over 140 through

I saved a lot as I was able to gather rugged leather and scales myself. I could perhaps grind devilsaurs solo for their leather, but getting paid for leather will be much better, I think.
---
Yeah you're right that's asking for a lot from you since you have zero critical logic thinking skills. All evidence presented points to zero ninja'ing.

Lol!

It bugged you so much that was only the first time you watched him eh? Way to bandwagon

You cant charge back that easily. On paypal you cant use buyers protection for digital goods for example. So no chargeback there

ANYONE!?!?

This is what happened to me too lool

The shit that some people try and pull is outrageous. Once everything settles down, hopefully these kind of people start to get a bad rep and it will discourage this kind of behaviour.

I reported several people I assumed were botting at Qia. They were camping her 16+ hours a day. After an entire day and a half using basically that macro and only getting one recipe (useless enchant), I gave up and bought a similar recipe off the AH at about 1/10th the price of the insane 40-45g runecloth bag pattern. I just wanted the pattern, not a way to buy an epic fucking mount. That being said, I can't blame anyone for taking advantage of aspects of the game. Instead I blame blizz for not making the pattern BoP, but #nochanges amirite?
---
Should be noted the alt pattern I used required additional/more mats than the bags, and are only worth vendoring as an item.
---
Level your character as you please, then start another to level with her as you will inevitably have discrepancies of leveling speed. This other character should be able to do it all to keep you and her healed and tanked for, perhaps paladin if you are alliance.
---
Hell I'm 47 and have only gotten to 56g

Yeah i meant farm as in just getting easy wins. If you go vs other good premades you might be stuck in  a 40 minute game.

Lol. Dense as a stone. Though I guess arguing with a rock makes me the crazy one...

I never said he made content about 5 mans, my position has been and remains to be that his content is applicable across the board. My stance hasn't changed. You fail to understand that one can learn with out being hand held through some terrible step by step 5 man dungeon guide. It appears now that we have come full circle. Agree to disagree I suppose. I'll allow you, YEE MIGHTY TANK GOD OF ZUL FARRAK, the last word as is customary for someone of your stature. I will not be responding. Feel free to continue "dying on this hill" or w.e.

If I replaced that robe during p1, I wouldn’t even bother crafting it.
---
This is off topic but does 300 mg actually hit you?  It’s hard to justify $50 for one high. I’ve never had a good edibles high though, highest they sell in WA is 100 mg and I gotta eat 10 packets of sugar for that shit and it does absolutely nothing
---
Sorry I’m retarded
---
Edit: but I did see a video of a guy who made a macro to actually use charge when in combat. Assume it’s not possible anymore (that was 13 years ago)
---
Warriors have an ability in berzerker stance that allows them to charge in combat called Intercept

Wow he is so damn talented!

He would only get 50 gold if he sold it. Saving 50 gold by not having to buy it is completely different from earning 50 gold. You're literally the only person in this post that fails to understand that.

Take the context into account and read the comments, the video is meant to appeal to broad audience, which of course isn't that interesting for the hardcore wow-people.

It’s just random luck... or more often, lack thereof.  You don’t hear much from the people that get them quicker.  That being said, I rocked double Mass of McGowan from the AH until I got my Dal blades on my retail rogue all those years ago -- maces are surprisingly useful in PvP and in various dungeons where except for the bosses, everything can be stunned.

The way that this question gets answered anywhere I have seen is that blizzard has a "One Macro, One Key" rule. That is to say that pushing one button should always yield one in game action. This is why any macros with multiple "/Casts" in it take two presses to go all the way through. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The actual terms say:
---
Cheating: Create, use, offer, promote, advertise, make available and/or distribute the following or assist therein:
---
1. **cheats;** i.e. methods not expressly authorized by Blizzard, influencing and/or facilitating the gameplay, including exploits of any in-game bugs, and thereby granting you and/or any other user an advantage over other players not using such methods;
---
2. **bots;** i.e. any code and/or software, not expressly authorized by Blizzard, that allows the automated control of a Game, or any other feature of the Platform, e.g. the automated control of a character in a Game;
---
3. **hacks;** i.e. accessing or modifying the software of the Platform in any manner not expressly authorized by Blizzard; and/or
---
4. any code and/or software, not expressly authorized by Blizzard, that can be used in connection with the Platform and/or any component or feature thereof which changes and/or facilitates the gameplay or other functionality; 
---
None of the individual components of the script should be bannable, however, automating them would be. For example, if you were to use your "gaming keyboard software" (3rd party application) to set up a macro key that would press all four of them for you in a single keypress...that would be automation and you would be in violation. In this example you could argue that detecting the difference between a keyboard doing it and a human would be negligible as they would exhibit similar characteristics, which is precisely what makes my argument impossible to win :) I am by no means the authority of Blizzard Terms, just use your best judgement and try to learn from my mistakes.
---
I never said reserving all righteous orbs in a pug was fair. I simply said that it is common practice in a pug to give the first orb to the tank. It is incentive, so pugs don’t spend two hours spamming in lfg then another two hours in the dungeon.
---
It’s a common thing.... I didn’t invent it. Sure the same could be done for a healer if you need one of those. Although, the main point is that reserving gear, if anything lets people know you aren’t willing to compete for an item, and if you need the same one, find another group. My guild and I help each other out with all the items we need yes... once in a while we need to fill a spot, and we politely explain what the situation is to everyone.
---
Its vendor sell proce not vendor cost. My blue mount doesnt have a sell price so I assume the same is true for the epic mounts. Basically this means it costs nothing to list.
---
Yeah I’ve since gotten more educated about it and how to make them myself as well. I 100% back these tips if you’re having a prob w edibles. 
---
I do use trim to make my own, a comment I made a few minutes ago states my buddy sells me his trim (typically about 7-8oz) that i use to make my own
---
You can disenchant any level item at level 5 I believe
---
Yeah...  Gotta take it nice and easy tho. You add mounts there, then here and all of a sudden everyone has a Ferrari whereas right now we have Honda Civics.
---
I had about 120g when I hit 40. If you're hard up for gold, here's a few tips:  
---
* Take two gathering professions and sell everything.  
---
* *Don't* start leveling a crafting profession - you probably won't need anything you can make for a long time so it's pointless and a waste of money. You can always switch later, so save it for after your mount is covered.  
---
* Try to use looted gear or run some dungeons, don't buy anything from the AH unless it's absolutely necessary (your weapon is 20 levels lower than you for example).  
---
* Use the vendor price addon and don't AH your stuff for less than it vends for + the deposit fee. Judge whether it's worth it if it doesn't sell the first time around. Most likely it's more worthwhile to just vendor it to save on downtime with city runs. 
---
* Don't train skills you never use. You can always get them later if you decide you need them, but it's a huge gold sink otherwise.  
---
It might also help to solo when you can. Maybe it was just bad luck for me, but whenever I partied I pretty much helped everybody else get green drops - none ever went my way. If you're in an area you can easily handle solo, don't party with too many people unless everyone's hunting the same "boss" kind of mob. You're just sharing your loot and the more players the less merry that is going to be.
---
It's a difficult topic. Bottom line is that hardcore gamers tried to prove that the majority of them aren't brutal, disgusting misogynists, with the result that it turned out that most hardcore gamers are brutal, disgusting misogynists.
---
Does anyone know of a good dungeon timer? I find it's helpful when grinding dungeons that multiple guildies need gear from, because people have something to focus on and improve. 
---
Currently I'm just referencing the longer buffs for how long we took, but a thing that kept track of discreet groups and gave us benchmark times would be nice.
---
Is this for real you can’t do this??
---
Sure, but then you gotta hope there’s someone that’s in the instances general chat that will join, or hope that someone in lfg can join, but they could be far away from the instance and then you gotta wait 10-20 minutes for them to get there. That’s annoying. And if they’re the tank or healer that just left, that’s even more of a pain. 
---
I care when people leave randomly in the middle, that’s a bitch waiting for a replacement.
---
The world needed tanks. So I became one.
---
I always wondered why they're aren't more undead races. Like if you could pick any race and make them undead.
---
Not after level 40 bb 👌
---
It would seem you only have one choice.
---
Lol by that logic the mages doesn’t “need” the robe pattern either, he just wants it for the money. The money he’ll save by not having to buy it from someone else. In the end it’s an increase in net worth, whether from items or raw gold. 
---
The mage does not need the gold more than anyone else.
---
That's a reason to make selling accounts illegal, which it is. Not a reason to ban multiboxing
---
Nice
---
Right, so you run out of the cave while hitting A and D and the melee mobs won't be able to hit you.
---
Use a macro. When I switch stances I also switch weapons at the same time.
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
/equip 16 1h_Weapon
---
/equip 17 Shield
---
/cast Battle Stance 
---
/equip 2h_Weapon
---
It works well enough for me. It leaves some flexibly out (such as if you want to go battle stance but keep your shield on) but you can make more macros for different possibilities. But this suits me 99% of the time.
---
anyone can make a raid group and have people /follow and /assist macro to one keybind and spam. it it's not different
---
Everyone hit need, hows that being a ninja
---
Its self explanatory, besides nothing I say you to would ever be understood so it's not even worth trying. I've been trying to get you to understand for over an hour but you are just too dull.
---
These mounts dont have sell proces so they dont have AH listing fees right?
---
Funny coming from a guy with zero evidence of his ridiculous claim.
---
No i completely agree with you. Organizing groups based about the needs/wants of each member is the most efficient and objective way to grind dungeons.
---
What do you consider an impressive achievement in wow then, or in real life for that matter?  Anything can be done with enough time invested.
---
This isnt a ninja loot, everyone needed.
---
When did I say I sent anything? I’m confused.  I took stuff out of my actual bank, maybe you’re confused about that? Not my bank alt but the physical bank in Darnassus.  People here are fucking ridiculous about this lol.
---
Never been on it
---
Cool, next time don't spread lies.
---
Yeah I was just wondering anyone has seen one drop in Blasted Lands.
---
I screwed up and disenchanted vendorstrike last night.  Turned 9g into 6g.
---
Nope it was actually 90 flat.  17 for the training and 73 for the mount.
---
Yes I also often think that playing a tank it would be easier for gear and group but warrior leveling seems so slow
---
Well we can all get kodos eventually but you are stuck with kodos and wolves so...
---
&gt;Nah. That’s a poor attitude to have.
---
A poor attitude is to allow people take photos of their screen? Okay... lmao.
---
&gt; Especially since you’re being a hypocrite for trying to stop someone who wants to complain about image quality, from complaining about image quality.
---
Yup. And now you're complaining about my complaining about their complaining. 
---
What a dumb and useless circle are in... all because you incels need to have the crisp HD picture quality for something as insignificant as this photo... lmao.
---
I did this and there is no data when I go to add a route.
---
To each their own ;)
---
Thanks God
---
Yeah, I mean let's cut Blizzard a break here! It was only through pure luck and massive $300/month hosting fees that private servers *ever* came close to being more stable with higher player concentration.
---
I’m not the one to ask, but if you scroll through the comments here mixed in there are good piece of advice.  I didn’t get my mount until basically level 43.
---
I would hook up an external keyboard personally, I dont like using laptop keyboards one bit for gaming.
---
I raid and today I lost two rolls on sword and dagger from garr. One person got both of them.
---
So we agree with my original comment then? 
---
That the content of this video would not resonate with the classic wow fan base of this subreddit? 
---
Alright well nice chatting :)
---
i'm torn beteen playing shaman and warrior but leaning warr because shaman melee seems like it's just auto attack
---
If they learn it, it's not a ninja. Your pitiful argument could be applied to gear, too, maybe that will highlight how absurd it is.. "The only reason somebody would roll need on a gear upgrade is because they want money, if they wanted better gear they would have bought it off the AH."
---
If somebody can learn a crafting recipe it's fair game for them to roll need on it just as they would roll on gear. Who cares if it saved them 50 gold. Congrats to them, I say
---
Going in through purple entrance, picking flowers, killing celebras, tinker and rotgrip, that's about 60-70 gold/hour.
---
Imagine not understanding Blizzard has never defined what the population caps would be post layering, and people are stating caps are higher without layering than they were in vanilla with absolutely no factual basis.
---
I enjoy classic wow more than retail because it feels like a much more immersive experience to me. I don't mind waiting for people to run to a dungeon because running to a dungeon instead of teleporting there connects me more to the game world. If I do get teleported there, it's because a warlock summoned me, it has an in-universe explanation that I like. Even on my 50th run to blackrock mountain I still prefer it. I don't mind that classic wow has less things to do because I don't need classic wow to have endless content for it to be an enjoyable game. 
---
In the video he describes that classic has limited choices for leveling and explicitly labels them as 'bad' and near-pointless. In comparison retail is better because it provides more freedom. I don't agree with this. I would rather have a finite number of completable quests then have to do the exact same world quests every time. I would rather grind mobs in the open world and risk things like being corpse camped as well as things like valuable epic drops to sell then grind in the dungeon finder to level up. And while the stories are simple I prefer the more simplistic and serious tone of the vanilla quests to the more 'jokey' quests you do in the same areas since the cataclysm revamp. Driving a tank with rambo on the machine gun in redridge mountains is funny but things like that just destroy the immersion of the world for me.
---
Story, immersion, social cohesion (seeing the same people in the same world consistently) are things this guy seems to completely omit. I don't want classic because I'm 'delusional' and think it's a super hardcore perfect experience, I like classic because it's a world I can escape into with other people.
---
That’s awesome. A young server is probably the best time to take advantage of this.
---
You got a recipe?
---
How much gold were you gambling?
---
The walk is just so much more intimidating
---
I went through this too, she is not a gamer either so I figured I could introduce her to Donkey Kong Country 3. She had fun playing the game with me every now and then so after a month I felt like it was time to install WoW on her laptop! And after 15 mins she took to make her character..... she got overwhelmed and quit it :( rip
---
Its the same as rogue leveling.
---
I would think marksmen would just make it go faster.  You dont use your pet for anything other than making her stop to do the anti-melee cloud.
---
All bosses are killed at range, so marksmen makes it go faster.
---
So sad that this quest chain was ultimately unfinished.
---
You can click the time on the map and it opens up a timer and alarm
---
Where is the stupid game?
---
These people might actually be mentally challenged... and that's an insult to the mentally challenged.
---
Si
---
well, did u have many people fighting for it? because that matters, if u know the pvp community, u can easily just calculate it and rotate the GM ranks around like after x amount of HKS i would have to stop for the week because if i did more... it would make it harder for those above me ( contenders)
---
Calling a dungeon by its final boss is just outta left field.
---
Yeah, i guess so. Guess our respective points flew over our heads :D
---
Could you link your spec? :)
---
The nodes are on my map. It’s just in routes when I hit to make a route...I name it and chose my zone. Then that’s it there is no data underneath...gathermate2 doesn’t show up there.
---
Lol... True
---
What would he say that you couldn’ think yourself? Why let anyone else influence your option, especially when said person isn’t qualified in the field
---
Small indie company
---
I got my wife playing this time too so here are some tips. 
---
My tip to you is make sure she is well taken care of.
---
In game be ready to explain lots of stuff and not man splaining shit but in a calm cool guy way. She’s not a gamer so there will be a learning curve and if she’s gets over it before it starts that’s it. 
---
Out of game make sure she gets the better computer and monitor and chair.  My wife plays on my 28 inch curve with my gaming desktop while I play on my work laptop with a 22 inch monitor.  Now what she doesn’t know is that my boss hooked it up. I have 32 Gigs of 2666 ram, all solid state, i7 6 core with hyper threading and a 1050 4GB video card.  So it’s a sacrifice.
---
I don't even think I could play without my nostromo tbh
---
Play what you enjoy.  I mained a mage and alt’d a rogue, always had a blast on my rogue - kind of like a sinful dessert after work, but beyond amazing single-target DPS, their utility is at the bottom of the totem pole.  I used mine to mostly farm potions and flasks for our raiders.
---
If you have a supportive guild, you can get your rogue into plenty of content, but just about everyone has an alt rogue.  You’ll inevitably have gear competition, if it’s not a rogue, it’ll be a fury warrior, druid, hunter or even the tank himself looking for off-spec gear... but once you have your gear, that’s all done.
---
And conversely, Thelsamar in loch modan gives rested in the whole hamlet!
---
Anyone have a "maintenance day"? 
---
Like today I'm going after my unarmed and rotate between fishing/cooking/first aid...
---
Basically when I'm burnt out on grinding/questing I'll just take a time to watch TV while doing something non-intensive.  
---
It gets me back into the game...
---
And that's a valid point to make.
---
Multiboxing is stupid and destroys the spirit of the game. But Blizzard doesn't care because each account is giving them money and the bottom line is what matters most. 
---
Is it illegal? No. Is it stupid as fuck yes. Will bads defend it? yes
---
what is the progression order for raids currently in? Is it MC--&gt;Ony or Ony--&gt;MC?
---
There we go
---
In case you would like to - roll druid, you are way-semi rogue, full 5man (and raids) tank, full healer, third faction ingame.
---
PS: Leave rogue on 40lvl for STV/Tana on mount
---
T1 is not good for Resto because of the low bonus healing. When you're healing 100% of the time, bonus healing is all that matters. You just downrank for efficiency.
---
When you're healing maybe 25% of the time (like a Feral tank) the raw stats from T1 are more important than bonus healing because you can afford to cast max rank heals. The armor + stamina are on T1 is comparable to BiS tank gear and not much of a downgrade, allowing you to fill 2 roles with 1 set of gear.
---
Tiny bowler hat
---
Oh, then idk its probably worth a couple hundred gold or more.
---
Thanks man! wow under 1.3g / stack is pretty cheap thats nice! You will get there don't worry :)
---
I can see it now. You get burnt out. She becomes the ultimate neckbeard. Grey Russel T-shirt covered in Cheeto dust. You beg her to help with the kids. She refuses. Growls at you, even. You can smell her from two rooms away. She starts to resemble her Orc. You ask for a divorce. She tells you to mail the papers using in game mail. She whispers her new Tauren boyfriend that they can finally stop hiding. You become a single father. Your wife, well, she’s roaming Durotar with Chadcow now. 
---
You have been warned.
---
Nobody is paying thousands of gold for any item in the game at this stage lmao get out with that nonsense
---
Spoilers!!!
---
That mage after 2:50 that Ice blocks out of cc and blinks away just to run back into you, lol.
---
Looks like it’s just a short suspension, and not a ban.
---
And yeah, no gambling I guess 🤷‍♂️
---
fuck, im lvl 39 and got 2g to my name.... fml lol
---
ew wtf
---
I think the part that says they can’t disclose what they found is the most bogus thing ever... how are you not going to tell me what exactly was the reason why, yes I hosted a game with friends but for you to say you found something, why not say exactly what I said or did
---
Seriously. Imagine not knowing you can announce to barrens chat you're a girl to get free gold.
---
Right, a BoE is exactly that.
---
Reading through this and threads similar to it in the past couple days I've learned a lot. There seem to be two types of players. People who roll need on high value BoEs and people who are naive.
---
It’s hard to give recipes or directions on how to accurately and properly make edibles as it’s always a case by case basis. The base for edibles is typically cannabutter which is just melted butter using a double boiler and decarboxylated weed/trim ground up and soaked in the butter for a few hours but you can also use olive oil, coconut oil, etc depending on what you’re making.

Why the fuck are there so many pics of monitors taken with phones on this sub? How hard is it to hit print screen?
---
Yeah I dont understand the absurd amount of hate for Asmond. People make such outlandish and crude claims. They say they dont care but their tone of voice and anger says otherwise
---
This right here, case and point. People that farm it for profit are going to farm it constantly and people that want the pattern won't be able to get it. It may have even been another farmer that reported me to try and get rid of some of the competition. Like I said, I don't blame the person that reported me because it's frustrating as hell to have to pay 45g for a 2g pattern. It's a blind spot.
---
Same hoping to get 500 for it phase 2
---
Yes you can skip purchasing by finding, but attempting so is non-sensical as it *a* relies on rng and *b* takes much more effort, which come to think of it, also incurs an opportunity cost, so he's actually paying *more* by trying to find it than he would if he simply picked it up on the auction house.
---
&gt; You're comparing real world economics to a system where there's infinite potential value. 
---
There's only infinite potential value given infinite time and given infinite time.
---
&gt;It's absolutely retarded to do so.
---
Yet economists have been doing it for years.
---
PSA2: Sometimes you don't really have 2 minutes. Sometimes it's more like 1 minute and 20 seconds and the stupid thing will fail if you press it any later. Let me pass my learning experiences on to you.
---
Yeah 3 days xD there goes my weekend lol
---
It's not like a certain type of person plays Horde, while a certain type plays ally. Most players are dumb as rocks.
---
I can see Faerlina being weighted with more teens and the dumb fuck portion of millenials who want to be near "celebrities". But that's about it.
---
I never let it go below 45 seconds haha.
---
dont get it, someone explains pls
---
I know you just want to be flying, shimmering, SPLENDID!
---
This concerns me...I’m level 31 with only 16g. Not sure where 84g comes from in the next 9 levels 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Can you elaborate?
---
I've had some shams do off heal dps in dungeons Yeah, seems to work okay but later on for raids I would recommend switching to full resto if you want to heal :)
---
and there is a flying carpet..... sooooooooo.....
---
Farm bis because by the time everything drops for you you will be 60
---
I find it easier to just have a succ out and tank myself. the blue berry is only for when I plan sac it
---
Youre a rare spawn. How
---
Was it a wand? Because I looked on wowhead and it looks like there's no wands dropping that are higher than +20 healing atm.
---
The bomber guys can be pretty tough. Wiped there several times myself :D
---
Once the run even ended there, yeah.
---
So if he lost money here then is it really ninja'ing?
---
Ret hunter was literally their only comp in s7 and s8. And unless you were vanguards, might be a little tough to get some good teammates when even a bad death knight worked better than a fairly decent ret. Maybe you'd see ret warrior rdruid but on mal'ganis I can't remember any really high rated ones.
---
I think if your spec only has 1 comp that is just a subpar version of another comp, your spec is pretty much unviable which is exactly how ret was.
---
Considering a +33 healing wand is literally BiS FOR THE ENTIRE GAME...yes people will.
---
There is no wand that will replace it all the way through naxx, and people will pay into the thousands for an item like that.
---
Gold isnt that hard to make right now and there are many people already sitting on several thousands of gold after only a month of classic.
---
No, they just knocked layering down to 1 or 2 layers.
---
I'm selfish because I want all five people to have the opportunity to roll for something that offers them all equal value and you're magnanimous because you want to automatically get the item simply because you can equip it.
---
Makes sense.
---
because when you tell someone how they got banned they tell other people allowing them to avoid that activity which makes it harder for them to catch the next person breaking the TOS. That's why pretty much any game or company that hands out bans operates the same way.
---
No and when people kept bringing it up in his Twitch chat he said he would start banning them for talking about it
---
I said small pulls are generaly faster didn't I? ;)
---
i was thinking the same thing, ty!
---
Uninstalled WoW classic yesterday and have a big urge to install it again.  Lol.  Trying to break the addiction since it's hard to not play too much
---
You don't have to be 60 to be farming felwood, but most people also won't have 900g when they ding 60 whether or not they buy the first mount. My understanding was that the original post was about skipping the 60% mount to save money for the epic mount, which would be monumentally stupid.. if I misunderstood then my bad
---
That's a feature, not a bug
---
That macro was for Prot Paladins, who actually had a hard time getting uncrushable. Warriors are uncrushable completely naked with a shield on assuming they have 1 point in Imp Shield Block and 5 points in Deflection.
---
When you tank a raid boss, just make sure Shield Block is up for every single attack and you won't get crushed. Swing timers are 2.5 seconds and you have 2 charges of SB every 5 seconds.
---
Most people do have all their spells visible because it's easier to manage them that way, but it also takes up screen space that is technically unnecessary. When you see he has 12 buttons on his bars all of which have cooldowns, that's the first thing that comes to mind.
---
Even if you repost it more often: Its not funny imo\^\^
---
No changes
---
Oh I have no doubts, but what I'm saying is none of those actions are against the rules. You can play 36 hrs straight camping a rare spawn for all i care. Being more efficient than other people isnt against the rules. 
---
I would call customer service asap.
---
This is the true classic experience! lol
---
X
---
I'm not sure I follow..she couldn't learn the 3D movement?
---
I mean that doesn't say anything. 2300 when? 2300 in s8 puts you solidly in rival which is pretty terrible. But Im going to doubt you even played in wrath considering how uninformed your comment was. Your comment reads more like someone who has a general idea of how wrath arena was but didn't actually play it.
---
If he makes it that far, he's not going to find a lot of people willing to carry him through the 40-59 dungeons, sure hope he likes grinding mobs for all his XP

I'm glad you enjoy my lil drawing :D Thanks for the inspiration

At least as a human (I just refuse to be a little shit gnome) I can sometimes see that invisible rouge  incoming/licking me.

Yup, and he is my only lvl 60.....

Every guide states that devilsaur is go-to gear. Nowhere in the Internet it is explained why BDS set sucks ass.
---
You can’t summon inside instances. At all.
---
On our server with me no lifting it and at level 42 someone decided they would set the price at 2k. I laughed and asked him who had that kind of money. He responded that he’s sold 3 of them at that price already... I asked him to mount up for me and he didn’t have a mount at level 40.
---
No, you're right, when your bank account is empty at the end of the month the only possible explanation is that you've never gotten paid ever.
---
But okay, let me explain it to you since you seem to want an explanation.
---
If you steal a $10 bill from me and you go and spend those $10 on a BigMac meal, does the fact that you're no longer in possession of the particular bill you stole mean you never stole anything?
---
Pickpocket SM if you’re a Rogue
---
About 4 gold each on my server last time I checked. Farmed a few in Searing Gorge while levelling.
---
I've been doing grind days. Choosing humanoids 5 levels below me and just mindlessly killing them while catching up on TV etc.
---
Helped level up my professions without breaking the bank
---
You guys should try the gym or something together
---
Definitely worth saying. You have a hobby you love and are super passionate about, you're so excited to get your so into it with you and you end up forgetting that love and passion grew because you had to learn and adapt yourself and discover so much along to way. It's true for any hobby.

I would never buy a fucking Horse with glowing Eyes. I bough the white one in 2005 and after a Patch it had glowing Eyes and I hated it! [Just skipped them this time.](https://i.imgur.com/r1sWXeW.jpg)

Good luck with the laptops playing WoW.  Unless you dummy the settings, they run hot with it on.
---
Nice!

in the instance?
---
More along the lines of

'You cleared SM: Armory in 19:15!'
---
'Your current record is 18:55'

sort of output. But that does help. Appreciate it!

Who cares? Not everyone is minmaxing

I guess to answer that I would have to live in a world where I can just find a Mercedes out in the world that belongs to me if I beat 4 other people in a dice roll.

Kind of? Taxonomy never had to deal with undeath before but I'd argue that their physiology and behaviour are different enough to be something other than homo sapiens. Their bodies operate on different systems now. It would make taxonomy meaningless if you could have two vastly different things under one label
---
Yep. Plenty of videos online if you just do some searching
---
Based on OP's post history, Denmark
---
Lvl 49 arms warrior tank here, ran mara no problems with threat maybe an occasional taunt.  
---
 Berserker rage-&gt;battle stance-&gt; charge -&gt; autoattack-&gt;sweeping strikes-&gt;berserker stance-&gt;blood rage-&gt;whirlwind-&gt;defensive stance(equip sword and board macro)-&gt;tab revenge/sunders/demo shout. No huge threat problems, sometimes a taunt-&gt;revenge but at that point the mobs are already almost dead.
---
 Granted thats the arms rotation for 2h tanking w/ sword and board swaps. Not entirely sure about fury but without gear im certain hes going to continue to have threat problems on aoe pulls. Arms is just too good for aoe threat in dungeons with ss-&gt;ww combo right at the start of every pull. 
---
 Fury to be equal on threat would require good gear(crit/hit, adequate level to not be heavily penalized vs the dungeon mob level). Stack agility for crit+armor+dodge and stam to have a nice hp buffer.
---
 Essentially for fury tanking to be possible you have to deal good consistent damage which is hard if youre not proccing crits enough for flurry to generate more rage for more heroic strikes in defensive or sunders to keep the threat up.
---
 All in all fury tanking while leveling is possible but a challenge compared to arms tanking especially when it comes to holding aoe threat. Fury tanking also puts more pressure on healers if done properly to generate enough threat.
---
 Ive tried fury tanking myself and its just not as smooth as arms when it comes to aoe dungeon pulls. Doing mara at 48 can be rough too especially as a tank, that one level can make a huge difference tanking. Best of luck
---
I gotta reiterate some of the others. Don't push her. I had a hard time at first because I kept wanting to tell my wife she was doing things wrong. I do recommend getting her a few quality of life addons as vanilla wow was pretty barebone.
---
My girlfriend who I never expected to play WoW also recently agreed to play...now she's on several times a week with me! Good luck!
---
Not for spelladin
---
how many oni you think he thrusted to get that money?
---
hard to get Arena master trinket without exploring  STV
---
Yes you can.. you can summon people who are also inside the same instance as you to your location
---
A legend.
---
We even have a skill literally named "Enslave demon"
---
Right, maybe it was 4 MB. Mages and WL just seem to go oom in 1-2 pulls while the healer is always on 3/4 mana. In RFD lvl 31 priest was enough to heal RFD flawlessly with less than a stack of water.
---
Yes you can. If the person you are summoning is also in the dungeon you can summon them. Useful in long dungeons when someone has to run to ress and you can just summon them once they enter the dungeon.
---
the truth must hurt my dude
---
It's effectively a tailoring mage only boe drop. No group I have been in has been stingy with a boe that was going to be used. And this isn't just a
---
  boe, it can only be used by a very specific class/Prof combo. 
---
Every gear upgrade saves people money, and the item it replaces is sold for more gold. Using your logic everybody should roll need on everything because it generates money, but if you're rolling on things you don't need and won't use just for money than that's actually ninja looting. You're a very confused individual.
---
Also no one stole anything in this post. Rolling greed is for people who want to sell something. Rolling need is for people who want to use something. Passing is when you don't want it at all.
---
Because your brain is incapable of processing hypothetical situations?
---
I prefer to have the buttons showing for CD's, range indicators, and silence cooldown, but you can chalk that up to difference in preference.
---
There's no argument for cutting out all your buttons but leaving 5 bags and the system bar.
---
we had a webpage with information on who to play etc because we knew all the members wanted it and if someone played extra it would fuck up for everyone, back then it was also do this or get blacklisted u know... so just get with the program.
---
nice deflection..
---
U see these comments pretty often, how does that even happen
---
Thank you, I really appreciate that. Not entirely sure what I’m doing with the channel, or what even possessed me to make it in the first place, but I’ll probably post update videos in the future.
---
Spell buttons indicate range and give you a timer on silence.
---
Oh yeah definitely. It's super not understanding how there's any theft when no one wanted to roll need on this.
---
Us leveling paladins spend all our time rubbing two things together.
---
This was me and my hubby about 4 months before Legion launched. I had never played games before (he had played since vanilla) and I fell in love! Now we play every night together :) hope she falls in love with WoW just like I did!

Man I'm lvl 40 and feel like I'm stuck in fishing. I'm at 148 and every time I fish a spot in STVietnam my fish get away.
---
Any experienced rogues have a good talent list for sword/mace spec? I have looked at the Icy build and a few others, but i've heard bad things about Icy guides and was hoping to hear from someone experienced. I'm currently level 46 and have been running dagger build, but getting sick of solo'ing mobs and fighting to get backstabs in. Any help appreciated, thanks!
---
I'm a cheap bastard but you'd be surprised. Found a dozen stacks for 1.18g earlier today
---
That's so true. You really have to feel for poor Activision **®** Blizzard when it comes to all that work they do behind the curtain. How a couple drunk Russian neets made and hosted a similar project [that doesn't lock up with 10 seconds of input delay](https://streamable.com/t1d8e) shouldn't even be brought up.
---
Same here. I use a tool called ShareX. Snips it and auto uploads it to your imgur page(if you set it up), saves to clipboard and saves a copy in your my documents.
---
&gt; but if you're rolling on things you don't need and won't use just for money than that's actually ninja looting.
---
That's literally what the mage did.
---
Good luck lol

I was hoping for a depressed fat voidwalker sitting on the couch who hadn't shaven in a week watching tv with his kids running around him and wife screaming at him.
---
Had this guy in our UBRS run today who made a scene about leaving after ML was turned on, good thing that scrub did, we invited another DPS in 30 seconds, summoned him and killed the boss easily. The manchild's item dropped, but ofc he was already gone.
---
I've made this mistake in the past, I thought I was just explaining things in a way that would make the experience more enjoyable but in reality, I just came off condescending. Half of the fun of being new to games is being lost, honestly. That's where a good number of my happy memories with WoW came from, just not having a fucking clue what to do or where to go.
---
Phase 2 announced to come late 2019, how late do you think it will be?
---
What level can you begin doing this?
---
Boohoo, why are you crying about a hypothetical that wouldn't even affect you? Who cares if a game does have extra gender options? Don't like them, don't select them. It's almost as if you're all filled up with hatred rather than worried about the state of games.
---
You're welcome, cretin. ;)
---
As you wish: the math shows more dps for Disc. ;)
---
That sheet does not include the in-cast mana regeneration for Disc, the comparison is just to show how close they are together. Shadow is one, but definitely not the only option for dps.
---
I think that Olympus is a bit of a step above most guilds though. Most guilds with shitty guild masters who make everything about themselves aren't usually being led by a person who everyone in the guild worships.
---
I did the same thing with my gf and she loved it! I’m sure yours will too
---
Not if I am logging out after
---
The auctionhouse is literally a list of items that haven't sold.  Don't assume the price you see there is what it's worth.
---
Lol. You're clearly upset over this. Tell me why you don't like him.
---
I have yet to hear a valid reason as to why someone would not like asmon.
---
"Yea but you have to play alliance"
---
Ftfy
---
If the paladin had rolled need, would you have been okay with that?
---
Playing with artificial lag is never fun.
---
ONLY 67G?? I have 3 and I'm level 30!
---
You're STATING like its a FACT that there are more players who are 1-59 CURRENTLY ONLINE vs 60's. Meanwhile I'm speculating and using my 14 days /played time to back up my opinion. 
---
Get off your 3 reddit alts you goober
---
Let's just say leveling all the way to 60 and then terrorizing lowbies at Redridge Mountains and any 60's called to back them up makes it all worth it.
---
No. He gave the item away and paid everyone more than what the item was worth. So in the end he actually lost gold.
---
Do 24hr listing, problem solved, deposit is returned when the item sells, so being more expensive is irrelevant
---
Yeah I think I'll go with druid which is the least played and I'll be able to heal also.
---
The backpedaling was my indicator.
---
I look forward to tea bagging your wife's corpse.
---
&lt;3
---
Helped a paladin do Chasing A Me in ungoro earlier. Bless his little cotton socks.
---
It’s perfectly normal not to be able to afford your mount at 40. Once you pass 40 your income grows even more and you’ll have it within the next few levels if you save. That said, if your goal was to have your mount at 40 you needed to have that mindset back at 20.
---
Neat
---
it's so stupid it's genius.
---
like getting 2 birds stoned at once.
---
the recipe is from gnomeregan afaik, idk, I got it from someone else.
---
You are a lucky man or woman
---
Most? Org or Scarlet Monastery. I've been dungeon leveling :(
---
How dumb are you people? You don’t realize this is all an act? You don’t think his ‘overinflated’ ego is part of the joke and the ‘personality’? Jesus christ I legit pity some of you guys because you seem to me like the type of people who also donate to e-girls since you can’t tell the difference between fact and fiction
---
Sounds like you want to play vanilla. The problem is you're more than a decade too late.
---
I mean I wouldn’t do it without Vanish at least
---
Idk how early people do it
---
I have succeeded in this task, unfortunately we started playing retail since the accounts were free and now she doesn't want to start over in classic.
---
I regret trying to rush my wife to level.  It turned her off the game completely.  I should have let her do her flower picking and Alchemy.  
---
Hooves crossed that we get a Classic BC.  When I asked her what she was going to play in Classic she responded with “blood elf hunter”.  To which I responded you know that wasn’t available devil woman.  
---
Anyway have fun.
---
Amazing work, could you make one themed around level 19 twinks at one point? That would be a funny thing to look at.
---
&gt;dunno. but if its gay thats the only way I know of.
---
Turns out speech exists whether your aware of it or not.
---
How’d you do it?
---
Probably not and youd have to get them in range of the loot anyway
---
Or you just made a alt and gave it 100g
---
Stating “the end” after stating an opinion as fact does not actually make it fact.
---
Giving up some random crap I wouldn't even have a shot at without a tank in the first place in exchange for a smooth run and a chance at my pre-raid BiS? You'd be on my speed dial =D. 
---
Also, coming at this from a newbie warrior perspective, learning how to pull a dungeon by watching a more experienced tank is worth all the loots in the world. Wish you were on my server.
---
Its good if your wearing int gear. OP is clearly prot or ret and shouldnt have Int gear.
---
My 46 ret has 61 int. Was basing off that.
---
The extra 4% str if he moved those talents into str would be (based off my gear) bonus 12 str or 24 attack power. Much much better for ret or prot pally than measly 30 mana
---
When you've got 20 dust and it came from 8 greens, you're carrying 8 greens in one slot, that's saving slots not losing them.
---
nah, you're butthurt. Whats the different between spending an insane amount of time and gold to make a great 60 pvp character and making a great 19 pvp character? I do this to have fun. You look at fun with negativity, for no reason, since im doing nothing to you, therefore you've got a problem.
---
Burning steps
---
Herbalism/skinning be like that
---
You are using some major mental gymnastics to make that point.
---
Most so far was probably aahenvale. Least is duskwood (I HATE Duskwood).
---
Fake
---
Got my main at 60 with epic mount and plenty of extra gold so i just buy a round of greens to my alts every 5 levels or so to make the leveling as bearable as possible
---
Generally comes down to cool down usage, on the fly gear adjustments and having better gear.
---
The census showed it’s a little more alli sided like 55/45. I have a 53 night elf warrior and it’s been back and forth a lot more alli in the morning than at night.
---
Nah
---
https://i.imgur.com/EbQLfOL.png
---
But you also assumed 300 spell dmg for both. But bis for shadow dmg gear is closer to 400 while bis for spell damage gear is only 350. This whole thing is just a mess of assumptions all boiling down to you saying that shadow is too complicated and casting smite is easier.
---
You also focused on disc scaling better and and the transition to healing being easier cause of holy talents that you wouldnt have till after 40. But then when we pointed out that max level dps is pointless you said this was for leveling. None of this makes sense.
---
If you wanted to say Smite spec is fine and you dont have to be shadow you could have just said that. Instead that title says shadow sucks. Which is wrong
---
I use character notes it works on classic it's been nice
---
One of them increases strength from gear, the other intellect
---
who says they couldnt win an even matchup? there isa huge disparity over a fresh 60 vs a decked out 60. Is playing the gear treadmill something people only do cuz they cant win an even match up?
---
what is an even matchup? you cant win because you cant afford to twink? sounds like the matchup was even and you failed at making gold.
---
The way you are talking I can tell you are horde. Let me guess, you're part of the "alternative" crowd.
---
Yessss! As a girlfriend playing for the first time I spend a lot of time fishing, way too much time of my other professions, and complete random quests just because they're listed in my log book :). 
---
Sometimes I'm annoyed that I'm so far behind (level-wise) and can't do the content my boyfriend is doing. But that forces me to whisper new people and respond to LFG posts - the true classic experience! 
---
Once I'm 60 we'll both be 60 forever and have so much content to do :). I'm so glad and thankful he lets me go at my own pace, and encourages the silly side missions I do 'just because' - I probably would have quit if I felt I was playing catch up and never good enough.
---
I did this for someone on lights hope and I'm so glad to see it done in classic! Always pay it forward brother! Grats btw.
---
This is a really dumb comment
---
As someone who's partner introduced her to this amazing game. Some advice, only offer help when asked and allow her to put herself on follow so she doesn't get annoyed at running everywhere!
---
Best of luck hopefully you will have a pocketheals in no time xo
---
Viper sting till he's either oom from it or from spamming dispells and shields.
---
If it's a shadow priest with decent gear,  send pet in, play just outside his range and run back in to get Viper stings and/or a quick auto + multi shot. Once he's oom it's an easy kill.
---
Doing the same thing! We're having a ton of fun together. I picked a healer so she can be the focal point and I can get her out of some tight jams. My whole goal when playing is that she never dies. It's nice though when she needs someone to advocate for her when people are not following social contract.
---
It depends on the level of the mob. Mobs of x level drop items close to x level. I got my staff of Jordan from badlands rock elementals. I’ve seen others post about getting theirs from the cats there also. Seems like a good zone to start
---
It's matters the same as if they equip the boe gear they roll on. If they learn it they can't sell it, so you know they can/will use it. If they roll need just to sell, that's what the greed button is for. Unless the group agrees otherwise that everyone should roll need. I always ask before I roll.
---
They didn't take gold from you. They didn't take gold from anyone. When you run dungeons sometimes you get the things you need. It's why people do it. Yeah it saves them money and that's great, congrats to them. If you can't use it, they didn't take anything from you.
---
So glad I haven't ran into any crybabies like you on the horde.
---
Oh snap, now ill ask how tf u managed that?
---
Trimming armor no scam real 1 trade
---
Hmm taking advice from someone that failed at the task.
---
I just played the auction house for a while. I don't have a lot of time lately to get really invested in grinding, so I've found it better log in, run a scan of the auction house, and make some gold.
---
This is a really stupid comment
---
FUCK ULDAMAN
---
Wow! Gold and silver. Thanks for the support! Kids in bed soon and the adventure begins! I’m curious which race and class she picks. 🙂
---
Soloing SM Graveyards chests and bosses + pick pocketing should give you close to 10g/hour

My spouse had a similar issue with a console game he tried. What few games he had played were all side scrolling type, so 2D. He couldn't navigate well in a 3D environment, where you could control the character and the camera independently. So, he often had the camera facing one direction, while he was moving in another, resulting in confusion about the movement/orientation of the character.
---
WoW at least the camera readjusts itself when you start to move, but I'm guessing his wife still had similar problems.
---
Wife: WHY DO YOU CALL
---
Warriors dont usually care. They just want their whirlwind axe
---
Wasnt your whole point that people rolling for monetary gain are ninjas? By that logic, since a trailering pally doesn't make sense and the item this makes is BoP and can't be used by pallies then yeah I have to agree with you on this. Since he can't utilize it then it would be ninja'ing. Same way if I was a hunter and rolled need on plate gear to vendor it would make me a ninja.
---
this is like the 5th time this was posted in the last hour. still not funny.
---
It's sad you think we need the player base to shrink when they should just have us living in a complete yet imperfect world.
---
It's even better if he doesn't have any sort of face, like the in-game model
---
Just this blank TV stare with the internal suffering at the world around him
---
I wish that my friend that got me into the game did that. That 300% XP made me breeze right through the game. I was made fun of for not knowing I could summon as a warlock... and I didn’t know that because my friend basically had me /follow him the whole damn way to lv40. I’m really enjoying Classic now, it’s the experience I missed out on. I’m playing a hunter this time so I have stuff to learn and at lv16 (taking it slow) I’m really enjoying myself
---
Nice.
---
Touching the AH at any point before 40 other than for a couple of key quest turnins that cost &lt;20s is why people hit 40 without mount gold. I grinded 0% outside of questing on my character and had mount gold.
---
Considering 8% for a mob 3 lvls above you i.e. raid boss then I would assume pvp hit chance against a player at your level would be 5% for yellow damage and 15% for dual wield white hits.
---
comparing nostalrius private server with active live server lmao ok
---
Just think, he's 26 now lol
---
Well you can get a bright bauble to add some much needed lvls.. as soon as I hit 35 I went and completed the artisan quest for fishing so I was already 225 going into stv. I took time off from the grind to enjoy myself in the world every night for about an hour or so before I logged off just so I would be able to use fishing to buy my mount since the items you get in those mithril and iron boxes are what you’re after for gold pulled straight out of the game
---
It's literally a great mage item. Post a screenshot of their AH listing and I'll agree that it's a ninja
---
Sad to see the guy who doesn’t understand threat and starts yelling at the tank for being bad. Isn’t in here haha
---
Can someone help me understand why game do this?
---
He thought, as he plotted potential defenses for his ruthless karma whoring conspiracy.
---
Ah, another rogue assuming he’s popular again.
---
just trying to get the title right. please stop being a lil biotch
---
The icyveins talents for leveling are fine. Just get some swords and you’ll be good. You’re close to thrash blade from maradon which you will most likely use until you get an upgrade from Ony.
---
Wow. This video is literally in my clipboard right now. I was going to strongly suggest OP watch this. Wow is a really high bar for a first major game as an adult.
---
You're playing a videogame not producing any form of value, you're already wasting time.
---
Fingers crossed for you man. It's great if you can find it!
---
Agreed. I went from 20g on my hunter around 32 to 80g at 40
---
&gt;Scrub lock here too... maybe for suffering? That’s the only thing he has that targets multiple mobs.
---
Exactly this, for 5+ mobs
---
I like how you not only admitted you were speculating but then used a total non sequitur to “back it up”.
---
Jesus get fraps or anything. At least take a screenshot and stop this noob phone crap.
---
"hoj and savage reserved" is just as easy and not much different than "LFM Bear, Caster DPS (that doesnt have a melee offspec that will roll on HoJ and Savage") "
---
Lol rip been playing smooth all day
---
&gt; It's matters the same as if they equip the boe gear they roll on. If they learn it they can't sell it
---
So ninjaing is okay as long as you don't sell the stuff on ah, got it.
---
&gt; They didn't take gold from you.
---
True. 
---
&gt; They didn't take gold from anyone.
---
This is just objectively not true.
---
&gt;  Yeah it saves them money and that's great, congrats to them.
---
Agreed
---
&gt;  If you can't use it, they didn't take anything from you.
---
Again, true, they didn't take anything from *me* in this instance, but they did take something from their group members.
---
&gt; So glad I haven't ran into any crybabies like you on the horde.
---
Maybe that's because it's filled with children who does nothing but call other people names and have yet to gain and understanding of basic economics.
---
Ghostbusters?
---
Agree, today i die several time out of uldaman during solo questing, and with 10-12 soul shard i can manage summon, healthstone and soulstone easily after death
---
Grobbulus represent!
---
Wow is unfortunately not newb friendly. The general camera movement system borrowing the mouse thats use for the UI is a very difficult concept for non-gamers to grasp. Good luck. I hope she loves it :-)
---
Yes
---
Literally nothing you've said has provided any use but lowering the probability of future posts being actual screenshots and not phone pictures. Useless, in other words. Destructive, to be precise.
---
My wife started at launch and I pretty much just downloaded questie (waited until level 10 so she got the full effect) and she took off.  She pretty much went against everything I told her in terms of class and leveling experience.  She’s now a level 42 Ret paladin and is absolutely addicted despite ghost running back to her body half the time she’s online.  Never gets mad and never asks for help or gold from me even when I insist.  She’ll “find a group her level” fine you do you girl ily
---
My wife is leveling but losing patience with STV to get to 40 best not being alliance on a PvP server where it's only 20% alliance is brutal. But I'm alliance (horde at heart but all my mates went alliance) tho I'm 60 now so time to boost her I think.
---
Detect invis is always appreciated right outside of instances where there’s a lot of pvp.
---
Tell that to the level 48 warrior that killed my ass 4 times in a row in stv before teabagging and spamming emotes along with orcish translated to "lmao" and "go back to retail" 
---
Yes I am salty ;_;
---
Server-cap was the maximum amount of players allowed on a server at all, period, before queues started. They artifically raised this while layers were around because layers made it easy to get around this while they decided if more servers were needed. 
---
There are indeed many more players per server than even the most populated servers in 2005. They said this before release, they said this after release. To deny they said this like you have is just silly.
---
Yea I just turned it in last night. No fuckin thank you
---
I made a priest then decided for a rogue alt.  Never played rogue before, currently lvl 19 and not super sure if it's the class for me. I'm going to do some more dungeons though and see how it goes. Crazy how much more gear dependant rogue feels compared to priest (or I guess casters in general which I usually play
---
Not expert but the first one looks good
---
That's awesome!
---
Gnome tho, I'ma have to turn you into a sheep and pet you if we cross paths..
---
Does anyone else pick stuff based on roleplay story at a possible detriment to being the best? I feel like that's kinda the point but everyone is running the same builds/spec and professions.
---
U wot
---
&gt; then yeah I have to agree with you on this.
---
and THAT is why the other people didn't roll need on it.
---
See. 
---
This guy has high IQ. 
---
He tests WoW on a laptop BEFORE he buys it. Not after.
---
You neatly summed up the results of this video: https://youtu.be/ax7f3JZJHSw
---
I’m rooting for you. I messed up my chance to get my wife into wow. It was all my fault. Help her in every way you can. Hopefully she’ll love it.
---
If i stole your food and eat it, it wouldn't be stealing since I'm not selling it?
---
Glad you understand how loot works now.
---
If the deposit &gt; vendor price I never put something on the AH unless it’s something I know will move.
---
Can confirm. I helped my wife create a nelf druid and I created a nelf war to level with her. (Just a few months before BC)
---
We took it slow, letting her explore teldrassil w me just following her around making sure she wasn't getting over her head. Or getting lost.
---
Got to around level 10 the first night, then we went to bed.
---
She was 20 when I got home from work. Safe to say she was hooked.
---
Hell, I haven't played since cata until classic and she's been playing the whole time. Lol.
---
Yeah, that’s my daughter. She’s 4 now, and we have a 1 year old son as well. And thanks!
---
Without battlegrounds it's going to be hard to stay interested. I'll be doing a lot of world PvP once P2 comes out but that doesn't quite hold my interest like BGs.
---
I remember my cousin and uncle always resetting the instance just to get the hot poker
---
Women like big wardrobes
---
Your video will still be shitty no matter what title you give it. Hold that downvote.
---
I personally dont have that many; one is my best friend of 20+ years so it's a given, and the others are friends I made during wotlk raiding. Sadly a lot of those people are playing on EU servers now (they were oceanic during retail).
---
Just a matter of finding people who don't annoy you too much ;)
---
Should we tell him?
---
I've understood this the entire time, the issue has been trying to get you to explain why a mage needing purely for monetary gain is acceptable, when according to you, the paladin needing purely for monetary gain would be ninja looting.
---
Please stop linking this absolute garbage, thanks!
---
The worst part about playing with someone who is more experienced than you in an MMORPG is that they try to dictate on what class would be suit their needs and not yours. 
---
Follow what these people are saying. 
---
Let her pick her own class and find her way. Answer questions when she asks them.
---
Also, don’t bombard her with addons first thing. 
---
Let her play Classic the way it was meant to be played.
---
327 hours. 
---
The word “days” is deceptive because when we think of day we assume 8-10 hours, the rest being to sleep. 
---
327 hours has a WHOLE different feeling to it.
---
Not happiness, compulsion.
---
Sorry about your dog, that sucks :(
---
This guy gets it
---
Maybe think of the title before pressing submit?
---
Mind = blown right?
---
Please stop being an absolute bitch, thanks ya jack off
---
Blizzard doesn't even respond to this type of question, because its been asked so many times. The answer is yes, it should be allowed, yes its allowed, no they aren't going to change, and blizzard has told people to stop asking.
---
Great video, but the post should be titled “Asmongold Reacts to Getting Destroyed in WPvP”
---
He didn't gain any money. His gold count did not increase unless he sold this, which you have provided zero proof for having happened.
---
There's no right or wrong here. There is, however, being a negative cockhole for no reason.
---
Hmm it's almost like some people learn from their mistakes
---
It's a little annoying, but the 27-34 level range you've got to jump between thousand needles and hillsbrad foothills and ashenvale
---
I always forget this. It's good to have a reminder
---
Agreed. But we have our priorities straight! Would be like 10 hours max per week. Of WoW. Lol.
---
Talking about horde privilege.
---
3-4g on my server
---
Explain. The argument is that BOEs should all be needed on because they can be sold. BOPs can be sold so they should be needed as well using the same logic. You're argument against that is that you can't buy BOPs on the AH, but you can buy groups to run you through to pick up BOPs so I don't see the point to your argument.
---
You can focus in shadow and still heal dungeons into the 50s. 1st respec is only 1g so you can stay shadow if you want and then switch to holy for late game.
---
But it’s happened correct? Well bank alt method gives you more freedom to log when you want, no tricks needed, and you can log back in whenever you want. It’s objectively a superior method and I’m done with this ridiculous discussion.
---
I'm totally new to WoW Classic, and I don't keep up with exactly everything, so if I'm wrong then I apologize.  
---
However, I'd like to imagine that the reason that the servers are the way that they are is because they're using phase 1 to determine if it's profitable to invest into Classic and its servers. Optimistically speaking I believe phase 2 would be a lot better than what we currently have now... but who knows.
---
You should start posting asmon vids. That will get you all the likes
---
cookies cove is the real third position
---
More rage for more damage.
---
That's what you get for using a dwarf name as a tauren
---
It's all water under the fridge at this point
---
Nah, I just don't like ninjas.
---
Aoe at 22 is not that great. It really gets a lot better and easier at 30 ish.
---
At 26 you get coc which helps a lot!
---
It’s better, but it seems you aren’t sure what a recipe is.  It’s like you say: 2 eggs, a cup of flour, a cup of oatmeal,  half cup raisins, and here is the important part: an ounce of pot.  See, the problem with people who haven’t made edibles is that they don’t know how much pot to put in so they ask people.  But then people refuse to answer the question and just make vague, unhelpful statements.  So then you just keep going back and forth until one of you gives up.

look at my last post yesterday with 1.5k upvotes you fucking asshole. why are there so many people like you on reddit, that are just so unbelievably rude for no fucking reason. get off my dick
---
and you playing as Horde, right. Good luck \^\^
---
hmm but this is a different person since the "dad" left the guild
---
DM launched 3.5 months after the original 04 launch.
---
I'm guessing they'll match or beat that timeline making phase 2 drop at the latest early December, but more likely early November since they've stated the biggest hurdle for phase 2 is removing layering.
---
No, it really doesnt happen, so I'm going tp keep using it and you can use yours.  Nobody gives a shit which method you prefer, sorry.
---
You don't need to switch weapons during combat at all, unless you need to tank unexpectedly for some reason and throw on a shield and 1H. If you are tanking from the get go you'll be in 1H shield the whole time and if you're dpsing or soloing you'll be using 2H or DW the whole time.
---
Nice, i'll use there talent guide then. Is it okay to use maces too tho? I have a really good mace atm.
---
It mostly applies to FPS games, a lot of people have difficulty with looking around and navigating a 3D space
---
Pickpocket add ups nicely
---
yeah almost entirely
---
First of all there is loads of PvP going on at level 60. Second who the hell at level 50 is going to respond to a duel request in trade? Just keep leveling then pvp at Blackrock mountain and duel level 60s. Pretty simple.
---
Yeah default wow controls (especially the a/d being camera turns) are designed for newbies
---
You can also stand in one spot at the base of the stairs. But that's not as much fun.
---
Yeah we do have a switch and when we game together we play Dr. Mario she likes that game and it's fun.
---
But wisp form is BiS racial while leveling a Warrior
---
youve posted the same thing multiple times, multiple times from looking at your post history. post it once and move on.
---
In my old guild during legion we used to /roll 1-X (chosen by players, commonly 1000 or 5000) and the lowest roller had to pay the highest roller the difference. So if low player rolls 20, high player rolls 5000, low player pays high player 4980g. Even had an add on that called out who needed to roll and calculated the payments automatically and everything. Fortunes were made and lost during raids....
---
My reaction to the Aladdin bit:https://youtu.be/fcbazH6aE2g
---
I would say the best way to set them up for success would be to set up key bindings on the action bars and movement keys “ A and D” to strafe left and right. 
---
Other than that, let her explore and adore just like we  did!
---
Should have sent us into a proper Uldum or whatever. But alas. Never to be. Replaced with...whatever the hell we got in Cata.
---
Seriously my reaction
---
"Tf is he talking about?"
---
"You think he means undead?"
---
"No cant be thats the dumbest way ive seen of shortening it, i must not know this term"
---
"....."
---
"Nevermind hes just an idiot"
---
Not at all :)
---
Seems to be a pretty rude thing to do to someone. If someone kills something and they can skin it, they should be the one skinning it.
---
By 30 warlocks in dungeons with a succubus our will output a lot of dps. For single target only rogues should beat you. And for 3 ish targets you are like the top dog. 
---
More than 3 though, mages start getting very good.
---
I thought this as well but going through it again isn’t nearly as bad as I remember it being. Kinda enjoyed it.
---
I underestimated how quick triple mage was until I got into a normal group. Not massively different but a big change of pace.
---
Chad walk
---
That’s the whole thing I’m trying to tell you. It varies how much pot you put in. Cannabutter is typically made with around 7-10g of weed but that doesn’t really mean anything because you could still either get super fucked or not feel anything. Homemade edibles are almost impossible to dose. How dense are you dude?
---
Yes!! It actually fixed it thanks
---
Did she hate it? WoW is casual by mmos, but still pretty hardcore compared to something like Mario Kart.
---
I imagine a holy joe is probably pretty popular for raids, with all the healing potential. Still, i really enjoy how my priest feels atm, i feel pretty powerful- more than i ever have with mages. Are there any dam perks in the later holy tree?
---
None of this is correct and you aren't reinventing a 15 year old game that has been theory crafted to death. Your math is full of way too many assumptions and you are mixing arguments about max level, dungeons, soloing, questing to justify damage that is purely speculative. 
---
If you want to cast one spell and have faster heals then you do you. You aren't going to convince anyone that smite spec is better than shadow with this garbage excell math. Your logic hear is seriously flawed. You cant start off by saying that this has nothing to do with max level then assume random bis gear and stats with max rank spells. Then immediately claim this is actually for leveling. Then claim it's actually for dungeon running so you can switch to healing. Then claim is actually better over all and shadow is never good except dumb pvp. 
---
Healing dungeons up to level 60 is perfectly fine and easy as shadow spec. No one is running dungeons as a spriest pre 60 and worrying about 5 dps differences. Obviously spriest is for pvp and soloing. And since level 60 is only for holy spec none if this matters at all. 
---
You are basically saying that with the best possible spell damage gear and extremely complicated dungeon fights that last about a minute a smite spec priest will do 5 dps more than a shadow priest. This is the most pointless post about shadow priest ever. And all of this according to you equals "shadow sucks". 
---
After 40 shadow is more efficient hands down. You take less damage and deal more damage and mana effencieny is fine.
---
Spoiler: T1 Chest is BiS 😂
---
My wife doesn't understand what to do in open world games, it's an option overload thing I think. Good luck!
---
Level and heal dungeons as shadow, respec at end-game.
---
Shadow is a garbage DPS spec. Priest is all-round the designated healer class.  But the extra damage that points in Shadow gives you will make levelling less grueling.
---
Goals. Goodluck m8
---
I’m a horde on the Benediction server there is slightly less of us but you can’t even notice really. It’s high population at peak hours and I’ve never been stuck in a queue. Level 59 there now and I have zero complaints about the server
---
I thought you were talking about a character you keep in the drunken in-game state where everything is blurry, you can't run straight, and you see things as a lower level. That sounds more fun than what this thread is actually about.
---
World drops are things you "can't intentionally farm". They have an insanely low drop chance from a huge range of mobs.
---
That said: https://classicdb.ch/?item=873
---
That database site is great for questions like yours. I highly suggest you indulge while choosing a goal for yourself.
---
My atlas loot doesnt show drop rates. Is there a check box or something I'm missing?
---
I think it's because they did it without notifying the people who were earning a living from the game in advance at all. No indication, they just dumped it on them when the general announcement went out. I don't think anyone is suggesting Blizzard should have supported a loss making endeavour, just that the way they handled things could have been better. I think that weird Redditor logic you're talking about is empathy, man.
---
Oh I have the occasional drops in main cities and some more demanding areas but it is locked 90% of the time and even when it drops it’s not lower than 100 as you say. Mine was dropping to 60s it ended up being the addons.
---
Getting Tactical Mastery is huge for tanking if you plan on doing dungeons and personally I would respec in your situation.
---
That sounds like a pretty good plan tbh. Stay deadly for now, go holy later. I can work that into the roleplay too, redemption arc kinda thing :)
---
Edited
---
The trolls got kicked off their island by a level 10 troll and don't even reclaim it, I solod zalazane as a level 7 shaman.
---
Also if they go PVP pick the right continent for the faction on the server. 
---
I started in Kalimdor as Alliance. That was really tough and majorly slowed down leveling and I'm not new to WoW or to gaming in general. OP should not give his lady that experience right out the gate
---
Really though this is very very good advice on your part. People who aren't as good as you don't respond well to backseat gaming. You gotta let people learn and you gotta save your amazing tips for when they ask for them.
---
Time so sell your shoes
---
Yeah mainly cause you can pound some enemy faction then zone in if you get too many enemies
---
This will get lost, but if there is any chance that you two are playing Alliance on Rattlegore server, I’d like to give her a Siamese Cat companion pet and say “welcome”
---
For this reason, I usually recommend new players get to level 10 on their own, or to the first zone outside of their starting zone. For most Horde, this would be the Barrens. This way, they can get a feel for it all on their own for a few hours before they’re ready to group with you without feeling like they’re severely dragging you down.
---
Sit near them so they can ask you for help or you can answer questions, but backseat gaming for them when you’re both questing together is VERY annoying. Sit near them, but do something else like watch TV or browse Reddit. Let them experience the game and get used to it for the first few levels at their own pace. Grouping with an experienced player at level 1 is exhausting, even when you try your hardest to make sure it’s not.
---
Are you on Alliance? They were about 10% that price when I sold mine on Horde I think.
---
Yeah i think this is the way to go. Shadow priests are no use to anyone in the endgame, i suspect. Cheers :)
---
Save your money. You’re going to end up replacing it in a couple levels anyways. Go with the free option.
---
She is now.
---
How dense are you?  You still can’t give a straight answer.  You’ve at least managed to say one side of the equation; 7-10 grams but you couldn’t manage the other side where you say how much butter that goes into.  
---
Recipes involve mixing two or more ingredients together in specific proportions.  You’ll get there, I believe in you.
---
Neither spec has a huge advantage over the other, arms is just easier to tank with because of tactical mastery.
---
It's a bit of a give and take though. I try to find good deals on gear about every 5 levels or so, if there's a serious improvement to be had for &lt;2g. 
---
Higher stats, kill faster, quest faster, level faster, make more gold faster. 
---
Ofc I'm a druid so I already have +40% movement speed and almost zero downtime.
---
That's probably a fair assessment of Shaman melee abilities. You only really get Stormstrike as a 'melee' ability as the bottom talent in the Enhancement tree. But you do have plenty of other abilities to use and manage. They're just not melee abilities.
---
On the other hand, my experience with warrior at low level has been that although you get these abilities it's hard to use them because you're perpetually rage starved. At low level, it does get better at higher levels.
---
Pretty sure this isn't related. It's more like the hunter = pets, which is awesome. and then not knowing better = always need.
---
Spell batching wasn't noticable when people had 150ms. In fact it was a benefactor with such high ping. But nowadays people play with 10ms, and spell batching no longer has a place in modern gaming.
---
They should've kept spell batching but cut the window timeframe in half so the game doesn't feel so damn laggy. This is what private servers did and it works amazing. Private servers did a lot of things right.

This was actually it by the way thanks

The early points in fury help more but I would definitely respec when you start to do dungeons.
---
Personally I rotate:

Charge&gt;MS&gt;StanceDance Into Zerker Rage&gt;WW&gt;MS&gt;Execute 
---
Sprinkle in Bloodrage and Hamstring if you need them, Obviously keep Battle Shout up
---
And make a Macro to Stancedance your Overpowers:

/Cast Battle Stance
---
/Cast Overpower

I would love to try to get my wife into it but the first time she had to run across the Barrens or something I think she would be done...  Ok maybe not the first but the twentieth
---
Plate DPS has plate. They will get hit, a lot. Which is good.
---
A tank tanking a dungeon is there solely for looks. And getting hit by bosses.
---
Tank needs to have Very fluent control over all three stance. Charge in, clap, def stance for reveng taunt and conc blow, zerk stance to get to the elite the dps pulled, def stance to taunt it off.
---
This is just one normal 10sec pull.
---
Tank is there to make sure everyone feels nice and mushy. And to make sure healer is not dead. DPS will learn not to get ressed.
---
I prefer to fight over the chains personally. Makes it more risky.

Its not morally wrong to stop doing something that isn’t profitable.  It is, however, wrong to basically give 0 notice that you are essentially terminating the jobs of dozens of people, especially when those people did nothing wrong and were performing their job adequately.  Those pro gamers found out via the same social media everyone else read it from that they basically just lost their job.
---
Imagine if you went to work one day, and even though everyone was talking about how great everything was the day before, you just... didn’t have a job anymore.  There is a right way to do things and a wrong way to do them.  Had those gamers been given proper notice, they could have switched what games they were playing in the off season or looked for traditional jobs.  Instead, they spent the entire offseason practicing for a game that they expected to pay for their food and rent once the season started.  Instead, just before the start of the season, there was no season.
---
But yeah, no, I just have weird logic.
---
I'm so, so sorry.
---
yeah this x100. this doesn't just go for a wife, but getting any friend into any game. Let them have the experience of exploring the game like you first did. It will probably be a while before they're able to play at your pace
---
imo have your own alt you level with her. Let her level her alt quicker than you level yours
---
That's a bizarre thing to say, considering the opposition couldn't prove anything other than the fact that they're rapists and pedos.

When I did the quest, there was a level 50 something trying to trade 1 emblem for 1 elemental fire. I just trolled him telling him I kept getting elemental fire and couldn't get my emblems, and kept refusing to trade as he begged to 1 for 1 with them. Good times.
---
Yeah but even then, you probably aren't sitting there for hours. You get some juicy kills while you wait, then you leave and zone in. No potential for corpse camping or counter griefing.
---
Much easier to get than the felcloth. Was farming it last night
---
Completely agree. I've had the group leader announce they want to use ML in UBRS when everyone arrives at the dungeon and not mention it before, and said I didn't agree with that decision and would be leaving. Usually results in the leader quickly changing their mind and begging me to stay since I play tank. ML in pugs should only be used in raids.
---
There's an addon that completes and accepts quests you walk by idk its name but it exists for classic
---
1 Elemental fire has the value of 50 charms on my server (charms go for vendor price)
---
You should get more comfortable seats if you want her to keep playing 😉
---
Fairbanks has turned out to be a great server so far. Sorry to hear about your dog
---
Ok like I said, good luck finding a buyer who wants to spend that much on a few extra points of healing this early into classic lol.

It was once possible to set your hearthstone to arbitrary locations by having a friend on the other faction kite an innkeeper to wherever you wanted to hearth. I remember seeing a forum thread that one guy posted where he had set his hearth to Blackrock Mountain is this way — his Alliance buddy kited the Kargath innkeeper out there.

How much did it cost just to buy all the rune cloth to reach exalted?

This is Correct. Anyone who says otherwise is a cute lil retail babby.

You literally have no idea what I do mate. Couldnt be bothered doing dungeons before raid for minimal upgrades so I spent actual hours there pvping and helping people open UBRS.
---
Probably the free one. In three levels you can get the thrash blade from a mara quest.

I saw a guy with a similar post searching for a tank for at least over an hour. Then judging by the LFG messages his party members started leaving before they got a tank, seems a bit counterproductive for some greed.

Did you guys mean to say essence of fire?? Because elemental fires are like 50s a pop on my server

Started as a rogue because that was my first character ever.  Sticking with it because it's tons of fun!  You can pick pocket farm stuff and give the profits to lowbies, gank people for the fuck of it.  Just have fun with it dude.  Don't worry about end game stuff.  If you want that kinda stress, there's always retail and mythic+.

What makes eng so good for warriors? Force reactive disk or is there more?
---
If I remember correctly, you wait after their attack, move in one step and hit.
---
If you're on a pvp server, shadow without a doubt(Spriests are some of the best 1 v 1/ world pvp class/spec, so most people will go out of their way to avoid pissing you off). If a pve player, I think till 40 Holy or disc is slightly better till 40 (but imo not enough to matter, save yourself a respec and just do shadow). At max respec holy   for raiding unless you are the lucky 1 Spriest invited to the raid for Shadow Weaving.  
---
You can heal all dungeons up till BRD or beyond as shadow, no need to worry about that.
---
&gt;and spell batching no longer has a place in modern gaming. 
---
You do realize every online game, including modern games, runs on ticks or batches right? It'd be quite impossible without it.
---
Now retail spell batching is set to something like 20 ms and has a spell priority. Classic is around 200 with no priority. Just slightly noticeable but not terrible and can get used to it.
---
Not difficult really if youre sociable. I mean you already have a shared interest that you spend alot of time doing which leads to chatting and getting to know each other ingame. I met mine in a guild i randomly joined and i started doing pvp with them. 
---
She joined me and we made a good team. Talked a bit played alot together. A few cross country visits and here we are 6 years later.
---
windfury or flame tongue? Most guides say windfury?

But they also take dmg from arcane explo, while ranged only take one explo per blink.

I’m putting one point into it to start with to see if it will suffice, but I think I’m going to need two.

You can have empathy without saying playing a game is morally wrong lol

Just going to warn you now that the chance she sticks with it is like 1%

Dual spec

Getting someone to go spend an hour trying to get you gear, but not having any gear options themselves, but you think they aren't entitled to something. I think you're confused on who believes they are entitled here.  
---
If you want someone to help you get gear, and they have no gear to get themselves, why should they go? Strat specifically is a dungeon that has ZERO tank gear, so getting tanks to show up is simply out of their good graces, or because they have an agreement of some form of payment and reward for coming to help YOU get something.

In times like this its important to remember that you gave your dog a lifetime of love and care. She wouldn't have traded that for anything in the world. She will be there for you on the other side eagerly waiting to shower you with affection. Rest in paradise to your dog and stay strong king &lt;3. It will get easier with time I promise.

Probably best if she plays a female human or night elf. Most girlie gamers I know like to play dress up and are more into their toon if they are more aesthetically pleasing.
---
Night elf and dwarf are probably the rarer of the four, with human most popular (pve) and gnome second most (pvp).
---
But at the time nobody really pondered viability. They picked what appealed to them fantasy wise.
---
Start her off as a warrior? Lol
---
What if he uses OpenBSD

It's based in how much damage you do.

Yeah, but i havent had the balls to take anyone on yet lol. But hey, gotta start sometime, right?

Grats! Got mine about a week ago. Farmed the runes, which also gave me about 15 felcloth, and bought the rest. In the end I spent about 150g on it, including getting tailoring from 280 to 300 to craft it. Well worth it imo!
---
I basically dont stance dance at all. it's the one downside to this build, and it really is hard, cus i do it alot with tac management.
---
However, i manage my rage very carefully, basically in dungeons, i always have 50+ when running into a pack. from rage stalling and ending previous pull with a good rage stack. 
---
also obviously i am in defensive stance, when tanking, and zerker as dps
---
Bless you and your heart.
---
Depends entirely on your server economy. On Shazzrah, vision dust goes for ~5s each, and the maximum you can get is 5. So that would be 25 silver per mask (maximum)
---
Touche! That's not till Lich King....
---
LOL slow your roll there my guy, the way you advert and deal with people sets expectations and has consequences.  I'm just saying talk about what you want instead of what you don't want.  
---
Avoiding accumulating negative feelings toward yourself and your groups allows you to cast the widest net and pull from the largest number of people.  I'm starting to see exactly this on sulfuras, among people at the top end you can tell when the guy whose group you just joined has a *certain* reputation, even if you've literally never seen him before, just by how long it takes to find easy to fill roles.

Toxic man who will ruin classic for thousands of star struck kids thinking that is what the game is.

Then you'd buy them right?
---
So needing it is still greed, as you're saving yourself the gold.
---
My ideal scenario is for then to rollout all the changes that happened up to WotLK in the order they happened and on the same schedule. Maybe slower schedule. And ideally if they could preserve each version as they go so you could play BC or WotLK but still have classic. 
---
It's a tall order, but that's my ideal scenario.

You haven't said anything constructive in any of this thread, just trying your best to sound overly intelligent, to strangers on the internet (and then tell them to get over themselves...)
---
He's right, skarn does mostly speak about highly optimised content. You are obviously correct that this translates, but it's few and far between what is actually applicable to someone sub 60 still getting to grips in dungeons. Alot of his content is fully assuming you know the game inside out, optimal rotations and skips fundamentals.
---
And he's right, it's great content, but just not for the audience you are suggesting!
---
I've been playing for about a week on a laptop and yes back of my hand/wrist hurts.
---
So then the other bit I dont understand is why 1h weapon speed is so important then? If my weapon does X DPS, then why would faster be much better? The DPS is the same?
---
211g across all characters.
---
Same concept as Linux, both in what I stated and what the link states.
---
And I said in my last post, you don't need VW to hold aggro for long. Just long enough to get all your dots up and a few SBs in the air. You do enough damage this way to kill normal mobs either while they're on their way over to you or just moments after. You should take very little damage, less than demon skin can take care of before your next encounter, even with a tap in there.
---
Too many people think VW means either sitting still with half your dots going to not pull aggro or face tanking. No, just time when you're pulling aggro. For really tough enemies take an extra 3 seconds to time your aggro pull for when torment is close to firing and VW will pull it right back off you. Make the enemy waste time running from VW to you while you throw out more SBs, you don't need to cast from 5 feet away, max out that range.
---
Or go to where the stairs to 2nd floor begin. There's a ZZZ spot there that I used to log off. 
---
Also, if you hit /camp or /exit or /log and your character sits down and it takes 30s to log off... YOU'RE NOT IN A RESTED AREA. All rested areas have insta-log offs.
---
Depends on the server. On mine, the recipe goes for 8g, essence of undeath go for 30s, Essence of fire go for 2.5g. On the other hand I haven't seen a single essence of Water below 22g.
---
Robe of Winter night sells for about 150g on my server, which is what I spent on Robe of The Void (plus like, an evening of farming satyrs).
---
But the most important thing of all: it looks good. Robe of Winter night looks like a recolored level 40 robe.
---
Also, purplz.
---
Elemental fire are 1.5_2.5g on my server. The more people raiding mc and farming elemental fire, the more expensive they'll get.
---
Whatever has the best stats. Ranged weapons are a stat stick for rogues.
---
Well i experienced it like this: after knockback we have a softreset for like 3 seconds on threat, means whoever does most threat during that time gets aggro, taunt neglects that. It‘s just my understanding, i also could be wrong. But i talked to a warrior of my guild and he always ate melee hits of ragnaros after the knockback when he engaged again and had WF proccs. 
---
I‘m playing feral tank, and styled 1.5 mins straight with pummeler while he died, can‘t say you my exact tps, but i had 234dps while that happened. (Killtime of rag in 2mins27secs)
---
To be fair, streamers getting mass gifts is just as bad. But by imbalanced I just mean heavily imbalanced for the purposes of making serious gold.
---
Mate, burn as much strawmen as you like, it won't change the facts.

What if he uses TempleOS

Be sure to check out their specials/movies as well.

Oh and i only ate one knockback, and it happened before i got knockbacked even once. Rag already had 35% by the time

This is the spec I would use at 40 on a pvp server:

---
You can take the 3/3 points in shadow reach and apply them elsewhere according to playing style (3/5 black out or 5/5 mind blast probably.)
---
Then just go down disc till you want to respec for healing, something like:  
---

---
And you will quickly learn you will melt almost anyones face 1 v 1, once you learn that your confidence will grow lol
---
Oh my god was that the one on craigslist??
---
Yeah mage life is free as fuck
---
I didn't use the ah at all on my way to level 60, vendored everything. Spent 25g on respecs, still hit level 40 with gold to spare after my mount.
---
I've had mostly positive experiences. But that's probably because I'm the tank. I set the pace. And I dont let some punk dps think he can. He can die. He will learn after the healer gets sick of ressing him and he has to walk his dumbrogueass back to the dungeon.
---
I also usually pair with a healer, so we have no problem finding a new dps if they wont listen to how the group should work.
---
We are pretty lenient and will tell you what you're doing wrong and ask you a few times correct it. But if you insist on pulling the mobs or being cancerous you will be replaced.
---
I'm still only 30.. I dont think I'll make it to 60 honestly
---
How spending/money conscious should I be? I’m a level 21 Rogue Elf and have 1 gold and 30 silver, am I doing ok money wise? I feel like I don’t spend too much, just on weapons and travel and copper healing items. On this sub I see a ton of “save your money so you can buy a mount at 40” posts and I have no idea how literal that statement is meant to be taken. 
---
I’m looking into buying a sword (Longsword 19-37 dmg) for 78 silver because it’s much better than my current two (Daryls Shortsword 14-26 dmg). Is that a good purchase? Can I dual wield the long sword and another sword? There is also a dagger (Kris 12-23 dmg) for 64 silver, that would allow me to do my stealth assassinations, backstab, etc. 
---
I just don’t know how I should be managing money, buying weapons, and obtaining better swords, etc.

Batching to not screw up healing. (Heal lands same batch when tank dies, then tank usually dies)

I'm a priest main and recently started a warrior alt, my guild mate messaged me "you just hate fun don't you" when he saw my alt lol. They don't know my 3rd alt yet either... A paladin lol.

My wife and I started playing classic together and I thought I’d have a toon to play with her and one to play ahead on my own.  She told me that it’s more fun for her if we experience it all together as opposed to me experiencing it ahead of her, then playing a lower level character just to play with her.  I didn’t get this at first, but after playing with her and resisting playing at a quicker pace on my own, I got it!  It WAS more fun having the character we were on together matter the most.  Our levels we gained together felt cooler, the dungeons we did together were more fun!  We’re only at like level 33, but I’m glad I slowed down to her pace. :)
---
TL;DR: Her pace makes it worth it.
---
I think troll is the rarest warrior race. That's pretty much anecdotal though. Everyone rolls an orc warrior.
---
Need greed system is no protection.  Anyone can Need on anything.
---
Only pre raid bis then becomes useless
---
On my server:
---
Pattern = 8g
---
40xFelcloth (4g) = 160g
---
12xEssence of Fire (2.5g) = 30g
---
12xEssence of Undeath (30s) = ~4g
---
12xBolts of Runecloth = 50 runecloth - 5g
---
2x Rune Thread = 1g
---
so about 210g total. Spent about 150 for mine (I farmed some of the Felcloth myself)
---
I've never seen it before, only references to it. I think I may just dive in.
---
No, shamans are.
---
Exactly, I paid 1g for 10 charms. Why would someone trade 1 charm for 1 Elemental??
---
They didn't want to spend money on it obviously? Are you willfully dense?
---
Best of luck in your recovery, and on your journey to 60. Mistakes exist to be learned from. Thanks for sharing, and I genuinely hope things improve for you. It's clear that you're a good person who means well.

He looks creepy like his skeleton is trying to leave his body threw his mouth.

there is no additional discount past honored in vanilla. rank 3 from the honor system does give a further 10% though

Dude made up an entire hypothetical and then got mad at it. That’s efficient triggering

&gt; /u/shammywow Needs a real OS then
---
If you're not in a bomb shelter right now, then please seek out one. You're going to need it.
---
I didn’t choose this life.
---
You also get a good amount of essence and shards. Alone the essences pay for the costs

Thank you for your service.

I'm not a huge fan of any streamer, but objectively speaking soda and reckful are very good at the game and it was fun to watch them play arenas. People would watch them for the same reason people watch really good league streamers. It's cool to watch someone who's really good, and you hope that maybe you learn something. Makes sense. 
---
Asmon isn't very good. He's probably much better than the average player. I don't really know for sure, though, because I've never actually seen him play the game. I've tuned in a couple times when some thread hating on him pops up, and every time it was 50000 people watching him watch shitty YouTube videos and complain. 
---
The difference between the "old guard", so to speak, and asmon is that the other guys stream game content and asmon streams himself being bitter about everything. There's a huge difference in the content that they put out, in the amount of effort they put into their gameplay, and in the general tone and objective of their gameplay while they're streaming. I don't think that pointing that out means you're gobbling dick or what have you. 
---
I'm not going to fault people for liking asmon, though I personally don't like his schtick and believe it's harmful to the community to harbour toxicity in the way he does (yes, even if it's ironically). But I also can't shake the feeling that he's a lazy, shitty person and the people that watch his stream do it to commiserate.
---
Op is on TempleOS.
---
Checkmate.
---
&gt;being this delusional
---
That’s why if you need to refresh it, you do so after a spell cast instead of in the middle of the 5 sec rule regen. If you’re in a 5 mana user group then it restores mana equal to its cost after like 4 or 6 seconds and then it’s all profit after that. Think of it more in terms of how I’d benefits the group rather than just the shaman using it. 
---
Improved mana spring is insane for long fights where you don’t need the resist totem assuming the full 5 mana user group.
---
Legit. 
---
And to cash in even more, sell them on raid nights cause you know half the guild run will forget about their fire pots until the last minute (slyly raises hand).
---
Good luck!
---
Oh wow, youre just a little bitch, arent you?
---
I'm sorry you had to run with such dicks. Hopefully your groups will be more understanding that tanks are allowed to use gear that is an upgrade for them too.
---
Anyone making twinks (max out at 19, 29, 39 for BG)yet? What level cap should I go for if I make one?
---
Try Catch
---
Lolol I have done this before....
---
Batching is actually such a bad mechanic I dont get why it's in game. It was used as a tool 15 years ago when people did play with 300+ ms and had awful computers but the majority dont now. I cant fathom why it's a thing.
---
Fights like this is fun to watch, but the party that has the initiative usually ends up wiping out the others real quick, since they're not prepared or even expecting it
---
Like the "LOTR" raid in Kargath that was posted here a couple of days ago
---
Another repost?
---
Classic hunter
---
Still not worth it. I hit 60 wearing at least a few pieces of gear from &lt;30 pretty much every time I level and still get times ranging from 4.5-5.5 days played every time.
---
You're correct on that at least. 
---
But it is most certainly an indisputable fact. How could paying more money for more power not be considered pay 2 win? Please explain that.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahshahahahaha
---
I think there's a pray key or something.

How?

So you auction botted. In osrs this is bannable but you do you

Optional toggle for old/new character models

Really glad to see this. My friend encouraged me to respec for shadowform at 40 (and I did), but after maining disc and healing high level content since Cata, I have been terrified since to step into a dungeon to heal. Mana feels like so much more of an issue in the shadow tree... I just hope I don't fail my tank!
---
no he’s actually a master streamer, he is the archetype of the streamer.. and a master troll
---
Same thing happening to me, sometimes the mail icon doesn't appear for auction mail I specitically remember mail for auctions sold.
---
Had to recreate the authentic classic experience!
---
Yeah. WPvP has serious lag if it's over 80 players. That isn't acceptable if a p server could do it. Blizzard can make mistakes guys.
---
Show her how to "pick flowers". Maybe have her role hunter so she can have a pet too.
---
So a drunk hunter rolled need and won my Archmage robe pattern.  Instead of kicking him, my friends and I guilted him over the rest of the run into giving it to me.  Whew.  Also, fuck hunters.
---
imagine knowing the names of some esports losers off the top of your head, holy shit
---
The first asmongold stream I ever saw was the first raid in BFA, where he had "world first" in his video title. I proceeded to watch a guild full of morons that can't listen to simple instructions, wipe repeatedly for the next few hours on the first boss, with asmongold flopping his teeth out like a beaver every 12 seconds, and making faces that made me wonder if he was in the middle of a seizure while playing, Then part way through the raid an item dropped for one of his guildies and asmongold said you're either giving that to me or giving me 150k gold. I was immediately like "this guy's a fucking loser"
---
​
---
So thank you for this, this is nice.
---
Case When
---
That's a bingo.
---
I wasn't paying attention  when taking the screenshot which is why he got us

Just because you know the wrong way does not mean you know the right way.

Then they realize you don't need be holy spec to heal dungeons fine.
---
Damn. Suddenly Truefaith seems like a bargain.

Horde motivation for both BRD and Ony is aiding the Alliance. Pull your head out of your ass.

As soon as I get my desktop my Mrs is gonna have my.laptop. fingers crossed
---
depends on if consumables are allowed or not, if its an anything goes tourney then the matchup is doable
---
Get the vendor price add-on so you can see how much the new sword costs over it's vendor price. I used it a lot to find great deals while leveling. Almost never bought anything that was over 10s more than it's vendor price.
---
Jeez, can you just let people be happy?
---
Because they have the tailoring skill and is a mage. This is how the need/greed system works. Of course you don't "Literally need" anything, because its a video game and you can still progress the game without it, but the point of running dungeons is getting your gear without spending money to buy it on the auction house.
---
This is the deal you inherently make with your group when you go into a dungeon, that any drop that could benefit someone should go to that person. If there's more than one person who benefits from it, they roll for it, and rng decides who gets it.
---
I don't play 1h fury so I'm not positive, but I assume a big part of it is the Unbridled Wrath talent that makes you generate rage per hit.
---
Aww i love this!Great part of being warlock is being one of two classes with pets.sure they are not hunter pets but they can do so much.

Dominah is queen of dps and can CC mobs even in dungeons with her seduce,Chagrath is often a sacrifice that saves your life but hey he can offtank for you on elite mobs or give his life protecting you from elites while you mine sweet sweet thorium.

jholahah (or w/|e ) his name is ,is solid dungeon buffer with blood pact for all and fire shield that can help a tank a bit more with aggro and do some solid dps.

The dog (oops dont remember his name barely used him so far leveling)is a pvp king with his spell lock,dispels and sniffing out stealthers.Ofc can have uses outside even dispeling/silencing caster mobs or your hexed tank.
---
And ofc they have many more uses making a class truly unique
---
That's the one. Thanks for the correction.
---
I pretty much only buy it under 1.2g. usually do bids on my bank alt around 90s to 1.15g. the trick is to find bids that are around 1g that have a buyout of 2g. So far I don't get more than 10-20 stacks a day (besides farming and guildmates) but at least I'm pinching pennies. I refuse to buy higher than 1.2g.   
---
Just 320 stacks to go
---
You make groups for collecting quest to kill the mobs more efficient. Ur a warrior and seeing a priest doing the same quest? Nice, group and you can speed up. I hate having no competition for quests etc. even if it takes longer. Imo things like this made retail so bad in the long run.
---
I mean did one of the friends report you? I cant imagine youd get banned for a mere 200g. Did you spam global or something about it this doesnt make sense at all.
---
What does it do to you? I forget

We demand a fax of a Polaroid

I get the same feeling from whenever someone makes a leeroy joke or when someone thinks "stop dots" during onyxia is still funny. They are tired old jokes from 15 years ago, move on boomers
---
Okay... Do you disagree with the advice given, or do you just enjoy being a contrarian?
---
My welcome what?
---
Appreciate the feedback fellas, yeah currently doing duos with a rogue, but I'll respec to arms to make the grind less tedious.
---
Problem is you can make a script of some sort which I'm obviously not going to show how to code. It would look something like this.
---
1. talk to Qia (wait 0-60 seconds)
---
2. Interact (wait 0-60 seconds)
---
3. Attempt to purchase (wait 0-60 seconds)
---
4. Close vendor  (wait 0-60 seconds)
---
5. Repeat step 1
---
It can all be random too. So after step 1 my character can wait 3 seconds, step 2 wait for 2 seconds and step 3 wait 5 seconds. Next time its going to be different wait times and it would look "legit".
---
No one expects the NE Inquisition.
---
Not odd. People appreciate free a lot more and want to be generous. People assume if you set a fee that you know the value of the service and won't tip on top.
---
Long hard day of terrible aggro-ing :)
---
I was actually thinking for tanking for a 1H + shield.
---
God that was hilarious. Gonna have to go find it again.

I'll go ahead and post it again.

Faction/server change
---
No rolling need on an upgrade is not ninjaing. That's the point moron.
---
That's one hell of a game to start someone on.
---
The system in place now is a bigger gold sink  for mounts. Anyone that wants a different mount is gonna pay a lot.
---
Lol
---
get off his dick, damn!
---
Or they didnt have the gold??
---
Imagine thinking kids are the main audience of classic lol.
---
As guilds get bigger there comes a point where g chat is no different to trade chat.
---
haha.  I'm picturing her going full Clara.
---
Odd place to be venting
---
Dual spec or a respec cap of ~10G and the guildbank feature
---
Doesnt help if you get invited to a group and the ninja just so happens to also be in that group, unless ofc you frequently browse your ignore list when entering a group.
---
you made him delete his account with that comment lol
---
I bet people said this about slavery too

You seem like an awesome person, I just found it really ironic is all. Don’t worry I have plenty of friends!

You're supposed to sit back to back cheek to cheek. That way she can't see the look of disappointment on your face and get discourage.

Yea I'm with you.  I went back and tested again on some just trash that was ending soon and still getting outbid instantly.  Definitely botting.
---
Even with that they can't all do it in the same gcd
---
Summon hearth all the time :)
---
Also it's probably way easier to read and understand if you give the variables proper names.
---
I'm programming for a living and this was hard to read...
---
&gt;In classic you aren't really able to reach a state of mitigating every attack in some way.
---
But you can get extremely close in naxx though
---
No you misunderstand it. Warrior does not stand for War but for wary, to be wary of potential enemies that would kill you.
---
Should warrior tanks be rolling on two handed weapons?
---
Yet only your warped mind could consider this as ninjaing. You arent right, give it up.
---
And if you had progressed beyond basic economics you would know very well at this point that a low supply (a rare drop in this case) inflates the market price (The price that people will sell it for on the AH). If the market price is inflated  and it would take more time to make the gold needed to buy the recipe than farming the recipe to drop, then it makes more sense to spend that time in the dungeon.
---
This is of course assuming you've communicated to your group that you would like the recipe if it drops, which most reasonable humans would be ok with considering they have no use for the recipe other than to try selling it.
---
Running instances and vendoring greens helps

I can't wait to hear about your divorce.
---
I still farm some when I get bored and 30s/ea seems to be pretty common on Grobbulus
---
Hehehe, thankyou! :D I find it really fun!
---
How does this apply to lock pets? I feel sometimes they teleport and sometimes they aggro everything in a wide circle.
---
Also, in the pic it doesnt look like the pet has any aggro
---
I actually got a mage to 60 before realizing how much I missed playing rogue. It’s so fun in the open world, being able to pick and choose what battle you want to take. I also have a fat kill on sight list from my mage and it’s really enjoyable to come from the shadows and ambush crit them while they are eating.
---
Metzen really wanted **Naga** as a playable race.

My GF would never touch wow, but man she crushes me at overcooked

Our MT is a Druid right now for all of MC. It’s not hard enough to be exclusionary
---
You could use that macro and also keep jade/agate in a side bar for your viewing pleasure.
---
No one! I repeat no one fucking cares!
---
What about for humans?
---
There are many craftable items that can help greatly with various aspects of PvP and also some useful items that will help with AoE damage / tanking.
---
😮 you play as female human and your wife as male?
---
I thought that was a it too.
---
That said, there's no way all these people are setting alarms and timing their AH sells to come on and bid for the last 2 hours of every item they listed.  Maybe they could do them in batches but that many people doing that at 3-4am EST on a weekday seems so unlikely.
---
I think there is some kind of automation happening.
---
And some of them are only a gold so why risk the deposit forfeit for outting it up 3 times
---
Congratulations! It takes so damn long to gather all those mats, the thought of grinding it all fills me with dread! I mean, how the hell did you get *two* Rune Thread?!
---
Also if you run upstairs to the top you can get rested there too
---
It isn't hard to make 100g at low levels..
---
For starters, Brown Linen Robe make flat profit when you DE them into Magic Essence.
---
It really picks up after 30 in general. I literally had like 13g at level 28, I now have like 37g at level 31. The only item I have sold on the AH was a blue bow for 3g. I train most of my skills as well. I get a free mount at 40 though, living that pally life. I guess it makes up for the leveling experience being basically runescape combat.
---
Too bad you dont know what they are.
---
There's no chance this is the reason else half the streamers would be banned too as they all roll for gold.
---
Lol no this is the shot she took. The ones I took were all crap in comparison
---
Get some damn cushions for that bench or you both are gonna have a bad time.
---
where's "Then"?
---
Seems to be super common for people who aren't literate in current video games. When faced with separate camera control and movement, new players tend to only move the character rather than changing their facing direction (in FPS games). I suspect for WOW it's not as big of a problem since you can pretty much run straight and "steer" the character like a car.
---
Is this a shill for Asus?
---
Automatic downvote
---
Just wait it out. The pattern was like 90g a couple of days ago and it's at 26g last time I checked.
---
I feel like you missed a lot of the video while skipping through it if that was your main takeaway.
---
I got the impression that the video was more of a neutral comparison between retail and classic, what differentiates the two and so on.
---
Technically, yeah
---
Ive heard drawf racial is better than gnome racial for pvp
---
melee has them hostage.
---
Wssnt there like bunch of 50s in that grp
---
Farming Elemental Fire for mount on my Hunter in her late 30s was the funniest shit ever. All these level 60 Warriors and Rogues never getting a tag.
---
He either bragged in chat or one of his friends snitched. I’d be surprised if they had detection for this kinda thing. Maybe a lot of trades occurring would flag him, that could be another way too, I guess.
---
Daddies boy. Never worked a day in his life, using daddies money.
---
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starch white shirts
---
Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?
---
I’m now convinced he’s guilty.
---
The problem with this is it's a 447MB file.
---
Warriors aren't all tanks. And not all tanks are good ones..
---
He has shown it on stream a few times. It’s available information for partners.
---
Do you really think we'll need it in BWL and AQ?
---
Its all mechanics, we have as much dps now as the average-ish guild did in naxx.
---
Why do people say this about staff of Jordan? I sold one for 105g in like 5 minutes in trade chat, guildie sold one for 90g in about the same amount of time a couple days ago.. it seems like one of a few lower level boe epics that are guaranteed to sell
---
Generally first orb res is standard for that. Not all orbs, though.
---
Is there an addon like https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/tradeskill-info that tells you in-game what different materials are used for in what professions? I'm getting tired of looking up every single white item that drops in order to check if I should or should not bother trying to AH it.

Most? Ironforge lmao I rack up a lot of afk time and messing with friends around the city goofing around.
---
Least? Probably Felwood. Just never really needed to go there. I hear there’s a dope world buff tho but still haven’t gone to get it before raids.

I mean the meta might evolve to that if the guilds coordinate to all zerg mc/ony on the same day with world buffs.

I went disc recently and have found this really well suited to 5 mans.

20% reduced threat, 10% more mana really seem to making more of an impact than the extra hps holy gives.

Classic AMA
---
Thank you! Next step is getting some nice enchants to match the look.
---
There is a difference between people just fuck around and people actively fighting. Also there is a difference between 100 and 300. The game should be able to handle 300 people.
---
Can be good if they go mace spec for PvP. Extra chances to proc that stun
---
Does this work with ghetto hearth?
---
Dual spec.
---
I am happy to get PvP soon'ish, but I really hope they don't rush out P3.  Wait till May/June (to give people time for R14) for P3 and get some summer out of it.  Then head into P4 end of Q4 2020.
---
Are you implying warlocks arent people?
---
IRL childhood friend, his in game name and nickname is 2 letters off from his full name
---
I think they’re both on par. The big thing for the dwarf racial is that it fucks rogues, which are pretty popular for pvp.
---
I made about 7 to ten g an hour grinding out my last 30 just east of the Kodo graveyard in desolace grinding beasts, but i do have skinning.
---
Fucking hit print screen you god damn heathen
---
Masterlooting is acceptable if you have made it clear before the dungeon that a certain item piece is reserved. If everyone in group agrees to that condition then there should be 0 qualms when the party leader masterloots at that boss, handles loot by either getting the item or having everyone roll, then turns off after.
---
Should people always roll need on purples even if somebody wanted to wear it?
---
Eye of Fire dropped in LBRS today and the tank rolled on it. I love fire as mage and my goal is to make a pvp fire mage(stuns/ignite ftw) but then i lost it. That would have been insane. I'm really bummed
---
Dude, phase 2 has World bosses. You will need 40 people to do them. And there will be at least 2 Guilds of each faction competing for them and likely bring 2 raids to it each. You will have 400 people pvp on every single worldboss.
---
Is one DHK that bad?
---
You're SB spamming but never going oom? Also not draining to sustain lifetap? VW really blows my guy.
---
Don't join the group then. Reserve is nothing new to classic.
---
Phew. Because the mats alone are a killer to get (20g per mooncloth, 25g per orb...)
---
Yes it does.
---
Join a different guild.
---
Is that item BiS for chest for Priests?
---
Thunderfury, Xarl here. Zug Zug lads
---
At most you could probably get an easy third party program where you chose what dungeon you do and then click stop on when you are done. Which then would tell you what your current record is, etc.
---
Sad cause the dps didn't change
---
Didnt mention region, faction or server lol
---
He is both of those things
---
Bullshit, you don't put the same effort in as someone who is organizing the group and farmed the UBRS key + is also clearing the dungeon. Not only that but as the party leader you constantly have to tell noobs what to do so they don't wipe you. I did this and it was by far the most draining shit I've ever done in WoW. Everyone would much rather sit on their asses and AFK while someone else makes the groups.
---
Don't join the reserved groups then and make your own if it's the "same effort".
---
or you can set it to be in the wall, or on a different floor. I did this with dalaran in wrath so i'd fall into the garden whenever i hearthed
---
Literally me last night, 2 people had to repair mid run, so they hearthed and ran back into instance to repair.... the problem is when the warlock has to repair. That's when you gotta get group to self summon from outside brd.... damn being a lock has it's perks
---
What is BDS?
---
Look they have plenty of water breathing buffs to give people, it's an important job.

Take the stickers off of your computer!

Spot. On.  The same people who don't want to give this guy his due credit for being a pretty impressive self promoter, are most likely the same people who think house flipping shows are real.  It's all an act
---
Too busy crafting bandages, but zug zug!
---
Your right!! Region is US, Faction is Alliance and Server is Ashkandi. Thank you!
---
Who said I don’t make my own groups. It’s not hard to make a group and no matter what you’ve done to make it you don’t have more right to loot than anyone else
---
Farm rep, max professions, help your guildies gear up.
---
I did mention the equal chance (need).  Master loot without reason, you can’t even need for a chance.
---
"meant to be played" lol. I think we can all agree the default wow ui is pretty Garbo.
---
Reserved makes sense..sometimes?
---
Like bribing tanks into strat (which they don't need) by offering them the orbs from live side.
---
a clicker died, all is well in the universe
---
Certain classes are better at different level brackets
---
You don't understand the irony of the situation?
---
Is the humour really lost on you? Like really? Really, actually, truly, and honestly?
---
if you’re still using sexuality as a derogatory adjective, I’d say you’re the ridiculous sounding one.
---
Depends on how good you are in terms of finding groups. If you have a premade team that levels with you all the time, you will be faster than questing. If you have a personal tank, you will be faster than questing.
---
I get it bro but don't say that out loud eh.
---
Really it's just the pilot that turned me off. The rest of season 1 is pretty damn good. The finale of 1 is one of my favorites. I tell people to start with episode 2.
---
Dont forget landing makes you a Dishonorable Kill. Flight path camping isn't as good as people think
---
Because they know it's a lot more effort to create groups/deal with being a party leader, so they'd rather bitch and moan about it because they're lazy.

Also, if you are exalted by level 40, you can certainly buy the 60% mount
---
I bought all mine off AH
---
Opposite. Rolled a warlock, but I have been playing a rogue for sometime so I went back. Rogue is just my favorite flavor
---
I used one for a quest once
---
Yeah I just learned that earlier lol. Did like 20 runs, saw 2 savage chains and I was like wtf.
---
Yo what the heck.
---
I can testify to what your sayin in regarding to luck of the draw with finding lotus. I afk / herb while at work, for multiply hours through out each day or any extra spare time between dungeons / raids. Some more then others but like you, I have only found 2 as well. One being today, pog 65g.
---
I wondered the same thing regarding server cap and supply / demands. The demand is way higher with supply being way lower (If server cap is higher). They’ve stated pre classic release that today’s server house many more people then an original vanilla servers but have never provided concrete numbers between the two.
---
Interesting food for thought non the less. Glad someone else has there gears spinnin
---
What quest? There's a gorrila quest in un'goro but it requires (3) mithril casings, not tubes.
---
pre bis is not needed, it just makes the entire thing quite a bit easier. It is good to have a few pre bis items, it is not that hard to get anyway. I got 2 of them on my first BRD run.
---
The advice to let her play without telling her what to do is critical - do you get away with telling her what to do elsewhere in life?
---
But beyond that, I disagree.  Make a new character to play with her.  That may mean waiting a while, if you make characters with different starting areas, but exploring together and sharing the new things in game is a huge part of making the game something you do as a couple.  I also recommend either  a druid or a pally for you to be able to tank (protect) or heal (show caring) for her as she progresses.  My own wife loved hunters because she loved animals and gnome mages because they were bouncy fun and it was the heart of our computer time together.  
---
As someone who cannot do this now due to her passing, I sincerely wish you the best - it was great!
---
Why would anyone be able to "reserve" any item? 
---
I could not give less of a shit how bad you need it, how good it is, how many times you've farmed the dungeon, etc....
---
We all completed it as a group, if two people need it, two people should roll.
---
Fuck you and your entitlement.
---
If you want a specific drop for your class, just don't invite another person who might need it.
---
Holy shit, it comes with a banana?
---
Eastern plagueland quest I believe. Made me get a ton of stuff
---
Good, wouldn't want myself interacting with narrow-minded people like you anyways :)
---
your hearthstone on the inside of your bubble?
---
why is stuff like this allowed here?
---
i mean lets spam the damn sub with every streamers drama/bullshit, lets see how that works out
---
OP don't feel too bad about this. They are worth about the same in gold. I payed 300g on Fairbanks for edgemasters. It's very server dependant
---
You’re.  
---
But thanks for the sentiment.
---
Yesss!!!
---
Hint: it's the second thing.
---
yes you do if you don't wanna kill bosses in 2+ minutes.
---
this it not retail, clearing is not the goal, the goal is to clear it fast and efficiently. also doing MC/BWL in one raid night is better than doing in 2.
---
Obviously this voidwalker was enslaved by normie warlock
---
Right? I mentioned having only a 6 slot bag and got gifted two bags in a dungeon. Super nice.
---
I see you smartened up and moved Cleave from keybind "9" to "1" Honestly dont know how people use keybinds that far down the keyboard lol.
---
Don’t take her to WC
---
Bruh I needed that
---
I leveled a pally to 28 and then rerolled to rogue. Its not hard to get a spot in a group if youre actually a good rogue. If you can manage your aggro and kick/cc youll stick out from all the other trash rogues who can't attack the same target as the tank for some reason.
---
Got goosebumps from reading the whispers! Fate!
---
I’m about to hunt this down. Ty!!!
---
"he hasn't called me since he got his succubus."

If you come across this guy on Whitemane as horde. Do yourself a favor and find another tank.

If you want guaranteed loot, solo the instance.
---
This is five man content. If I need, I need.
---
Level 48 is a shit area. I would just run ZF a few times until you are level 50.
---
Making groups and farming a UBRS key is literally more effort than anyone else in the group by default, no matter what nonsense you say.
---
&gt;you don’t have more right to loot than anyone else
---
Sure I don't have "more right", whatever the hell that even means. I have the right to reserve an item though and that's all that matters. I'll have that right as long as it's within Blizzard TOS. And you have your right to not join or make your own group with your own rules. This doesn't mean that many other people will care what you think and they'll still join my reserved group regardless, because it's their right...
---
The fact is that plenty of people still joined my reserved Dal'rend groups and that's how I got the item. You can't grasp the concept that there are many people who don't care about the reserved item and who would rather not deal with making groups or farming keys.
---
God damn onions man...
---
Why start her off on the crappy version?
---
It’s the best hairstyle
---
I'm a hunter with herbalism. I don't get why other classes complain about bag space.
---
Good for you man. My wife has a spider phobia and didn't make it out of Goldshire.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they planned out these ninja looting events, I mean how hard is it to trade the item later if its BOE
---
I’m lvl 52 and on my 3rd boe epic find 😂
---
Man, I want my interface to look like this but it's so much work.
---
The guild I'm at I grouped up with one other shaman who plays enh. So I was in discord with him and constantly nagged at him to think about placing his totems. Then we talked a bit he told me about his leveling plan. I asked him whether he intends to go on raids with the guild. He was like "I'm one of the Guildmasters, I sure hope I will go onto the raid"
---
I don't really remember where this tangent originated but I DO play Classic lol. Sorry if it was random, I think it was about helping someone in times of need. Either way, good luck and good loot from Atiesh.
---
Phones aren't for playing.

They are for taking pictures of your computer screen while playing.

A guy earlier in LFG was memeing about it, he was advertising just needed a tank for Strat, but all Righteous Orbs, Truefaith Vestments, and mount were on reserve, with a 30g surcharge for the tank. It was pretty funny.
---
Yeah. It's called my main.
---
Fucking love this meme

They funded the championship prize pools, and they sponsored the league.  They didn’t pay the pros a salary, but it was essentially a contracting gig.  Blizzard funds a competitive league and makes attractive prize pools, pros play in the league and bring viewers to the game.

You can pull him into the previous room and have a ton more room to work with, easy to avoid the inferno. Also there is an overhang you can run to with living bomb

easy to forget what the key bind is for that spell for a while tho

ideally though you will have everything keybound and won't click anything ever

Might be somewhat useful for bear tank. That\`s about it.

Shut up.
---
The delving into the difference of pace/world scope and why some people prefer different things was very well done. Something I hadn't seen a good argument for before, although the conclusion that "Everyone will get tired of this eventually" with regards to constructed vs sandbox activities squares oddly with me. Maybe I misinterpreted it.

I feel like something most talked about outside this video, the socialization issues, wasn't properly delved into. There was much discussion about the negatives of forced socialization, namely toxicity and eventual lack of partners for early game content. But I feel like much of the appeal of a more social game, while much lauded everywhere I've ever looked, was left untouched in a discussion of why Classic wow is more than just a nostalgia trip.
---
Overall a neat listen.
---
Idk Why but on my server (Horde side) thundering were going for way more than cresting or burning. Maybe because people are that lazy and don’t like running from Hammerfall.
---
A cmon, there are tons of relatively big female streamers who's only trait is their look.
---
stackable soulshards
---
On the other hand, Classic does a good job of weaving PvP into the whole experience, while in BFA it's kinda sectioned off into its own thing.
---
Absolutely agree that if *all* you want is PvP, BFA is the way to go. But honestly, if all you want is PvP *you may not want to play WoW.*
---
Can you talk to my wife?
---
Gotta go left, cause left ain't right and I ain't about being right. 
---
Also blue eyes are awesome and I'm a paladin.
---
If you do 5 runs that's 15 gold. That's 1/4 to your mount. If you ah the greens you've already made 20 / 25 gold. You need to try harder at making money. It's easy past 35.
---
Post a vid bruh
---
Yeah, I suspect you’re right. I misunderstood the AH fee calculation.
---
Now that’s a RP server move
---
Warriors need them for their Whirlwind Axe.
---
Yep, I suspect this is right. I’m dumb!
---
Try more dungeons. You're going to get spanked in greens because dungeon loot is significantly better at every level.
---
I just bought my mount at 35 making money through mining/blacksmithing. Just find things that sell consistently, for a decent price, and go to town.
---
Also, when you start getting to silk cloth, turn them into bandages, they vendor for pretty much what the cloth go for on the AH on my server.
---
What level lockpicking do I need for BRD? I heard you have to lockpick a gate or something not sure
---
no, warlock only BiS right now
---
Then what?
---
idk, those look like some serious gamer mousepads to me....
---
It's beyond me why people prefer to watch other people playing a game instead of playing it themselves... Worse still is paying for it.
---
As a wife who's husband did just what you explained--100% this!
---
First time playing WOW and I'm hooked. I can only recall maybe 3 days since release that I haven't logged in.
---
Auto-attack = majority of a leveling paladin's damage output.  
---
Mace meet face x 100,000.
---
Because Feral Druids can't dps.
---
Druids can tank. Or they can heal. Or they can tickle.
---
Groups don't need mobs tickled.
---
Agreed. That's all I'm looking forward to once I get my gear setup.
---
I do play on zandalari tribe eu and for most part i don't RP while solo leveling and nobody around. In groups i tend to do some light roleplay like calling party members companions, travelers, fellow adventures etc. When i ask about something i tend to use words like " would you be able to do me a favour " instead of "can we please do x", sometimes also in trade/LFG channels when somebody is roleplaying i also participate (tonight there was naked dwarf blacksmith offering services, so i asked him if sparks don't bother him when they fall on his... Bottom head). 
---
I take that RP tag light-headed and enjoy going into character every now and then, but doing it all the time, standing in locations for hours at end on /s or /e is for me a bit overkill.
---
You are asking someone to pay your sub? To be brutally honest you should start by either getting a job, working more hours or getting another job to supplement your income. If you can’t afford a $15/m sub then you should take the time you would game and work.
---
I convinced my wife to try it shortly after WoW first launched.  She made it slightly more than an hour and quit because, “there’s just too much running.”
---
It’s lag they are not doing this on purpose
---
lol you are forgetting about sweaty gamers like me who already have alts who can use this
---
i bought one for my mage alt a couple weeks ago and im using it currently
---
They've also never been rogues and watched every hunter, shaman, warrior and druid take truestrike shoulders. I have made plenty of ubrs groups and I never reserve anything, but I'm about at my wit's end losing these shoulders to every other class. I haven't even seen a dr drop yet. I'm sure the first few I lose to orc warriors and hunters who have objectively better and easier to attain weapons are going to hurt.
---
EQUIP IT
---
Yeah but you also get other perks that you wouldn't otherwise. I doubt most of us are in a guild with thousands and thousands of members, or with a GM that has enough clout to run these insane world PvP events every other day, or host cool community events, or be a part of stream drama. 
---
Streamer guilds come with some amazing perks that you won't get anywhere else in WoW and I think that's a good thing to have as an option.
---
Wow, I have no idea what that is but can see you're dedicated. Is it the best chest armour for end game lock or is there something better after?
---
Same for Fairbanks. Lvl 40 and make around 10g+/hr farming fire. As long as I can farm during a super non peak hour. As a priest I can't do instant cast dmg so even if I tag an enemy first all it takes is a druid to cast moonblaze or whatever and they get the target. Super annoying but gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Wait wtf? The robe of the void pattern costs 8 gold on your server?! It's like 80-100 on mine
---
It's weird to know that there's people this pathetic out there playing WoW.
---
PoH heals target's party, but it does do it in radius from initial target. If you have targeted some at yourax range, and some in that part is let say 45yards from your target, they don't get healed. Yard distance is probably different, it's jist example.
---
there is a guild on my server names "Out for Newports" lol
---
Mage was literally never bad in vanilla. It's a common dps yes, but it's always in demand as well.
---
It's the only DPS that will get you close to the being in demand of tanks or healers.
---
yeah or your friends can share it
---
Good god get a fucking life
---
Found the mad 10 year old. Let me know when you make it out of goldshire little guy.
---
google it real quick, i think its a legit bug
---
I know, I do the same when I am tanking for the heal threat. But I can also swap to bear or deal with it. It's not an issue if they are hitting their buttons, and it keeps the run going with less downtime.
---
The lack of name reserving for alts is astounding. Your will to commit to your main is far greater than mine.
---
QQ more
---
FYI bloodthirst doesn't use weapon damage and heroic strike gets (substantially) worse the slower your weapon is.
---
@laurencei dps warriors want a slow mainhand for two reasons:
---
* Instant weapon attacks (e.g. mortal strike, whirlwind, overpower) will hit harder for the same rage cost and cooldown, leading to a substantial dps boost over a faster weapon; and
---
* On horde-side, a slower mainhand will generate more rage over time due to windfury (which can proc not only off of white swings but specials like MS, whirlwind, and sunder)
---
The latter reason also makes slower weapons more attractive for tanks, but as they have more cause to be using heroic strike in a raid setting it ends up being a wash. I personally prefer mid-range (1.7-2.2) weapon speeds for horde tanks but I don't think there's a definitively right answer.
---
As a priest, fuck you. But honestly, just wish I could do instant cast dmg. 60% of the time I get the first spell on a target but it can't proc before a druid/hunter hits it first for first dmg getting the tag.
---
That’s me and the boys 😎
---
I enjoyed it, I feel he did his homework and had valid points all throughout the video.
---
Worth watching unless you have a strange burning hatred for retail.
---
I hope you get divorced
---
"half serious"
---
And they get a few globals in while they're running away, while ranged lose a global or two.
---
My first was a Tauren Druid. I wish I still had my original account and toon. :C
---
Well, unless u have them then im sure they are taken now. But idk, I kinda like Laena
---
Accepting isnt consent you shitlord
---
50g seems pretty expensive to me
---
I made two characters , I have them both .
---
Honestly it's still just a game, it sucks, but chill
---
there's a 255 character limitation for macros, that's why things aren't given proper names. the logic is easy, fitting it into the space wasn't.
---
I think I had to google it, it was confusing for me you need to switch it to classic wow somehow on battle net
---
Dude, is bug only word in your dictionary? Get a 5 man party, do a duels so ppl will loose health, try healing them. No rocket science involved. Or even better, get 10 ppl for mini raid, do 5 duels and then trying to heal. Recruit lvl 5 characters and give them 5s for participating if needs be.
---
That's what I said!
---
How?? :(
---
Yeah, it's not exactly a far fetched hypothetical.
---
Between cancelling game developers and driving them to suicide, and games like BF5 straight up shitting on its fanbase for not wanting cyborg Mary Sue's in their WWII games: I can confidently label the progressive left as the new religious right of the 90s.
---
Cyberpunk 2077 handled the gender/s with character creation extremely well. Hearts and minds are changed through diplomacy, not malice. You'll find that out in 2020 the hard way.
---
I hope she loves it!  It's a rough one to start with, but once your wife gets hooked it's a blast!  Let us know how it goes!
---
For the Horde!!!
---
The grinding is hard but it's worth it. I went heals and my boyfriend went warrior and it's working so far!
---
An updated and more skill based PvP ranking system to determine rank 14.... the whole 16hrs+ a day for 3 months just isnt possible... I've been 50 for almost a week now because life is just a priority.
---
He means porn and jerkin it. Like that old forum post that I don't feel like looking up to link. I'm sure you've seen it.
---
this is awesome!! only ^super ^minor point is that i don’t think you shuffle mid-hand? idk, love it tho
---
bro im in a fucking molten core as we speak and cant heal anyone in any other parties why the fuck you think im posting,  fucking christ
---
I'd lean on Laena simply because Graceful is an adjective. Bubbles would be a fine name in my view, Bubbly would just be weird.
---
Well then Searing Gorge opens up for you, which is an easy level at least. Then you can probably go: Feralas --&gt; Blasted Lands --&gt; Felwood --&gt; Ungoro --&gt; Western Plaguelands --&gt; Eastern Plaguelands or something like that. Also the occasional BRD run. 
---
Alternatively to ZF you can also go Maraudon. If you are a melee class you need to make tons of princess runs anyway for the ring. You can also do a Sunken Temple run at level 50/51.
---
&gt;Planning to respec to Disc
---
Please dont man. Disc is only good for pvp, and even then it's not that much better. 
---
Just go holy and embrace the inner healslut
---
Ty!
---
I like Laena.  I don't play RPG servers but I like RPG sounding names
---
just dont join 
---
wew
---
you're probably right. that makes sense
---
"Its luke from childhood"
---
She should be a healer
---
the whole game is a giant race war.
---
Then gtz , you're a dead weight. Somehow ppl still bring priests to MC to heal so they must be doing something. 
---
/Off to sleep, don't bother replying
---
Totally I’m a 10 year old bully, now gimme your money no life nerd
---
depends on your class
---
I wouldn't get any work done with this setup. Very cool!
---
Of course I understand the point of the screenshot. I'm asking the OP what he gains from posting it.
---
He asked "What would I possibly have to gain making it up?"
---
I'm asking "What could you possibly have to gain by posting anything in the first place?"
---
Yeah i often just grab a mage for the reliable aoe, cc, and water. Makes the runs a lot easier imo.
---
Jokes on you. This is 2004.
---
make a macro like this and put it on a button available to both defensive and berserker stance (So either a top bar or on each stance bar). Overpower is one of your best abilities while leveling, and in fact at some levels it is recommended you spam hamstring (or rend on bleed immune targets) to fish for overpower procs -- its more damage than heroic strike! You can see it more in [this infographic](https://i.imgur.com/F4aqlns.png) 36-35 you sunder to 50% then hamstring for overpower procs.
---
    #showtooltip overpower 
---
    /cast Battle Stance

    /cast Overpower
---
Best of luck. Enjoy the road to 60!
---
“Chriist..”
---
Yea, but getting used to it first, then saying "I wish I could customize this UI thing"  Boom!  Oh hey let me introduce you to this one addon. Instead of just bombarding with a list of addons that they dont know what to do with.
---
I was too shocked to form a coherent sentence haha
---
Drop down menu, select version
---
It's all about stacking it.  One + on any mod in WoW short of lvl 60 gear isn't much.  That's why most people don't worry and + to damage types of healing until later when they can get multiple pieces.
---

This one? No mithril tubes there.
---
Easiest money of my life!
---
Had a shammy take the Draconian Deflector from the main tank because he was planning on shaman tanking.
---
We actually don’t care as much as you do. Olympus guild chat is always active, and the community is nice.
---
Graphics.
---
Not only that it gets rid of diseases too. Looking at you RFD.
---
Thank you to the Horde on Bloodsail Buccaneers. You guys are fucking awesome!
---
So many people willing to help amongst each other. So many others willing to give gold if someone needs a little more help for a mount. So many I've met teaching other players versus yelling and berating a player for their ignorance.
---
I will miss this game.  I will miss my guild. I will miss destroying and being destroyed in duels. I will miss watching a hunter jump down to fight Rend and pulling the entire dungeon with a their un-dismissed pet.
---
I will miss you Horde.  I will not miss BRD.
---
Actually, I had some issues tonight that I never had before. Everything would freeze for 2-3 seconds and then catch up. Would happen every 30-60 seconds.
---
I'm glad I won HoJ because it's hard to not have at least one other to roll against. Now I run me, rogue, priest, mage. Rogue gets HoJ, I get chain, casters have no problem getting their easy as fuck loot. Everyone wins.
---
Ironic.
---
Well unless you got 2 locks. That blood pact doesn't stack.
---
It just says “try for free” there’s no drop down option
---
This is how it works on retail. At least the one time I thought I was a genius and tried it it did.
---
No way, start on season 1, watch until season 7 and watch the specials/movies throughout. 8-11 is way lower writing quality (Mike Clattenburg stopped writing for the show at this point) unless you just like over the top swearing and dick jokes, which really isn't what made trailer Park boys such a great show in the first place. Season 12 is a bit more like 1-7 though
---
You want a slow heavy hitter in your main hand and a fast off hand to generate rage and procs.
---
It usually works fine but we had new tanks and they ran to the wrong side during inferno so we couldn't heal them.
---
IIRC the 2nd build is the I'm-overgeared-for-dungeons-and-can-keep-healing-off-Bloodthirst or I'm-OT-and-will-never-have-to-take-raidboss-hits.
---
You get a free bubble for when you pull aggro
---
Right above download for retail there's no text that says World of Warcraft? Like it's right above download in blue.
---
You can incentivize people to join groups for live strat by reserving orbs for the tank.  It's fairly common practice on Herod.
---
It's enough to make me wish I had rolled one instead of a warrior.
---
Old spots used to be badlands for the rock elementals but now with fewer layers you'll have a bad time unless you're playing late and even then there will always be someone farming in each spot at least, other place although not as profitable is the basilisks close to the tanaris border, usually not too camped and there's plenty to go around.
---
That's cool you get to actually experience it from the beginning now
---
Hell yeah brother
---
Can you pm your mobile number and I’ll send you a screenshot of what I’m looking at lol
---
saving this, thanks
---
Just an idea. Are you.logged into the correct account? Maybe you have an alt, or it's her account you are on? Check to make sure it's the same exact account you have been paying a sub for.
---
I meant either. If your herbs sell on the AH, sell there. On my server I was able to sell mining materials but no skinning mats before heavy leather. Hides never sold on AH for me, so they weren't worth hauling to the big cities.
---
It's somewhere in your account options.
---
Game time and subscription status. Something like that.
---
We've been hearing about damaged reputations even before classic launched and if anything the ninja looters only got more famous and still pull shit like this.
---
I was able to insta logout upstairs.
---
well just when i think you couldn't be dumber, you go ahead and prove me wrong
---
also wow
---
again. wtf dude.
---
It depends. I'd say I use the felhunter almost as much, really just depending on what kind of mobs I'm dealing with. Any casters will look at you and then advert their eyes and try not to incur your wrath when you got the felhunter out.
---
It’s my account 100%
---
What projector do you have?? And how is it compared to a normal TV
---
Thrown weapons has no stats, and run out, thus should never be used. Get a ranged weapon with favorable stats.
---
It's a great for needing to go afk while out in the world alone. That combined with wisp spirit makes Night Elves the best leveling race imo.
---
What are the odds. Seriously.
---
No one who hates something does it for hours without need. By definition. 
---
If you’re watching asmongold for hours, you don’t hate him. That’s not what the word means. You aren’t getting paid. If you hated it you would literally not do it.
---
“Fuck I hated smashing my toe into the bed frame. I’m gonna do it again immediately after though.”
---
What the fuck is this shitpost
---
You make it sound like you’re done. Levelling is only the first chapter and now the real game begins. Wait for BG’s and more raids.
---
Pmed you
---
Well he's a madman fighting an orange, stick to yellows, this isn't retail
---
I don't even join if they res something, whether I need it or not. I think it sets a bad precedent, like everyone is using their time to help with a dungeon, you're not more important in any way lmao.
---
I tried my hardest but she has major issues with movement. She's never played video games other than Sims. I trie having her use the mouse to move and look around too.
---
It's the only one that isn't white too lol.
---
Just post a pic to imgur
---
i think my favorite part is how the pet has a seat and it looks like the other 3 party members are trying to figure out whos going to stand on the side.
---
What are the charms for?
---
Hmmm. Your right. My bad. Then I have no idea why they are used either lol
---
I did this at least 8 times with warriors and like 2 times with warlocks :P
---
Did you mainly fish around STV?
---
Have an active subscription, this is my view I have, want to download only classic, not enough room for retail
---
Lol it’s not gonna work out
---
I've been watching this implode over and over for 15 years. It's not even a gendered issue - I see women fail to get their boyfriends/husbands into WoW all the time.
---
I've got no idea why none of us have partners who like this game.
---
Void walker: Why do you call?
---
Wife: can you pick up milk and bread on your way back?
---
Yeah exactly.  Being a tank with HoJ does make it way easier.  The rogues are always especially happy when they see I have mine.
---
One tip for you and your friends: pick one main character that you all play with as a group and pick a secondary character for solo playing. That way, if one of you fall behind in level or quests, you don't have to all wait for the last person to catch up
---
Also, what kind warrior don't use overpowering on dodge.
---
That's a fist?! Eleven years playing WoW and I always thought it was a knee.
---
Omfg
---
Where do I even start with that horrible statement
---
Because people read that Feral Druid dps is bad or how they are not viable in raids etc etc so they get this negative idea stuck in their heads instead of just having fun in Dungeons with any class build :/. These people think you have to have the most optimal classes for a quick n smooth instance run when it's not true at all.
---
Linked below. Got it for about $120. For movies/TV shows, it's perfect. 3600 lumens and 1:3500 contrast ratio. It's the cheapest one with good ratings I could find that was about 3000 for both of those. TBH, WoW on a projector sounds a lot better than it actually is. It was fun for a good hour or so, but then my eyes started to hurt, I think because my "cheapo" projector has some blur around the edges. Maybe on a high end projet it would be more enjoyable on the eyes when doing a longer gaming session.
---
A normal TV would definitely be better on the eyes if playing for an hour+. The distance of which you are from the TV could present issues such as not being able to read chat/text, when on the projector I didn't have a problem with that. Besides that, a TV will have better quality and refresh rate. (Unless you are going very high end for a projector, like $800-$1000+)

Need them for a warrior quest. Gives you the Whirlwind axe.
---
Warriors need them for a quest to get the Whirlwind weapons.
---
These all look like a screenshot from a Warcraft cartoon.
---
it’s fine most raids need so few tanks anyways
---
It really is the only way to go. Classes that can't even use items are able to roll need on them is ridiculous.
---
Seeing how a lot of guilds abandoned the DKP system completely and are using randoms to funnel gear to their guildmates while calling it loot council is reason enough to just implement personal loot.
---
People whined for no changes classic so hard but most obviously can't and won't commit so much time again to have multiple 40man raiding guilds on each server every raiding night. Add to the fact that people realized how easy PvE content really is and they don't even need 40 members online consistently, just pull a random from the street and have him do some damage or healing.
---
If you're a warlock, you should be looking at your health bar as extra mana. The healthstone spells (every rank) are basically resource neutral - the stones restore health basically equal to the stones' mana cost. From that perspective, it's definitely worth making a healthstone if you have downtime so that you don't cap and waste mana regen. Without any talents, it's a way to transfer present resources into future resources. 
---
When you add in imp healthstone in the demo tree, each healthstone will give you 20% more health without changing the mana cost. With imp life tap, health is worth 1.2 mana per point. So with these two talents (both of which are taken pretty regularly in leveling builds) regularly using healthstones and tapping the health they give you will return 1.44 the mana you spent to make them. 
---
If you create a major healthstone (highest rank), use it, and tap the health it gives you, you'll end up ~500 mana in the black. All it costs is the cast time of the spell and the effort to farm a shard.
---
Drain health is a thing, you're right. It drains ~350 over its five second cast time, which returns ~420 mana after imp life tap. It costs 300 mana, though, so you're profiting 120 mana for a five second channel. You could argue that it's more efficient because it's also dealing damage, but the lion's share of your damage as a warlock comes from your dots anyways - they're very efficient, and deal more than 1 damage per mana spent. Drain life is really just to hold your resources steady while facetanking the mobs your shitty pet couldn't hold aggro on.
---
Obviously you should ignore all of that if you need health to stay alive. =)
---
I feel like he should say that while sitting at an Old Man’s bar
---
Lol. Truth on the barrens talk though, for whatever reason.
---
&gt;An awesome feral druid is never going to be as good as even a mediocre rogue.
---
No. A really good feral in full phase 6 BiS with full raid consumables and buffs (without legendaries like Atiesh of course) can do \~1300 sustained single-target DPS. A really good rogue in full phase 6 BiS can do 1500+. A mediocre rogue with the same gear - 800-1000.
---
¿que?
---
Don’t listen to anything we’re saying.  Just be with her and make her have a good time.  /make her laugh. Wish you two the best !
---
It gets a lot better once you get more levels I had the same thing when I was lower level not exactly sure why
---
The Logitech G600 is another alternative you can consider.
---
Repairs, food, water, ammo, flight masters, skills, weapon training, profession training. And then a lot of people buy stuff from the AH
---
What toolbar add on is that??
---
i wouldn't be upset because i have no problem tanking because i rolled a warrior
---
 1hnd speed matters because of the fury talent. 40% for another rage on hit, also faster attack speed makes heroic strike less terrible
---
That's 2004 for ya.
---
Maybe update the launcher or sth or just click the try for free thing maybe that will turn it into the normal wow screen where you get a drop down for classic
---
Yea man I was starting to think it was just me but it’s good to know I’m not alone.  I’m usually pretty chill but so many of these dps are so quick to blame me for them pulling adds.  I’ve never seen such incredible entitlement.  It’s never their lack of awareness, it’s my poor positioning.
---
It’s incredibly taxing to deal with so much toxicity directed at you so yeah, I’ve started just peacing on groups with players like that.
---
Im 38 with 11g, you’re not a noob.
---
It only heals your party.
---
Hit try for free see if you can download it
---
Wotlk (in my opinion) was peak WoW beacuse you still had the community and attitude of classic with alot of the QoL features of modern wow
---
Yesterday also dinged 40 on my warrior. Had 100g. Just sm runs 30-40 and 2-3 hrs gold farm at all in desolace.
---
The best chance to obtain is by buying it. 
---
This is not something that is possible to farm. World drops be like that. Sorry this isn’t what you wanted to hear but your plan is bad and a waste of time.
---
Do it. By taking away the top 1%, you don’t allow the processor to go into an overdrive state, which then maintains lower frequencies. Only a small performance loss in most cases, and typically a large loss of heat.
---
But AR can't be used in combat 😭
---
But what I wouldn't give for NS to work with AR
---
Way to pick the Eco terrorists
---
Centaurs take the prize for shiftiest and most absurd underwater animation
---
You only need 3% for the ability hit cap tho' right? (Assuming 5% from combat talent and +5 wpn skill from Weapon Mastery). Looks like you have Mask of the Undying so that is 2% right there, then the last % you can get from a ring (or devilsaur set for another 2%).
---
I was level 39 and had 70 gold. I just spend the last 10 hours of game time grinding alligators in duskwallow. Gained a whole level and then some and about 22 gold. Flying to ironforge to mount up!!!
---
I could feel the heat actually decrease after a minute or so!  Unbelievable. Had no idea.  Thanks!
---
Why would you buy something as expensive as an epic mount to transfer gold?
---
Gear is wasted on clueless people like you.
---
It's a good reason not to make assumptions about who is behind the keyboard. You'll be surprised.
---
* A silver Mei about to flame her team for not getting on the Payload.
---
* Reinhardt wondering what the hell his DPS is doing in the front.
---
It's irresponsible to introduce people to an addiction
---
Heroic strike and imp overpower are a waste in that prot spec,  you either want more Raid utility with the shield wall talent or more dungeon utility from other talents in the prot tree

I watched like a minute of his stuff, saw his thumbnails, and read stories about him on reddit. Am I allowed to hate him? If not, then where's the line between "you haven't watched enough to hate him" and "you've watched too much to hate him"?
---
Agreed, unfortunately it's not going to happen on most servers. There are obviously new people playing for this first time but it feels like 99% of players think they are elite all knowing hot shit and its already getting old.
---
Glad to help!
---
A and d turns your character not the camera. Sure the camera moves also of course with your character
---
How stupid can you possibly be? It's a pattern for a tailor, specifically for the current BiS mage robes. The mage, likely a tailor, won the pattern.
---
Learn some common sense. I hope no one takes you seriously when you cry wolf against people legitimately rolling for items they need and you don't.
---
Or some people just like to play the game differently. There are those out there who just enjoy min maxing to a T, nothing wrong with that.
---
You need at least 250 but you dont have to lockpick anything, there are keys you can get.
---
Swamp jaguars in swamp of sorrows especially if you have skinning

Alas I have tried a few times with mine. She always picks rogue and always gets bored within an hour or two. I dont push her. Just follow her around.
---
Just not for her sadly.
---
I’m so weary of seeing this Neckbeards goofy face all over this sub. I did actually click on this video to see what it was - and there hasn’t been a more obviously made up and badly acted piece of drama since Leeroy Jenkins

I ended up using software solution when I played 5 accounts on my PC between Aug 2008 - Feb 2009. It was OK with GMs because it didn't used any form of automation, meaning I had to manually key press for every action.

Less holy paladins on my server and I'm good.

Switch to arms with a good 2h and you wont regret it. 31/20/0. Does great damage and aoe threat generation as well if youre tanking dungeons. Fury i find requires better gear to do as well as arms while leveling, endgame its a much different beast because of the gear available at that lvl.
---
I never once said you haven’t watched enough of him to hate him. You’re literally making things up. If you go up in the thread another guy was shitting all over him and said he had watched hours of him, including an entire Mc raid, which is where the original discussion started. 
---
Try following along and not just lying on the internet.
---
No kids were injured in the making of this moment.
---
I’d call the first night a success! She seemed to enjoy it. And got used to the camera controls fairly quickly. I let her pick everything except the faction. FOR THE HORDE! She chose a female Tauren hunter, and I picked shaman to heal and support. Should be a fun combo!
---
She liked looting new items, and trading items to me that I needed. Did very well with questing! Taking the initiative and being objective. Fun times!
---
I’m not sure how long she will keep enjoying it, but even having these small moments was a cool experience!
---
&gt;I was only top dps because i ate so much mana pots to proc hurricane every now and then. 
---
Do you powershift?
---
Never said I was.  But it is widely known that a huge part of the population uses it this way.
---
I call it the "first responder" support spec.
---
Better graphics as an option.
---
I introduced mine to stardew right before classic launched...
---
She's still playing it, addicted even.  She just married Harvey, she's saving for a nursery.  She taught me an exploit about stardew I didn't know...  She's schooling me on the game...
---
60. I should mention this is regarding instances and raiding.
---
I had plenty of world pvp on the way to 60 so maybe play on a bigger realm?
---
In my mind it's totally normal to get aggro for a bit especially if you're aoeing, but if the tank isn't able to peel them off of you in time or you guys aren't killing them fast enough then it becomes a problem. 
---
Plus if you're frost build, have the cc, and play the range it's totally fine.
---
Isn't it because women aren't as fragile as men?
---
Impossible!
---
As far as I know, in classic, it only heals the casting priests party. Therefore, in raid you should spread priests into different parties.
---
&gt;Because their damage sucks compared to everyone else
---
Only if they don't know what they\`re doing.
---
I dunno I just picked it up from ingame dialogue.
---
Why should you get to need on a BoP item when you can just buy items from the AH. Everyone gets the same amount of gold just vendoring them. That's basically your logic, my dude.
---
It could be widely changed then.  To correct English usage as opposed to an outdated insult.
---
this makes so much damn sense, thank you!!! this guy has all heals in the same group and im like dude, spread us out!
---
Okay, thanks
---
He did, it hit for 186 damage.
---
You have yet to prove this guy sold the recipe.
---
They can literally eat your corpse as food
---
Yes I had this in Sm cath. Only place I’ve ever experienced lag in the whole game and it happened several times. Obviously something fucky going on there
---
Cause purple.
---
I'd just sell them. Might pauldrons are better (5 less defense for 2 more stam, 90 more armor, and 2% block chance for crushing blow).
---
Shuda had the rogue do it.
---
We have no intentions of leaving the server so we have an interest in pushing back against the Horde. At this point it looks like multiple horde guilds are dodging us by getting to MC like an hour early. It's way more fun when they bring multiple raids or enlist additional guilds to fight us TBH.  
---
This past week I noticed a couple other Alliance guilds getting in on the action which is a good sign. Phase 2 will be interesting though. Alliance will pretty much always need to be in death squad raids to grind HKs.
---
Oh wow two laptops
---
Good video, thanks!
---
Do ZF/Mara as a 60 mage u can easily carry any PUG
---
Yeh apparently they slowly changed stuff over time and with 2.0 they made a big sweep to change everything. It was just weird to me back then since I already got used to the names especially the main cities. Now I would probably play on an english server anyway.
---
My rogue is level 38.
---
Fury tanking is better threat by a significant amount. It’s main draw back Is no tactical mastery which basically makes rag harder to intercept back down and makes dungeons slightly more annoying. Deep prot just isn’t worth it IMO. You don’t get increased threat and you only gain a few % points of armor. Fury/prot on the other hand produces a ton of threat, specifically on single targets quickly, and you always have the option of throwing on a shield if a pull gets too hairy.
---
Except you only need to rank a handful of skills as hunter, rarely need food or water as leveling (most Mana is used for utility and kiting) other than feeding pet.  The bag space and ammo balances it out cost wise.  Not to mention never really having to repair.  My 55 hunter has been super efficient and easy to grind money on.  If I wasn't spending the money to boost my warrior up at the same time, I might end up with enough for an epic mount when he hits 60.
---
You responded to someone asking why you even need frostbolt on your bars with    
---
1) Lockout: he has frost spells on the bar    
---
2) Range: the only one here that could pose a problem. There are 30yd spells on that bar, leaving an unknown zone of 3-6yds     
---
3) mana cost: not everyone is going to play like this, but an experienced player, esp a pvper should know thier mana costs. You think a good mage doesn't know the cost of their frostbolt? As a druid I know before I pop out of form that I have enough mana for natures grasp, the heal I want, and going back into form. I don't know the exact cost of every single spell on my bar but I know what mana I need for certain plans and I 100% know critical costs like 684 and 249 for my shape shifts    
---
4) It's preference: I never said it was an ideal UI which is what you're going at in this response, I said the reasons you gave for not having frostbolt on your UI aren't really neccessary reasons
---
A good story always begins in tragedy 😁
---
I never said that...but thank you
---
He is kinda different. I dont know if he will understand.
---
I'm talking about leveling and soloing though, not raiding.
---
Frostbite has a chance to root the enemy and it prcs Shatter for dem THICC crits.

Ok Mitch
---
I used to drink when I played wow on the weekends but for some reason I can't keep going now, so after getting to a certain point I hop over to madden turn on rookie mode and throw for 600 yards and 10 TDs a game lol
---
Any low end budget computer made in the last 5 years can run classic on ultra
---
I couldn't play wow on a laptop keyboard. Lol
---
Nothing that will do it automatically (outside bots), but in TSM you can start a sniper scan, so someone sitting at their desk running a sniper scan would have seen that pop up as soon as you posted it so long as it fit the rules of their scan, and then they could buy it right away and repost.
---
Most likely it was that.
---
I love T1 Hunter armor. Fuck the stats and set bonuses I’m all bout the world of fashionceaft.
---
First question....do you already have a pc? If so I suggest the new dell g5. I think it runs around $1200 US dollars. But I'f you dont have a pc, I suggest building one before getting a gaming laptop.
---
Laena sounds like anal backwards to me, thanks internet
---
Mine spammed 'WEAK' when people left.
---
It became annoying very quick.  They invited anyone with a pulse and quite a few without one, so I always wondered why they had such high expectation for the quality of their members.
---
Anything
---
Totally sell them. Defense raiting was overrated back in the day and valor shoulders are incredibly easy to get. 600 gold for a new 60 warrior is insanely good.
---
Wow... that was actually refreshing.  I haven't been a fan, and I don't enjoy his online persona, but that meta self-analysis was unexpectedly pleasant.  Some people are complex, multi-layered, creatures, and it seems Zach certainly is.  Thanks for this insightful video.
---
Don't do that. She will get addicted and u will lose her
---
There is an add on to play WoW with gamepad, you could check it out, maybe it works with streaming too.
---
You're fucking delusional the recipe is heavily overvalued on auction since it drops very often from a raid mages still want two other bis pieces from
---
Sounds super annoying, having to alt tab to have a conversation in discord tbh.
---
Hey, honestly don't buy weapons or anything off the AH if you want to be well-off financially. You should find good-enough gear from quest rewards and dungeon drops as you go. Check out "How To Afford Your Mount Straight At Level 40!" By Punkrat on YouTube for more money saving strategies
---
frost bolt has the same range as poly which is on the bar, unless specced into it in which it has a small 3-6 yd increase. That being said, it's not something really used in this fight.    
---
And silence, you only need 1 frost spell on your UI to know if you're locked out of frost bolt
---
Twohanded weapons are often seen as offspec  PVE and thus, paladins and shaman healers have the same priority.
---
Only 2h fury warriors and hunters are mainspec to some 2h weapons
---
feel free to take it with you
---
Your hate fuels me! I will be adding a few more accounts when the RaF returns.

Is this the guy that blows into a horn and yells "SHIP IT!"?

What's the best polearm at end-game? I like the aesthetics of them.
---
Yeah its bugged right now i think
---
What is batching?
---
Lmao dude get out of here with that shit
---
🤢🤢🤢
---
No, he expected it to work like priest MC where you WASD control your target while your own character remains defenseless, like priest MC or Eyes of the Beast for hunters.
---
Alright man, you’re gonna wanna go to the grocery store, preferably a Kroger or Aldi. You’re gonna want to buy two russet potatoes. One’s to install WoW on, the other is in case you get hungry while you wait. WoW should run fine on any old potato, but in my experience russet potatoes are the best bang for your buck.
---
This is satire, obviously. The older client should run alright on most computers with decade-relevant specs.
---
Leveling them  aint the worst part. Worst part is tanking with dpsers who dont give a F if you got the aggro
---
I have a 1500 laptop bought 5 years ago and it struggles
---
My guild didnt even help me with cyclonus what the hell
---
Literally though it's like...Greed is a gold icon.  
---
Need means you're going to use it. It's implicit, but these idiots over analyze shit to justify shitty behaviour.
---
Agreed 100%. Even things like reading quest text, taking time to really read your abilities, taking time to look around and figure out how to move, how to position your fingers. All that stuff is easier when there is zero time pressure. When you're grouping with someone else, there is some pressure to do something other than stand next to a quest giver for a minute, and then spend a minute trying to figure out what all of the buttons do.
---
For PvP I would personally use daggers
---
Razer is going over the board with these new mousepad designs.
---
Same boat here. No wonders theres a lack of tanks, grabbing aggro on trigger happy dpsers is impossible. Im having a better life as a pally tank honestly
---
Piff. She won't last. WOW fucking sucks. WOW has sailed away from it's prime a long time ago, it sucked only a little bit less then. She wouldn't have given a shit about it then either. Get another hobby that she will actually enjoy doing with you.
---
Majestic mount I love mechano striders.
---
I'm 99% sure you just have it disabled in your UI - some of them probably automatically disable it for classes that are not hunters and warlocks.  
---
    
---
You can hotkey the pet bar commands as well, which by default are ctrl1-5 iirc.
---
Same, this is especially true as a druid
---
powershift and my mana is gone in 3 times, would be better to keep it and hurricane
---
She does threat resets on fireballs, or threat dumps. It's not with the start of p3
---
I remember it happened a lot in vanilla. PSA for people new to single servers... you end up running into a lot of the same people. Don’t ruin your chance to progress by getting a bad rep and not getting into groups.
---
Im new and im a rogue. Please explain
---
Literally what you were asking though and if not you left it wide open for interpretation.
---
Its kinda rough on my hunter. Stand in that 20 yard range to see the name plates for easy target swapping, the tank moved the mobs and inch closer to you, deadzone baby.
---
Thats the Spirit!
---
Nah, it just removed 1 impairing effect wich can just be reapplied. You should be carrying a stack of FAPS for that.
---
Dwarf is BIS for pvp alliance side
---
Bloodfang was on high at peak h yesterday
---
Some guilds will force you to spend dkp to counter hoarding and items going to waste.
---
In a perfect world the system forces you to take lesser upgrades instead of hoarding for mageblade, for example, and letting other upgrade pieces go to waste.
---
But as in this situation, it was used poorly to force a downgrade just because he didn't have the item yet.  It sounds like they also had a minimum bid price for items too, which prevented him from just bidding 1 dkp (or maybe the margin for that dagger really was 1 dkp).
---
I can understand the issue of people passing on upgrades just because they want to save for the rarer upgrade, but there are probably better ways to solve it than just forcing people to buy stuff at X minimum price.
---
" also having shit happen that shouldn't really is annoying too." Thats the thing, it should happen in vanilla
---
Updooted.
---
This will be a great experience for her. The feeling of just starting is amazing!
---
Does this boss always drop 3 bits of loot?
---
Ok just remember to feed the baby!
---
The joke isnt funny if I have to explain it D:
---
If you enjoy the systems in retail then go back to retail? Personal loot is one of the many things that killed interaction in wow
---
I suspect someone going for karma copying a comment.
---
Are you on a pve realm?
---
Horde or alliance doesn’t matter too much., but it does affect where you quest. If you’re on a PvP server, you’ll probably start to resent the other faction after getting killed while questing, but it’s all in good fun. I’ve seen popular streamers who have a main on one faction, and an alternate character on another. 
---
Server-wise, you want a happy medium. If it’s too full, like the “Twitch” server Faerlina, you may have to deal with wait times to get in. If it’s a low population server, you may find that you can’t get groups together very easily for dungeons or good end-game raid groups. 
---
For choosing a race, pick something that benefits the class you want to choose. Racial passives/ abilities tend to guide people into picking a certain race. Tauren hunters are not as widely seen as an Orc or Troll hunter for instance. It doesn’t matter too much, but pick what feels right. 
---
*Spec = specialization. Each class has 3 specs to choose from starting at level ten, but usually only 1 or 2 are viable options for leveling.*
---
Only Alliance can be Paladins, only Horde can he Shamans. Paladins are slow to level, but are very versatile in a group and are beloved by most. Shamans are kind of a meme, but can be fun and always help the party they’re in. 
---
Hunter is probably the fastest leveler, but some find them boring and pet management can be daunting in a dungeon since your pet may accidentally get the attention of monsters who your group is not quite ready to fight. 
---
Do you prefer being up in the monsters face or at a distance? This may dictate whether you go for a melee class vs a ranged class (Like a rogue or warrior vs a mage or warlock). 
---
There is a LOT to this game. Like a whole bunch. You can research for hours, but another thing to consider is your roll in a group. 
---
Damage per second classes (DPS) are things like Rogue, Mage, Warlock, Hunter, and warrior/paladin/priest to some extent. 
---
Tanks have the ability to maintain aggro (keeping the monsters attention) but do less damage. The roll of a tank in a dungeon is more difficult than DPS, and have to be more involved, making sure the healer isn’t pulling aggro and getting hit. 
---
A healer, for the most part, can still do DPS. I’ve been in groups where a Shadow Priest (a spec chosen to make leveling easier as they do more damage) start off as DPS, but changed to being the healer after the main healer had to leave. 
---
Tanks and healers are the most sought after, so forming a group is easier if you’re on of the two. However, tanks and healers (warriors/paladins/druids and paladins/priests/shamans respectively) tend to level slower. 
---
Anyway, do some research and find what best suits you!
---
Sorry to hear that.  Give tanking another try.  Remember, in Classic in dungeons, the 1 class they can't afford to upset or annoy is the tank.  You are assured of getting an invite to any group in about 30 seconds when you are signed on.  While they have to wait sometimes hours to do a dungeon.
---
Fuck off. It's 15 dollars
---
If you didn't disagree then you shouldn't have contradicted what I said, doofus. 
---
"He does. I find most of his advice fully applicable. I feel like you are only thinking about his 1 fury prot tanking video. Sure, that's a pretty exclusive video."
---
You're now backpedaling off of this. 
---
I'll say it again. Skarm's advice is of little to no use for tanking 5 mans. That will be all. He can tell you all about what it's like to raid with full world buffs, killing bosses in 30 seconds alongside people who have been playing for 15 years. But he doesn't tell you anything about being level 46 in mauradon and dealing with DPS who don't know what they're really doing.
---
Damn, if only you had put on master loot only the relevant classes could have rolled fairly.
---
.... You said you can't play. Money is tight. Can anyone help out? 
---
What exactly were you trying to say if it wasn't asking for a donation? You'd have had a much better chance at getting help if you just came right out and asked.
---
No he's fuckin joking
---
In UBRS? I see this shit happen in SM groups all the time, people try to be slick and put it on Master Loot right before we reach the end boss, but as the tank I just refuse to pull or kill myself so we wipe until it's changed back.
---
Horde and Alliance has an equal amount of children.
---
Saying "If you're an adult go X faction" shows that you are actually not an adult :( at least not mentally.
---
Congratulations man. Experiencing wow for the first time is great. You'll probably remember this for a long time.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL--teiBbzQ&amp;t=211s
---
well you made the claim that pservers had3k max players, when they indeed had over 14k online whilst fights like this happened with minimal lag (aka huge server size). We don't know concurrent player numbers, but it feels like 10-15k concurrent per server. Aka comparable.   
---
Instead of arguing against my counter argument you are deflecting by claiming that the fact that they have 50x more servers make any difference, rather than sticking to your original argument (which is false btw). 
---
pserver player numbers: [https://vanillaradar.com/lightshope-stats/](https://vanillaradar.com/lightshope-stats/)  go lifetime and look for yourself. 
---
and just to clarify, my reason for claiming classic server cap feels like 15k is based on how cluttered the world is feeling compared to pserver numbers. 2 - layer servers might be 25-30k
---
It has nothing to do with lag. It is a bug that can be easily reproduced by anyone.
---
How to reproduce: Have a friend barely out of sight. As soon as you can see him, tell him via voice to turn 180 degrees. 
---
This works better in certain zones (un'goro for example) and is a server-client-communication problem and thus blizzards fault, not the player' fault.
---
but the point remains, they feel very comparrable on my end.
---
No minimum attack range for ranged weapons -.-
---
Damn, I really should have got into skinning as a profession...
---
way to completely miss the point doofus...
---
Lmaooo
---
Let’s say you bought the mats to make 100 masks. It takes 30.5 seconds to craft each mask, resulting in 51 minutes of crafting.
---
* Bolt of Mageweave=20s
---
* Heavy silken thread=18s
---
* Bleach=22c
---
Total cost for 100 masks: 38.22g
---
Total price when selling to vendor: 43.65g
---
**Profit from vendoring: 5.43g In \~55 minutes**
---
DE mat prices right now on Shazzrah:
---
* Vision dust (75% chance for 2-5) =5s
---
* Lesser nether essence (20% chance for 1-2)=70s
---
* Small radiant shard (5% chance for 1)=2g
---
DE mats acquired from 100 masks:
---
* Vision dust: (75x3.5)= 263x5s= 13.15g
---
* Lesser nether essence: (20x1.5)= 30x70s= 21g
---
* Small radiant shard: 5x2g=10g
---
Total value of mats from disenchanting: 44.15g
---
**Profit from selling mats on AH: 5.93g in \~60+ minutes** (**assuming every item sells + not including AH sale delay timer of 60 minutes)**
---
TL;DR: It’s likely that you will make more money disenchanting and selling the mats, but according to the current prices on Shazzrah, you’d only get \~50 silver extra. Maybe up to 1.5g if you get lucky with the Mageweave, but in my opinion that’s not worth it because you’d have to rely on all the mats to sell and it would take much longer than simply vendoring them.
---
Yeah seems not great on Warrior but my Warlock stomped em lol, I had a good time selling those
---
Edit typo
---
You can go 1-60 with arms and tank dungeons with a 2h, later levels will require a 1h and shield swap during the pulls though because they will hurt more. 
---
 Tanking while arms will let you do massive aoe damage which in turn generates massive threat which is perfect for tanking. Really starts to shine at level 30 (sweeping strikes) -&gt; level 36 (whirlwind). 
---
 Protection is not worth speccing into at all until 60 unless you dont care about damage/speed. I find that if you are specced prot while leveling you will have more survivability but take 2x as long to kill mobs which in turn cancels out the survivability gained bc the mob is hitting you 2x as long.
---
Arms will also let you pull more than one mob at a time and burst them down faster than protection can kill one mob.
---
 All in all play the way you want but if you care about speed/efficiency i highly recommend leveling as arms, and as explained above it will not detriment your dungeon effectiveness at all, most likely improve it because you and your party will clear even faster if you are dealing  good damage as well. Best of luck!
---
You still make more money off their drops. skinning tho will add a few extra silver per kill tho
---
Some of the pre bis items will be worse than just int stam gear, the health and mana is more valuable to aoe grinding than spell damage
---
Warlocks can farm Maraudon for about the same amount of gold/hour.
---
Lol, NS + AR. The memes write themselves. “He just...disappeared”
---
It’s so hard to find groups for lower level dungeons like gnomer, GY and stockades. In lfg channels it’s mostly just end game dungeons. Is everyone that ahead?
---
Oh yeah, love Honest Trailer epic voice man
---
Thanks!
---
A friend of mine was excited to introduce his wife to WoW but she spent the majority of the time... fishing. Found it relaxing after her high pressure work days.
---
a] you kill mobs twice as fast, taking half the damage, so it's more efficient to group up.
---
b] if your partner gets his 50 ears first, you can loot ears from his kills after he loots, so its more efficient to group up.
---
It's for Show Your Work to get your Gnomish Engineering Card.
---
edit: derp, I see you mention this one but its the only quest for it.
---
Nice, my GF is the same, let her pick what she wanted and also rolled Tauren Hunter, so I've rolled Tauren Druid and she's happy to have a cat AND and "Bear pet protector". We've been very slowly but happily smashing stuff around Mulgore and the barrens, and She's particularly enjoyed being able to skin and create new gear for us. We're just about ready to try out RFC so that should be interesting!
---
Im chaffed by your attitude. Of course I'm sensitive.
---
I play with my wife for 15 years, the laughs we’ve had...
---
Idk about those turtles but they have good loot in general, a lot of people farm the ones in Tanaris
---
Well sorry that a priest then needs on your ravager , because you see vendoring it for gild is still better for the priest that giving that random warrior a weapon he wants. Doesnt matter if you are in that dungeon for the ravager. You didnt mention it in the start of the dungeon
---
Well I guess we know who the real bitch is. 
---
You!
---
Yeah no you cant contest facts scrub. I love seeing warlocks who wasted time leveling to 60 get passed up for slots
---
It's the same concept of hunting and killing a deer to feed yourself and/or your friends. You could easily use the money you spent hunting to buy some quality prime beef, but the fact that you got the meat yourself is "fun" for some people.
---
I know not everyone feels that way, but some people do.

---
What about this one? 40 man raid in ultra mode? CSGO on max settings?
---
So are mods going to let low effort shitposts go through now?
---
I'm laughing so hard right now. I just read this out loud to my fiance who refuses to try playing wow with me.
---
Most, barrens. Lots of quests and levels. I've done it so many times it felt so much longer than the rest, even if it wasn't technically the most time. Least, elwynn/westfall/dun moroh all at never entered.
---
You mean has a job or kids right? Because I got neither and tons of money/time to play WoW with.
---
Hmm, I agree on it being a 3 cost talent but I definitely think it is worth it as you may need instant health boosts multiple times while tanking. More specifically during raids so it's important to know what they plan on doing.
---
Best advice I can give is just let her explore. At its basic lvl someone can just explore and enjoy it by seeing the sights. Even at low levels. If you are inclined to go higher levels make and alt. Let that woman just do her thing take the time to have fun. And if its not fun just get her spore and move on.
---
aka "evil morty theme" :P
---
In an open field, Ned!
---
If the tank took a few seconds before generating any aoe threat, would those HoTs pull aggro off the side-mobs?
---
Mine played for almost 10 minutes, said they didn't like it and then quit! 
---
Good luck
---
So the other four people in the group should pass on an item they helped the other one get just to satisfy his/her weird rp nonsense?
---
/r/wellthatsucks
---
Beaver man is literally the biggest loser in classic wow
---
Yes. Can't remember how much but yes.
---
I get to use whatever insult I want, nerd.
---
*non-ironic* Zug-zug
---
I play the game on a 6 year old macbook pro (15” 4gb vram) and it runs on Ultra @60fps. 
---
Inb4 the downvotes, thats my work computer and no point in buying another one when this works fine.
---
I lost it on the 2nd parry
---
I use this in BRD to activate that big cogwheel thing at the beginning of an angerforge run without having to kill the surrounding mobs. Useful if you don't have a Rogue.
---
You mean the Underground Bandit Revenge Ship? It’s UBRS.
---
your autos are a majority of your dps. its definitely good to increase them, at least as rogue. I'm not as experienced with warrior theorycrafting.
---
&gt;It's really just lazy pos warriors that want to get handheld through content
---
Or theyre like a warrior  in my guild who has done 50+ runs and lost every roll for HoJ. 
---
He only wants to group with casters now.
---
Run into a large pack of enemies. They follow, you vanish.
---
Lmao @ describing having to look at pictures of a screen as "precisely destructive". Get a grip bud.
---
ok, thank you! :)
---
"They called me a fucking blueberry!"
---
I dug deep into the thread to say this as well.
---
BWEEE BWEEE BWEEE someone doesn't blindly love classic! Quick accuse them of being "retail players"!
---
I want to make an alt too
---
Burning is super far away though.
---
holy hell i didnt know we hVe purple raptors here...T_T well, its too late to think about it, sadly. I wish i farmed reputation for it from the start of the game :( it looks awesome.
---
This is a login queue though, not a realm queue. Full realms wouldn’t affect login queues?
---
I’ve seen these login queues when Blizz has issues and a large amount of players get DC’d, and they all try to log back in at once.
---
If you choose to reroll, think twice about committing to a healer. On my server healers have a harder time finding groups than most DPS.
---
I failed as well.
---
Yeah, I found that the water nearer booty Bay would spawn wreckage that gave mithril lockboxes when fished, which seem to have a few more goods when opened. Wreckage nearer the from gol side of STV give iron lockboxes, which still are not to be ignored. 
---
Lots of mageweave/runecloth bolts which fetch a tidy sum at my AH (Gandling Horde).
---
Added bonus I've fished up 12 slot bags.
---
You'll get the occasional green too.
---
I'm glad somebody got my shitpost.
---
That's why I said fuck it and equipped dual-wield. I might miss more, but it phases me less because missing on a 2h is a lot more damage than a 1h and DW just looks cooler.
---
I'd be doing that too, but also pissed that some rando guild officers forced me to spend dkp on an item that was a downgrade. That's some shit lol
---
I'd have that guild on blast too. It'd be known what went down
---
I'm the same. I hit 40g and level 40.ran to the stable with a big smile only to grimace at the real price. :(
---
You can’t be that picky if your asking for a vote. Pick a name, you’re gonna see it a lot
---
no its not lol.. robes of volatile power are way better than t1 chest
---
I mean just kite them? U take like half the damage overall
---
Every time it doesn’t sell you’re losing *more* money though. 
---
You’re not only paying to have an item listed during hours when almost no one is playing but you’re also locking your item in to one price for that entire time. Shorter listings mean your price can adapt to the market (i.e. you’re not SOL for 23 more hours when someone immediately undercuts you).
---
Fishing, my dude.  I can make around 50-70g an hour just fishing, so I do that.
---
Berserker Rage -&gt; Battle Stance -&gt; Charge in -&gt; Thunderclap -&gt; Defensive Stance -&gt; Demoralising Shout -&gt; Sunder on Skull, then X etc. 
---
Berserker Rage gives you extra rage from initial attacks on you. Of course you can just bloodrage after changing into Def Stance. 
---
I usually pop a taunt as soon as a mob turns around and then ignore it (don’t bother building more threat) if it’s going to die from dps in the taunt’s duration.
---
Getting thorns aura and/or a shield spike helps. 
---
If the mobs don’t hit super hard sometimes I’ll just charge in and do a whirlwind instead of thunderclap (requires the stance dancing rage retention talents).
---
With a mage(s) in group freezing things. All you wonna do is try drag the mobs towards the edge of the blizzard farthest from the mage/group. Especially taunting the one at the front of the pack (running at group when you inevitably lose aggro)  then sunder spamming the others. Disarm is also useful if you cannot drag one, or mocking blow.
---
Ohh my God ... It's just a videogame streamer. People watch it for entertainment.
---
&gt; When said person isn't qualified in the field
---
It's just a guy playing WoW, watching and commenting on WoW-related videos ... And so what if he shares his opinion? Why does someone sharing their opinion somehow have to equate to adopting it? Does a lawyer who comes home from a long day of work and plops down in her couch to watch some Temptation Island adopt the contestants' opinion on relationships and fidelity? No. She's just looking to turn off her brain and be entertained. Same goes for streamers. Watching Asmongold doesn't somehow mean you can't think for yourself.
---
You people take this wayyy too seriously. Just insufferable.
---
Try going outside once in a while. There's a lot of stuff worth worrying about out there. Whether some neckbeard shares the same opinion as you on a 15 year old MMO, is not one of them.
---
Yeah that was such a garbage zone in Cata.  Easily the worst zone which says a lot.
---
He's such a prick.
---
Take your upvote sir!
---
Great, that makes sense thanks
---
As a warlock leveling, how many soul shards should I keep on me at any given time?
---
So it's not like a farm to just get into a raid?
---
I just wanna hop on a raid for a 3-4 hours and be done with it. That possible?
---
Which mount is that expensive?
---
Fuck them kids
---
I suspect Royson borrowed money from Asmon to buy his epic mount and then handed over the same pair of gloves. And I'm not sure Quin ever gave the gloves to the guy. He might have wanted the gold himself.
---
Getting the first mount is the best!
---
Btw I already had a Diablo themed UI but decided urs was cooler so I  downloaded ur addonlist, if you don't mind me asking, you don't happen to know how to change the target unitframes to maybe look more like the players unitframe, like with a picture of the player and thicker HP/mana bars. Either way ty for sharing.
---
"Online experience not rated"   Parents need to learn to parent.
---
Kida are more evil than the adults.
---
I used to play on Skywall and then Blackrock. Skywall it was pretty 50/50, but on Blackrock rolling need on BOEs was standard. To be fair Blackrock was 'that' kind of server, but I loved it. 
---
I don't consider it 'shitty people' because I'm more than happy to buy and trade BOEs. The way I see it if a valuable BOE drops the luck shouldn't just be that one happened to drop for your specific class/build, everyone should have an even chance at being lucky. 
---
I'm fine with people having different opinions, more power to you if you and you're group decide someone has more of a right to something they specifically can use, but it doesn't make people who think that selling a boe is just as justified 'shitty people'.
---
Yup, if you're kiting, you need to be on point with the autos because one stun cascades into losing 20 yards , which is at least another 2 boulders.
---
2/2 pathfinding helps a lot. Spirit bond helps a lot (see below). 
---
If you've lost distance run into the inner 'lip' of the circle.
---
When boulder casts step into the water. This LoSes princess, which cancels the boulder cast and gains you maybe 10 yards.
---
Prioritise getting to 41 yards over dps and you'll get there.
---
Finally, with the kite method, hotkey your pet follow and pet stay.
---
Use pet stay to trigger Princess into casting her fart aura, recall pet, turn and get 2-3 autos and a rank 1 multi off. Spirit bond will keep your pet relatively healthy for the few ticks it will take. 
---
Do NOT use arcane shot or serpent sting (duh).
---
This is the best way to do it as a fresh 60.
---
Once you have 3 pc T1 you can use the pet tank method with Aspect of the Wild, since you can heal from a great distance and your mana bar is that much more meaningful. 
---
Even easier with 5 pc: 
---
120+30+60 nature res for 210 means it can eat the full nature AoE easily instead of having to recall it and losing your max distance.
---
Seething
---
&gt;But the wow devs in 2005 were basically all horde, as horde flags lined the corporate office, so it's to be expected I guess. 
---
Cry more
---
I agree, OP needs to close the doors, take a closer look at the picture...that face
---
Yeah, you've faced worse enemies.
---
Hopefully your wife wont leave you and inevitably make you sell that awesome system. Good luck!
---
Parents should be aware of what their kids are doing. That's why there's an age minimum in the tos and a profanity filter. If someone is glueing a five year old to wow and leaving and the kid somehow manages to get into a situation where his feelings get hurt, then that's on the parent. People need to actually parent their children.
---
Oh god, oh man...
---
Why are they 9g a piece in mine? I just purchased 10 of those for my epic cloth chest and i had to sell a kidney.
---
I'm having the same issue I thought it was just my old outdated PC.
---
No wonder he keeps comin' back!
---
One-handed playing leaves a lot of time for rubbing.
---
Look at the essay you wrote. Look at how much effort is involved when including a woman.\\
---
Absolutely insanity.
---
60-100g? Nice bullshit. I’d say you get max 30g an hour.
---
I agree
---
PvP gear generally isn't that similar to your PvE setup. You're going to have to do a bit of farming both ways but generally PvE armor has a lot less completion for it. 
---
You'll often be prioritize cooldowns and Stam, then generic hit, and finally things like Frost damage and crit. 
---
For example as a mage the nether wind set is pretty nice as between like 3 pieces you can get 500 extra hp at the cost of not too much spell damage since you need generic spell damage and not only Frost. 
---
PvP in classic is really gear dependent and you'll be putting in a decent amount of time getting setup regardless of what class you pick. There's really no avoiding it honestly. You can do slightly better as a poorly geared mage/rogue but you'll still get smacked aside vs geared players. Gear is just too important.
---
FD so pet gets aggro, but hunter combat resets? Hmm that immo damage not sounding too bad.
---
You'll get a 12 slot soul bag, just keep that filled.
---
As a 55 warrior who frequents arathi and has helped 25+ warriors both alliance and horde achieve their axe...just go get rockbiter. Its way easier.
---
Isn't heroic strike much higher when you have enough rage. Skarm (prominent warrior) said to basically spam this or cleave if you have the ressources, because decent damage and decent threat.
---
&gt;Look at the essay you wrote. Look at how much effort is involved when including a woman.\\  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Absolutely insanity.
---
Doesn't it get boring knowing exactly where everything is? Where's the adventure and discovery? Idk man. It doesn't make sense to me to complain about retail being too easy and then go into classic with a hand-holding guide.
---
I wouldn't let it happen
---
Holy shit. You could apply this to anything in a relationship. Good man. Still married I’d imagine.
---
Funny enough a group of my buddies tested this at lvl 60 with no gear on and actually found that only 32/100 Stuns were resisted. Which seemed totally within a margin of error to what the tooltip actually suggest.
---
Ok and your post is what, based on hard proof?
---
It MAYBE made sense watching streams to fill the void on the beta phase since we couldn’t play. But to watch his streams now???
---
I picked up Engineering and mining.. can I ditch mining once I max ENG and choose tailoring instead?
---
Where to level at 52? Not sure if I should go to ungoro or blasted lands. Or if there is somewhere else better.. anyone know?
---
The actual battlezone is hinterlands ghost mushroom cave. Around 3 muhsrooms spawn every 15 minutes so there is no sharing.
---
Imagine the type of person that does this lol.
---
I met my partner by walking up a random toon in Orgrimmer and striking up conversation. Had never seen him before and we were even on different realms, just happened to be layered together in Org. We spoke all-night and it turned out we lived close irl and here we are, almost 3 years later, we are living together still playing wow.
---
Edit: spelling. Damn phone.
---
Thanks for all this stuff but show calcs on 100g per hour. Thank you.
---
great advice,  as someone who failed getting friends who are gamers into the games I love this could not be more true,  
---
I'd like to add that op believes this is going to be the best fun he's had in ages, but it's not.
---
it's going to be very frustrating and take a lot of restraint to watch your partner fail at every turn, but remember that was what made your first experience so fun. just be patient and have a few beers to drink while you wait and watch the magic happen. 
---
good luck and I hope you both have a great time.
---
Fuck off
---
What a cool shot
---
What fish are you aiming for?
---
Have you considered not being a rogue?
---
God dammit this is too cute
---
What class are you? If mage, aoe ZF gy or fire spec Princess in Maraudon. Lock, Priest, and hunter can do Maraudon too, even easier. No competition in instances.
---
yeah it’s in relation to party members :)
---
Lennyface
---
This is cute.
---
He can? Thats some lax policy
---
I lead around 50 ubrs run before getting my skinning knife (which was reserved) and no one ever had any complains. Just lead your own groups.
---
But did he get her number?
---
You can but what do you need tailoring for? I would advice getting tailoring first because you get so much cloth from leveling that you can do it as you go.
---
i think the only reason this is in the game was for the unarmoured epic mounts that we dont even have access to in classic.   cause i think they remained boe after the system changed, though i could be wrong but this is the only thing i can think of
---
Now you just need to find While, One, and Fork
---
FWIW I tanked Ony tonight for a pug as arms with mostly threat gear (Voones, Deathdealer, Windrunners) and had no issues.
---
If the parent let's their child play an online game known for alight elitism and shit talking, then it's on the parent. Like. This is the same thing when people said this for fps games. Theyre known for being competitive and shit talking. 
---
Not to mention the animosity between factions in classic is something completely different from any other game (including retail).
---
Wtf I eat 1 10mg dose and I'm on the moon.
---
What interaction? That a caster can roll need and win a 2h weapon then sell it to the vendor for a few gold while the melee guy got shafted and has to continue to suffer with his bad weapon?
---
Or that some asshole can just ninja a rare drop item that he again can't use and just vendors it while some guy spent 50+ runs in a dungeon for it and now has to do it again?
---
Sound argument there. Just typing out "go back to retail, classic wow had it right all along" doesn't make it so and doesn't mask the fact that classic has a lot of problems that got tweaked and fixed and should be recognised as such.
---
Is it satire? 
---
the use of humour, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.
---
PoLiTiCs
---
Can't he just play paladin
---
Fishing nub here about to level it on my near max main (mage). Care to share advice on making money fishing? Are you hunting for wreckage, essences, cooking? What sells?
---
It should be, but this isn't what people are reporting is happening. As they are contacting CS and they are leaving it locked for the month regardless
---
In these cases it's an amazing idea to think like a woman. Since both are quite equal, take the one that looks the best.
---
you sir, are better man than me.
---
Yes but we all should consider that a bunch of kids are playing...
---
Haha, air was the only farm that actually went well for me, I got like 5 or 6 in 2 hrs but bought nearly all the rest
---
lol ur mature ya?
---
Princess Runs
---
I got flamed last night for doing this, rogue called me a "cancerous fuck" and apparently people like me are what's wrong with the world. 
---
Promptly told him that he should get some sun and have a shower. And mabey shave off that rank neckbeard.
---
Tyvm!
---
Isn't it great when all your opponents are made out of straw?
---
Gonna be a big no from me chief.
---
I made a troll mage as my main specifically so I could run around Azeroth high af
---
Did he know that was the car goin in?
---
"Guys he resisted my HOJ that's why I died, I totally had him" -(OP's "notes")
---
"Yeah same, that's why we died too" - (Allies confirmation)
---
*- OP and friends after a failed ganking attempt*
---
Embarrassing, no proof or significant sample size.
---
Half the people i knew playing wow was not a gamer. Wow as a thesisms/habbo/clubpenguin/secondlife prospective it is very effective, later when they get involved they start to pve and some pvp.
---
Literally saying don’t bully people that’s it damn y’all need to chill and grow up no wonder so many people are saying this community is toxic. I’m honestly so ashamed of this stupid subreddit and these responses. The point of this game is to have fun.
---
I usually fish for Essence of Water from the pools in the Bay of Storms in Azshara.  Essences usually sell from between 10-15g each.  Also if i just wanna be lazy, I just go to Hinterlands and fish up Nightfin Snapper and turn those into Nightfin Soups which I generally sell @ around 3g per stack of 5.
---
After watching preach's drama time for a few years.... this is not a good idea lol.
---
Let that be a lesson to ye
---
That's moronic. The amount of times auctions are gonna fail to sell because you listed them during quiet hours is going to eat your profits.
---
You should always be prepared to slow the pace on dps in classic. Threat meters were mandatory back then for a reason :)
---
Flight to TB is excellent for some IRL time. You can prepare food, take a bio break or even a quick shower. And when you get back, you are in the middle of the continent, at the most beautiful part of Azeroth.
---
I can accept that at lvl 60 it's not that benefical for some, but as a leveling alternative its superior.
---
Just a warning to anyone thinking mods weren't power hungry babies on that sub.
---
the use of irony, sarcasm, ridicule, or the like, in exposing, denouncing, or deriding vice, folly, etc.
---
Looking up definitions is hard but wow, it’s as if they can vary.
---
Has anyone mentioned the Big Bang Theory, 'The Barbarian sublimation'? :)
---
Had half a ZF party leave when I was farming in cat form in front of instance. "lvl 42 and not even rest spec forget it"
---
I think telling them I heal with downranked healing touch and 5 more levels would be irrelevant to my healing ability didn't help either.
---
Awesome advice! :)
---
What a fucking worthless comment that does not add to the discussion at all
---
I believe bloodhoof village has both a skinning and leatherworking trainer.
---
I have fun by swearing.
---
If you want a specific item, you make your own party and reserve it, making sure you get it in case it drops. Nobody is making you join the groups if it bothers you.
---
"Oh, have I told you about MOTHER?"
---
"Whose mother?"

"The Matron Of Tenacity, Herald of Endless Research"

"Interesting how the second 'of' didn't factor into her name..."

"RIGHT?!?"
---
Another fake story
---
This is so great! My bf was hyped when classic came out again and introduced me to it, I had never played WoW before and I enjoyed it so much I progressed to retail and now I play more than him lmao

See, that post wasn't fun.

Clean your keyboard bro
---
Having something you want to do with your time when you wake up in the morning is a huge deal for addiction. WoW coming back has been a big deal in my life also. Drive and thinking about the future also have a huge effect, starting a guild was probably a very smart move. Good luck!
---
Shadow priest here, get whispers all the time from ppl who did /who lol, and i do just mainly heal dungeons anyway. Dps is boring bc i oom in seconds, but still will stay shadow. Played it since 07
---
https://youtu.be/ztVMib1T4T4
---
35 here aswell..
---
A quick browse through your history shows pretty much just you calling stories fake and getting downvoted. You alright bro?
---
Bloodhoof villiage, yep - It's pretty much the only primary professions that you don't have to go all the way to TB for I think
---
I bet Chris Hansen is a predator.
---
Who knows what this player's preferences are. They could enjoy both retail and classic.
---
I honestly don't think you'll find anyone who's put as much work into finding out their average dps at that level as you have. Google isn't going to have these answers because rather than study their low level dps, they're trying to hit 60. Nobody cares at that level since upgrades come often and talents are all over the place. 
---
Rogues are meant to fight mobs the same level or lower than them or else you wind up missing a lot and getting killed. If you're too lazy to go to a different zone, and you'd rather fight mobs 2 levels higher, you're only hurting your leveling pace, since you're massively reducing your exp rate, and by the time you killed however many mobs in your higher level zone, you could have moved to another zone and killed twice as many.
---
Your rotation is fine. Once you have sword specialization, try to time your ss and evis after a hit of the mainhand autoattack. That's about it for damage increases outside of gear, and that one will probably not even be noticeable.
---
What a shit guild you're in that makes their tanks pay for consumables or have to buy their own. 
---
Don't ask for gold to tank, it's a shit thing to do, this isn't retail.
---
The prices for consumables are only what they are for you because your guildies cannot be arsed to farm and make them for fellow guildies for free (especially and at least for their tanks and healers).
---
This is the easy version of MC and Ony in Classic, not Vanilla hard versions and apart from health and mana pots for emergencies, even fucking fire protections are a waste of time and gold, never mind flasks.
---
I tank on my Druid for pugs running Ang and then we hop into Arena on the way out, I don't need anything at all but everyone wants those dps trinkets from Anger especially, even had the epic chest drop a few times for the hunters from Arena.
---
Simply all I ask is that they pass on shit they don't need and let me greed it to help pay for repairs and some extra gold for my time. All are happy with it, nobody complains, everyone wins and I make a lot of gold in the process. 
---
If it helps, just do stealth runs to Anger, only invite Druids and Rogues, do it all much faster. Druids want the Tanking and DPS trinkets, Rogues want the DPS one, works out well for you as tank because that fucking axe and chest seems to drop 90% of the time from Anger anyway.
---
You are incredibly sad hahah, how about you just live your life
---
Killsbrad.
---
Up to level 40 I quested without the addon, but I felt really lost all the time and without direction, just aimlessly wandering between the continents looking for something that's within my level not really committing to anything. Questie really helped with pointing me in the right direction
---
Good luck with RFC! This sounds similar to the first experience I had with classic recently, I picked a troll hunter so my bf picked a troll shaman and I was skinning everything I saw haha
---
When the haters becomes more fans than the actual fans. I watch asmongold and would never ever give gold to any post about him, not these haters tho hahahahahaha :D
---
Sorry to hear about your loss bro. Had to put down our family pupper earlier this year. I’m also on Fairbanks. Pm me for my hunter’s name and I’ll run you through an instance or two.
---
wow ur so funny
---
All the effort of finding people? Heard of the lfg addon? Fucking rofl.
---
It’s actually the best race for prot
---
I hope someone can do the same for him IRL!!
---
Lmao @ james Charles
---
ive suddenly lost the urge to play after hitting lvl 48.. 
---
Cant find a group to run maradon so my chars been sitting at entrance for couple of days...
---
Should i go back to ZF?
---
Final fantasy will always have a place in our gaming hearts
---
I’m a 46 fury warrior and Sitting around 205 str and 175 agi its a great combo and I recommend making sure every slot has Str/agi combo, you’ll want to purchase “of the tiger” boes, Agi is so important for fury I have an awesome time in PvE and find myself critting constantly (have berserker helm and dragonscale gauntlets both +1% crit Chance tbf)  I’m guessing the reason fury was shit on back in the day was because people weren’t focused with gearing up their agility as well, I see people shit on fury for missing all the time but I find that I kill things very quickly and am not have tremendously long miss streaks that get me killed, leveling has been a breeze since I maxed out flurry and dual wield specialization, I use a 1.90 sword and a 1.60 dagger both 30 dps plus and have str/agi with the fast atk speed I generate a ton of hits and crits which with flurry is exponential and like I said before pve is smooth as hell im not sure why every guide I saw said respec to arms I don’t think it’s necessary if you gear with an open mind and almost like a rogue
---
Right back at ya. 
---
Anybody using an illogical trash system clearly can't be too bright :D
---
Treat reddit accounts as you treat burner phones. You burn them. Just make a new account and continue with the new. They might claim IP bans etc but we all know that it does not work:)
---
In addition. Do not ever post anything with any account that is connected to your real life wow account. Meaning. Stay away from official forums etc. They can ban your account from playing wow. 
---
So fly under the radar as the default way to communicate.
---
To preface, I was turning in a Fordring quest and passed him escorting the next section on my way to the turn in.
---
Yeah thats really lame of me I guess. It must be hard for a Classic WoW subreddit browsing stud like yourself to put up with such losers like me
---
Delete this
---
My kids understand the value of curse words and the power they hold. They know what it means to say those things and don’t abuse the power most kids find in cursing.
---
You were actively bashing retail wow on the retail wow sub in an attempt to stir shit up between the communities, and then called the mods fascists.  Now you're shocked you got perma banned?  
---
I hope your trolling.
---
Post Malone? 😋
---
No, most people laugh at obvious baiting, then there is retards who bite
---
no its longer than that for sure. 1-10 takes like 2 hours maybe 3.
---
I guess I’ll take a seat.
---
Definitely strat repeats if you want to maximize gold gain. Personally I kill random UD though because it is chill and I rely on nobody :)
---
classic wow is brutal, this will fail my friend 😁 gl though
---
People dont cry over games, the fact that you say that leads me to belive youve cried over games, get your life together.
---
Which is great! But as adults shouldn’t we at least care a little about that and just generally be nice
---
What is it with all these low effort posts on this sub?
---
Nobody cares
---
The big advantage about starting with WoW classic, if you're new to mmos, is that, well, it assumes you're new to mmos. The game is pretty good at introducing things at a newbie-friendly pace, rather than drowning you in systems from the get go. 
---
It's a pretty slow and grindy game. Some people enjoy that, some people don't. I find the grind much more fun in classic than in other grindy games, and I'm not entirely sure why.
---
It's also a game without a lot of modern convenience stuff. You wanna group up for a dungeon or hard quest? There's no system that just lets you queue up automatically, you have to go ask in the various chat channels. Again, some people like it this way, some people prefer an automated queueing/matchmaking system.
---
The game is also pretty unbalanced. Some classes and builds are just straight up better than others. Luckily, most classes have unique utility stuff, and the raw damage/healing balance issues aren't enough to make the less strong classes useless (although some builds are, with varying justification, considered "meme specs"). Basically, if you're the type of gamer who cares a lot about fairness and balance, you will probably be frustrated. If not, you should be fine, and you can play any class and do endgame content etc. 
---
If none of this sounds too off-putting, I'd say... try it out for a month, and see if you enjoy it.

That’s true, I guess we just grew up differently. Sorry for saying that’s awful.

OP did need, he just lost and is salty.
---
They do in dungeons.  People get all pissy about it.

My man!

This is 3 tier deep picture-ception. He put some work into this
---
Can someone show me the importance of hit chance with math (or point me in the right direction where I can look up this information)?  
---
For a dual wielding warrior I understand the chance to miss is 24% for auto attacks and 5% chance to miss for special attacks.  At 76% chance to hit, gaining 1% chance to hit works out to 1.32% **more** chance to hit and thus 1.32% more auto attack damage and for special attacks it works out to 1.1% **more** chance to hit.  
---
When I look at a lot of pre-bis gear it looks like they're rating chance to hit much much higher than just that much more damage.  I'm guessing it has something to do with consistency of hits but why?  Over longer PVE fights, where does it come in to play that you would sacrifice damage for consistency because all I can see is failing a Pummel being the biggest issue.
---
I will fucking die before I pay a tank 30 gold to tank strat live. Get in a guild make friends this shit is for pugs
---
I'll never understand why people do that... The goal is to make a much money as possible, and you are saying that paying the mail service 30c by item is better than just going by yourself in capital city (where you will go anyway to train, raise your professions... etc) ?
---
Over time the accumulated 30c fees will amount to a lot.

Asmon setting bullied like the shit player he is ❤️
---
9% is your special attack hit cap, things like eviscerate and sinister strike.
---
Auto attacks while dual wielding have a 27% base chance to miss on a level 63 boss and auto attacks are your main source of damage so any hit over 9% is still worth dps.
---
Or drop the 'e'

\*cough cough\*, if you have a friend on alliance side willing to kite the innkeeper you can set your stone at any place.

I have Questie too, but actually only to find available quests.

That priest is a fuckin idiot. Put him on ignore and add him to your guilds shitlist. 
---
Tanking is rough, but you don’t **need** a dedicated warrior/druid/paladin to tank. If you get aggro you kite, and cc. A rogue can tank plenty/most bosses with evasion, and a shaman can slap on a shield and earthshock for threat. A hunter can kite+tank with distracting shot, or a slightly overlevelled pet. 
---
My personal favourite is lvl 60 boomkin in good gear aoe tanking strat. 🏎
---
This guy's art of s amazing and he needs me get hired to make a comic animation now!
---
Same here. It's super relaxing in an odd way.

I want to see you prove that via a video, series of videos, or combat log parse.
---
By the way, I'm primarily an Alliance player, I agree that Horde gets a leg up in some areas, but that doesn't mean I'll take some undocumented/unrecorded anecdotal evidence at face value.

If it was 100% resist rate you should have no problem producing another 50. Go.
---
For me the best looking rogue set. You Sir are a man of culture
---
Lol thanks
---
Mages really are the new hunters. I’m a 36 warrior that tanks when needed. I’ve gotten to the point where I don’t want mages. They’re usually last in damage, don’t cc, and die constantly because they can’t (for some reason) figure out aggro issues. Never thought I’d see the day I prefer a NE hunter over an any race mage. They’re universally bad
---
You can’t really use dots in raids because they take up a debuff slot so your dps will suck. And unless you have a lot of warlocks then one shadow priest in the raid might be too many also.
---
I was unaware! Good to know.
---
Oh wow no ban from a GM? Well what do you know. It's like it's not their job to take care of carebears that greed roll epic BoEs lol

15 years ago if you didn’t live in a major city, your internet had to go from the ISP thru a clothes line shaking in the wind to get to a radio tower that would send a signal to a bunch of tin poles sitting on a can of beans, that would get sent directly to your house via Dial-Up.
---
Plenty of people had poopoo internet. I remember leveling my Druid in cataclysm thru Isle of Conquest with 6000 ping at my grandparents house, and that was in 2011.
---
Yup, fascists.  They silence opinions they disagree with and try and pass it off as policing toxic comments.

I mean, it's not BOP so really he just gave you 60g so you don't have to buy it on the AH. Any pugger would roll need on that lol

There is only 2 genders...

Shadowcraft, Darkmantle, and Bloodfang are all top tier sets.
---
it was bad for me when i was around level 20, are you speccing combat?
---
Maybe it's just how I play and I would need to re-evaluate my entire playstyle.  I use Taunt liberally (on all cloth/leather) which allows me to bank an emergency Mocking Blow for healer aggro.  Some dungeons have a lot of cc and I find having access to Intercept is sometimes the correct play if the cc leaves you way out of position or slowed especially.  
---
I've not got good enough to consistently work Berserker Rage into my rotations (just for rage rather than incapitates) but I feel like that's another one that without Tactical Mastery would be way beyond my skill level for at least a few more weeks/months.

Then go and play the borderlands 3 nothing is stopping you.

Youre thinking of essence

Idiots? It's a pvp server, deal with it.

Goodluck I'd love my wife to join me playing games, I'm trying to ease my wife into gaming, she enjoys cod on xbox and has recently started playing other games like the sims, fingers crossed I can tempt her to check out WoW I reckon she would enjoy it if she tried.

Yeah, and then guilds would force everyone to stream so they could gkick the idiots that use the newer models. No thanks.
---
It was confirmed, that Phase 2 will start this year

My goal is to hit 40 before the 14. (that's when uni starts again) I'm currently 32 so I'm optimistic, started on the 12. of September

None of the 2h weapons ever dropped off of Rag for us.  Finally, after months, Bonereaver's Edge dropped.   Spent all my DKP on it.  Was awesome.  Was even more awesome when they buffed the weapon to the BLADE OF UBER DEVASTATION that it is today.

I was just going through some reviews and reading about gaming keypads and ran into Nostromo a few times.

I'm really considering getting one.

Can you give me some pros and cons of your own?

No difference

I'm a heal priest lvl 41 and want to have the BiS Chest. Currrntly got Skinning and Herbalism 250. I'm planning to drop Skinning with lvl 60 and get Tailoring for the chest. But I also want Alchemy so I'm wondering if I should drop Tailoring after getting the chest. So that I have Alchemy and Herbalism. 
---
What do u guys think of that? And can I still equip the chest even if I drop tailoring?

Damn if only blizzard thought of a way for people to communicate in game! We're lucky we have this missed connection part of Craigslist here huh?
---
Can someone please tag a blizzard employee and suggest them we get an option to message players in game? Would be so nice in an MMO.
---
Wont happen on my server, there were 2 groups farming all the crests while i was there took me ages to get them all, they're selling on the Ah for 7g for a stack of 8
---
At first when I came to Desolace people were asking for Rexxar all the time.
---
Later on I started bumping into Rexxar fairly often, but at that point nobody seemed to be looking for him.
---
That's mostly right, when you have more rage than you know what to do with, you should start using heroic strike. The only thing I'll slightly take issue with is heroic strike doesn't go up in priority in that situation. It's still your lowest priority ability but what you're saying to yourself is, "I have more rage than I can spend on my higher priority abilities, might as well dump some of it with heroic strike." The only priority change that does happen in infinite rage scenarios is shield slam &gt; revenge. Usually revenge is highest priority because it's way better threat/rage than any of your other abilities. But shield slam is your best ability in terms of threat/gcd.
---
Sorry that was overly long and pedantic :P
---
Me not that kind of orc...
---
And MC has been cleared by a 20 man raid already - same principle as this. It's possible but for the general public who are inquiring about dungeon levels etc they should probably go in at the recommended level. If he has a good group who is happy that take him sure!
---
It was blizzards answer to quest givers, innkeepers, flightmasters, etc not being permakilled by PvP.
---
Anyone who doesnt want DKs is a moron. Literally every NPC in every non major city hub would be permanently dead when phase 2 hits.
---
5g probably. Ain't nowhere near bis
---
Ah thanks
---
Min maxing is pretty common to be competitive in PvP. But I feel ya. I like the immersion play more than trying to be the best PvP. Although getting rolled often isn't the greatest feeling &gt;&lt;
---
This was more what I was looking for. Yea, I want buffs/debuffs inside like it is on the default frames. Having them outside just becomes a clusterfuck in raids. About the debuffs - I don't want it to only show what I can dispell, but just any debuff period. For example, I play a pala and while I can't dispell nets I can remove them with Blessing of Freedom. Also, on several occasions I've had to make druids/mages aware that they have to decurse so my heals are not reduced by 50-75%. I am basically looking for the default raid frames with an agro indicator like Luna has :P
---
Don't pug
---
Lucky they were selling for 7g a stack of 8 on my server

Haha I had a necro that was 10 bubbles into 50 from power leveling my whole guild, ran a cleric main and spammed spread heal while we aoe’d zergs

Jesus. People want to be a dick that sits down all day and gets subs so bad they are willing to troll other players LIVE.

At least the dude has a personality of a diaper so we know he won’t succeed in life but then again these trolls flourish on the internet because well the internet is filled with retards. Mainly kids I’m sure that want to be different. This bo jack horseman guy wanted to be different. I hope he takes a step back and realizes that plastic surgery won’t fix that head of his.

Better to take another warlock to help the warlock dps.

I’m so glad you posted this.  I can’t second everything you said enough.  Sadly modern multi player games have watered down the party experience and taught a lot of bad habits to people.  Keep doing the lights work out there.

Sure you would have.

&gt; I'm calling you out because you looked like a clueless shit-talking dumbass.
---
Sorry. I can't hear you when you have your mouth full like that.
---
More work?
---
The double paldrons are the only thing I would change.
---
In a raid scenario you're not usually in a position where you have such a huge threat lead that you don't need to worry about threat anymore (unless your dps are slacking). And the only way you'd find yourself with that kind of threat lead is if you had so much rage you were spamming hero strike in addition to your other abilities, so it's kinda a moot point.
---

What? I still can't understand you when you have your mouth full.

Get Skinning + Mining/Herbalism. Also, learn to fish and cook your own food. Keep all the meat drops as most, if not all of them can be cooked and sold at a much better price even just to the vendor! Better yet, look for a Mage to conjure you some!
---
Also, if given the option always go for grinding either Humanoids or Beasts. Learn First Aid up to 175 for Silk Bandages and (depending on server economy) turn all Silk into bandages then sell to vendor.
---
The Yeti Cave (Cave Yeti are the brown Yeti, not to be mistaken with the white one) in Arathi is an awesome grinding spot at 33-34 as they yield both Cloth and Leather.
---
interesting, thanks for the clarification
---
They should put that in their rules before blindly banning people.
---
I did tho. There's literally a question right there.
---
People like you could never survive Rust.  Lol such babies...
---
You can use mouseover macros to cast buffs/heals on people without selecting them.
---
Probably not in wow no. Shooters might be more risky.

Yes.

Am I tripping or did Shazz not teleport at all? Maybe vid was sped up too much to really see it

Luckily mine is actually into gaming. She loves WoW, but barely has time due to her study. Which fucks ME over. Haha
---
The blizz default just cover each other if you are in caster range. Can't see the information that way. And clicking the right one is also a pain.
---
Can you check chest spawn locations somewhere or how do you know where they are? Experience?
---
So you just roll on shit without looking lmfao.
---
Mara... but you will need to kill tinkerer and princess
---
Really? I always thought the healer could be a bit underleveled as dps or tank have i higher chance to miss.
---
Play the Warlock when she isn’t around to play and take the Druid when she is. Give the Druid to about level 20 before you decide.
---
I got bored of the Warlock once I started using the Voidwalker, switched back to the imp and found it more fun again. Maybe change my how you play the lock. It might be slower to level that without the voidy but if the play is more engaging it could be more fun.
---
only went into badlands to go into uldaman, so basically didnt even enter the zone
---
THANK YOU
---
Consider that as a warrior, a miss doesn't just represent a loss of white hit damage, it's also a loss of rage generation, which snowballs into less abilities being cast over time.  Comparing hit to crit, crit is another way to increase rage generation/dps but runs the potential risk of over capping rage or being wasted by critting a mob that would die to a normal hit anyways. Smooth intake is goood.
---
Generally, the goal is to get enough hit so that your yellow hits (spells like heroic strike) will never miss. With heroic strike, since it "eats" an auto attack in order to cast it, it's an even bigger deal for your dps if you whiff. Once you hit that threshold crit and other stats become more valuable than hit.
---
You think everyone is on Reddit. How is that not backwards? And you think everyone is a ninja too.
---
Are you projecting? Since you're a ninja? As I said. Get off Reddit and out in the real world. You live on here man, what the fuck.

I know the amount of work you must have had to put into this, and i am sure you are happy with it, it just isn't  my style, good work though
---
&gt;but doing it all the time, standing in locations for hours at end on /s or /e is for me a bit overkill
---
who told you to do that? never this post or my complain was about the lack of RP or wanting people to RP but the whole subject has been nicely derailed. are you guys blizzard's bots? because it looks like it. but let's say you're not: all this "drama' as some call it is only about people using the channels /yes and /yell for Out Of Character stuff which is a big no no on a RP server in all games and therefor Blizzard should not put the tag RP on the RP-PvP server has no RP policy is enforced. nothing more, no one here ask you to obligatory RP standing up and walking slowly under the sun like you'd be a prisoner in a Japanese camp during the WW2.

That's just how the mouse works it's just a mini keyboard on your mouse

sorry if I'm late to the party, could someone help me with this? 
---
I heard that warriors do not want to leave defensive stance most of the time because you got much more threat in it than in the other stances. WoWheads threat guide shows, that thunder clap (something which most guides state that it isn't a useful tanking skill) is the number one aoe threat ability: 
---
thunder clap (6): 180 threat
---
cleave (5): 100 threat
---
battle shout (7): 70 threat
---
demo shout (5): 43 threat
---
(all the highest rank) 
---
does this have anything to do with the number of mobs/allies I'm hitting with my shouts? So if I'm hitting 2 allies with battle shout, it's 2x70 = 140 threat?
---
Don't take this the wrong way dude, but I think you just have no idea how to play a mage if you think they aren't top-tier in both PvE and PvP.
---
Blizzard probably use shit like cloud from Azure. The scaleability is amazing, but the performance is shit.
---
Er how do you do it for chrome again? Double right clicking brings up a contextual menu.   
---
Or do you mean mini player, but then your WOW in window mode?
---
Is it the the warrior class or the buffoon that fights mobs 3 levels above him as a warrior. You decide.
---
Peon lives matter!
---
Similar story for me back in 08.  I was eighteen and decided to quit before wrath came out. I was also starting college and knew it would cut into my studies. I ended up selling my fully decked out 70 paladin with T6 grear and a T5 Hunter (both with full professions, rare recipes, etc) for 1200$.  Ended up paying for my car with that money and I drove the thing for 4 years.
---
Let her play warrior and learn the hard way.

In his defense, he said horse with glowing eyes, not tigers.

decurse aswell :D

Who assumes a day of played is 8 hours?

Go Druid, each form has no more than like 4 buttons and it has a strong sailor moon vibe

skull duggery, i see im not the only one who remembers those cowboys of moo mesa.
---
To hell with BGs.
---
Instances is what ruined WOW in the first place.
---
Np, and just in terms of overall priorities as a tank I would say:
---
Keeping yourself alive &gt; executing the boss mechanics &gt; generating threat &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; dealing damage. Your damage as a prot warrior is pretty insignificant compared to the rest of the raid, I'd say trying to maximize your damage shouldn't even be on your mind.
---
Yup or sell blackstone ring 20-30g to rogues/warr/druids
---
Yes. Doesn't matter if it's a separate program or just a function your mouse has, multiple button inputs without a human action are considered botting.
---
You forgot the five paragraph long story of how wow changed your life.
---
I mean most of his abilities aren't bound to anything yet he bound tracking herb. I'm gonna bed there is a lot of clicking going on
---
But he's asking experienced people what items will be expensive in the future. That would only tell him right now.
---
It’s a rite of passage.
---
I hope you both enjoy it! :) Go at your own pace! I met the best people in my life through World of Warcraft.
---
see? it has to remain in the game so people can hate it, makes total sense.
---
Even if I'm sitting there holding it (AKA not using a weight on it)?
---
After investigating it, it turned out to be an offhand that looks like a wand, apologies, it was gossamer rod.
---
No. Locks need to dot for the debuffs.
---
My thoughts when she played. Might be easier sway her with retail first.
---
Depends on the mob and level. With Whirlwind axe you can solo orange mobs up to 40. This guy will be able to do it. Problem is that it isn't efficient or enjoyable, is doable if you play your cards right with thunder clap and demoralising shout to reduce the mobs damage.
---
That being said, turtles are assholes,  yellow level turtles gave me more trouble than most orange level mobs. I think turtles have a high defence stat making them annoyingly difficult to hit
---
It doesnt need to be in the rules. They can ban you for literally anything. Same way reddit or facebook can.
---
Well it sounds like you can just buy the edgemasters so it's nothing to really be concerned about
---
Congrats, how did you make the gold go buy it Haha I'm level 37 with 30gold...
---
ThE WiFe
---
All warriors can be tanks tho. You don’t need that much gear for dungeons. Now most dps warriors are awful... so there is that.
---
Dear healers: Is there really no way to see the OUTGOING healing numbers? I could swear that I had this as part of a floating combat text thing or something, but a bit of research indicates that my memory is wrong...
---
i want to pvp. not get camped my man good try
---
On my server, horde is always camping this spot. I was there for 4 hours, repeatedly getting ganked trying to get my charms for WW Axe before I gave up and bought them from the AH. I have no problem with people farming these, but if you see a warrior in their 30’s trying to get them, pls have some compassion and let them tag a few.
---
It's for mistakes, like you vendor something you didn't mean to or you DE'd something and regretted it. They take the mats/money and give the item back. 
---
Can't keep doing it though, eventually blizz draws the line. It's like a few times a year thing afaik.
---
How would they tell? It's going to look like automated inputs from Blizzard's end.
---
I mean like get somone who is exalted to buy it and trade to me
---
Isn't rage (at least the attacking part) based off damage dealt?  Isn't that the reason why 2Hs can generate more than 1H/shield and why warriors scale so hard late game, or not sure if I'm talking out of my ass on this.  If that is the case then an equivalent DPS increase on autoattack whether through larger hits (more damage) or less misses (more hit chance) should work out to the same for rage generation unless I'm missing something obvious.
---
Heroic Strike is a bit more complicated, I'm going to have to think about that and try and model something to make sense of it.  Overkilling being wasted damage/rage I definitely agree on being an issue, but that feels like it's going to be next to impossible to contextualise into how much it affects your DPS.
---
The "1 button=1 action per client" is such a flimsy excuse tbh.
---
It obviously gives you an unfair advantage when you can just stomp anyone you come across with 5 characters.
---
I'm Ukrainian/Russian. And I'm not tied to fraction that hard (I miss shamans so much).
---
OP shouldn’t come to Reddit for help... please, this is exactly the sort of thing to come to Reddit for.
---
Exactly. My girlfriend (not a gamer, suggested trying wow herself) always 1-click follows me, when we have to walk more than 10 seconds.
---
During that time she browses Facebook on her iPhone or whatever.
---
Yeah I've gone from maybe a 5min queue last weekend to 20min today. Not a huge deal but it is noticable.
---
I see you pointed to the rules and asked them to point out which one they broke.
---
Could you point me to the sub or reddit rule that says you can only be banned for breaking a rule?
---
Can you point me to a law that says they cant ban you for literally anything they want to? Something that prevents them from banning you for saying anything or for any other reason?
---
Thanks!!
---
Yeah this is how I use it. I hate feeling like I might miss a quest. Once I find the quest giver I turn off the rest and try to figure it out from there.
---
Damn, the Armor looks really ugly on the NElf.
---
Turtles actually have some of the lowest armor values in the game.
---
I’d say stuff you can play with a controller. For example girls really dig Destiny for some reason🤷🏻‍♂️
---
as an orc?
---
Lol I play on oce realms in German because it helps me to learn the language
---
How can you be on the Horde Council not being a warchief?
---
Seen 3 wreckage so far &amp; I'm 39.
---
Can't sell herbs as I need them for alchemy. Potions aren't selling because anyone high enough level to use them is saving for there own mounts &amp; I haven't got to raid level alch. 
---
But I'm a druid so just gonna travel- form till 60. I'd rather spend gold on spells that I actually use 99% of the time anyway.
---
Grats on your mount tho.
---
Born losers lol
---
There's a chick in my guild who's never played before who basically is better at the game than I am now after playing on and off since Vanilla. 
---
Her girlfriend has been playing for years and kind of helped her but really it was mostly her, and apparently she was primarily a console gamer before this.
---
People will help you and youre going to go far
---
Then you'll probably kick their ass and show them they dont actually know that much about the game.
---
This is awesome, thanks elf !
---
Why? Im not going to cater to children. I dont even like children. Online games aren't for children and if parents allow them to play and they dont want them to see profanity they need to turn chat off

These 5 hours was yesterday, combined over these past few weeks i have prob done around 100 and seen 1 hoj and no chest

Make a macro.

Dunno if that'll work but Google around for macros people have put a lot of effort in.

Wish I had read it before I started to play with gf. I’ve got so excited to play with her that unfortunately I ended up dragging her. Hope it’s not too late to start again and let her play at her pace.

So were supposed to parent their kids?

1 lock only can handle the debuffs, others spam shadowbolt, but I think now the debuffs slots has been increased
---
how did you get oPie to work? Last I tried I couldn't access any of the settings for it.
---
Look at his face jesus.
---
Show me where I made a blanket statement like that.
---
Essence of life, essence of fire, and essence of wind/undeath are prime money makers, In that order.
---
The full answer would require information what you're doing. If you use downranking heavily. Then yes +healing is best bar none because you simply can't get enough crit/+heal/mp5 atm to use Illumination to its fullest. 
---
The problem with green "of healing" items is = no stats. This means a very small mana and health pool putting you in danger to mana burns and boss mechanics. I just finished my first MC ID and I was honestly surprised how heavy the random raid damage was. As everyone was running around in hit/crit/spellpower/healing gear and not much stamina stuff could be an explanation. Same as the much smaller raid size then before. Even PUGs will flat out refuse to fill out MC to 40 man because nobody wants 8+ fighting over drops. Sure we rarely had full sized raids back then but not at the beginning. 
---
Add to that the current optimisation going on with smaller raids to share loot more efficiently and you get to the point where HP become fairly useful to survive two boss abilities in a row without dying or having a DoT longer active on you then in a 40 man. 
---
Just to illustrate this, I have a screenshot of my warlock from his first time in MC, fully raidbuffed 6k health. Now? I have seen tanks there with less then that and some mages struggle with 4k. 
---
For PvP that will come it's obviously suicide to pick the of healing stuff. Even if its plate. 
---
I would keep both helmets but primarily use Whitesoul. In the end I wouldn't recommend getting Whitesoul any longer anyway. Judgement Crown has almost the same stats from a healing perspective and is easily gainable via Ony Pugs. As Paladins are a minority right now you shouldn't have a stiff competition.
---
Good save
---
So accurate! But only for the fire ones, the other ate into my bank to get :/
---
Hey, no worries. Thank you for being kind and civil &lt;3
---
This is great. Wish I had thought of this before I plugged in the second monitor.
---
Yeah first pull you single pull to pool rage, bandage and pull 2 mobs and do sweeping strike. Execute the last target when you can. Eat food. Repeat
---
Doing your Onyxia attunement quest chain could get you to 60 maybe
---
Live to win
---
Nope you can reset and logout and you'll be out the front again, since you're the only person in your party. 
---
Mara is good because with the Scepter you can reach and kill 3 bosses every 15-odd minutes. The bosses drop BoP blues with good vendor value, and in the case of Princess can drop 2 or even an epic. 
---
The pros of farming Mara are that it's way more consistent than farming low% drops, and you can make 40g an hour quite reliably if you know your stuff. 
---
The cons are that 1) it can still be a little inconsistent, e.g. Princess drops unique items you can only hold one of, so you can potentially get 0g from killing her and get low value drops from the other bosses. And 2) it's a comparatively very challenging and high focus farm compared to mindlessly killing world mobs for rare drops. You need to run and wait at very particular points, pay attention to mob levels to decide whether to sneak past or fight, manage pet aggro carefully against Gizlock, kite without a slip-up against Princess... and the punishment if you die without Soulstone is huge.
---
If you're interested in how it works, [here's a video of the route/method for Mara farming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM-xj_FvGng). My advice is check it out and see whether it's something you're comfortable with doing over a long period of time, because you can always sacrifice 5-10g per hour by hitting much easier farming spots.
---
If we’re busy complaining at the big issues, then chances are that we won’t complain about smaller ones.
---
really, I got 10 so quick in Silithis and got my air in no time as well, plus quite a few greens that I made some money on, Fire was the easiest by far, but it took me forever getting the water in felwood and eastern.
---
You say this jokingly but its a real thing. The bad stuff makes the good stuff better. cant have 1 w/o the other.
---
&gt; i want to pvp on my terms only
---
FTFY
---
&gt; I'm dying.
---
And this is how you spent your Make A Wish? Smh
---
Lvl 28 now and got 27g. I‘m already worried that I miss my mount at lvl 40 :o
---
Only set I like more than shadow craft is dark mantle :)
---
But what about their defence skill? Armor reduces damage taken, defence reduces chance to hit
---
what is hit cap again for a prot warrior ? 9% ?
---
If you enjoy hours (days?) of grinding ZF, go for that option.
---
Watch horrible whiney intro just to get to a rogue in shadow craft that doesnt use key binds.
---
Time is money friend
---
Yeah... you Summon him on a 10s cast while in combat.... sure
---
Entirely depends on if you were in his group or not.  If he is running a dungeon with you it should be free.  If you are asking him to go out of his way to make stuff for you, he can charge you whatever he feels like for the inconvenience.
---
So they just say LFM 2 DPS and if a class of certain type that may need the item whispers he leader refuses. And it's all the same except the people that are that class and don't need the item don't get invited anyways. People like you are weird
---
Yes. This. It's very similar to the approach my husband took with me. He explained the different classes to me at first so I would have a better understanding of each of their differences, but after that he allowed me to explore the character and world on my own. That was about 2 weeks ago and I'm having a blast! Best of luck to you and your wife OP!
---
We’ve all just agreed to Round-Robin them on my server. 
---
Though *somehow* I always roll highest as the first as the tank, so it doesn’t really matter.
---
Reserved pattern for Truefaith, too? ;\^)
---
It's the concept of investment: make a small sacrifice now to reap a larger reward tomorrow.
---
Hell yeah! Grats. What class you leveling next?
---
Not for bear though.
---
Also on Kromcrush and I can confirm that we only complain about not enough cleave and pulling too slow lmao
---
It can still miss
---
rogue is next :)
---
I like to see my name. Also I can sometimes lose track of my dude in a crowded area

Its probably between factions. No clue why they're usibg the mount for it though

You are more of a fanboy that i could ever be, and i actually watch asmongold, but you little nerds hating on him, post, talk and discuss way more about him that i, as i watcher ever do. Whos the real fanboy?
---
Which server are you on that has 3 ref paladins?
---
Aren\`t there a couple in Mara, on a way to Princess?
---
Why didn't you just farm gold instead?
---
Nice work, and thank you!
---
Keep us updated
---
I use Plater. It allows you to toggle how much they overlap.
---
It takes a while to set up but God it's worth it.
---
This would work on me
---
They can, and do, but not in raids :-(
---
Can confirm 
---
In dungeons it's blizzard 80%
---
I wish this sub reddit had the complexity to understand that....
---
just skip right over entertaining huh
---
The guy literally put it on the ah, used the gold for his epic mount...
---
Warlock damage comes fro Shadow, though (unless you\`re a meme firelock).
---
How do mages make their money in maraudon?
---
It is what you make out of it. Sure, if you yell in world chat to form a 20 men raid to gank lowbies, that's on you.
---
You can also go to Azshara and pvp mages who are there mining for their engineering.
---
You don't *have* to make it easy for yourself to call it PvP.
---
I think drain tanking with succ is better for leveling in general
---
Is this RPing?
---
he's propelling himself forward with pure hate
---
Just don’t group with non-Nelf plebs.
---
Ctrl + Tab should select the nearest friendly. You can also keybind interact with target, a mouse isn't really needed to do most stuff tbh. If I get lazy I sometimes just play with one hand.
---
&gt;My green vest has 2 less shadow damage than robe of the void.
---
And 14 less stamina.
---
Aye, best of luck to you both!
---
This is really good. Another option could be this: 
---
    #showtooltip  
---
    /cast [stealth] pickpocket  
---
    /cast [stealth] cheap shot; slice and dice
---
So, if you are stealthed, pickpocket and cheap shot. If you are out of stealth, SnD.
---
How many raids you summon while levelling?
---
That's frankly much too fast. We'll be completely out of content in 2 years at that pace. 😐
---
It's not whipping, she spanks her ass
---
Do you have a job? Or a wife? And kids?

I’m so jelly.
---
It's drawn and quartered, not drowned and quartered. Drawn is the cutting them open and burning their bowels. Quartered is the cut into 4 parts. It used to be a real punishment, not just from Braveheart.
---
Feral is best for tanking and you can probably heal with just some int gear
---
Pet abilities are a very obscure system. A pet won't gain any abilities unless it already knew them when you tamed it. However, you can tame new pets and learn their abilities, and then teach those abilities to any other pets.
---
So what you'll need to do is stable your pet, then find a wild beast with the ability and rank you want (there are lots of resources online telling you which beasts have what abilities/ranks) and tame that beast. You'll then have to use the newly tamed pet for a short time until *you* learn the skill. This usually doesn't take long, just kill a couple mobs. Then you can stable or abandon the new pet, take your original pet back out and teach them the newly acquired skill or rank.
---
Like I said, this goes for ranks too. So if your pet has Bite 1, you won't be able to teach it Bite 2 until you tame a pet that already has Bite 2 and then learn that rank yourself.
---
Its that easy huh
---
Feral
---
You need a big fat slow sword with high damage in your main hand. Off hand is a fast attacking sword that applies poison profs. My char is 39 and uses a zealot sword, which gives useless stats for the rogue but the reason I’ve been using for the past 10 or so levels is because it has big dick damage. Even now it’s still decent. Your main damage abilities like sinister strike and evis scale on your main hands weapon damage, that’s why you want it. Stop opening from stealth, most targets won’t need it. Just roll in and spam sinister strike and evis.
---
Had a 2.5k realm queue yesterday but no login queue
---
yeah i work full time.. from home lol
---
That's the one.
---
I farmed in burning steppes, made a few hundred gold there, but mining is garbage now due to others camping nodes and prices are low.
---
Wait for dire maul thorium runs or just start fishing 00-06 am in feralas river for $$ fish
---
This
---
No, it\`s only good as a pre-raid equipment.  There are also robes for mage and priest, and mage one (robe of archmage) is really, REALLY good.
---
Spell cleave powa :))
---
Wow gamepedia
---
Warriors need 10 charms from 3 different types of elementals + 8 liferoot and 30 bloodscalp tusks from STV (that have a horrible drop rate) in a highly contested area to summon a lvl 40 elite for their lvl 30 class quest to get a whirlwind weapon.
---
He is not wrong tho ,is he ? Still impressive for me 2x 60
---
Wow what a stupid way of pulling. You can easily pull Rotgrip from the other side with an aimed shot + multi shot and serpent sting. After that you run over to him
---
I prefer switches
---
Try turning off instant quest text. That’ll slow you down and give her a chance to figure out what’s going on.

Go bear and let your friend backstab the hell outta these enemies

Check the bug caves in Tanaris/Un'Goro
---
That editing was a wild ride. I feel like i just had a stroke. Also if you had battle shout on you would have killed
---
the best opener for rogues is actually sinister strike. you don’t wanna use garrote at all as combat. also dont use slice of dice rank one its bad i wouldn’t recommend it at all. just go full burst mode with eviscerate.  dont go for mobs that are 3-4 levels higher than you while questing. last but not least, dont worry about people telling u have low dps in dungeons while lvling it doesn’t matter. Good luck! and feel free to ask anything about rogues :)
---
Leveling a priest is considered easy? Not challenging just curious
---
few hours later --&gt; gets banned for gold buying because blizzard assumes it XD

I wish my inner minmaxer would allow me to play human warlock.

How you gonna say that and not link to a example!?!

There is a plethora of games where you dont  have a carrot on a stick dangling in front of you like Battlefield, Call of Duty and the likes do.

You can play games just for the sake of playing the game. If you dont hardcore grind, the PvP rewards are hardly worth the effort anyways.
---
Not just any orange, but one of those turtles. The "Spikeshell" moniker isn't just for show, they have a pretty strong Thorns effect on them. Had to bleed kite them on my Rogue to not get annihilated by it.
---
Yes, full means full. At 52 you will not be doing a full run, unless you get carried.
---
Tuning flight paths.
---
Ok thank you. I figured feral was gonna be the way to go, I just wanted to make sure that if I needed to be the healer I would be ok to do that as well with only swapping out some gear.
---
atleast i dont use a browser that is spying on me aka google chrome lmfao

Our guild helped a 30ish warrior in our guild to grab it. He steamedrolled everything till mid 40s lmao. Now we have a great tank :p

To be honest I kind of dislike people with this view, there's nothing wrong with gender disparity or pandering as long as you pander equally. But equally doesn't mean in the exact same way, typically women are less interested in men in bikini armor than men are in women in bikini armor.

When my wife and I met she was a gamer, but had never played WoW, or any MMO. I RAF'd her into Cataclysm at the time and rolled a prot pally clad in heirlooms and powered through dungeons. 
---
Needless to say we hit 80 in a matter of a day or two and she wanted to play alone for a bit. She had fucking zero idea what to do and quit the game. 
---
She ended up picking the game back up mid WoD and I stayed away and let her play to level cap then brought a fresh level 100 along to play with her to show her the ropes of dungeoning, heroics, etc.
---
Just go to Un'goro and start ganking some alliance in Marshal's Refuge, I can guarantee you that people will join in and you have a 2v1, 3v1 in no time. Pop a FAP and you will have fun.

Most important warrior macro is for auto attack:
---
/targetnearestenemy [noharm]
---
/startattack
---
Use this instead of "auto attack" from spellbook on your actionbar.
---
/startattack is nice to build into almost all your skills, rend, mortal strike and more. 
---
This is to avoid standing there in combat doing nothing for few seconds because you didnt rightclick the mob.
---
People look too much at tier lists and top tier raid run and if you’re not playing what those people are playing they assume it’s trash.
---
That's definitely the plan. lol
---
Call To Arms
---
Need to now take a picture of the phone taking the picture.
---
I have 15 skills that I have not bought;) my skills are all rank 1 except rend. And I don’t even have all the skills so that is in the box. 
---
I do vendor everything and I sell heavy leather on the AH but they don’t go for much above vendor sell but. 
---
I am just starting to get concerned since I am 6 levels away and I am about halfway to my needed gold.
---
If it doesn’t have to be a laptop.... get a used dell Optiplex MT desktop, upgrade the ram to 8gb, get a used 4gb video card, a decent power supply; and a ssd for &lt;$300 total. I’m finishing mine this wknd
---
It's not an issue, it's just part of the game
---
The way I got around this was using Mik’s Scrolling battle text (MSBT). I’d rather have the default combat text but not seeing outgoing heals was bothering me enough to use the add on. (MSBT is great though!)
---
Call To Arms is one.
---
ya it’s not really better as a caster.. sure I can kill an orange but usually takes a lot more downtime and is inefficient
---
especially after 40. Any mage should beat a warrior, every time.
---
Not particulary hard when he has a 60 to twink them with weapons+enchants.
---
Also note that your hit rating tool tip in your character screen will change based on the mob your targeting or fighting. Dont target anything for awhile anf check the %
---
Full BRD means everything.
---
Thanks man, what are some other farming spots where you need to be less focused? I will try maura but can't see myself doing it for more than an hour or two at max and then look for something more relaxed.
---
Last night two different 60 rogues tried to gank me within 10min (I'm 56), Did /lol on both of them and managed to run away unharmed. Thank god neither of then had epic mounts.
---
Ret dwarf pally is surpisingly good at escaping from rogues if your repentance/HoJ land.
---
yeah mb that was me and my guild from retail we have 3 guilds on 3 servers of around 400+ members each we decided to go all in on Classic when phase 2 was announced.
---
I get a week of every other month. I have over 30 vacation days. I can easily afford it and so can basically everyone I know.

I tried levelling without it, but the quest text is often very vague or worse completely inaccurate.

Terrible? We had a 40 man MC clear with all of us on disc laughing and chatting together whilst we all had fun gearing up.

Not sure if that’s terrible but we play for fun and not to be hardcore BIS nerds.
---
Hes wrong, this is impressive regardless of classes.
---
You just don't realize the intense, manual labor it takes to upload something on a PC compared to mobile, stop hating plz /s
---
Yes, since you are the most sought after healer for spelcleaves.
---
Boomer spotted
---
Warriors have no threat drop/reduction so they can either top DPS and pull threat or they can be relegated to a shittier rogue/hunter/lock/mage. There's really no inbetween which is why so many people have bad experiences with dps warriors. The party needs to know how to integrate a dps warrior into pulls, where the tank isn't trying to build threat on the dps warriors targets and the healer knows they're splitting aggro.
---
So this requires some knowledge from the tank+healer AND the DPS warrior. Everyone needs to be on the same page. The DPS warrior also needs to know not to wear a bunch of leather when he's going to be ripping aggro (every 60 dungeon), so unfortunately incompetent warrior can also feed into the problem further by wearing a bunch of shitty leather meant for raiding when realistically wearing a full set of mail/plate would be the right thing to do in a dungeon setting so he can tank damage he rips.
---
Then basic knowledge of just knowing what's ok to rip threat on vs not ok. 99% of trash you're pretty much good to rip threat and tank it without a shield on a warrior provided you have a competent healer.
---
It's hard for pugs though every little problem compounds things in a bad way especially when no one wants to work together, or they have wildly different expectations like the tank+healer wanting a casual tank+spank and chilling on every pull while the warrior is expecting a 20 min speed dungeon pace.
---
Meanwhile Shamans can’t even equip plate.... go figure this one out....
---
Took axe on human to fight orange-lvl mobs? Genius.
---
For stance and weapon simply use:
---
/cast Battle Stance
---
/equip Corpsemaker
---
Or
---
/cast defensive stance
---
/equip Sword of Omen
---
/equip skullflame Shield
---
And if you want to just click one button to Shield bash you can add that also, but you will have to click it two times probably.
---
Speaking of what you can and cant say.... us Germans cant even say "weniger", which means "less" as in "less is more". Instead it comes out as "we%$*#" or something if you have the filter on. Its pretty rad.
---
I healed dungeons as ret up to 35. Could have kept going but I found s group to heal for melee cleave and wanted the holy talents
---
I’m sure you can heal as feral but tanking and questing as resto would be more difficult
---
well that's why you reserve so people who want it won't join your group, saves drama. now deciding how other should play according to you, that's entitlement.....
---
he said off hand which isn't a requirement for using skills only need a weapon in mainhand
---
Getting ww axe at 30 really solves like, 90% of your problems.
---
Every picture of these setups ive seen, have a low level char.. Doesnt seem to be that good afterall eh?
---
we must be on very different pvp servers. its been a bloodbath trying to level for me
---
And we wouldn’t have it any other way tyvm

I HATE nameplates so much. Yes, I'm also a caster, but those things ruin the "I'll hide behind a tree/inside a bush" tactic in PvP. Makes me sad.
---
“Work”
---
This game is a major time investment. I love this game I've played it for years. it's just so that I can play it less if I need too. Like currently I just started a new term in school, I haven't been playing much as I feel the courses out and get a handle on what I can expect my workload to be. But that's okay cause I did a lot of back end work so I can still fit in a raid night and have all the consumes and shit to be a proper raider and do good damage. I can still do what I enjoy in the game, raiding, competing on meters, getting loot, having fun with the guild. 
---
I play like this cause I wanna be the best player I can while also being able to focus on my real life. 
---
People losing their shit over my posts and I realize they sound pretentious but that's just how it is if you wanna clear content at a high level while maintaining a real life. 
---
The people down voting me will be the same people inspecting my character wishing it was there's.
---
Rc bad

Wow classic good
---
Shadow weaving isnt even a reqson to take a shadow priest. Most guild will take one but you can just have a holy priest spec in to shadow weaving which is the much better solution
---
Should i just wait until I'm 55 to do BRD?
---
Warrior trainer will train you the plate skill so you can wear plate.
---
If it makes you feel better it’s actually 90 gold not 100

its also pretty good xp if you are still of a good level to get xp. lets yu save questing at 60 for huge amounts of gold threw conversion

Feel like your goin a bit hard on yourself man, you being upset that she slept with someone else is completely normal, an you responding saying you hadn’t even though not true isn’t like crazy ridiculous man, you weren’t being a Peice of shit, intoxicated an hurt an in the moment. If you woulda been the one to tell her first you slept with someone, an asked her if she had aswell she could have very well responded the same way you had, not right or course but I think your being way too hard on yourself man. Good luck getting sober, the fact you got clean because your parents made you an not 100% your own decisions probably has a lot to do with the relapse, this time you make the decision. I know that’s way easier said than done, it took me so many times myself. An remember there is no doin it once or twice a month an “controlling” it. Ya get a taste then you spiral back down, EVERY time man, just how to is. 100% clean or 0%. Good idea with the anonymous video! There’s tons of people willing to talk to ya bout this stuff, so many have been through the same
---
It is impressive as i said
---
He didn't say he was. But PvE combat is what you're going to be doing most of the time so if you don't enjoy it it makes sense not to play.
---
While I agree that holding that stance is somewhat silly, it is still fitting for a nelf female. By my understanding they rely more on agility and finess than brute strenght, so a parrying stance is quite good for them.
---
Skip to 1:20 to hear explanations of the stance. It is at least close to nelf F stance.
---
https://youtu.be/zy3eFPTbE8U
---
Go for a nelf mount.
---
Haha, get on skype joel.

I had hoped to have a similar experience. Sadly my friend I lost touch with has taken to shutting everyone out of his life which is rather unfortunate. Even his sister tells me the only one he really talks to is his gf.
---
I’ve given up in thorium farming, best but is to run dungeons or farm mobs. As a holy pally solo farming isn’t viable so I’ve been doing all the 50+. Quests I can find

Orcs have 30% because everyone has 5% baseline
---
Mid 40's rogue and thought I'd switch to Mage to see what that's about.  
---
Mage is in the late teens and I'm looking forward to see what L20 brings.

Thanks for all the info, I really appreciate it.
---
Hey,
---
Do you have "auto attack" on your actionbar?
---
Use this macro, it's so smooth to play with.
---
After reading your comments I've come to the conclusion that you're a weirdo
---
Well I'm not even gonna try to tell you what's wrong. But I believe you might have an acute case of retaillicksitis maybe stick to retail.
---
isn't that how it always is?   
---
Mystery and the unknowable are cool, I don't get why everyone needs every detail and plotpoint of a character revealed
---
You made it look too busy in combat.
---
You want a squishy tank use a lock lol
---
You forgot to Frost Nova, didnt recast shield, didnt Blizzard to keep them together slowed.
---
Get an epic  mount and go to EPL. EPL is chock full of mobs when riding into the vales and into Zul'Mashar, therefore you either dismount and run through the mobs manually slowing them or you ride with a 60% mount and die or you run past with an epic mount.
---
Therefore this area is the best, because both ores and herbs are often guarded and you need to slay the mobs quickly so neither your faction nor the enemy faction can contest.
---
Bring FAPs, some bandages, food, good amount of health on the gear and you will make a lot of gold in EPL.
---
In short: EPL is hard to farm in comparison to the other areas, therefore it's less contested.
---
This is absolute gold! Thanks so much for this! Recently changed to a single monitor to save space, and fishing is waaaaay more boring. Been resizing and having weird-shaped WoW windows. Didn't think about PiP!

It does but I'm not sure of the accuracy at times.

Who said I did it? I didn't say it's what wpvp should be, just what it is.
---
Crem10 is wrong. What he linked requires Naxx level gear. The best spec is BM for leveling and MM for raiding, there's not a lot of choice so you easily be able to find the best spec by Googling it.
---
Hi everyone! 
---
Thanks for the feedback, praise and criticism of the comic last week. We will try to post a new one semi regularly, as long as my GF has ideas and wants to draw.
---
For those who missed the last one, you can find it here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dafa0d/first\_attempt\_at\_a\_wow\_classic\_inspired\_comic/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dafa0d/first_attempt_at_a_wow_classic_inspired_comic/)
---
Hope you guys enjoy it!
---
This, i love doing this when they follow me and try to ninja skin it. I just leave it there and go kill the next one
---
Maybes if its a quest mob? Other then that I don't think so
---
Spareribs is super cute
---
My ex partner got me playing WoW 10 years ago. Started in WotLK and I LOVED it! Don’t play as much any more but I’m playing classic and I think it’s great. She’ll love it!
---
That settles it, then. Thank you.
---
Make it happen, keep asking me questions about the game and I'll keep posting paragraphs
---
What about end game pvp.
---
Someone also posted a picture of tanking BRD on his phone here
---
OP said his nickname is close to his real name dude 😉 Dannylew - Danilo very similar isn‘t it?
---
Had similar situations as a spriest, even though I'm already offering offheals (no shadowform yet).
---
I'm level 31 so far and my damage is actually pretty decent... people are way too scarred by the "meta" in my opinion... Sure, in raids I understand... But even there, 15% of Warlocks Dmg is actually damage because I'm there x)
---
You could look for a group doing just half / early bosses
---
No, I love rogue.
---
But it's not as fast
---
It's great for PvP, but most probably wouldn't sacrifice their PvE viability for it.
---
Top tier world pvp, average in BGs.
---
ASUS makes great gaming laptops for a good price. Look into them.
---
Pot calling the kettle black much?
---
All classes are fun and awesome in many ways, but they all have different styles so you just have to find what you like.
---
Hunter and Warlock could be recommended for a beginner maybe. As they have their own personal tank. 
---
Which is really handy solo for getting difficult quests done or herb/mining a node in peace for the extra gold.
---
Druid would be a cool choice also, travel form OP and ability to heal,dps and tank is cool :-)
---
Effort? Is this effort for you? Holy shit you retarded, asmongolds biggest fanboy
---
no I don't have a drinking problem
---
You can definitely use buyer protection for digital goods on paypal. Paypal is probably the most reliable way for a buyer to scam a seller actually.
---
this was me doing the enchanted golden robes quest on my warlock
---
It is around 30g an hour not more, every run u have like 2-3 resists and vanish can fk up although rarely. Thats pickpocket to guzzler and back ahile killing 2 bosses.
---
They're down voting cos its fucking garbage.
---
Pretty much most classes are 1-3 buttons for dps
---
plenty of arena runs are going on
---
I laugh my ass off when my warrior buddy screams about his overpower missing.
---
let people know in lfg channels that they are toxic.  Dont be mean but just let people know to be cautious.
---
The gold really starts to ramp up in silly ways. Assuming you’re moving around to higher zones at least. STV gave me a lot, then I spammed SM arms/Cath since I wanted to hit 40 before this weekend. 
---
I was getting I wanna say 10-18g a level 37,38,39

What button do you use to take a screenshot that shows your keyboard also? Cool feature
---
I have a pretty powerful desktop computer already my friend. I’m 32 and have a family. My desk got binned to make way for a dressing table ☹️ I have to play on a laptop now on the dining room table
---
Could we please get a follow up post, like a month from now
---
Good one.
---
Hey, it’s me, your best friend
---
Mr Lahey's got my porno tape!
---
Obviously?
---
This guy TPBs
---
peal off the damn stickers and enjoy the game
---
Farmed the other 2 charms and fire was my last one, went too it and saw a 60 farming them, I thought fuck me im gonna have to fight him for tags, but nope, he came up to me, gave me like 30 charms. The dude even offered to help me farm the other 16 charms if I didn’t have them already. Not only that but he also ran all the way to south shore and helped me kill cyclonian. Was a really nice moment.
---
Why
---
[Déjà vu.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/cmwov/hey_reddit_what_tattoos_do_you_have/c0tpyls/)
---
American translation: I $ f c
---
Depends whether solo or organised.
---
Solo you want self-sufficient ranged dps like Hunters, locks and shadowpriests.
---
All of those (besides locks) are significantly overshadowed by the control of mages and the burst of ele shamans in organised PvP though. Healers and warriors are also a lot more fun to play in organised BGs than they are solo too.
---
Bought one for 80g coupel weeks ago.
---
Skin mats?
---
Pip should be in the contextual menu as shown in the pic, if you don't have it, update chrome!
---
Is bonebiter the one from the SM quest?
---
There is an addon that will do it. Either CT or Leatrix. Not sure which.
---
Sounds like clever use of game mechanics to keep prices of elemental fire up
---
Thanks,  I got it! 
---
I feel so strong 
---
/flex
---
How did you convince her?
---
I thought shadow priest were trash in group pvp due to healers. They go oom easy and if they're Target is healed then what?
---
I kill princess in maximum 5 mins and 20 seconds (150 kills this far). You are just horrible if you take 8 minutes.
---
sorry, have a nice day
---
'Only 76g'. Mate I had 13g at 40!
---
Is there a good source to check the A/H ratio for individual servers?
---
Or use the snipping tool that is built in to Windows 10!
---
I use Leatrix plus for this
---
Damn how can he just say "oh shit what's up" id be shitting everywhere if this happened to me
---
Mana burn
---
I would think full BRD just means there taking a route to emperor, nobody will kill every boss
---
That’s why they’re not popular in premades. Their durability and ability to burn a target 1v1 makes them viable and fun for solo queue though
---
Can you please sort your characters?
---
It's an even more impressive accomplishment considering you're a disorderly slob.
---
Also, grats.
---
No he doesn’t, sure people like people to believe he does. but in truth he has no idea how he achieved success and has even less of an idea how to maintain it. The only thing he knows is that his success is a fluke and shouldn’t question why, just make bank while the sun shines.
---
Most popular german realms are lucifron and venoxis. Both have a slight horde majority of around 60/40.
---
Jesus. I always lived in the capital city so I never noticed this.
---
Tank live strat and reserve first righteous orb drop rest are greed.
---
yea but it's 1 more thing you gotta remember. sometimes enemies die so quick if you get a nightfall proc and your shadowbolt crits for example. it's best to only drain soul if the enemy is 5%-10% HP at most. trust me if you're not thinking about soul shards and don't just automatically farm then now and then, you will run out quick and it's a shitty situation to be in. nothing more annoying than resurrecting with 0 soul shards when someone is camping you.
---
What do you mean Mana burn
---
You should have a look at getting the Shadoweave Set that’s crafted by tailors, after you’ve saved for your mount of course. It’s an unofficial set of +shadow dmg gear that you’ll wear until 60.
---
didnt you hear his DOG died????
---
you must have no heart, everybody knows animals = good, humans = bad
---
except for humans who trade you items worth 5s in classic
---
also, classic community = good
---
The roll is also random. You got unlucky. I believe it's 20-21 for a 59 wand.
---
Because they [tttrrrrrink that WINE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=em4Yl8qIm9Q)
---
How did this get silver....?
---
Try farming those troll ears at lvl 30....
---
It's exactly why the Soulsborne games were so successful lorewise.
---
The worst part is you won't get gold for this because everyone who needs this advice can't afford it.
---
My pet boar does the same thing, he just snuffs the ground and skids forward along side me... ridiculous !
---
In group, no. Out in the world, fine with them charging.
---
No, literally not at all.
---
I'm going to give a more general answer to your question: you need to be making macros to do instant stance changes + &lt;thing that can only be done in that stance&gt;, then have a quick button to get back to defensive stance (or whatever dps stance you're in)
---
Changing stances quickly, and using the skills from those other stances ASAP is the mark of a good warrior over someone that is clicking skills or waiting for GCDs between each change.
---
My boyfriend got me into vanilla a little while ago and I’m loving it. Running dungeons with a Druid is great cause you can try out all the positions till you find the ones you like. Im exploring leveling up other classes now but it was good to start off with a Druid because they are so multifaceted. Have fun &lt;3
---
I find Trailer Park Boys a lot funnier than the office
---
What add on merges the bags? :)
---
Frig off Lahey!
---
drop rates on warrior prebis are terrible on classic
---
What private server is this?
---
Isnt whirlwind better?
---
Okie dokie.
---
I have /played overall what people have only at 60, I know there are people like my gf who play for an hour or two and they are only lvl 40. But they are just casual, not average. 
---
Like let's put it that way, there are people who play from day one and they are level 40, there are people who haven't cleared MC atm due to gear, commitment etc. But they are 60. There are people who've run MC two times so far and there are people who had their first MC raid on week one. 
---
Would you say that everything above the level 40 is rushing?
---
All I see is a casual, two average categories and a tryhard.
---
How do you "objectively" see what's casual or not since blizzard doesnt post those things...
---
they fucking rekt my feral druid
---
Out in the wilds i always tip, in a dungeon i think a mage should gibe out water because it helps progressing through the dungeon faster. It's a spell of his that can support the group and imo it's the same as a dps class not using their full kit, someone not buffing or a shaman not placing totems.
---
Ok,i get what you [say.Do](https://say.Do) you think that healers should start charging per hpm,or tanks should start charging to be in your group?Its their time also after all.
---
"Oh shit I though i got rid of this guy 18 years ago"
---
Thanks a lot, will try it later tonight
---
Or use something like OnTopReplica
---
which just pulls an image from another window and overlays it.
---
An elemental shaman
---
Id say "tips welcome" but personally i wouldnt charge. Though i suppose each to their own
---
For alliance though.
---
If the lockbox is found in a group ill open it for free for them, otherwise I just ask for a tip,
---
&gt; In group, no.
---
Pretty sure I answered your follow-up question before you even asked.
---
People didn't even farm for HoJ back in vanilla since no-one knew it was that good.
---
What do you mean?
---
Haha such an angry baby boy, needing a cuddle?
---
Do you still lose your rage/wnergy?
---
If a mage asks for money I ask another one.
---
If the mage don’t ask for money I usually give 50s.
---
Weekend
---
It looks like a pile of soil, and Questie has one of the many spawn points listed for it. Check around the entire dig.
---
Is also a good chance he's disenchanting the items for essences
---
If you like healing and stealth just roll a druid. Best of both World and Can even be a decent tank.
---
I wish you luck because I want the same for my wife. I want her to see why it helps me relieve some much stress and I want her to be a part of it. I am willing to show her but some times it feels like she doesn’t care. Good luck!
---
To be honest with you warriors are very easy to level. Just slower than other classes. Not once did I have to buy food, at least not until level 45+. Your weapon progression is pretty easy to obtain, and they'll do most of the carrying. You'll 100% have enough money for your mount without taking any professions, and don't waste gold on AH items. Just make sure to keep first aid up to date.
---
Your not stealing my money making methods!
---
You’re asking what dps class can burst people down fast and is good in all situations that’s not a warrior mage or warlock, and on alliance side? So no a hunter and rogue are neither of those things.
---
No they shouldn’t bc it’s sth they planned to do anyways a mage in the open world is busy and can’t just enchant for everyone 
---
It’s less of money making and more of “let me quest/farm” 
---
You are the entitled one in the situation prolly 
---
In a dungeon it’s common courtesy to conjure food for the group for free doe
---
That apples to you, too. Instead of just turning it off and ignoring him, you're watching anyway in awe of how people will "unironically" watch him, and then watches highlights &amp; enter his threads on reddit to comment on how you can't believe that people watch this.
---
I've been playing with my wife for a while, I'm a warrior tank, she's a shaman healer, we both work full time and "used" to do the cleaning/tidying together.... our house is a mess now
---
God damnit
---
I already threw it away and alt + f4'd outta there.
---
Now I'm eating my 2nd bowl of Lucky Charms, scrolling WoW Classic questioning my Undead life.
---
Giving the tank the first orb on reserve is a very standard practice for Live Strat runs. You don't have to participate, but I'm informing you that it is common.
---
Yeah sorry but that's just through sheer lack of trying, and buying things you don't need.
---
Greys alone start vendoring for anywhere between 25-75s depending on armor/weapon/slot, you can vendor quest rewards for 1-3g, if you have enchanting, the mats can usually sell for more.
---
If you ignore crafting professions entirely before 60, or 50+ if you really want them, even easier. I'm personally on my way to a 3rd 60 and both my 60's so far had ~150-200g at 40, just sell trash (even better with dungeons where you get showered in greys), mats from gathering, be smart about what skills you buy, and what you buy in general, there really isn't much to actually invest that early that you need, and being able to afford a mount at 40 is one of the biggest boosts you can have to the entire leveling experience from then on.
---
The best rng
---
horde player crying about losing in owpvp lmao
---
on whitemane horde outnumber ally 2:1 and they camp in searinggorge, inside brm, at MC entrance, and at BRD
---
that's 2-4 death runs every single time i want to go to BRD
---
but do you see me making a cry post?

Just aoe grind ZF for 7 hours and you have your complete robes

Which add-ons do you recommend that still maintain that classic wow feeling but also give quality of life?
---
Fuck asmongold and everybody who follows him
---
I read 5% base across the board, offhand has 19% miss chance on top for 24% total, and another reply said its 17% (total?) for mainhand with no additional penalties for special attacks.  
---
And that's why I took the best case scenario where hit chance would have the largest impact as my example.  1% hit chance is 1.32% more damage/hits when you have 24% miss chance, it's less impactful when you only have 5% miss chance.  I'm not sure how much base dps you should have exactly on completing your pre-bis but lets say it's around 100dps (weapon+strength+attack power all included).  10 strength gives you 1.43% more DPS/damage.  No Pre-Bis list values 10 strength higher (I think even 20 strength they won't prioritise) over the best case scenario 1.32% more damage from 1% hit chance.  I wanted to know why that is.
---
some servers probably ave too many people to keep track but there's constantly people talking about who has been ninjaing and who to avoid in world and lfg chat on my server
---
Wtf did you hope to accomplish by doing so? There’s a hate in my heart so black and ferocious that you can’t even begin to comprehend the depths of my insanity. Brace your existence if you come at me as I will end your lucid fantasy of righteousness, for I am the fucking lizard king.
---
As a mage i can tell you that time is a resource like any other. When someone asks for conjures which if the skill was just purchased it’ll conjure 2x at a time, a full stack will deplete mana surely however this alone does not entitle the mage to charge money. Its like your standart wait personels its not necessary to tip however if you like the service you can consider tipping. 
---
Cus the mage will always waste those minutes by spamming conjures + drinking up again, interrupting him of whatever he was doing.   
---
Mages can ask for tips, me personally never do but apriciate it when it happens. 🤔 
---
Edit: some words/grammar
---
Rogues are not affected by will of the forsaken at all. But that’s irrelevant anyway since I said rogue and hunter are both classes you really don’t want to play. And they are also the only classes that fit the characteristic for what you’ll consider.
---
You need a 9% hit chance for special abilities not to miss, Even higher if your fighting mobs 1 level higher then you. That's just miss, block parry dodge are all different things
---
Did you really post a screenshot within a screenshot? Dont you know theres a print screen button built into WoW? /s
---
Yes, everyone is aware of it but Blizz has said fuck all about it. How tf am I supposed to 4 stack reckoning bomb someone when this is all bugged
---
So,as long as someone is not in your group,he should charge to give you a heal or assist you with a mob.Alright.I do not agree with this practice but i see your point of view.
---
Cant upvote when its on 666 ...
---
Don't know about late game, but you can make dynamite for AOE pulls and target dummys for crowd control for starters
---
When the burning crusade first dropped I played it so much, I remember having dreams about the game so often it’s crazy lol.
---
&gt;If I see a tailoring pattern someone else needs I'm not needing despite the fact that I could vendor or AH it. Because I'm not an asshole like you. Realise you are by far in the minority because the only person who agrees with you is a troll. Nobody thinks like you do when it comes to a tailoring pattern.
---
And porn in the bathroom.
---
I’m at 40 g as lvl 37 how do you guys get so much gold ^sad ^gnome ^here
---
Of course! A Tel'Abim Banana!
---
It won't happen
---
Bagnon or whatever it’s called that combined all your bags into one is brilliant. Damage meters of some kind can be good for instances and you can turn them off later. 
---
I’d recommend highly that you don’t use Questie. I levelled 1-35 without it and then 35-40 with it. It just kills the need for exploration, to read quest texts and just kills my immersion.
---
Class Swap? Never. Faction change, probably not either.
---
I absolutely love the community as it is and I am willing to put in any effort to keep it this way. Makes it way more fun.
---
Pretty certain we'll never see a "class change" feature. 
---
Faction change is possible but I wouldn't expect it for a very long time. 
---
Just re-roll and get your friends to help with transferring your gold over via the shared AH.
---
and call it Nevada
---
Why dont you do what me and my friends do and make a chatacter to play together. We only log on to thst one to play together other then that we use our other characters
---
hell yeah thank you my friend
---
Ban PSA POSTS. Fucking narcissist
---
Ditto, did not happen on Aerie Peak
---
Surely they can! It depends on the group around them of course, but mostly they will serve as utility/great burst dps and solid 1v1 play, depending on faction/class. No need to worry about min maxing, they’ll be fun to play and moderately sought after, usually welcome additions to most bgs, casual or not.
---
A situation like this has a lot of variables, but don't think just because icons seem simple that they are simple to develop. It could take them hours and hours of iteration to get it to look just right.
---
People often don't understand what takes graphic designers so long to create logos. If you've ever done it to a high level you'd understand the iteration process is 90% of the work. Drawing the actual logo isn't hard, it's getting it to look amazing that is.
---
Its Luke, Luke Shitsthebed!
---
Yes son, "hoes (sic) mad."
---
And clicking number 3, like fuck does your other hand even exist?
---
They already do. Delete or transfer your rogue to another realm and start from scratch. That's your opportunity right there.
---
Is Lord Alexander’s battle axe all that bad?
---
Obviously the other areas aren't quite as consistent or else people wouldn't recommend Mara, but some areas that come close are:
---
* Plaguebats in EPL. There are three varieties, one fears, one poisons and one silences, so just farm the ones that don't silence. They drop a bunch of greys that stack, so you can just mindlessly roam back and forth in EPL killing these until you have bags full and then vendor the whole lot.
---
* Satyrs in Felwood or Azshara. These dudes drop both Runecloth and Felcloth, and since they're quite low level you can easily pull multiples at a time, clear the whole zone, and they'll be respawned by the time you loop back around. Be aware this zone might be popular depending on your realm.
---
* Scarlet Spellbinders in WPL. These guys drop Runecloth, but also have a lotto payout of the Crusader enchantment formula. They're non-elites, which makes them much more farmable than the Archmages that will drop the formula instead come TBC. 
---
The upside to all of these farms is that there's always that tiny chance that you get some crazy blue/epic world drop. The level 52 Jadefire Shadowstalkers in Felwood can even drop Freezing Band. Obviously you don't wanna bank on this, but it makes it slightly easier to keep farming as opposed to Mara when you always know the absolute best you can hope for.
---
Just rip it my guy. But don't be afraid to throw out some heals if it gets too crazy
---
I find it very disturbing that there's a bar clipping into your chat window and that I can't see the damage window.
---
Depends on class, lots of QoL out there. I would suggest onebag/bagnon for sure. I use titan panel just for coordnates, it has a few other things too.
---
U/whtey pls
---
Lol true, but I've been in many groups that I beat out mages and locks in overall damage as a rogue and provided stuff for the group like cc ing adds on healer and evasion tanking after tank died.  Being a mage or lock doesn't automatically make you better for the group. Rogues do bring benefit to the group if they are good players.
---
You don't need an addon just type 
---
/console SET chatClassColorOverride "0"
---
Well that's not really hard.
---
Did you guess I play horde from when I said "I play on horde"? Let me guess, you're part of the "slow to learn" crowd. Good job deciding to try to insult me because you made a stupid generalisation.
---
haha I ran into a member of that guild too but he was from London (Ironic :D ) - sadly its not a legit Irish guild.
---
Ok, let the downvotes begin.
---
Netflix sucks because region locks, lower quality streams and subscription fee.
---
Firefox is better than chrome.
---
So this isn't all that usefull for me.
---
If your going tank id just sell them
---
Why? It will be blizzard again that makes the new story, so it will be shit again, nobody plays blizzard games for the story since 2004
---
After reading the title and seeing the thumbnail I saw that going differently on my mind....
---
Its just overall really really strong gear
---
Search through your bis lists and if it’s not there I’d just sell it
---
It's a screenshot of a text message, how could've he posted that any better? Go drink some milk and share your stubbornness elsewhere
---
Problem is that good players tends to not play rogues
---
The 5 points in weapon skill actually reduce the hit you need by 3%. So at 305 you only need 6% to be capped for yellow attacks.
---
Any hit above the 6% will benefit your auto attacks, which will increase your dps significantly.
---
not playing something you don't like isn't being an elitist, you cant force people to play a shit game
---
Cool man, i've tried Plaguebats before which is stable and did satyrs in Azshara with a friend for around 45 min and earned 15g each.   
---
Not sure about the spellblinders since it feels like there isn't that many of them? Gonna check it out and try a few mara runs. Cheers
---
I'm most likely gonna sleep on it and figure it out, I'm very heavily leaning on selling it.
---
As a human warrior I'm good with the +5 for swords/maces so it's not a super big upgrade for my race.
---
Why warlocks will be stronger in naxx than now? I assume that because of items, but what will be the major change?
---
everyone is bad
---
Thanks, I'll check out bagnon, it seems amazing.
---
And I'll check the damage meters too.
---
I wasn't planning to use any kind of quest help mods since I read the quest text everytime and also I like to guess where the objective is. :)
---
I think she is calling you fat..but I can't quite tell. 🤔

Gold to whoever gets classic running on templeOS
---
i might be missing something but mouseover macro for offensive abilities on ennemies seems really useless.

Elseif do loop for in each while I am eating
---
It does not level along with it, nor will it learn any new abilities. You have to teach him them through beast training. 
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Pets will teach you their ability as you use them. Sometimes it’s right after training, others it’s after a couple of mob kills with it. 
---
In order to learn the next rank of charge you’d have to train a beast that knows it, use the beast until it teaches you it, then you can teach it to your boar. 
---
Pet optima tells you everything you’ll need to know. From what ranks they can learn the abilities, what abilities they can learn, and what pets out in the wild will teach you them.
---
Good thing you're sitting on that comfortable hard wooden bench when settling down for a straight 6'er.

r/whoosh ... I hope

blizztard has already changed hundreds of things

can we stop with the nochanges? its more of a joke at this point.
---
VPN, support content since you can afford a WoW Sub, Firefox cannot PiP.
---
You are irrelevant in this thread but insist on making a post.
---
:D
---
Haha, thanks mate! While I agree that some of the more recent comics they released were, let's say, underwhelming, the older ones drawn by Ludo Lullabi were the bomb!
---
No. It's not any different than keybinding left click to scroll wheel
---
They get paid for some PUG dungeon runs when the group can't find one, and in some situations a guild need to borrow a tank or two from other guilds for some bosses like the hour horsemen which required EIGHT well geared tanks in rotation. In that case the tank will surely get paid. Druid and pally may handle it in dungeons, but not raids. Not until TBC. It is you who're too ignorant to know any of these.
---
They aren't bis past C'thun when you get the Gauntlets of Annihilation, cause you get enough rage at that point that you can convert more of your white hits (can't glance on yellow hits) to heroic strike.
---
At least this was the case on pservers. Maybe they stay bis, but they won't be THAT much better than C'thun gloves would be my guess.
---
As more people figure this out, their value will drop as AQ comes closer. Maybe they rise for BWL, maybe they don't. You can spend your 500g right now on an epic mount, gear/enchants, consumables or invest into mats/consumables that WILL increase in price, like elemental earth for nature pots.
---
500g in phase 1 is worth more than 700g in phase 3.
---
Thank you, mate!
---
Yeah I made the disenchanting mistake too. Get yourself an addon that shows value from ah, vendor and disenchant. Often you can just vendor the item and buy reagents on the ah cheaper.
---
Next level thinking
---
We poor plebs help the poor not for gold!!!
---
Jesus christ why did this get gilded *twice*
---
Here rogues tend to open with cheap shot blade flurry evasion while patrol is incoming and tank wants to LoS
---
just a fun video man. nobody has to care about anything. 
---
hoes mad.
---
I'd like to know this as well!
---
O wtf it got gold
---
Wait for 5 stacks of sunder.
---
Dont use anything that increases threat (rockbiter etc)
---
Accept that you're there for totems and prioritize them.
---
no one plays on that dead server anyway lmao
---
It's still the warrior class, because any other class could easily kill it twice as fast.
---
According to Shadowpanther, it’s basically BiS pre-raid for MH.
---
https://shadowpanther.net/weapons-pve.htm
---
Yeah I did this too until level 33 it so haha
---
Shouldn't be. It's just a mechanic.
---
I do this in Silithus when people tag my dotted mobs.
---
Lunch
---
Get 2 keyboards and raise the laptops to eye level, your necks will thank you
---
retail soft boys need a report button for everything yikes
---
And then you somehow en up as the only warrior on your first Ragnaros and get both BRE and Onslaught girdle.
---
Where is Exodar and Azuremyst or was it added later and not currently in classic?
---
Could you outline the steps so I can link to your comment mate
---
And all too rare. Ppl on pvp servers seem to go out of their to be dicks. Honestly till honor points get added to classic, theres very few valid reasons to pvp someone. I get it if they tagged s mob and you want it, that's fine, if you grinding a quest drop or loot or mats and someone just shows up and starts trying to take all the mobs or mats that you hard already started clearing, that's understandable. But when you get nothing from killing someone other than making their time more difficult then that is a totally dick move.
---
I don't know, i found it both funny and accurate.
---
More like RaPeing
---
WAIT IT DOES WHAT!?
---
WHY DID I KNOW ABOUT THIS!?
---
Yes, adult responsibilities.
---
Nobody is jealous that you’re a failure in life, pal.
---
As an aoe mage that doesn't want to be a nuisance in dungeons, do I just stick to doing single target or should I be using aoe? When do you know when it's okay to aoe?
---
Nah, we just prefer premades than to sit through pugs.
---
Thats burning crusade content.
---
how about dont pvp as alliance whiner
---
I used to use that but one day for some reason it stopped showing up when i would run it. The program would be there and running but no window anywhere. Have uninstalled and reinstalled like 3 or 4 times and the same thing every time.
---
Thank I'll link to this comment!
---
I had no idea that I was the case.
---
Dir fehlt ein M im Namen, für den fall das es deutsch sein soll :)
---
Nice way to hit 60.  What did you sacrifice along the way?
---
Hit is a strong stat but that doesn't mean it triumphs over any amount of spell damage. 33 shadow damage is worth more than 1% hit.
---
If you're going to reserve an item though, then others should also have the chance to reserve an item if they join. That's only fair. Anybody can lead a group. Classic WoW isn't rocket science by 2019 standards.
---
Well considering tanking on retail is done exclusively with a shield for warriors, tanking with a 2h or dw is the magic of classic.
---
You can miss overpower, I believe.
---
You can also use ontopreplica to mirror any window. Creates a floating, always on top, resizeable window.
---
I’ve wanted to get this kind of thing working for so long and it worked flawlessly, thank you so much. Grinding will be much less of a pain
---
Real gorillas are completely incapable of swimming. Apes have no swimming instinct at all and will just sit there and die if they fall in the water. So, I guess they're going for realism.
---
Im guessing they run underwater.
---
cant tell if scarscam
---
*are
---
Not OP, but if you give the tank a few seconds before attacking, you won't have issues with pulling aggro from a single mob.
---
Good luck, I am gonna try eventually too
---
Don't use rockbiter or earthshock, I assume your using windfury, Even if theres say 2 sunders, and you proc a windfury, those 3 two handed hits could probably easily pull agro, even more so if you waited for less, Just because hes swing doesn't mean hitting as well, Also if your tank was 25 he even has a harder time getting any aggro
---
Night mode in wow?
---
Unless its an aoe group, use single target.
---
Maybe, but a normal raid group only has 1-2 druids, and usually for innervation, Brez and the buff.
---
Do you remember mace stun lock rogue in bc My god.
---
Don't pretend to be so fucking dense you squid. I'm comparing one actor to another.
---
That's due to poor communication then. Opening with cheapshot instead of garotte shows an interrest in mitigating some incoming damage on the tank.
---
[The meme I'm ripping off](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/reaction-guys-gaijin-4koma)
---
Im very happy to have monopolyman as my bank alt.
---
So it's still a third-party program, without it you won't be able to multibox
---
Is it because your walking around with the STV pages quests in your log, taking up 5/20 of your quest log? I agree, abandon and bank pages until you have them all, and then accept hand in.
---
If you believe the amount of servers doesn't matter, you're a fool.  
---
What's harder to manage, holding 2
---
1 bowls full of water without spilling, or over 50?  
---
Literally naive to think Blizzard isnt trying to fix this issue, and super naive to think pservers were as hard to maintain as classic + retail.
---
if all of these ideas were combined, you got retail
---
I don’t play on it but it was the only one marked as full few hours ago
---
Also the case on mine.

Dual monitors are not ideal for gaming, nothing beats a single curved ultrawide monitor
---
The thing about Vanilla is, there isn't very much that's a straight up dps race outside of some raid bosses, and since threat can be so hard to build until you're in some prebis/raid gear with some +hit, it's usually a good idea for the dps to chill out for a bit until some threat is built. 
---
It just makes it easier on everyone, the tank gets plenty of rage, the healer only has to focus one person, and you're free to go nuts when that threat is built up.
---
And on your multiple mobs point, AoE threat is generally even worse, and is going to depend on how well the particular Warrior tanking for is about stance dancing and spreading sunders, so it's kinda hard to give a concrete answer for that one, if you find your current tank just can't hold AoE aggro, try and just focus on whatever their target it.
---
What server can I go Kill these Olympus bastards cause Asmon is annoying as hell
---
Going to hit level 60 as a rogue In classic tomorrow.
---
I know I want to do damage endgame, I know I like having fun and being self sufficient
---
Only thing was for me, I found it difficult to get use to not being able to keep up during certain aoe situations, but as I leveled up and learned my class more I’m more often than not setting myself up for intense damage bursts between 1-3 targets and absolutely wrecking damage meters. 
---
rogues have so many fun useful abilities and some obvious weaknesses, as all classes in vanilla. Just figure out if those strengths are where you want them
---
Single target has their purpose. Think if instead you had 3 rogues who were min maxing and try hards vs 3 mages. The mobs would get slaughtered just as fast imo assuming the packs are not bigger than 6.
---
Even blizz knows you're a wannabe rogue
---
Idk man mages are rich tho. I bought the mats for robe and epic mount days after 60
---
Actually I've been told they just can't float because they are too heavy, bones are too dense, and they almost completely lack fat, that which helps us float. That was during a visit to a super ultra giant monkey park in Europe / France
---
Its bis until c’thun for non-human/orc as long as you use swords/maces as human, however if you get some insane axes i would still use them as human for dps.
---
But if you tank then no, you get enough rage to use heroic strike on global as tank and special attacks cant glancing blow.
---
&gt;It's like how people say silly slang terms ironically and then end up actually just saying them normally.
---
this has happened to me so many times
---
ngl, its pretty lit
---
I hope you are a patient man
---
Oooh, please do a Rosie the riveter style poster. But with an orc holding a pickaxe, which the slogan: “Something Need Doing?!”
---
Why horde kill evan after I give kissy?
---
You got to see it like this: you, the hunter, learns to teach abilities to your pet.
---
You learn to teach the passive boosts such as armor, resistances and stamina from the pet trainer.
---
You learn to teach the abilities from pets around the world.
---
Your 'main' pet, if you have one, gets Training Points from leveling its level and its loyalty.
---
So if your current pet knows Bite (Rank 3) and you want it to know Bite (Rank 4), you should learn to teach rank 4. You do that by taming a pet that knows Bite (Rank 4) and fight with it for a bit. After you have learned to teach rank 4 (by watching your chat) there is no reason to keep the newly tamed pet. Once you got your 'main' pet again, check to see if he is of a high enough level and has enough training points, then teach him the good stuff.
---
That fact about Nefarian blew my mind. It's a good thing server hardware was updated because a lot more guilds will be clearing BWL at the same time in classic.
---
I pickpocket farm by macroing pickpocket to garrote and using it while I dungeon, I pocket one enemy of every pack at least

What are some good techniques for pvping as a shadow priest?
---
This is foolish logic, if he didn't reserve the item he would simply avoid inviting the classes who would roll need on the item. 
---
Reserving the item includes more people and is entirely better than completely excluding everyone who can use it. It's your choice to join the group or not.
---
Filthy horde.
---
You could, just awfully. Why it passes, is because it's not automating anything as everything is controlled by your single keystrokes and wow in-game macros. So it makes sense with blizzards tos, even though it sounds super shady. 
---
A good argument could be made that blizzard just wants their money, but imo(I don't actually know) I don't think multiboxing is so rampant that they're crushing sub fees by allowing it. I think it just worms its way thru their tos in such a way that it gets the pass.
---
Meanwhile 
---
The Ret pally, Feral Druid and boomkin are being killed by bugs.
---
"I hope your overpower misses!"
---
U can carry two rings. Equip one
---
Not on my server. Everyone is treated as equal. One doesn't get privilege over the other 4 just because he was willing to spam a macro in chat every 2 minutes.
---
Generally as a warlock you want to run around with a full or close to full shard bag, and I still have my first si that's 16 shards. It's mostly important for wpvp when you get into pissing matches with another player who can't let go that you killed them while being 8 levels down.
---
Need before greed would have been a better option.
---
So from what I could tell from reckoning 
---
1. It doesn’t store stacks accurately it’s hit or miss when you get Crit... it works but sometimes it doesn’t.
---
I won’t be surprised if it’s an intentional nerf TBH
---
Does blizzard only have as much money as EU nerds?
---
When you move ya body?
---
My favorite zone is winterspring, I spent so little time there because I completed the quests so quickly
---
I think I spent the most time in ungoro crater just because you do giant circles
---
No but you can technically get it at 30, Ravager requires 37 iirc
---
She probably gave up like 20 minutes in and pretended she liked it
---
Meanwhile I’m
---
Having a mental breakdown leveling my paladin.
---
ah, thank you
---
Nah I think a lot of it has to do with the relevant times in those nation's histories also. Middle ages England is at least seen as gritty non flashy armor crusaders etc. It feels real and hard. Middle ages France was about parties big hats big feathers and lots of make up.

But you don’t want to complete orange and red quests, as they give just as much XP when those quests turn yellow or even green. You’re making it yourself more difficult than necessary. 40-43 should have yellow quests available in Badlands, STV, Arathi, Swamp, Dustwallow, Desolace, Alterac and even more.
---
And even grey quests can be just as lucrative for gold as other quests. Especially when they reward a weapon.
---

You also can't enslave tapped targets.

Wow, and I never mention I have played retail. Nice logic you got there.

it's still sort of usable, it's just not nearly as powerful. more or less on par with the 10% one handed weapon thing

\[Sleen the Vending Machine\] Free food and water in Undercity Inn. Also free ports (\*Provide rune or 18s) to Org or TB. \*Minors (under Lv18) need not provide rune or 18s for ports.
---
Except "justdrop" he can go fook himself
---
brilliant advice! stick to it!
---
It shows that the rogue dont want tank to gain rage
---
thanks!
---
Yeah, it's so awful
---
I just explained why this is foolish logic, did you not even read my reply? Okay, I'll explain it again. 
---
If you don't invite the people who could potentially roll against you for an item then you are excluding people of that class who may not even care about that item. 
---
Advertising your group with the item reserved, is by nature, a more inclusive solution. That guy making that group with the item reserved would simply ignore your whisper asking for an invite if he weren't reserving the item. 
---
Let's say a warrior is making a BRD group and is advertising hand of justice as reserved. Other warriors and rogues who may already have HOJ will join his group because they don't care about HOJ. 
---
This is entirely better than ignoring anyone who wants to go because they can use the item you want. What part don't you get?
---
Eheheh
---
The butt is hurt with this one. If mages want a raid spot they'll open a portal in our guild runs.
---
A sense of importance for once in his life when his made up bs gets upvoted, karma for w.e reason, etc. Theres plenty of reasons to do it
---
Cloth are usually only stamina and int or stamina and spirit. So you’re saying the blue chest piece I got from dm is better then a +9 Shadow damage chest piece?
---
you sure can, especially at his level with the influx of power from the WW axe. It's even better if you learn that there are more things than standing there afk and you can kite.
---
Switch select
---
This mind set is so fucked up imo. If people want to play that way, just let them. Who are you to tell ppl to not reserve or accept reservations? 
---
Also if you want to not reserve for some strange principle and you're playing for example a rogue, then good luck ever getting your BiS items. You're forced to run dungeons for a 4% drop chance only to compete against like at the very least 2 other players. The chance of getting some items become insanely low to the point where u might as well just grind and hope for BoE epics lol.
---
Farm ZF and buy the mats. Take it from someone who farmed most of the essences before finding out about ZF. ZF is much more efficient.
---
omg this serious response to a joke. you truly have a real rage towards mages lol.
---
I already have first aid can I take cooking as well?
---
As a departure from my usual hunter life I decided to roll a warrior. Is it possible to tank low level dungeons as a fury? If yes, I'd like to hear some tips or some resources worth looking up please :)
---
I hear you, but if you're on this sub I'm betting you prefer quality over quantity ;)
---
Like master loot is going to save you.. I had a priest roll need on chromatic carapace with it on group loot. I was the second highest roll as a warrior.
---
I love you for this
---
I love you both
---
Nice find! Now if someone can find that cell door opening, or the dragon screech from Starcraft...
---
Why do you think 50% of the population is now made up of mages?
---
Many people rolled mages because they are the best class.
---
Now that many are hitting 60, most are leveling mages due to them being by far the easiest to level. This became even more well known after jokerd hit 60 in 3 days. Now everyone knows it. A quick trip to any popular humanoid spot will show the extent of it. Mages on top of mages fighting for any mob they can get in attempts to aoe.
---
And then after you level quickly, they have high demand due to their utility which is equal if not better than warlocks for raids. They make food and water. They give arcane intellect. They have portals. They top DPS charts by spamming 1 button.
---
For PvP theyre also one of the top classes. Where as a warlock can not beat a rogue, a mage can beat pretty much anyone.
---
The only downside is that mages make up such a significant portion of the population and the number is growing every day as more people hit 60 and the majority of them roll mage alts. So finding available spots will be harder.
---
However, you can literally run a raid group consisting of pretty much all mages, a tank and some healers. Such as what Asmon did week 1. Or what "the mages" did in vanilla downing ragnaros in record time 
---
In many cases for 5 mans you dont even need a tank. Just bring 3 or 4 mages and a priest. Maybe 3 mages a lock and a priest.
---
I have an even better version.
---
Get a script that let's you make a given window a certain level of transparency. Open up a full black page on paint. open up the video you want to watch. open up your game.
---
Make your game something like 50% transparency. You will now see through the game into the video. The advantage to this is that you will see both images at the same time, meaning that the view you have in your game will not be blocked by the video you are watching.
---
If you are interested in using this method, message me directly and I can send you more info about it.
---
&gt;It also allows you to watch all your gear go to the streamers because their leadership is on record talking about how "randoms" that they dont know dont deserve gear.
---
Isn't that the other way around? Leadership (Mcconnel) is talking about how randoms don't deserve gear, because the gear piece didn't go to the streamer?
---
Theres so many.
---
Bagnon - bag organizer and lets you see whats in your alts bags
---
TitanPanel - bar that does a lot but gives coords/location, and tracks your total gold between alt characters
---
Details! - nice meters for dps and threat.. helpeful for any class
---
Then id get a map one since the regular map sucks.
---
It's possible to tank everything as fury, including MC and Onyxia.
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Field Guide :)
---
Hello!
---
Got some question to seasoned tanks: After hitting 45, I respecced into full prot (11/5/33 at lv58 currently) and started mainly tanking dungeons together with my priest friend as my healer. We will be hitting 60 soon and I was thinking about skilling DW fury which was my plan from the beginning.
---
Long story short, is it feasible to tank the late game dungeons (Strat/Scholo/UBRS/..) if I skill fury?
---
If it is, how does fury handle initial aggro? Without talents like Tactical Mastery for stance dancing? Would you tank in prot stance? or fury stance? (which would lead to longer reg-pauses due to healer mana I guess) A little bit of insight would be great!
---
Thanks in advance :-)
---
From 225-300, The Searing gorge has a pretty good area, there lock boxes in the area underground near the overseer/plans quest from thorium point. there a bunch down there you can bring in that starting area, and the hallway that is a bunch of bed bunks around the corner, Once you get a little higher you can pick the locks in BRD, the 2 gates to the left, and then door to arena/angerforge, and then the lock itself, Around 58+ you can unlock the lock without aggroing mobs and reset. I did this to 300 by resetting instances. You need 300 to lockpick the scholomance and strat doors. ( every door can be lockpicked except UBRS, as its not an actual door.)
---
Expect no less from a hunter who brings up gender topics to a game and can't even use the most basic English verb correctly.
---
Melt their faces.
---
35 isn't much grinding. Just make new one on a PvE realm.
---
Flying can stay, but not for cheap. LFG can go die in a fire. Completely ruined the social aspect. So much bad behavior once people weren't having to rely on each other anymore.
---
Do you sit on your left hand till its numb the pretend that's Asmongold's hand as you wank off?
---
your journey has only begun my friend
---
How can i press 3 if im too busy keyboard turning :(
---
Yes, you can take all three secondary professions (first aid, cooking, fishing) in addition to your two primary ones.
---
We know that Alliance have cooties.
---
Did you ask for consent before kissing them?
---
Isn't it a bit much to assume malicious intent?
---
What tank BiS are from crafting? I thought I was so lucky in having to avoid the gold sink but now I'm worried I have a bad BiS source.
---
Mages rogues and warriors, the unholy trinity of classic.
---
After STV I decided every rogue is KOS.
---
He may have to spend in The Barrens and survive Barrens chat..
---
same. installed at lvl 30
---
Locks can Tank. Pretty good actually
---
For leveling I'd say stam int spirit, not spell damage.
---
Ok, but the person who leads the group just was the one willing to spam chat in Ironforge or whatever. Just because you have the group lead, doesn't mean you're actually leading. This is a really old game. It's more than likely the next person knows the dungeon inside and out too.
---
“I don’t like this place”
---
Guess I could do that but I was close to finishing a couple of them and I wanted to track it.
---
How to get that much gold as rogue without epic boe drops?
---
What is there to be appreciative of? People you don't know, that you haven't even played with, not doing you any favors.
---
Now if this dude was handing out summons or something that would be different.
---
You can spam a "/startattack /stopattack" macro to get extra hits and the swing timer reset, also sitting works if you stand up just before getting hit, the timing can be hard though
---
Such auto attack, so much skill
---
Spell damage &gt; stam &gt; int &gt; spirit while leveling. Hard invest on spell damage, stam is a solid secondary as it acts like a second mana bar.
---
While leveling get shadoweave and/or shadow spell damage that’s not super expensive. Get hypno blade from library and shadow orb from level 35 lock quest.
---
Spirit and int is sort of meh if you draintank.
---
It's possible, but most guilds will probably want you to bring your basic consumables. Shouldn't be too expensive though, you could make that gold in less than an hour with various methods.
---
Class never
---
WHO ever recorded this was fucking clicking all bis spells with his mouse... wtf dude
---
They're doing their part.
---
Having a mage at 60 in the same period as torch runs, sm runs, 7 man dungeon groups is not impressive.
---
16 int to 1 shadow damage give or take
---
Lionheart helm is the only one that immediately jumps to mind.
---
I can see why we have different opinions then- I'm not a big fan of PvP. I can see why that would suck though!
---
Are you on skullflame? I saw this exact same thing yesterday...
---
Meanwhile I as a priest spend about 90% of time slowly walking back an forth.
---
Pretty bad ttk though
---
Wouldn't both with slice and dice until you get rank two. For grinding mins I usually just SS then to death. Sometimes I bother with a garrot, but often as not I just face stab mobs. 
---
Bare in mind that if a mob is 3 levels higher than you your DPS will be significantly reduced. Look up Glancing Blows. You need to understand them. 
---
You should be wielding Sword of Omen from SM quests, and trying to get Vanquisher from RFD - also a quest. 
---
You don't need to worry about dungeons except for the weapons. The weapons are pretty much everything to a rogue - my equip besides weapons is trash but I smash things mostly.
---
But it'd cover my dps meter
---
How is it with locks? I always try to Dot all minions as fast as possible and then focus the first mob again with Shadowbolt etc. Since the cast time of fire... (I don’t know what it’s called my game isn’t set to English) and the fact that the dots don’t deal damage right away should be fine, right? Or should I wait for the tank to at least hit everyone at least once before dotting then?
---
Locks do dot.
---
The corruption spots are sought after for dick measuring on the meters.
---
You need elements to make the mages feel good.
---
You want shadows to make the warlocks feel better.
---

hoes mad
---
For leveling you want to maximize spell damage if pve server, on pvp stam gets more value. Int is mostly not used because lifetap is a thing so we use stan as a second health bar
---
Live the dream bud!!
---
Well, I vote by not joining those groups. However, they do take away players that otherwise could have joined more well-meaning groups with no reserve system in place. It's a toxic stain on the server in question. If you want to gear up fast, you can always join a guild. In pugs it's supposed to be rough. It's supposed to take months, not weeks, to get your BiS and t0 dungeon gear.
---
That's no different than going to a car auction and there is a reserve on it. If you dont pass the reserve (or the seller chooses to not remove it) you dont get the car even if you bid on it.
---
Yup! I understand why people like flying, it's so much convenience. For PvE servers I'm all for it in fact. I was hoping with BfA they would make it so it was simply Warmode on = not able to fly. But nope. They just allowed it as soon as people got it and within the day people were swooping in to gank or flying off to avoid death. Nothing you can do about it.
---
Brilliant.
---
How do locks do Maraudon?

what the fuck does that even mean lmao
---
... should I be? No one told me how to play.
---
Also, I prefer Cheap Shot as an opener. Then I evisc when the mobs about 30-40% if I have 4+ cps. Otherwise just SS it out.
---
Why?
---
Decursing is more important than frost bolt.
---
The amount of rage the "Devilsaur Mafia" is causing reminds me of that old Serenity Now vid.
---
Zug Zug!
---
Tbh I got a second screen but still prefer this method. Makes sure that you keep your focus on the screen where stuff is happening.
---
"What's Training?" is the one I use.
---
I love mages. They do all the work on trash while the real classes get top of the charts.
---
Its much more mana efficient, while still doing an auto shots worth of damage.
---
Wow Classic can run on a potato
---
So wear my 9+ shadow damage chest and 7+ damage spell boots then the int and stamina stats on other cloth gear at my level?
---
After STV I've decided every Olympus guild member is KOS.....I play horde on faerlina.....
---
Spirit is important for leveling effiency ( if you care about such thing). Speed levelers usually stack spirit for higher health and mana regen.
---
Not really, takes most people way longer to get hoj
---
Disagree. Spell power is hard to come by, small amounts don't provide much value imo.
---
Int is almost as important as stamina, more mana = less gcds spent on life tapping. Plus you level with dark pact anyway.
---
Spirit is not a bad stat, it reduces the inevitable downtime you will have.
---
Shoulders and boots look pretty shit tbh
---
which one do you feel like playing...? no one else can answer this for you.
---
Some shoulders can roll frozen wrath 100%
---
&gt; Netflix sucks because region locks, lower quality streams and subscription fee.
---
Compared to...?  
---
^(Note: I'm not saying Netflix is the best or whatever... I'm just saying you can't say they're worse, without actually saying what they're worse than...)
---
Why do you chose to only focus on Netflix? The post mentions YouTube as well.
---
&gt; Firefox is better than chrome.
---
Personal preference.
---
For instance, I think Firefox sucks (except for their dev tools), but Chrome sucks more. Vivaldi is the best browser available right now, IMO.
---
&gt; So this isn't all that usefull for me.
---
Do you go around to *every single* guide/tip post and comment the same thing? I don't get this.  
---
It seems like you expect every single post here to be tailored to your preferences/needs. This is *clearly* intended for all those who use Netflix/YouTube and Chrome, which is a **very** high amount of players.  
---
The good thing about posts like this, is that others will often weigh in and add to the guide/tip for other types of users, e.g. Firefox users. Suddenly, the post is more relevant to you
---
As for your other comment:
---
&gt; You can't handle feedback very well, can you?
---
Maybe if it was relevant, fair, and useful feedback, people would handle it better. OP handled it fine, BTW. He was even kind enough to edit his comment for you, when he found out that it's also possible to do it on Firefox.
---
*"I don't use Chrome and Netflix, so this is not useful to me"* is not useful feedback in a public forum, where not every post is meant to be tailored to you anyway.
---
night mode , warm color, easy on the eyes etc etc
---
And its like 30-40g on mine :D
---
No idea what guild that is, but on Gehennas every horde guild has APES on KOS
---
Nobody gives a shit about your shit guild runs.
---
i know what youre trying to say but thats not how his math works
---
Did you just assume my race? Racist!
---
My fiancé is the one who got me into the game. She told me for years I needed to try it but never did. I’m sure she wishes she hadn’t introduced me to it because I play it all the time now.
---
Could get the swords from RFD and SM. High level enchants on them like striking or fiery can speed up leveling significantly as well. 
---
15 second kill time is pretty normal/above average though I'd say(on equal or higher targets). Using blade flurry/adrenaline rush/evasion to kill 2-3 mobs every 2-5min.
---
 I also like the opener of Garrote&gt;Rupture&gt;SS&gt;SnD. Especially on higher armor mobs(ie turtles, shield mobs). It's a grand total of 140 energy which makes it feel very smooth on a mob to mob basis because of the timing of the first two energy ticks lines up perfectly with 4 globals. Then SSx2&gt;Eviscerate usually finishes the job.
---
It's obviously not a serious meant name and I didn't have issues with that. It might be wise to judge by ones opinions, not just the name.
---
I’m never a random I always make the groups to make sure that everyone is treated equally no matter how much work I put in to form the group or get the key
---
Does consecrate damage them?
---
If the rogue is 60 and has a few magic resist pots, they go solo the flames.  Then the party moves in.
---
Nice!  I’ve been reluctant to do it as I’ve just focused on gear farming, but as it comes to an end/just getting jaded by not seeing drops I’ve been prepping myself to get into this farm.
---
In the toilet at work be like.
---
Sounds like you're on the right track! Keep it up!
---
Immo has very high damage per mana spent. Obviously rank 1 multi better.
---
Anyone else wondering what breadboi was doing when all this was going down?
---
At 35 you can get the occasional spell power gear here and there.
---
You can't stack it efficiently, and buying gear while leveling isn't efficient.
---
I wouldn't put spell power while leveling at 1-1 with either stamina or int.
---
You can start the game directly from the folder you've installed WoW. Fuck the launcher
---
Warrior def isn’t a auto attack grind people just don’t understand how to play them. They have good abilities to weaken Enemies like thunderclap sunder and demoralizing shout
---
Stranglethorn Vale.
---
The trees speak (Orcish/Darnassian).
---
The mage can only sheep once?
---
impoosible to tell do you sell 1000 leather n ore a day or only 10.
---
what i can say is once mining hits thorium on my server arcane crystals fetch around 7g a pop
---
All of what you said, now take away all the boe drops (blue or purple), and that’s where I am :(
---
You are wrong. The question was what is the best end game pvp spec and that is my spec.
---
Pretty sure I didn't wait that long but could be wrong.
---
Yep. But once they're active, if you're close enough for consecration, they're close enough to go boom and hit you.
---
After taking 1 or 2 booms in previous pulls, because they wouldn't focus fire them, I just started moving away from them. Sometimes cons did enough damage to destroy them, but not usually.
---
Just open them, the meat stacks
---
This. Op this is the answer you’re looking for.
---
Tough to say, if you are worried look up a good mob grinding spot where you can make a few gold and good xp per hour and you'll be fine. I found the lions in alterac near dalaran to be quite good in the level 32-37 range.
---
I have duo monitors but this is still useful so I don't have to keep turning my head to watch stuff!
---
Classic is beautiful everywhere. Except dustwallow, fuck that place :)
---
Benchwatching series while leveling is tiresome work!
---
Lol you tried man... This sub is full of idiots. As a mage whos solo farmed 25 of these patterns I totally understand where you're coming from. This subs view on BoE's is absolutely bizzare
---
You need plenty of agility for Lightning Reflexes to be worth it. And most people don't want to respec to be viable in PvE, which you have to do in Classic.
---
&gt;Saying it's a grey area is just you hand waving away your own selfishness so you don't have to face it.
---
Spell power is 12-1 int, and most decent pieces are at most 1-2 gold depending on server. I still use pieces i bought at 33 now at level 50. As long as you fon’t buy the most extreme items that’s really expensive it’s not bad value for money.
---
I have just stopped spending gold at around level 35 and had enough to get a mount at level 42 without any grind at all.
---
This is what character notes are for. IMO one of the *must haves* for classic.
---
I don't either. Made same comment in another thread, similar downvotes happened. Shrug.
---
What a dumb response. Mage is way more popular then you're dumb guild. Every class has their retards too so, don't think that just cause you're not a mage that you're some sort of genius.
---
Naga please
---
How? If he wanted to transfer funds, he'd use some other item that doesn't cost the value of an epic mount. That'd just stupid.

It’s a tactic to get a bidding war on. People treat AH as a real market (which i personally don’t.) I would just get used to it for a bit before the market floods with stuff, then people will be forced to undercut prices.
---
Spirit is great for warlocks (because mana=health and spirit boosts both) early on but as soon as you hit 40, assuming you went affliction, you don't need spirit or int anymore.
---
Very true.
---
What? It's one input per action. One character is not doing multiple things on that one input.
---
It does indeed work for Twitch!
---
It works with most video players you can find online.
---
WPL, EPL, Winterspring
---
First thing i posted on reddit
---
Can i just sit there with the Tab open and wait for it to respawn? Or do i have to go out and talk to them again to check if it restocked?.
---
&gt;And if you had progressed beyond basic economics you would know very well at this point that a low supply (a rare drop in this case) inflates the market price 
---
Mages, the only class who would use this pattern, can solo farm it which has resulted in it being very cheap.... Farmed 25+ on my mage.
---
That's fine. Let the people who want to run reserve groups run reserve groups. Usually they fill with classes who either can't roll against that item anyways, already have it, or simply don't care. No harm to you.
---
theres quite a few people so yeah
---
The tradeoff when leveling is basically you take 5% more damage but do 30% more damage and threat. Most people will take the latter.
---
I’d throw it on the AH for 500g. There’s really no harm if no one buys it and if someone does well then that’s money in your pocket making phase 1 easier.
---
I like how your character is even doing a facepalm
---
You never considered that a publicly traded company only ever acts in the interest of profit?
---
Have you missed the last 20 years in gaming?
---
Thanks for posting this, this sub can be super toxic instead of explaining. This was my first classic experience, and in low level dungeons I would immediately start throwing down blizzards. Not because I was “trying to be cool and copy streamers” but because I knew it would do damage to multiple targets and didn’t know how threat works.  A lot of people are really hypocritical and talk so much about the social aspect of the “classic wow experience,” but yet it never sounds like they try to teach someone that’s doing something wrong, they just bitch and complain on Reddit.
---
There is two 60s here.
---
Regardless of class he is doing well even without your toxic ass.
---
Let's face it, male night elves look ugly in anything
---
Seen it happen to a lesser extent but relationships break over the time sink.
---
Learn when you need to mana burn and when a proper silence will give you a kill window.
---
And third party programs aren't explicitly banned.
---
There was a Texas Holdem addon that me and my guild used to play back in the day.
---
Like Pokemon
---
Yeah, that plate armor we get at 40 is great for weakening Mage's magic
---
Mirror this feeling 100%. WoW peaked and I definitely peaked myself in WotLK both in pve With yogg+0  and later in ICC and in pvp by hitting a decent rating. I doubt I’ll ever enjoy wow as much as I did during that period however going back to vanilla is fantastic. 
---
All the memories!
---
Do you ever use herb pouch? I never feel like wasting a second bag slot.
---
Time to level an alt?!
---
This is the flaw of playing horde. Since Male hordes are essentially off limits you get the random pieces like this that are wildly different. :c
---
from another comment
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The top half of stv, the northern part of wetlands, or hillsbrad are all level appropriate for you. In a level or two there is also desolace and shimmering flats.

To play. We have a bench full of them waiting for someone, anyone, to call out. 
---
&gt; then you're dumb
---
Irony in three words.
---
Incredible math you have there.
---
Yeah, the two easiest classes to level.
---
It's impressive that he has two, but the mage really isn't impressive.
---
It is man. I just picked the first EST PvP server I saw I launch day....grinded like crazy for two days, was at level 35 ish when I finished my first huge grind of the first few days. Then I started looking online and stuff and realized it was a sever with "popular" streamers and was like ..... Shhhhiiiitttttt..... But no way was I restarting the grind again lol.
---
*Laughs in frost mage.*
---
My eyes oh god
---
Just because when you're gaming you're focused on one monitor does not mean having a second one makes it less ideal... I think you're just trying to make an argument that ultrawide is better than a normal monitor...
---
Well see, it took me about a month to get to level 37 (I said 35 but I fibbed a bit)
---
This is my first time playing wow, I never played it growing up because I always thought it looked lame, and my friends forced me to try retail about a year ago much to my displeasure.
---
Wtf is wrong with your actionbars. This is awful.
---
Edit: omg those keybinds
---
I think it has nothing to do with the post actually.
---
I remember farming them on my Shaman and the drop rate was abysmally low; wowhead/classicdb had them at ~4% drop chance. Would take me like an hour just to get 6 or 7 of them.
---
Frost Nova is better than anything a Rogue can bring to a 5man
---
Ar/prep 🤤
---
Still doubt it was as good as mutilate in wrath, not because of pure over powering kill potential, but because it was just soooooo well rounded
---
Shadow step hemmo was still pretty decent after ARs nerf
---
I would like to meat the creator of this post
---
Why not both?
---
Aren't people on Reddit actual human beings? Why not draw on multiple resources and share your issue with the wider world so more people can benefit from your experience. Reddit is a huge community of people to draw on. And yes I have worked in an office lol.
---
It's usually not too much of an issue! Just testing to ding 35 for first aid quest outside Theramore haha
---
Addons were pretty cheaty in vanilla. But most players either didn't know about them or didn't care enough to install them.
---
But honestly, I'd say there are more restrictions on addons in classic than in actual vanilla. More people just know how to use addons now so it presents itself like an issue when it really isn't
---
There are some Videos in YouTube.

I Appreicate it! Not a native speaker as you might've guessed, took most straight from english wiki: "He was hanged, drawn and quartered —strangled by hanging, but released while he was still alive, emasculated

[Endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect)
---
**Endowment effect**
---
In psychology and behavioral economics, the endowment effect (also known as divestiture aversion and related to the mere ownership effect in social psychology) is the finding that people are more likely to retain an object they own than acquire that same object when they do not own it.This is typically illustrated in two ways. In a valuation paradigm, people's maximum willingness to pay (WTP) to acquire an object is typically lower than the least amount they are willing to accept (WTA) to give up that same object when they own it—even when there is no cause for attachment, or even if the item was only obtained minutes ago. In an exchange paradigm, people given a good are reluctant to trade it for another good of similar value. For example, participants first given a Swiss chocolate bar were generally unwilling to trade it for a coffee mug, whereas participants first given the coffee mug were generally unwilling to trade it for the chocolate bar.A more controversial third paradigm used to elicit the endowment effect is the mere ownership paradigm, primarily used in experiments in psychology, marketing, and organizational behavior.

I always play a healer in MMO’s, including WoW when it launched, but this time I’ve avoided it trying several different classes. Only role I’ve never been comfortable with is Main Tank. Not because the mechanics of it but because I I forget the dungeons and that makes it a pain. Drop me in the woods or swamp IRL and I’m good, for some reason I turn around twice in a dungeon and I’m lost. /shrug
---
With a 3.40 attack speed what could go wrong ??
---
I didn't post the parent comment. My comments are relevant to what I was replying to.
---
Also, the title is easy game.
---
Of course it's easy when you literally pick the easy mode.
---
If only he weren't a scummy douchebag.
---
It's probably the buffoon, still loving it either way haha
---
Thats what you get for doing orange quests as melee? Yellow or green my friend, yellow or green
---
Essay? You call that handful of sentences an essay?
---
No wonder you have such an idiotic ideology. You're an idiot.
---
It can be overcome by making friend with healer/tank on your way to 60. The important part is making your own pug groups. As a tank warrior, I have couple rogue that I meet in scarlet monastery and brd dungeon that I prioritize to ask when making group because I know that they are reliable(know to interrupt, know to focus mark target).
---
I agree with you ... Once a bid is in place the item should not be able to be taken off
---
As a lvl 30 hunter, I found myself in similar position.
---
I went and did the wetland quests solo, eventually leading into me grouping up with people for the higher level 35-37ish quests. If you can find a group to do higher level quests it will bump you over that weird stuck at low 30's feeling.
---
The dream! mine won't even agree to try it. Been asking it for 11 years lol. Classic gave me some new hope... did not happen
---
As soon as they dodge im like oh boy you're in for some damage now ! *Miss*

I second this. Opera is a great browser for me personally. Seems to use resources way less than other browsers and I can overlay videos it's pretty cool.

Clearly you need to go be fat somewhere else.
---
I’ve finished Wetlands! Did the Dark Iron stuff with a group, which I really should’ve saved for now I reckon!
---
You frost nova 5 caster mobs. Now what? Wish that rouge was there to provide disables.
---
All classes are easy.
---
for clarification, it is actually "better" in a sense, that you can stack attacks while also resetting swing timer.
---
Problem is, it is MUCH less intuitive, and it requires you to spam a macro, which feels pretty buggy and weird, even though its potentially better.
---
I'm not like 100% laid back and don't care about progress and all that. But most importantly I simply just want to have fun. I don't care about my dps or doing things in this or that order and all that. Sometimes I run around for 3h just picking herbs, rezzing poor souls laying in the fields and flying from one city to the other to get things. And that's fun for me.
---
On the other hand it's totally fine to run around and being all about min/maxing and getting whatever you want asap. Just don't expect everyone to run your course all the time.
---
Sword is better for human objectively until you get MS iirc
---
Axe is always better for everyone else
---
Most of the mobs were yellow, I'm okay with a spicy orange fight once in awhile haha
---
That sheep just walked into the blizzard?
---
Can back this up. A friend introduced me to WoW back in 2006 and while he was there if I had any questions, he didn't hold my hand. He just allowed me to experience the game on my own and I think that's why I got so into it. If I had been bombarded with tons of knowledge I didn't need to know yet, I might've felt overwhelmed and quit. Sometimes it's better to just let the new player experience the game organically and find their own groove.
---
Shit. Time literally flies! :)
---
The seller can indirectly have a reserve by cancelling the auction. If I don't like that I'm not getting a large bid on my item I can just pull it and wait a day or two and try again.
---
If I’m lvl 26 can I help a group do Deadmines in sub 2 hours? I don’t think I can commit more than 2 to a single dungeon atm.
---
Noted. I've been a life long clicker lmao
---
I'd like Dual Specs
---
My boyfriend got me absolutely obsessed with Classic (and I haven’t played in 10 years! I’m NOT a gamer) he tells me the lure and stories and it’s so much fun! We just did the Link quest together. The only issue we had is when I picked up extra shifts at work and he kept grinding. If she feels like she’s being left behind, it’s so discouraging. But if you wait and level and quest together it’s the most fun bonding activity!
---
Now I’m a lvl 50 druid tank, he’s a 54 mage, and we’re the ones running all of his friends through dungeons! I never thought I would enjoy it so much, let alone be a higher level than all of his gamer friends 😂
---
It feels nice slaughtering things with your significant other ❤️
---
Slice and dice less, Evisrate more!
---
Go for Vanquisher Sword and Sword of Omen
---
(SM and RFD quest reward)
---
These have around 30dps and should help you burst things fast then Evisrate for the kill. 
---
Like 5-9 seconds per mob?
---
The issue lays more in the fact that rogues are just a really popular class.
---
It might be hard to get an invite to a raid because the group already has 8 rogues and 8 warriors.
---
So it's only "bad" because of the popularity. But really it shouldn't affect you too much. The more friendly you are and the more positive impressions you leave on people, then the better your chances are of getting invites!
---
Big goal for me was to get an SoJ for my eventual 39 shaman twink. Picked one up for dirt cheap the first week.
---
If you have worked in an office then you should know that directly talking with people achieves more than a written message. Writing an email is also communicating with an actual human being but it's different than talking to a human being over the phone or if you are in an office job: going over and directly talking with that person.
---
Ahh okay fair enough thanks guys :) I'll probably just get a sub.
---
Not really, you could go fury prot but you have to ask yourself why. Nobody is going to be pulling threat off of you as deep prot in preraid gear other than maybe during aoe which fury wont help anyway. All you're gonna be doing is making life hard for your healer with no real benefit. If you wanna go fury just be a dps imo.
---
What kind of bars addon do you use? I need more than the standard two max.
---
&gt; its cheat , blizzard will eventually find a way to remove it and ban you. But you still used something against the rules for some times. 
---
Blizzard makes an API with precise control over what addons are able to do and not do. They don't need to micro manage who and what addons are released.
---
No add-on can let you cheat and they'll never ban anyone for what an add-on can do. Unless it's some edge case exploits but that's never happened.
---
BTW, the spy addon simply watches the combat log. Any player can do that without an addon.
---
Okay maybe you are right I’m sorry. I’m bad with math. What I do is abuse that broken ah. I farm up to 200 essence and post all of them for 2.5g buyout and 1 copper bid. Because it’s broken the people without AH addon will see sorted by bid and will buy it because there are 50 sites of my essences. I do this with every enchant mat and mats without high ah fee. I cancel and repost them daily (you can cancel even if ppl bid on them). 
---
Ofcourse it’s kinda scam and I expect people don’t like it buts a game mechanic I’m willing to use. 
---
This has nothing to do with your post and I have no idea why I posted this. Have a good day
---
Everyone has their own playstyle.
---
If you roll pvp server you need to accept the fact that you will be ganked many times over the course of your experience. Most of the time the two factions are civil, but there are certain zones that are highly contested, namely tanaris and STV. For whatever reason these zones are straight battlegrounds. And it can be a lot of fun! If your really only interested in PVE then re roll on PVE server. But just know it takes an core element out of the game when you don't have to be apprehensive about the opposing faction.
---
Mr Godfrey, is this you?
---
ClassicCastbars
---
It will show you what spell your target is casting. It helps immensely, you're as good as blind without it.
---
I need spy as a solo questing warrior to make any progress... but I should not use it so you can get your ganks off easier? Nah, and I’m glad it has the function of reminding me who’s on my KOS list
---
Also remember that building a good reputation matters. Bring consumables, level your lock picking and allow people to roll on locked chests, change up your poisons for different needs, use blind to cc strays in pulls and please remember to always kick down casts. Rogues can bring utility to groups, but many do not by choice giving the class a bad rep.
---
You could do the first big room in brd as well as the tunnel guards
---
Yeah, but it's screwed up. It's gotten to the point on some servers where some groups even specify nothing is reserved, "nothing res". Yeah, that didn't happen on my server back in the day. If you joined a dungeon run, you were treated as equal to everyone else. Nothing is res was a given, not something that had to be specified.
---
Every set of tier gear was designed to take months to get. You can't get your entire tier 1 or tier 2 in 1 or 2 weeks, for instance. T0 is the same. Classic was always about the journey, not destination. Take your time and enjoy the game. You will get your t0 and pre-raid BiS eventually by doing enough Scholo, UBRS, LBRS, Strat, BRD, Mara, Dire Maul etc.
---
Hård i magen, nice.
---
My first Rogue in Vanilla (bearing in mind I played my brother's 60 rogue back then too) made it to level 31 and I couldn't get out of STV...
---
... Because I spent my entire play time ganking people and protecting the horde from high level Alliance by stunlocking them and running away. Had so much fun.
---
You just can't not do it as a Rogue. I'm not even sorry, and no doubt when I level my Rogue in Classic I'll probably do the same, minus the mindless ganking anyway I'm not that much of a dick any more.

Even he sold the gloves on the AH, he bought another pair and handed those over because they're BoE and it doesn't matter if they're the original ones that dropped or not. You are literally watching The Kardashians of gaming if you buy into anything Asmongold does as not pre-planned and mostly scripted.
---
TWO Shadowfangs?!
---
All add ons do have blizzards seal of approval. They can only use the tools provided by blizzard.
---
MRS. WRYNN GET DOWN
---
Do you mine
---
You miner
---
Almost sounds like they're mocking you
---
"Yeah I bet you do mine you fucking miner"
---
You break LOS and take zero dmg
---
Damn, Froskurrin lookin fine.
---
I have 5 now lol
---
Now find the source of the police radio chatter heard in every game that involves cops. Started with Need For Speed 3, maybe earlier.
---
Yup perfect advice. Game is about exploring, people gotta get a chance to do just that.
---
How’d you get this much gold already?!
---
*cries in tank with 3 full sets and multiple trinkets*
---
Shoulders are a bit weird imo
---
Highly recommend that. Addon totally changes the way you're feeling the world of quests. A must have, imo.
---
I tried to brought my dad in right back the end of vanilla, being lured by my classmate myself. It didn't work out well.
---
Looking back, I think it's because he had so many games on hand already, We had piles upon piles of game magazine, I remember watching him playing C&amp;C, AoE2, AoM, General, SC, War3, Battlecry, Blitzkrieg, Return to Wolfenstein, Sacrifice, FF7, all the way to Tom Clancy's Endwar and so much more.
---
He tanked his parents and wife when family tension was high, DPS to raise me and my sister without us ever worrying about money, heal us when we bump into hardship of life, all while being a gamer himself. He is a greater hero then I would ever be.
---
Damn!! All bought or get any yourself from SFK?
---
You run behind a wall and cast blizzard on those casters.
---
Because blizzard is an AoE you can hit them without being in line of sight, so you deal damage without recieving damage.
---
You do this all the time in BRD, inside the Tavern there are many casters, if you go for huge pulls like pull everything dowstairs in one go then you need to use your brain.
---
And mages got big brain... or it might just be that I'm flaming their ass in chat if they fuck up. I'm tanking btw.
---
AH
---
I bought a propeller hat from Spencer’s when I was a kid, and that was the only time I ever got lice
---
OR MAYBE DANNY BRO
---
Seeing an enemy on a pvp server and deciding to farm NEAR them is a prisoners dilemma game. Of course it's rare that players choose trust/trust, it's game theory.
---
*rogue stealth noise*
---
you better make sure that bitch is min maxing by level 2
---
You pay a fine on cancelling an ongoing auction.
---
I would also say BRD. If you are careful you can easy pull out 2 mobs in the first big room (care about pats, pull them to the front) I think you have enough time to constantly farm with 5 resets/hour
---
I usually dont care for streamers. But asmongold is a cock. 
---
Nice video
---
Who tf uses Firefox anymore
---
&gt; the noob who ventures off not knowing a single thing about the game
---
Literally the best way to play it. Have fun!
---
Wish I had that kind of gold. My highest char is only 26. Got some work to do! I’ve reserved the name Twnk though so it’s gotta be done eventually.
---
Fuck off, my frostbolt has a 36 yard range.  Gimme that.
---
I just don't get why people leave those stickers on there.
---
Same, with my Logitech G600
---
HI LUKE
---
Depends on your gear and class, and on the rest of the group. I have had sub 45 minute runs with all level 20's and below. I have also had hour and a half runs with most of the party around 22-23.
---
How to have miserable experience 101: enforce your hobby onto your partner.
---
I feel sorry for you.
---
I would suggest to group up with a warrior if possible. He can crush those mobs while you support him. This is the best thing about classic: different classes for different situations but together ur the best :) if you want to level alone: use melee gear like already mentioned
---
And Execute wiping all rage generated within of 800ms after pressing the button and not counting it towards dmg, basically rendering the ability useless? Enchants counting towards Buffcap and therefor rendering worldbuffs useless since they can get thrown off from a flurry?
---
Yes, but mages and priests are the easiest by miles.
---
Probably Daniel Lewis
---
Orange mobs are hunter loot, warriors need greens!
---
Sorry, I meant "Honorless Target", I typed that right before bed hehe. I'll edit my comment. Also "let people get away 40 seconds" means they're gone, unless you're CCing them in that time, that won't be easy to coordinate. I'm sure people will make a Weak Aura to avoid killing honorless people
---
Opera also supports this feature and it won't drain 99% (exaggerated) of your processor power to do it.
---
Been using a VPN for a while in China. Never had an issue. I think you are right, it must be from randomizing locations.
---
I got have a average of 25% miss. I got 1% hit atm. My mate with 3% hit has an average of 15% miss. If you calculate the missing dmg from misses you have your answer that hit IS the best stat atm.

Logs of the same fight with 2% Hit difference.
---
I think in BRD is It not so effective cause there Not as many Mobs that you can kill you need to reset many Times and maybe running in Dungeon Limit. My advise is get all Quests for sunken temple and that is probably lvl 54 , than do this in BRD and farm until you get all your pre RAID bis from this. Go WP and EP so the Quests you need this for some great items and Honor for argent Dawn, the Quests there is good for Partys and can be done really fast
---
Don't feel sorry for me, feel sorry that all of the morons are giving your class a bad name,
---
Renew is less mana efficient than your max lesser heal.  Both trigger the five second rule.  So, if you are attempting to keep your mana up, heal is better.  As long as you get full value.
---
Renew also heals for very little.  I healed RFC, renew was not enough.

So you wanted to play but were unable to pay for the service? Doesn't sound like blizzard customer service is at fault.
---
I went single target from 1-60 because I valued wpvp a bit more but a good 90% of the time I was grinding dungeons with spellcleave groups, even as single target, you can get away with it just fine because everyone else has imp blizzard, and you just ae/Coc nova packs and do just fine.
---
This post is now 16 hours old. Level 30 yet?
---
There is no riding skill for 300 mounts, this ain't private Servers of decent quality, this is a clunky virtualized low effort version of Vanilla.
---
But ofc Reddit won't tell you that, because people hanging out here maxed their first char to 30-40 just now and are AAAMMAAZEEED by the quality. They won't eben be shattered when they die in raid due to faulty batching a healing spell, grabbing the mana from healers but not healing the target.
---
People who aren't sheep.
---
Lol as someone evidently proved to you, because online cookies don’t mean anymore than internet points.
---
I'm maining a Troll Mage now; mained an Undead Rogue 15 years ago.
---
Learning how to push the mage's boundaries is a lot more fun than replaying a class I know the ins-and-outs of.
---
It came from StarCraft korean players actually.
---
I’m a tank and i love to take rogues. If they get aggro they don’t die in 1 hit due to dodge, they can stun mobs and even some bosses if we have trouble. I would take rogues over fury warriors all the time. For 40 men guild raid: look for a guild that needs a rogue and done
---
fucking nice. just got mine solo with the same strat.
---
Wants his guildmembers to ninjaloot from non guildies, for example.
---
Numerous similar things. He is extremely selfish and acts entitled because he is "famous"... even though he looks like a 50 year old semibald ginger who lives in his parents house
---
People who don't like botnets
---
Let the enemies hit the tank for 3 seconds, then blizzard. He needs rage (probably) or its just white hits and prayers
---
Lionheart helm - 900g
---
Arcanite reaper - 1050g (arms tanking 5mans)
---
Aniilator - 700g
---
Not crafted but boe:
---
Skull flame shield 250-400g
---
Edgemasters 400-1000g (unless you picked the wrong race)
---
Off the top of my head, haven’t looked threw the list I’m sure I’m forgetting something
---
You suck at conveying anything online besides a lack of confidence. Try emoji you twat.
---
No, blizzard would take money out of our card and then innexplicably return it 12 hours later, i even tried paypal...
---
i think im playing on a tryhard server because it's as toxic as any other mainstream game and i've seen zero wow noobs, it also has the most imbalanced faction ratio, and my lvling experience is people non stop trying to tag steal mobs, ore, chests everything. No random kindness on stalagg
---
I play a warrior.  You really need to stop projecting.  You look like an idiot.
---
4k standard. Lol. 120hz 1080p over it any day.
---
You think I give a shit what people here think about me. That's cute. P.S. Second largest group of idiots is warrior, so there you go.
---
Why is the mage giving a cookie instead of the warlock? Healthstones are referred to as "cookies" :(
---
why
---
Or maybe people just use it mostly for leveling...? Doesn't mean it's bad lol obviously mouse + keyboard is what you want for "serious" play but there's nothing wrong with this setup for casual leveling whatsoever.
---
Not only does this whinge post reek of cringe, but you actively think faerlina is home of the "cool kids"?
---
Dear god you're a lost cause.
---
Ice block for sure
---
He was pretty good at warrior at one stage and he is pretty funny at times. I dont think he is that bad
---
Unique. Not twonique, or more. Lol
---
I have 20g at 33 I'm fucked
---
Sorry what exactly are you trying to do? Can you explain one more so I can help
---
 You might have to equip a shield for a few bosses. Rattlegore, krastinov, drakk, are a few of the bosses you might consider equipping a shield (and others) but otherwise you're fine.
---
Removing the 1 hr delay when mailing stuff to alts.
---
You don't get less xp from green quests, only grey affects xp gained
---
Also I get the feeling you're not telling us the whole story. You probably got banned for swearing at the GM or something.
---
I fail to see a racial reference in my statement.
---
It's generally not worth levelling in a pure healing spec even if you plan to heal dungeons, because you weaken your soloing ability
---
What if I hate all genders except proper ones?
---
Removed? :(
---
Vast mayority of tanks will do it in fury/arms specs even into 60s raiding
---
Not if the items doesn’t have ah fee for example enchanting mats
---
Not very related, but I bought my second 1080p screen for like 20 CAD which is 15 USD used at one of those sketchy computer stores. They are pretty cheap.
---
Priest. 
---
Thought I'd try something different, and I rolled a mage when classic launched, hit 33 and looked around. Got tired of begging for tanks to run a dungeon, and noticed everyone else was a mage. 
---
So I rerolled Warrior. Hit 35, and got tired of dps in dungeons wanting to gogogo, and immediately start aoe'ing. Last straw was doing an SM run, and asked a Paladin if it was too hard to attack the skull. That I was trying to learn to tank and his off target threat was making things more difficult for myself and the healer (he was also +5 levels). He lol'd and said "because this is easy". 
---
So, I went back to old reliable (was priest up to wotlk, when I stopped playing). I enjoy priesting anyway. Just caught up to my warrior yesterday, and having a great time.
---
When you spend a lot of time with people - be it online or otherwise - you tend to get to know them.
---
It's a new F R E S H that's been out for a few weeks now called "Classic", made by a small team called "Blizzard Entertainment"
---
Make the whole family with small blueberries with a tie and wife with mittens.
---
Firefox is really good now you should give it a try. Use really less memory than Chrome, and whithout keeping all your privacy files :)
---
You can set overlapping nameplates in settings
---
&gt;All day I had been seeing groups for dungeons with stuff like no hunters, no cloth dps (no mage or warlock, really?), mage only etc and I was sick of it.
---
Really?  I rarely see stuff like this.  Plenty of stuff on reserve, though.
---
Damn.  You should find someone to talk to.  You need help.
---
So the rant is due to come on the next post?
---
I like how you made the ud excited without a mouth :D
---
We literally had more powerful add-ons like this back in vanilla that could play the game for you - that's not possible anymore.
---
Probably bartender. But for the love of god, don't activate all 2000 bars and put them in the middle of your screen. It's the real reason my groups always suck. Not Netflix.
---
So I can't write "I was born in the Republic of the Niger"? Weird!
---
Did you get the idea from moonmoon’s stream?
---
One action per key press.
---
Day 4 is a portrait of the Lich King. So not Classic, sadly :P Thanks!
---
Isekai inside game oh shitttt
---
Does rage in bear show the warrior tooltip?
---
Hmm?
---
 Bruh, where’s the 1 hunter in there?
---
I feel for you lol
---
I have that the retail mindset has infected classic. But it's too late now, genie is out of thr bottle.
---
How about you don't go for oranges as a warrior and don't use sunder, but something more heroic.
---
Or even a lock!
---
If you want to, you can pretend it's being said by one of the warlocks further down the line.
---
My guild used to refer to any kind of bread as cookies back in the day, and especially in BC.
---
No jaw and no eyebrows. He is the absolute worst to emote with lol
---
Mages are broken already no need for that :S
---
Just had a warden staff drop there so.. there's a chance.
---
or :put your phone next to the monitor
---
How does so many have that staff and bow already wtf
---
I was thinking this also .. will give it a try
---
Make a chrome bookmark with this as the url;
---
javascript:document.getElementsByTagName('video')[0].requestPictureInPicture();
---
Start the video then click the bookmark. This will let you popout player netflix, youtube, twitch, etc. Any player pretty much.
---
Damn, haha
---
I really like that you have to be careful what abilities you use and you will get punished if you use the wrong ability.
---
thanks mate
---
tanking dungeons as fury or arms is perfectly fine at any level, even 60
---
2560g on a fresh 60?  I’m doing. Something wrong
---
Jummy
---
Good one, way to really stick it to me. Representing your class well.
---
He's [right](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ddkyz5/when_the_party_is_clearing_masses_of_nonelite/f2jds9j/) [here](https://i.redd.it/v45v5nwjhdk11.jpg)
---
Accidentally pull too big. Mage walks up Cone Of Cold to snap aggro, then frost Nova, runs back and hits blizzard. They slowly kite to the mage and nobody takes any damage. The circle jerk on here has made this guy think evasion tanking comes anywhere close to that.
---
Cool story bro
---
Until the hammer falls, the item isn't sold and still belongs to the owner to do with as they please.
---
It isn't. It is agaisnt rule 1. They get constantly removed.
---
I don't watch streamers, least of all asmon. Just hear about that stuff here. I didn't know that he re-bought a pair and all that. That definitely changes things a bit, yeah
---
I wouldn’t use chrome either. I use either edge or safari.

Almost as good as the boar swimming animation

Can you really not understand why someone would watch football rather then play it
---
Spent an hour looking for a tank for brd arena runs. Everyone else in lfg was looking for a warrior too. So I started throwing things in like "if you join our party we will tell you how great you are at tanking after every run even if you're bad."  The one that got two responses was "reason number one you should join our party: the other groups wont appreciate you like we will. The other groups think of you as just some wall, but we know you are really a person." Got two responses off that one right away.
---
E: phone spelling.
---
I strongly recommend against taking two gathering professions as a new player. For one, two gathering profs slows down questing considerably. Secondly its depriving them of the crafting side of the game. Some can be loads of fun while leveling, Alchemy in particular.
---
The only upside to double profs is that it's easier to get a mount at 40. However, someone who isn't trying to race to 60 can easily wait a couple of levels, and money is a lot easier to come by in the 40s
---
Spent all day there yesterday. Started probably 2/3 of the way through 52, and left 1/4 way through 54.  So many quests. And references.
---
&gt;I'm asking "What could you possibly have to gain by posting anything in the first place?"
---
He gains the satisfaction of knowing he made a positive contribution to humanity. He posted it for the same reason anyone post anything to Reddit.
---
In this case the post is funny and ironic. So he is bringing joy to people's lives by sharing the funny ironic situation.
---
Paladin.  It started back in my D+D days where I often played Clerics and Paladins, so I enjoy that particular class fantasy.  I have loved the class in almost all iterations of the game since the start, but back in the day I was often asked to play other roles due to my guild at the time being full-up on heals, so this time around I am excited to be able to play the class as a main.
---
The tankiest clothie ! There literally is an armor set meant for locks that have a ton of armor on it
---
You don't really get to say otherwise without being wrong.
---
If your shadow bolts hits for about 950 then 33 shadow damage will add something like 32 damage assuming you're using SM and have CoS up. That's a 3.37% improvement in your damage. 
---
1% hit gives you a little over 1% improvement to overall damage.
---
Is that some addon you're usinh for dialogue to appear like that?
---
This is objectively false. An extra sword swing can crit and also proc off itself, swords have always had superior burst potential which is why maces and swords were the favoured PvP choices in 2006
---
Why aren’t more hunters playing to their AoE potential? Gorillas bring nice burst DPS and paired with Beastial Wrath he keeps the agro there.
---
My new favorite is the Carrion Bird. 10% armor, Screech puts him at #2 on threat list, armor helps survive, KEEPS MOBS AT TANK. Max rank multishot and volley, I match or sometimes out DPS Mages and Locks. You don’t run out of mana that fast; the only way I’m running out of mana is if I sting every mob before I AoE 
---
You can’t tell me every Mage and Lock I’ve been with are playing wrong or not trying, that’d be almost everyone
---
Toxic post got a gold lol fuck this community
---
Those yeti are awesome... They're humanoids so they drop money and for some reason they can also be skinned... They tend to trop a good amount of valuable grey weapons as well
---
Not necessarily
---
Needs chained essence of eranikus in second panel
---
The orange shirt and devilsaur pants look pretty bad with it though.
---
Yea it literally does mean that so...
---
Attack asked doesn't matter anywhere, just top end damage
---
it is better 'raw' dps because it effectively improves your speed to 3.0, however with fluffy and windfury procs its better to cancel it for single-target in hope for WF/crits.
---
Done it quite a few times without a mage or lock
---
Followed this step by step since lvl 1 and I had so much fun.
---

---
This is pretty huge, thank you
---
Good luck.  Hope it was nice having a wife, cause you just lost her to the most dangerous addiction.  God speed
---
TLDR:
---
AOE players bad (retail players, very bad btw)
---
Old school players very cool and good at the game because they do dungeons at half the pace BUT They use cc and let the tank hold aggro!!!
---
Walk out to the little balcony porch area behind Lard.  You’ll see the ZZs
---
You have to manually swap them unless you use their launcher and pay for the auto updates as far as I know. Even if it’s out of date 9/10 times it usually doesn’t break anything anyways
---
Skill in a weapon goes a long way, so human racial is pretty good for leveling with the sword. PvP then just go for the axe, but I’m assuming nobody intends to stay level 30
---
Lol it says “Warrior abilities require rage...”
---
You’re just a casual who wants everything given to them and doesn’t want to work anything. I’ll stay up 48 hours and play through. If you don’t play hard then don’t play.
---
If fans of seafood were ninja looting stuff you need you would be pissed
---
The chrome PiP works with twitch, you’ll need to bookmark a command tho since twitch has its overlay on the video
---
Tell me the minimal us wage and we can discuss this further
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Yea the video shows a run that gets u 75g an hour, sell one ring over that hour...now you are at 100g
---
This is such strange logic.  Axes are better because it's just crit, not a proc?
---
You do realise that, mathematically, sword spec can do more damage?  A swing critting is nice, but an extra swing which can also crit is even nicer.
---
I played the game back in the days and most people and theorycrafters agreed sword was superior to axe, hence why it eventually got nerfed in wrath.
---
The truth is 5% chance to get an extra attack is a proc.  5% chance to crit is also a proc.  Proc stands for programmed random occurrence.  Critting is an occurrence. Critting is random and it's also programmed.
---
Or you know have it 50/50.
---
that's not a moonkin, that's a moonglow speced resto druid.
---
I always read random books throughout tge world. I just read Jitters journal from the Sven questline in Duskwood. Pretty interesting
---
Bullshit, didn't they give out free transfers for the full servers like yours? Seriously, stop lying... 
---
At this point nobody is gonna believe that you ended up on the streamer server by accident
---
Side note: the dude who joined got super wierded out when we were over the top nice to him. "I think your character names cool" one member kept saying how big and strong he was. Didn't ask the rest of the members if they were in on my plan eigher everyone just started laying it on thick as per my promise in lfg. After about three minutes he asked why we were patronizing him and could have lost him so be careful!
---
Wait, that is possible?
---
Yeah, that does suck.  Remove cancel if there is a bid.
---
Absolutely wrong! I'm leveling a feral druid in full greens and it's an total breeze.
---
Yes it's called my main :P
---
So you didnt even watch the video....typical redditor
---
I wonder how many people(like me) fish at this particular spot because they think they can get the quest at 200 but have to grind for the last 25 to get the quest.
---
Totally Agree! 2x gathering can be abit tedious.
---
I just hear some New players waiting with proffesions until lvl 40 or not doing them at all.
---
Proffesion is not a big focus, focus is to have fun.
---
But it's easy and fun to keep proffesions up to date also, and it can be a nice income. 
---
Theres alot of lazy lvl 60 in all server economies now so prices for certain ores and herb should go up.
---
I can laugh at the class I play passionately and make a fun post about it. Can you?
---
Get a pet with Screech or Thunderstomp
---
Haha the post started off as a bit of a rant.
---
any comments on this  rogue build?  The idea is to be able to use any wep type while still doing good damage in dungeons and raids
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fGefoxzVZGcVb0Vz
---
It is I, Luke from childhood.
---
And?  Like I just said I dislike people on their own demerits, one of which is certainly ninja-looting.  But I wouldn't then transfer that dislike to the seafood they were fans of.  I wouldn't be like, "man seafood sucks and is stupid because people who like it are ninja-looters!"  That's just stupid.
---
And priests, warlocks and druids. Even shamans for the horde side. No, a warrior only gets that dagger if no one else needs it.
---
SAME
---
In ol vanilla my server was like 40-60 in favour of alliance .But we managed to kick their ass around and especially in bgs as they were more pve focused .Bgs were server Bgs so built some real rivalrys not cross realm bgs
---
How could I forget that, I do that all the time in those situations. :&lt;
---
This is grand. Thank you! I \_do\_ have dual monitors, but I tend to forget I'm watching something when the video is so far to the left. Nicer to have it within my game view.
---
Such a great movie.
---
In this scenario the seafood encourages it and doesn’t care if it’s followers do it
---
There's also a program I sometimes have use for: desktop pin. Keeps whatever you pin always on top. Don't use it a lot as I got a 2nd monitor recently but it's still nifty sometimes!
---
My mechanical squirrel pet in classic does the same thing 😁 they are magic
---
Oh this! I gotta see!
---
I’ve been doing it for a while, on my phone at work, on my iPad in bed.
---
Steam link, just load wow as a non steam game and find a custom WoW controller scheme. There are Addons or user uploaded schemes to steam. There aren’t any classic WoW user uploads so I had to find one in retail wow and it transfers over automatically.
---
Maybe it was just Saturday night. There weren't too many posts like that but it was a good third at least. The reserve thing drives me mad as well. Fair enough if its a guild run and the others have more gear than you. But for pugs it's just ridiculous. Part of classic is having to run dungeons a few times to get items. Roll need and hope like the rest of us haha!

What's the reason for the timing?

Leveling a warrior atm but want an alt to level with a friend. I notice that I like pressing a lot of buttons / classes with a complex skill rotation. Thinking about making either a Shaman or Druid. How do they play? (leveling, not end game. Doubt I'll reach 60 soon)
---
Ok, sorry, the axe has better burst 99% of the time. The sword has better burst if you...

Dont have mortal strike

Yeah, that might have been the case with my totem. Thanks for your input, I made a rank 1 Earth Shock macro.
---
Stick to greens tbh. Fighting a mobs 2-4 levels below you is day and night.
---
Eh it kinda depends, it's a good threat trinket, and tank bis isn't exactly set in stone.
---
I block any person who chimes in with "technically deadmines isn't DM." If you need people to think you're cool by correcting an acronym for a low level WoW dungeon, I have zero interest in playing with you. Petty? You bet. Do I care? Not at all!
---
Please be kind and elaborate for me then.
---
Nah line of sight should still break them. Nobody is arguing you should see nameplates of things you have no vision of. But not seeing nameplates of mobs you are already attacking is just stupid. Screens evolved!
---
Wish it was 16x9 so i could use it as wallpaper. maybe just make a version that had the wood to fill it up?

Questie though? Do you still get that new zone feeling?

I know im right and i know you are wrong. I have proof and you dont. Go ahead and compare the whole log between me and koj and you have your answer. Cba wasting my time cause you are retard. This is not Nost or elysium with itemization. And the fucking bislists on google or wowhead are 70% wrong if you have your source from there.

Tooth of eranikus MH /Bone slicing hatchet OH are good alternatives as well. Dont go dal rends unless u wanna gear 3% more hit for yellow cap.

Yup

They are using Dominos Classic. If you look at their minimap you can see a little dominos icon. I also use it and like it.
---
Now I can also watch Joe Rogan instead of only listening :D

They won't merge realms this early, or at all,in fact. People care too much about their names.

You could've used steam/chrome viewer to get yourself in queue early in the day, lots of people did it without issues.

It was YOUR choice to transfer off, no one forced you. Choices have consequences. It sucks, but it's the harsh reality.

This is gonna suck for her if she feels like you are mansplaining the whole thing and she’s just being bossed around. I know it’s exciting but, do not spoil her experience by jumping in to explain things before she asks for help. It doesn’t feel like help, and if you’re not careful it can lead to resentment. This could be a really cool thing for your relationship so long as you don’t push her.
---
See, here's how reddit works: Some moron (this would be you) sees someone get downvoted repeatedly and feels the need to chime in about feelings and shit. I'm perfectly fine, I don't need professional help like another moron suggested, I just really, really don't give a shit about any of you.
---
The joke everyone I played with made when they picked it up
---
You can but you shouldn't
---
So it works inside a dungeon ?Damn forgot that
---
Just hit level 47 on my Warlock and been using the shadoweave set. Just curious, when do I start replacing these pieces? Only with other +sp or +shadow gear? I don't want to fall too low on +stam as I'm on a pvp server.

But he's not rolling on an upgrade, he's rolling on money.

Barrens plainstriders, RRREEEEE
---
Get some cushions for that bench.  Comfort is key
---
Reddit is full with these people now. This is the start just watch when people have wow based weddings, birthday cakes and cosplays. Also don‘t forget those celebration events when all these boomers on reddit finally hit level 60 or raid 1st time in phase 3. Also if you did that before them you‘re pretty much uncool :)
---
Please tell me how that item is an upgrade, how does getting it improve his character.
---
Just use OnTopReplica. It's the easiest fastest means of doing this and works with literally anything on windows.
---
Try Win + Shift + s
---
Boes? Yea.
---
Thanks
---
I'm not saying you should have stayed, the queue times were ridiculous. I'm just saying it wasn't some great act of sacrifice. You made a choice, maybe you didn't have any good options, but you chose to try something different to enhance *your* experience. 
---
The choice I made was to wait a couple weeks to sign up. Should I get a level boost? No, and I certainly won't act like the delay was to enhance the enjoyment of others.
---
No, I'm just amazed at the hate they get for just doing their own thing. Seems like the classic community are either people enjoying the game like those guys or retards like you who envy them so they get angry and pissed about everyone and anything... but are still to fucking stupid to go to another server and avoid the one server the streamers are chilling on.
---
Learn to solve your own problems kid, its just ridiculous how dumb you act
---
I don’t think you understand the situation. If people made mistake when they were placing a lot, they could freely take it off the AH while there was no bid. If there is, an item does not belong to them anymore. Full stop. It is the same as somebody bought it with the full price, you are unable to cancel that, aren’t you?
---
I lost my time waiting to be the last to place the bid so to win the lot.
---
The fine doesn’t help at all. For those who are lvl 40+ and can afford a mount and earn at least 3-4g a day, a 1-2g fine for expected profit of 40g is nothing.
---
Yikes, best of luck man
---
The healer refused to rez you? What a childish thing to do.
---
A grown man who works in a mine.
---
Its so easy to get every sm drop tho
---
Feral druid is one of the easiest classes to level, I'd argue that only hunter is easier. It's also equally fast to hunter.
---
Drawing a conclusion from a sample size of 1 when the 1 isn't even a good sample is hilarious.
---
"Hey guys I missed 25% times and my friend with 3% hit only missed 15%. Therefor 3% hit is 10% and the actual chance to miss is 25% and not 17%!"
---
The fact that you think you're being logical is the best part.
---
For my server silk is generally best to make into bandages and then vendor. It routinely sells for 1s 80c while silk bandage vendors for 2s. (Heavy silk cuts the crafting time down by half and nets the same profit since it vendors for 4s taking 2 silk cloth.) Then factor in cost to post, and AH cut, you come out much more ahead. 
---
Just craft it while you skim the AH for deals. Occasionally silk goes as low as 1s50c for me. So for a stack of silk bought off AH I can make 10s profit for about 10 seconds time spent crafting.
---
Sadly none of the other cloths work this way for my server. Linen doesn't work unless they sell for under vendor price, wool has always been stupid expensive, then by mageweave people seem to know what's up and same with runecloth.
---
In fairness we had a tank before the warrior came but he dropped out. That's why I said he stepped up
---
Knowing things is obviously not his strength ;)
---
You vs the girl he tells you not to worry about
---
This is what I do streaming from my Plex server
---
You as well, hope you get that degree in therapy you so desperately feel you deserve.
---
No, need need/greed system works by separating rolls that people need, i.e. can't get anywhere else and items that are purely money.
---
Cute though one little typo.  "Aren't you?" should be "Are you?" for this case.
---
I am currently a 48 holy pally,  not sure if I should go Ret the rest of the way to 60 or not.  Dungeon leveling when you include the waiting time for everyone to arrive seems really low.   I also enjoy healing so I'm torn between the two
---
you just made leveling 2000 times better , thanks man , i would give you gold on reddit , how about 1 gold in wow tho ?
---
It is currently bugged. Try this add-on that supposedly add the bars back: McCapFix. 
---
I haven't tested it yet but I don't see why it wouldn't work.
---
Yep, this is on my list once we get the office cleaned up and get her a desk.
---
Tune in to Venruki or Ziqos stream and you’ll find out. In short you farm the graves with the zombies in it. 40-50g and hour and more if you’re super efficient(I’m not).
---
Druid shifting.
---
Usually people saying "no hunters" or "no cloth dps" means that they don't want competition on a certain drop.  It has nothing to do with meta group comps really.  As a hunter, I couldn't get an invite to SM armory or Cathedral because every warrior tanking that place just wants to soak up the mail and doesn't want competition.  It's not that they have anything against my class, they just didn't want to compete.  I got invites to SM when I responded to LFG spam "hunter dps I dont want any of the mail gear, just want to finish my quests".  
---
On another note, I've run a few groups where we had 2 hunters with our pets tanking (instead of a proper tank) and it worked just fine.  The game is very forgiving up until BRD, as far as group comps go.
---
Bagnon?
---
Literally me in Uld last night

Okay.... KID .... go hang with your Olympus XIV, or whatever number of cult members you have now; and continue to all chat about how one day you all pray you get to even smell one of asmonbalds farts in the wind.
---
There ain't a lot of rogues on pve servers

Hey, you can be very competitive as a feral. You just have to farm dozens of these babies for every raid, instance and battleground:

You're some man for one man I'll tell you that

I knew about the youtube one, but Netflix too? Idk if I deserve this power.

So why do you care so much about a developer you don't care about and a game you wouldn't play anyway?
---
omg ty!!!!!
---
We don’t need em
---
Bagnon. I dont know if I can post a link so just google that or add curse addon etc you'll find it but bagnon is probably what you're looking for.
---
Maybe the the fact that I "can't comprehend" it has to do with the fact that I've asked about 20 times for a reason other than money the mage would roll on it... and nobody has managed to give me one.
---
I swear, officer. I thought she said she was a miner!
---
Make tons of gold while watching anime with this one simple trick! Dino campers hate him!

To be honest their "ready to attack" animation is pretty good and who doesn't want to constantly do flips when they're jumping?

What's the addon that display floating text damage like this video:

https://youtu.be/HrJqWag8cqs

Shows cc and spells being used and dmg done to you.

You're attitude is so fucking toxic it's actually stunning. Maybe you don't need professional help but you definitely need a break or KitKat or something.
---
That is the one I use. Works great!

Classic looks like so much fun /s

I like to help people that haven't seen it yet. Don't really care about angry redditors that spend too long in /new/

Exactly. When retail mages find out you actually have to cc mobs.

My are attitude. Here's another moron chiming in.
---
What's the difference in the two scenarios? Other than of course one happens in a game and the other happens in the real world.
---
Yea. Did brd lava run was healing it. Guys says if you take too many ticks just use natures swiftness. I'm like uh yea sure mate. I'm 31/0/20, nobody even notices
---
Think what you will, but the only thing i even did with the account was level a priest, couldnt even use chat as it never stopped being a starter account, and my communication with the GM was respectful, nice assumptions bootlicker
---
This guy posts in MGTOW lol
---
That's because the target can't be in combat if you want to sap.
---
Patchwerk is really good atm
---
TAKE MY UPVOTE
---
Yeah, I'm saying the tanks are the ones breaking it while the rogues are trying to do what they're supposed to.
---
Takes more than 1 min to hearth like that, prolly wont make it in time
---
Well isnt that motivation enough that your life will be destroyed if you start playing?
---
I won a bid for 140 and now they're up to 220-240
---
Looking forward to Exception.
---
Thanks mate
---
The person dealing damage is most certainly a DD and not a DPS, though...
---
VLC lets you stream from anywhere and has an "always on top" checkbox.

Easy sell on AH, it used to be 700g until mages learned they could duo farm it, so it's like 50g each now
---
Where the fuck are all you coding nerds when I need help with my hw ffs
---
I use arkinventory. I dont know about bagnon, but it is popular as well. I know ark allows me to create separate areas for bag stuff. Like, it all opens in 1 bag, but I have an area for quest items, trash, profession items, toys, soulbound equip, unbound equip, etc.
---
&gt; autocorrect

Nowadays it knows the difference between the possessive form and the contraction, but let's go with that and get you fed even more karma since this is probably the greatest thing that will ever happen to your reddit account.
---
Succubus, especially once you get the drain mana spell
---
you can tank everything in the game with a fury spec, just be ready To switch weaps and stance. with that said i dont think it is worth To do that before getting gear
---
skinning knife with fiery enchant is actually BiS OH until mid 40s!
---
Is it just me or are you far too worked up about wow?
---
It's funny how different peoples perspectives can be. I leveled as arms and went fury at 50 and enjoyed it *much* more. Waiting on a 3.8s swing timer is torture for me, and flurry made using a 2h much more tolerable while I had to.
---
I managed to find some success by letting her play and just watching. Then when she asked any questions I just answered back like I'm a complete idiot and know nothing about WoW. "Oh I dont know, that guy looks like he has a question mark on his head!!".... God Speed, Op.
---
This cant be classic, are those 3 bottomless?
---
Totaly or half duration?
---
Just you. Grinding out elementals and waiting to regen since I'm going to bed soon.
---
should've told that the huge outrage mob that was screaming for it months ago :\^)
---
Really depends on the build. If you respec out of imp imp then succ will do a lot more damage while being able to cc when needed. But for pre succ. Imp is the way to go.
---
Nah I mean people should be dicks to one another anyway, but if you choose to take a paladin tank (and you often will because there’s generally a shortage of tanks for 5 mans), or a bear tank for that matter, then you need to account for that and focus your DPS, wait for mana breaks, use threat dropping abilities, etc. 
---
You can’t expect to go into a 5 man and just play your class however you want without accounting for your party members.
---
Most certainly cant write about the Republic of Niger or the river of the same name...Same with Nigeria.

Leveling a Feral Druid and really enjoying it, but I think I might like to heal at 60. Can I still quest at 60 with Resto spec/gear?
---
The games on auto pilot
---
I have not heard anything about cross realm.
---
*randomly opens trade window with mage and says nothing*
---
I personally think that Blizzard will eventually introduce character transfers and faction changes (certainly not faction change to the same server though).  They'll never make a class change.  Blizzard can't resist that sweet extra cash.
---
As far as paying money for a faction change, consider how much your time is worth.  If a faction change costs $60 (assuming you have a job or other source of income), how long would it take you to earn an extra $60?  Would it take less time to do that than it would to level a whole new character to 60?
---
I know I'll catch some grief for this..  but I have found the twitch desktop app to be the best addon manager, as well as having every addon that I have looked for. Also, you can keep them all updated. Give it a shot. And yea, bagnon works very well, and has a new auto clean feature for sorting items. Glhf!
---
Is it better to start playing gold conscious now or wait until I'm almost 40 and farm?
---
I'm currently 29 and only have 12g I have a feeling I'm going to need to change something before hitting 40. My prof are herb/alch/first aid and I'm a mage. I didnt level cooking or fishing
---
Absolutely, if I use special shots I pull aggro off the pet. And autoshot lets my mana top off for mends and the occasional aimed/trap/aggro juggle.
---
What's the addon showing you 'nearby' enemies?
---
Must be busy using the keyboard for turning
---
So the epic mace from brd would be bad on a pvp rogue build? Or is it great
---
You mean the role they got pigeon holed into. There were more trees than just holy.
---
Paladins on release were a last minute rush job and a bad one at that.
---
So, druids feel like you don't have many abilities when you play them because most skills are locked behind one form or another. Also your main action bar changes with a formshift, so you'll find you don't wind up with many abilities on the bar at a given time. However it does take a lot of skill to know when to change forms, when to use what, etc. So based on your "many buttons" or complex rotations ideas, I'd recommend another class. If you're really just desiring something that requires skill and provides versatility, you won't find a better class than druids.
---
I mean no it would be op as fuck
---
If there were "literally 0 logic" in my comment then you wouldn't be able to address any of the points as if they were connected. You just don't like either the premises or the conclusions. "Yikes".
---
&gt;Yeah sure you play another class but for some reason decided to put up a priest flair, because that's really the function of that flair and is soooo common on this sub.
---
It's reasonable to presume that someone with a certain flair has experience with what their flair presents, absolutely, but you're taking it to heights where you're saying that I *must* play a Priest right now and that I *must* have only ever played a Priest. That last bit is even more interesting. As if you knew what I played back in Vanilla or now. You'd be wrong based on what you think thus far though (I tanked and didn't play a Priest during that span).
---
Your comment that I've only witnessed spellcleave from a Priest perspective is the issue though. You don't think I've seen it as a Warrior, even back in Vanilla? It wasn't as common but guild mates would easily do it. I'm curious as to what made you think I've only seen it from a Priest's perspective.
---
Weirdly though, your comment has been deleted. By you. Wonder why you'd do that.
---
&gt;Not to mention that a quick peak on your profile already confirms exactly that you're a fucking priest, so stop the dumb act.
---
I have *a* Priest, absolutely. Trying to get into it. It's not even my highest character. I just put the flair up since it's what I'm trying now, but it's by no means what I'm knowledgeable about. This is Reddit. It's a flair. You're taking it too seriously if you're trying to draw conclusions.
---
&gt;Spellcleave is awesome and you're salty because you didn't get a good group on your first try, happens mate.
---
We cleared SM a few times. I got a ton of XP and items. Boring though. And it saw a Rogue get kicked that I tried to invite. It also doesn't take a mathematician to realize that the numbers for 9 classes don't favor it. Overall I'm not interested in unsustainable groups that kick people. Most people aren't.
---
Even if that’s true, and it clearly isn’t, who fucking cares?
---
Oil of immolation and crystal charge.
---
Earthshock is basically a taunt.  For groups only use rank 1 earthshock just for interrupts.
---
After some spell power, demons start to be weaker. They are not scaling with you. I recommend dark pact and imp in phase shift for mana batery. Then play with your HP/mana (drainlife, siphon life, life tap, dakr pact) zero downtime, very tanky, easy solo elite mobs (with void for sheild) your mana is your hp.
---
But if you want pet, choose sucubuss
---
Less attention intensive games
---
They are ruining their own fun. Nothing beats the feeling of winning a roll against another person. If it takes an extra month running dungeons so be it. You'll get gold for your epic mount by doing dungeons in the meantime. If you played the game as it was intended, you might not be one of the people right now sitting in cities bored waiting for MC to reset every week, or you won't be one of the many people complaining on the forums how hard it is to get gold for the epic mount. Just play the game!
---
Aren't subs, like, tripled with the release of classic?  I'd say that's a hard "no" for a lot of people ... myself included 😎
---
&gt;One of the philosophy in my guild is don't reject bad players, teach them and make them grow so that they become as good as you.
---
What realm? I would love a guild like that haha
---
I'm always happy to chat if you'd like

ur level 20 m8

Okay, so instead of going to the YouTube and doing it, I open YT, get the URL, open VLC, dialog to option, paste it in VLC, same result.

Not a fan!!

Only after like 2.0.

Make sure when you spam for people you have it listed and also make sure before you invite people you tell them "just to he clear, the first orb goes to me, the tank"  dont leave any room for someone to not know.

This is only for leveling purpose, I will respec at 60 again to a DS build!
---
At this point if you keep focusing on dungeons you should zoom to 60. Lots of 5 mans open up after 50+. Get you a warlock buddy and you can summon instead of waiting on everyone to get there.
---
What did their now deleted comment say?
---
Thx
---
You could drop skinning for mining, gather up the mats necessary for engineering, then drop mining for engineering. I don't see a cheaper option for you if you want to keep tailoring.
---
PVPing on a PVP server does not need justification.
---
Here, have some more karma. That's all you're here for anyway.

Haven't streamlined it, as you can see its a 'put everything out there so I know where to find it' build

Well I was stoned and drunk so I should get a pass

Edit: a word

Happend to me yesterday. Died in a cave, spirit rezzed and rage quit at the Inn planning to go to sleep. Went outside to smoke, decided to play more, logged in and damn, rez sickness. Played for another hour and finished the quest in the cave and another elite with some help. It was way  after midnight when I went to bed. Good Times :-D
---
As a feral, this is painfully true.  In BC, it will be the ptchew sound of mangle spam.
---
There's a lot of secondary binds like E Alt E Shift E Alt Q and R and T not showing
---
Many things as people have posted below but you're also correct MC is an absolute joke that is fully pluggable with ease with less than 40 people. The consumable meta won't show up until BWL or even later.

I mean... I'm not sure how my phone would read my mind as I'm swiping up and down the keyboard but ok.

Are you just out farming downvotes this morning since all the thorium is contested?
---
I like this cleaner getup of hers, not bad
---
You can use the big map and make it transparent with addons afaik.
---
Look into Heart of the Wild spec. Split between feral and resto it's really got the best of both worlds and is viable for PvE heals and tanking as well as PvP healing. 
---
There are tons of videos of solo-farming dungeons and open world as this spec.
---
Only he could beat himself.

I know these but they are with small yards 5 and 3.. I was hoping for something with better range :)
---
Making an alt with my friend who is a warrior. I really wanted to play a Druid but it seems like a shaman would just combo so much better with a warrior. Does anyone have any advice, and if I went with a shaman how should I spec it?
---
Interesting, thanks. Unfortunaly this build doesnt appeal to my playstyle, but maybe Ill consider it if I get into trouble later!
---
There is really no for sure way you can trust people. Reservation groups especially are a huge red flag for me.
---
I don't speak english native but i find this fun aniway xD
---
The amount of greed displayed by subpar players in Classic has been the most disheartening points of its existence.  Even in successful guilds you see the same amount of "we don't care about loot", instantly turn into officers claiming they are the only main spec who gets X loot, and basically harassing other players of their class to pass.
---
So many guilds are bound to collapse before phase 3.  It's going to be glorious.
---
I like the goofy art style. For some reason I also imagined her taking leather working and being one skin shy of shoulder pads and he gets concerned as she looks at her pet while holding a skinning knife.
---
Sorry, Im not a master warlock. Why does drain mana support succubus? :o
---
Seems almost the same. Some may argue but going dark pact will help massively on down time. If you go succ and do not have her on auto abilities you can self sustain all day while doing perfect amount of damage. But if you want to go the passive build then yes this seems good enough till 60.
---
Edit- sorry this should have been a reply to your reply.
---
It's Robe of the Archmage, I'd be expecting the whole group to press need, you'd be stupid not to.  And no, that wouldnt be "ninjaing".
---
You aren't going to get anything with better range, and it's fine.
---
&gt; I'm not sure how my phone would read my mind
---
It doesn't read your mind, genius. It's called contextual text, and if the word following the possessive/contractive word doesn't match up, it'll suggest the other form. Even if I'm a piece of shit, at least I'm not a fucking liar.
---
ElvUi allows full bar customization and you can just type /kb to hover over spells in the spell book or any action bar to set keybindings. Very easy to setup just lots of options.
---
For my shaman I have a my Q/E/R/F/T buttons mapped to most common stuff and then you can do stuff where like 'T' is cast lighting bolt rank 1 for pulls but Shift+T is casts highest rank lighting bolt, or chain lighting with CTRL+T instead if you need it. \` is earth shock rank 1 for quick interrupts but Shift+` is highest rank.
---
Action bars are great when you couple them with good keybinding management.
---
I’m not sure how I feel about the fact that you have /spit macro...
---
And if you want hulu to work with pic-in-pic mode you have to use Just create a bookmark with following URL (you can do this via bookmark manager, Ctrl+Shift+O):

Your druid heals are just so good, an enh shammy cant even compare. It's like me healing a group with my retribution set on...oom in an instant.

To be an optimal kitty dps we need to power shift. To benefit from the wolf head helmet and furor talent. But their is a Gcd when hopping out and in the form.
---
 This.  Druid cat form increases movement speed by 50% and aquatic form increases swim speed by 50%. Swim speed in general is just slower. I imagine that AotC works in the same manner.
---
I've heard about this, I'll have to try it!
---
This guys 2nd most visited sub is cumtown lol
---
Go back to 4chan
---
Shaman are not just there for totems... that's such a closed mind way of thinking
---
That's a fair stance. I still think they're shitty people, but I think there's some nuances that sway people into categories of giant assholes (they showed up long after it was tagged) vs smaller assholes (bunch of players waiting together etc.)
---
No reason to be rude
---
Also don't underestimate doing green quests. Yes the kill exp is lower but you kill mobs insanely fast.
---
I actually love the slow paced grind haha
---
What UI is that?
---
Lambda
---
I love in flight! I suggest moving the little dismount at next stop action bar/button right next to the in flight bar so it feels very cohesive.
---
Oddly this free flight from Moonglade to TB is the only one I don't get a bar for, but I've manually timed it at 9 minutes so I'd guess your 9:04 is spot on.
---
Something something wheel turning something
---
Warriors difficulty with leveling is severely overstated.  Its very easy (just no multi mob pulls).  Maybe because its the end of vanilla its different, but warriors will have very little downtime for the first 35 levels.  
---
After level 35 your power level spikes dramatically and you are much more powerful but spirit doesn't regen quite as fast.  At this point you need food or good gear to continue non stop grinding.  Pick up cooking, its easy to level and kind of fun imo.  Other professions don't matter (choose whatever, probably gathering ones for the extra chedder)
---
Always be on the lookout for weapon upgrades.  There is a pretty established path for 2 handers, just try to get a big upgrade every &lt;10 levels.
---
Learn how to tank, it sucks if you are in a balls to the wall AOE group, fine if your not.  If you are tanking make sure you are within 2 levels of the highest level mob so that you can hit.  Use 2 handers, don't make a protection spec unless you want to.  Recognize which skills make your life harder (DPS shamans using earth shock), I usually just let them know they will pull aggro and try not to police too much because its just a game and dungeons will very rarely fail even if played sub optimally.
---
Warriors are a lot of fun with the best resource system and fun PVE rotations.  They absolutely SUCK at PVP though.  This has been understated by most.  They are the most useless class in the game in world PVP and its by far the biggest concern with the class.
---
BuT I WaNt ChAeP ePoX wAhH
---
Congratulations, you figured it out. All classes are exactly identical, there being no difference in difficulty, thats why a warrior got worlds first 60, I forgot.
---
Priests can Mind soothe mobs too.
---
I main a druid i dont bring them, i do on my alt warrior
---
what the fucl
---
We aren't comparing crit versus hit.
---
Use wind furry or frost brand. Flame tongue is objectively the worst imbue
---
Swords are prefered alot because of sword specialization in talents.
---
Both in Rogue and Warrior you have a chance for an extra swing if specced with swords.
---
This "windfury" procc gives significant dps boost. 
---
Some weapons and trinkets have this effect and they are all VERY GOOD, especially Ironfoe!
---
Enhancement shamans are there for the totems.
---
Any other DPS can fulfil the damage part better.
---
You’re the worst
---
this is actually a lot better then my code below - it even works with Plex!
---
Yeah, that's a difficult question for me.
---
wait what
---
Aka, Old School RuneScape :)
---
Why fletch?
---
Dat M100
---
Yes you're right, a practicing psychologist doesn't open with 'yikes' following their client's referral, what a revelation. Last time I checked you're not my client, just a person I'm talking to equally
---
Do you guys not have phones?
---
Seriously what is the point of this? Just put netflix on your phone and prop it in front of the monitor.
---
Had same moment yesterday watching mage farming plaguelands was in shadow worm so didn't wanted to waste mana to heal him😄
---
ppl r doing MC and Onyx runs with 20-30 man, not 40 as “intended”..... i rly thing it doesnt matter. If somebody tells you that you cant go becouse dps lost, its bullshit, kill speed with and w/o SP will differ in seconds, doesnt matter. 
---
If you have guild and they are “normal” people, they will take you just becouse you are guildmate. 
---
Maybe it will change when nax is up or AQ and raids will be actualy hard, but maybe not and most players will steamroll them just like MC and onyx. 
---
So SP doing low dps doesnt matter, play what you enjoy and dont let others to tell you how to enjoy the game.
---
I read very successful talking all the way through sm cath. And I could probably could've tanked ulda-mara
---
I never knew you way existed. Definitely seems simpler, I've been half screening this while time, will be nice to play full screen again, thank you!
---
It's pretty simple as a feral druid as well
---
Thx found it
---
Because the way that sword spec works is when it procs, it “grants an extra attack” by simply resetting the main hand swing timer.  By hitting your abilities right after your main hand swing you ensure that you don’t reset your swing right before you were about to swing anyways.
---
*edit for clarity*
---
Thanks for the help guys, going afk for some time!
---
Of you get the membership there are a number of original Nintendo games that you get to play online which is fun.
---
&gt; /script SetCVar("rawMouseEnable", 1);
---
Finally got to test and this is 100% the fix. Thank you so much!!!!!!!
---
Curious on what exactly this does, enable the raw mouse input I guess?
---
 These turtles specifically also have pretty high thorns damage.
---
Thrown weapons are better before you get stats on your ranged weapon, because they don't take up an inventory slot with ammo.
---
Warrior as in the most requested class for dungeons?
---
&gt;Today I heard about "HealComm" . It basicaly show prehealing on raid windows like retail. Again , does this belong in classic ? the difficulty of raid content was designed without this feature in mind. Managing healers was one of the difficulty the devs took in consideration. 
---
That was a thing in vanilla, most emergency monitors included it (Squishy did at least). It was more primitive than what we have now, but was perfectly functional as a way to know someone else was taking care of your target.
---
Same for Spy, it's barely more featured than VanasKoS, an addon everyone had.
---
Up until you can specialise, at best you'll be able to sell gear back for what you paid for supplies. 
---
Once you can specialise, you can take advantage of the young market. I picked up Elemental Leather working for my guild and there's good margins on a lot of the gear because most people go tribal. Just check your markets first though, might not be the same for you.
---
Nah never pull accidentally, while my mages are drinking I tell them whats my next pull gonna look like.
---
Since Diremaul and its water isn't out yet I have plenty of time since they need to drink twice to fill up their mana.
---
Also Tanking in spellcleave is supereasy, you safe so much gold because of durability since you don't get hit. Also you only need to taunt elite mobs or bosses not the trash unlike in other groups where you kinda should generate AoE thread.
---
Is a crafting item in game required sustenance for your character? Will you die without it? 
---
That's why it's a shit analogy. And before you try and come up with a better one, don't bother. Comparing real life to a game and assuming there should be parallels is ridiculous to begin with. The problem is you and your unwillingness to fathom how someone can use a drop other than to sell it.
---
Wasnt it healbot that did everything back in vanilla/tbc? Like you click a player and it would choose the spell + rank?
---
Got the twitch app.
---
I guess this is what world chat is for. Technically a private channel but everyone is in it.
---
Instant abilities don’t eat up auto attacks. They function in parallel unless an ability says “next melee” such as a heroic strike.
---
Nah, just one stack.
---
Yes it can happen easily!
---
And you really wanna keep that 3.60second weapon swinging so you can swing again soon.
---
It's not uncommon for shaman to destroy their hearthstone after getting recall, you will never use 5 hearths an hour and it takes up a bag slot. I could never bring myself to do it but there's really no reason not to.
---
I hate fake healers. Makes it hard for real healers to find groups.
---
That's fuckin genius, that's like getting two birds stoned at once!
---
To add to that, what he is talking about is a 0-30-21 spec, picking up Heart of the Wild 5/5 and Nature's Swiftness 1/1.
---
I think this is considered auto clicking, and yes I'd avoid doing it.  It's not that they'll come after you just for doing it, but if someone shines the light on you for whatever reason and they discover that you use it, they might punish you.  
---
I've used an auto clicker before, but it was to avoid afk in lake wintergrasp and I used a program that clicked at random intervals between 30 seconds and 2 minutes.  The random interval is important, because a rapid auto clicker is easy to track and identify.
---
If you have hundreds of clicks over a few seconds, each one the exact same minute amount of time apart - it's obvious you're using one and it can be tracked.  However, if you're using your twitchy mouse-finger to spam click as many times as possible, the interval between clicks is slightly irregular and it's easy to tell that you're just a spaz.
---
Went and watched it last night, gf laughed and said I was the guy tanking the kids =\

&gt; Your answer has been given to you 20 times:

And as I've said every time that answer has been given, that reason still boils down to him wanting money, which just supports my argument that he is needing because he wants money. Nobody else has been able to come up with a reason that doesn't have to do with him wanting money.

So please, give me an other reason.

I learned this a week ago and it has been life changing

I plan on putting it adding into every single hot key

For tradable items, unless you agree to something else beforehand, yes.
---
What?  That post was perfect.  This sort of ruins the spark.  These mods man...
---
This is exactly why I rolled on Shazzrah knowing it will have 5 hour queues. When I began playing and my first server had low pop at 2am I knew I will have to roll on a server with more population.
---
The agenda was clear from the opening, is what I'm getting at. You can stop pretending you give a shit now and just insult me like the other people in this post. You'll get upvotes regardless.
---
Good on paper.. in practice, you know some dude is gonna die irl from playing too much.
---
That is how I am fishing, make the video as big as possible and whenever I hear the noise of the fish I click the pole.

Makes fishing even more relaxed.
---
Reread everything I wrote carefully, please. I never said I was entitled to be the last to place a bid, there was active bidding going on and I tried waiting sometime to be the last one to bid (it was early in the morning when the activity on the server is low). 
---
The owner canceled the auction, you can do it even if there is a bid on it, I tried it myself with a friend not so long ago. This is the original point of this post.

[In regards to shouts:](https://classicwow.live/guides/19/threat-guide-and-reference-table)
---
&gt;Since [Battle Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25289/battle-shout) is in the Buffing section for threat generation here is an example with more than one mob. A warrior in [Defensive Stance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=71/defensive-stance) with the [Defiance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12792/defiance) talent casts [Battle Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25289/battle-shout) while attacking 4 mobs. The buff is in range of the player plus all four other people in his group. [Battle Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25289/battle-shout) Rank 7 generates 70 threat per person buffed. In this case the calculation is (70 * 1.3 * 1.15 * 5) / 4 for 130.8125 total threat on each mob.
---
&gt;[Demoralizing Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout) is a debuff so it would seem to fall in the Buffing section’s rules however because it is being applied directly to the mob it is actually an AoE Fixed Threat ability. A warrior in [Defensive Stance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=71/defensive-stance) with the [Defiance](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=12792/defiance) talent casts [Demoralizing Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout) which hits 4 mobs. [Demoralizing Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout) Rank 5 adds 43 threat to each mob. The calculation would be 43 * 1.3 * 1.15 for a total threat of 64.285 for each mob.
---
&gt;When looking at larger packs you can see that there’s a point where [Demoralizing Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout) can be more valuable because its threat doesn’t degrade with mob number. Smaller mob numbers will boost the value of [Battle Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=25289/battle-shout) but larger ones will boost the value of [Demoralizing Shout](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11556/demoralizing-shout).
---
Good question about thunderclap, now that I look at it it actually seems pretty good. Hope someone responds.
---
Cancelling an auction is essentially buying it out yourself.
---
The power creep throughout expansions is insane. I remember leveling prot in wrath with imp revenge and glyph. 
---
At lvl 34 I managed to clear the entire wyvern cave in 1k needles with a single pull.
---
Decided to see how far I could take it, ended up being able to 1v2 those lvl 50ish silithids in tanaris. 
---
Rdf was such bullshit.
---
Out of form there isnt. You can hop out and in instantly with a macro. Or from any form to any form. And actually not even  while getting in to form? Because you can also have macros to like transform in to bear and instantely bash or charge
---
Imagine playing a game so boring that you need two other forms of entertainment to drown it out
---
For anyone wondering, this screenshot is from Turtle WoW, a private server that has this feature enabled. Also, OP, the rank was going to be given to the highest-ranking PvP players of each race, not faction.
---
Print screen
---
Wait until lvl 30 when you get Blade Flurry and lvl 40 when you get Adrenaline Rush. The levels before that are a bit of a slog in comparison, though rogue fairs much better than a lot of other classes/specs as far as overall leveling goes.
---
I just stack spirit on priests while leveling. You'll do enough damage to be fine, and it really really helps with down time.
---
The average player is now 30-50, so obviously there wouldn’t be a ton of 60s lol in a low pop server
---
Link to your bug report on wow homepage? 
---
Happy to give it a bump so they focus on it
---
If you want to play Druid, play Druid. It's a really fun class and it does complement Warriors to a decent degree. Sure, you don't have Windfury, but what else does a Shaman offer a Warrior that you can't as a Druid? You have more reliable CC so you help keep Hunters and similarly annoying classes in place, or you force Mages to blink out of your roots / bear charge so your Warrior can intercept. You can heal without having to cast, which is invaluable in PvP, and you're way, WAY harder to just collapse on than a Shaman (which is what playing a healer in PvP usually boils down to - can you survive longer than their healer while all DPS are trying to kill you guys)
---
Well, it's nice. But alot of work.
---
I would just do 4-5 of them in battle/berserker and probably two for sunder armor and taunt in defensive stance for dungeon also.
---
Barbershops! 😍
---
Whatever you do, slam that windfury totem down,.
---
Okay, if I, as a hunter, had need rolled and didn't sell the recipe, it wouldn't be ninjaing?
---
surprising considering most would to kill to play a whiteman in today’s society
---
So the money goes to?..
---
But you don't need BoPs either, you want them, so why not give that gold to someone else in the group then?
---
Also, you're calling this person a ninja, without any proof that this group didn't have the exact criteria that you would find okay for yourself to use in a similar situation.
---
Fucking ridiculous.

Thank you.

More!
---
If you're doing drain tanking spec, it gets noticeably better at 38 when you upgrade drain life, and again at 40 with dark pact.
---
Gold conscious all the way, but 12g at 29 is a very decent point to be at. Gold really ramps up in the 30s. If you're struggling, just farm the last level or two.
---
And what’s the point of doing it?
---
Yeah that’s a good thing. It would be insane if you could link a macro to unshapesbift and then shift instantly into form and gain your furor and helm resources. I mean sure mana will still limit how many times you can do this, but even still I think it’d be crazy seeing a Druid just instantly switch between 3 forms in under 2 seconds.
---
i usually have the youtube screen-in-screen hovering near the lure so if i see it move I can just click it while not really paying attention
---
To get the item.
---
Remember that in a 40 man raid, there are infinitely more dps slots than tank or healer slots. A good rogue is a good rogue, plain and simple. This iteration of the game is meant to be played in a guild if you want the clearest path to gearing up so don't worry so much about being left out of pickup groups and focus on finding a great guild that fits you and learning your class extremely well. Everything else will fall into place when you have those 2 things set.
---
The interval between the clicks of that button is irregular, or at least it looks and sounds like it is. Still faster than a regular person (at least on longer durations), but not completely monotonous.
---
Spy
---
#showtooltip Thunderclap 
---
/cast Thunderclap
---
Then have another
---
#showtooltip Taunt
---
/cast Taunt
---
This will pop you in and out, even if Taunt's not up the first part of the macro will fire
---
I'm going to guess you're just plain stupid.
---
I encourage you not to ignore blatant data on classic wowhead. Whoever had it green just wasnt close enough to grey for it to matter
---
The moment my Priest turned 60, my interest started to dwindle. I'm currently leveling a Mage, a Warrior, a Druid and a Hunter on the side. 
---
It's a game, do what feels fun, we're in this for the long run.
---
Shaman, leveling as enhance, would let you heal your friend while questing and in dungeons, but also be capable of dps in dungeons too. Eventually you would grant both of you windfury which is incredible.
---
Druid feels more of a lone wolf to me. Between having stealth options, leaving others in the dust with travel form, class quests taking you to moonglade there will be times where you'll feel like you're waiting for him (shaman too with ghost wolf tbh). But their hybrid healing ability will be great just the same.
---
I play on a TV so this is a game changer!
---
So you place the item on AH to eventually buy it back. OK
---
Because once a hugbox starts getting momentum in wpvp, you're better off joining it, no matter if you want said hugbox gone or not. If you want the hugbox to exist, joining it is a no-brainer. If you want the hugbox gone, it's easier to join it and try to destroy it from the inside, as any aggressive move against the hugbox from the outside will be immediately cockblocked by the hugbox.  
---
If UN has gained traction on your server, better join it to push whatever you're trying to push.
---
But you *need* to get them from that place.
---
&gt;so why not give that gold to someone else in the group then?
---
Because there's a utility value in bops that is greater than their monetary value, that's not the case for tradable items.
---
&gt; Fucking ridiculous.
---
No, what's ridiculous is the fact that people are sitting here literally defending ninjaing because they want to need on shit just to make a couple gold.
---
&gt;going afk for some time!
---
Filthy casual... play 24/7 or go back to retail! /s
---
Love it !! What slaughter
---
Triggered it is then

DBM and other boss mods were not a thing at first, either.
---
Raids are significantly easier when an addon can tell you everything to do and/or there's a handful of people who have already cleared it dozens of times.
---
He mostly analyzes movies. But he's also an avid gamer and will sometimes analyze games as well. He also streams on Twitch every now and then.
---
That being said, I don't know why Dio thinks he's a scummy douchebag. I watch him stream and follow him on Twitter. He has strong opinions on things, but nothing too crazy.
---
If it’s a pull of 3+ mobs I’ll usually frostbolt the first to like 1/3 health to allow time for the tank to generate threat then nova and coc and/or blizzard the pack depending on its size/health.
---
But you can totally do that. Dont listen to that guy. He has no clue. You can use macros to instantly shift from any form to any form, and you can attach an attack to it like bash. You can even do a macro to exit form consume potion and enter form and it all happens instantely.
---
Did that one officer of his who ninja looted got deserved ban from Blizzard ? Or did they just let him get away with it ?
---
They aren't
---
There was a great post on exactly this a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d86rs0/my_list_of_recommended_addons_that_will_improve
---
You want to reserve loot, advertise that before inviting people to fill out your group.  Then it is on the randoms to decide whether that is ok for them.   Better, if you want a controlled loot run, put that together with your friends and guildmates only.
---
For the record, I’ve joined groups with reserved loot advertised, because often I’m in it for dungeon quest completion.  I’ll ask if they are down for completing that quest, which is usually acceptable.
---
I’ve had only one group so far try the ML switch midway through, and both the healer and I dropped group right then and there.
---
For me it's been the early 50s that I'm really having to force myself to log on. Luckily my guild is really trying to help me push through. I promised myself to hit 60 before making an alt.
---
Are you running dungeons enough? I've found dungeons are really good at breaking up the monotony of quest grinding. Also, use the succubus, it's awesome damage and great to solo 2 alliance.
---
Not to come down arrogant but if your wife is unaware she will never use auto-attack as a warlock so she can have something more worthy at the 1 slot. 
---
This is coming from a 60 warlock that didnt know you could remove the auto attack from the 1 slot until about lvl 18 lol
---
You dont replace a warlock or mage with a shadow priest to bring shadow weaving. You have a priest spec into it and use low level shadow spells to keep the stacks up while off healing.
---
Reading this about mouse look is really bizarre for me. Other people seemed to have mentioned it too. I guess I really take for granted the fact I've been playing games for a long time that it's natural for me. But at the same time when I first started playing games on the computer, it was immediately natural for me then too.
---
The floating damage text is the standard Blizzard Combat Text which can be enabled in your interface options. The other AddOn was called CCWatch, not sure if it exists in Classic. I suggest checking out NugRunning which does the same but looks much better.
---
Not true. Only certain NPCs
---
Reserving items definitely has a place in classic and it's been a thing since vanilla too. Let's say you're a tank lending your services to a group running scholo (you don't need any loot from there), it wouldn't be unreasonable for you to reserve all greens or blues that noone needs, so you can use that to make some money whilst helping others gear up. It's also been done since vanilla to complete dungeon sets too. If you have the Dal'rend mainhand, the group will clear faster if you get to complete your set before others get their off-hand, making it better for everyone in the long run.
---
&gt; Also let her pick the class/race she wants but also help steer towards a combo she might enjoy. Don't pick a pocket healer for yourself...
---
I strongly suggest you also roll on a server that you're not playing your main on just in case she picks the opposite faction. It's almost better to play the faction you're least familiar with because it limits the amount of direction and meddling you can do because you're both learning the quests and zones.
---
If you farm a few levels in stv killing crocodilisks, gorillas and tigers you will easily get there. I had around the same amount as you do, but I was level 37. I've spent two levels doing nothing but farming mobs and I now have 79g at level 39. It won't be the most fun you'll have playing but you can still easily get there.
---
Vendor price. You'll be so much richer at the end, and all it shows you is something you'd otherwise learn on your next trip to town. But when your bags are full and you have to pick, it's so nice.
---
Is there an addon that can show what abilities I have off cool down. Especially if they are in different stance? Would be helpful to me to visually see what I can use. Currently I have a stance and ability macro set up but if an ability is in a different stance it doesn’t light up to tell me it’s ready to use.
---
Part of the issue is our realms have like ten times as many people as they did back in the day
---
Welp, u have clearly peaked. Enjoy the rest of ur adventures never being able to fill the hole that this extreme high has left.
---
Stealing others skins is freedom?
---
But yet forming groups to work together cross faction is not okay on this sub?
---
Think it’d be cool if you added dashes of red somewhere in the form of blood spatter or otherwise for added visual flair and contrast :)
---
For the first shift. Yes you can. You can't do this multiple times. For instance, can't shift out of cat into bear, stun, then shift back into cat instantly. You have to wait for the Gcd of bear form then Gcd of stun. So yeah, it seems like someone else doesn't know what they are talking about haha
---
In my eyes that's the same thing. A non invite is being denied.
---
Then go demo affli. Soul link is very good for your sustain. Use succubus (around 40% dmg is dealed by her). She increase via talents your dmg by 15% (even wand dmg). But you will have some downtime because your drain life is not effective
---
The wotlk version of dual spec.
---
yeah never heard of him till classic ,but whats about him wiping blood from his gums on the walls clips ? That was ouch
---
Don't know why but this picture is giving me some "JUST DO IT!" vibes. I think it's the way your night elf is looking at the screen.
---
Frig off
---
You can start looking for Felcloth Gear, though that's not exactly plastered with Stamina either. 
---
Rule of thumb: if you want to PvE, the second you see something with more shadow or spell damage, you take it, unless it replaces an item that has hit on it. For PvP, you can mix and match to fit your personal preferences between DPS and survivability, but it's usually better to eer on the side of survivability
---
flametongue or rockbiter, windfury is bad.
---
The amount of genpcide our characters commit would make them very good sith lords
---
I spent all my money on a new pc so I can't afford new monitors :(
---
Find video proof if you can because in vanilla it was like that until Wrath.
---
Right after midnight I had a 40% nightfin chance in feralas. I fished for 3 hours and it was very consistently
---
It’s pathetic what people do for attention.  This and PSA posts are fucking cancer.
---
Elvui is good but really overhauls the UI, which can be a good thing, I've used it for a long time.
---
Check out omniCC for a clean display of buffs and debuffs.
---
Up until level 40 you should just stack as much spirit as you can. After 40 if you can get your hands on shadow damage gear it will be beneficial but I wouldnt reccomend spending any gold on it.
---
Outside of a raid boss when (if ever) is it the best strategy for a warlock to cast Curse of Elements/Shadow over Curse of Agony? and does Amplify Curse factor in at all to this equation?
---
Stalagg’s pretty rough from what I’ve read, come reroll on Fairbanks :)
---
Dominos is great
---
As a tank I would have loved every minute of that shit. 😂😂😂
---
Other way around, Gehennas is about 70-75% horde and most private server guilds also went horde rather than alliance.
---
The try hards have the optimal priority down, which at your level is sundar armor till 80% health &gt; MS &gt; WW. They don't use execute because its more efficient to pool rage.  
---
Hamstring kiting is a relic from the private servers and not worth doing imo.
---
I have played around with lots of different skills and rotations.  The try hards are right, but the difference is so minimal I would just use whatever is fun.
---
&gt;you're calling this person a ninja, without any proof that this group didn't have the exact criteria that you would find okay for yourself to use in a similar situation.
---
you missed this, and when straight on with 
---
&gt; what's ridiculous is the fact that people are sitting here literally defending ninjaing because they want to need on shit just to make a couple gold.
---
You have literally 0 proof of this person being a ninja, even by the criteria you've set up yourself. Everything in the screenshots points towards it not being the case.
---
The only ridiculous thing here is you being so sure of your assessment when everything speaks against it.
---
It's literally a pattern for a BoP item that is best in slot for the mage who needed on it and no one in the chat seems mad about it.
---
A very creative, but fairly awful build. 
---
No offense intended obviously, I think for what you're trying to do, this is about as good as it gets - but if you really want to play a build that doesn't care much about the type of weapon used, go for Hemo.
---
I use ontopreplica. https://github.com/LorenzCK/OnTopReplica

lmao xD
---
Thank you kind sir, no more smaller wow screens for me!
---
Everquest is an old as game for nerds. WoW was basically designed from the beginning to be far more casual and easier to play for not just extreme nerds.
---
Came here to comment that ahah
---
Or referencing stuff on a website, discord chat, etc.
---
Second screen is for looking up quest, reading shit, editing photos and stuff like that. Things you do when you get a minibreak (FP, queing, waiting etc).
---
Videos I want to glance all the time while still mindlessly killing candle-hogging-kobolds. Having it on the samescreen makes it easier to ”multi-task”
---
I really couldn't give a toss about getting votes, and I have no intention to insult you
---
Seems legit
---
nah shell syntax sucks :P
---
If you go upstairs it works too had same problem yesterday
---
Any tips? I've been good about censoring where I can. Haven't really played the AH except for swiftthistle since it sells well. I also avoid training skills I dont use.
---
You had me in the first 4 paragraphs I’m not gonna lie
---
Inb4 world first all Nelf guild is coming. Oh the horror
---
Just complete up the old zone, duskwood, wetlands etc, you’ll breeze through the zones cause you out level them, not to mention you’re a hunter. Run SM like once or twice. Get 33 and go badlands and start desolace. Thousand needles is good too.
---
Idk why people refuse to do green quests, the scale with your level so 1 level in green is still very good exp. Overall you honestly will waste more time fighting mobs too high level and getting killed by others when questing in a high level zone.
---
The most efficient questing is all about actually questing and not getting into random fights or dying over and over. My personal rec is 5-6 levels over the zone. For example badlands at 31, desolace 36, stv at 41. That way you can park yourself in those zones and finish majority of the quests, rather than needing to fly everywhere
---
a) diminishing returns messing up your actual good stuns
---
b) randomness
---
c) Combat in itself is fucking trash for pvp, there is no other spec that goes so deep into combat and for good reasons, you get nothing of value in pvp. 
---
So you end up with a pvp spec that has little to none of all the amazing utility and burst of the other trees, with random stuns that messes with your kidney , for what? A chance to randomly stun people for 1.5 seconds (since you have kidney cd). What are you gonna use that for?
---
I think what you’re describing is consistent damage.  This guy specifically said burst potential.  Sort of like a wind fury proc.
---
Cool so we agree.

The honor system would work better if you lost some on death. This way it would actually become skill dependent.

*confused officer noises*
---
Yup. His last solo tour was incredible and honestly quite emotional after Chester. One of the best shows of my life that I will always remember.
---
Yes it was glorious
---
Contrary to what this sub shows, boe epics are stupidly rare. Dont expect them. They are 0.013% drop rates. Vast majority of people have never seen one let alone 2.
---
Take a seat, young Spiritwalker.
---
And that's exactly why I was fine with announcing up front that I didn't want any of it.  However, there are lots of people out there who see a cool looking piece of gear and don't care much that it's not itemized for them.  Saying up front that I knew it wasn't for me put their minds at ease that I wouldnt compete.
---
You still need 2 other people.  Expanding on OP's reason:
---
Imagine you're in a dungeon and need to go back to repair. Just have yourself selected when starting the cast, and have 2 of your party members click the portal. Once the cast finishes you will have the prompt on the top of your screen.
---
At that point you can hearth back to town, take care of your business and accept the summon before it expires.
---
Note that others in this thread are warning you may not have the full 2 minutes, so YMMV.
---
You must be a bad warrior or a mage lol. I dps all the time as war and am ALWAYS 1st or 2nd in overall dps and always 1st on boss dps so you're incredibly wrong. To say a warrior is gear dependent isnt wrong but it doesnt mean you need epics to do well it means you need 1 good weapon for your level range.
---
I need an update please!!! Are you still married?
---
We're either working overnight shifts without proper compensation or have worked this job long enough to consider quiting it for good, but somehow can't step over our shadows because hey, it makes good cash
---
You frig off! This guy's been haulin' shoppin' carts out of Loch Modan for weeks and I'm just glad to be rid of him.
---
This is my first time playing WoW vanilla or otherwise outside of a free trial. How do add-ons work exactly? 95% of my struggles can be related to not finding where I am supposed to go, or when. I understand that's part of the experience, and it is rewarding to get things right, but even just a level range on the map would be helpful.
---
Just tell them hey I’m gonna go do some raids guys you trying to come? We have teamspeak to act as our guild... why have an ingame guild when it doesn’t do anything other than connect friends when there’s 100 other platforms to do that on white playing WoW
---
My friends guild has 10 members and I’m the only one logged on 90% of the time
---
I think the issue is more on how the population is spread out and not it being dead. 
---
Just because the new server isn't full of level 60 characters doesn't mean it's dead.
---
Feign death from safe location to safe location? 
---
Probably best to get to incendius and jump down and take the lava shortcut
---
Not mad at all. You're just predictable and very bot-like in your responses with all that regurgitating of internet slang. An original thought would overwhelm you so badly you'd crash and burn.

/gquit

Tons of mages refuse to cc. Its bonkers

Check out StaySafe’s content. He’s doing runs on twitch all the time and has a video or two about it on YouTube.

I'm just speaking from the DPS I see on average or used to rather.  Not playing right now during classic.
---
Wow... look at mister got-it-all-together.

Just started saving any item with int and then rolled ele. and then just focused on ele gear, 
---
and that helped a easy transition to resto.

What is the first thing you're saying? "What this subreddit has been telling them" meaning, you only take evidence from reddit. I get that you need it pointed straight out man, but jesus christ. Get off, reddit. It's not the world.
---
You don't need DBM when the majority of bosses have no mechanics.
---
More or less but it's even better. I got whispers from rogues/warriors who didn't need Dal'rend MH to join whereas if I said "no rogues/warriors" they'd never even get the invite. 
---
Overall, it's not a bad thing to reserve an item but some people are mad for no reason.
---
Yeah not mad at all 😂
---
Good tip. But I hate your bars.
---
It's the best.  It comes with a super intuitive UI for configuring all your bars and also allows for extremely easy keybinding.
---
It took me from having a few keybinds and having to click a lot of my spells with the mouse to 90% keyboard utilization for all my abilities.
---
It also stores keybinds on a per-character basis so if you have a healer and a dps character you dont have to put the spells you want in the same keybind place on both.
---
100% reccommend this addon for anyone.
---
Reminds me of Mabel and Waddles. Love it!
---
I can also recommend getting an older monitor from the thrift shop. It's cheap and works.
---
An emoji. How original.
---
How can you both say "Just play the game!" and "They're ruining their own fun" in the same paragraph? Who are you to be the arbiter of what's considered fun and how people should spend their time playing? 
---
If it doesn't affect you, and it doesn't because you're free not to join those groups, bugger off.
---
Edgemasters for 300 would get bought in a second on my server

/cast Mend Pet

/cast Revive Pet

edit\* im just kidding in all seriousness.
---
Now be smart and sell it. Don’t be an idiot like me and equip an amazing twink item
---
I switched at 40 for AR and i knew thrash blade was coming
---
In a " Princess run " you dont just kill princess. You kill Tinker , rot and princess . You cant account for just princess loot
---
Mad snowflake, you must be fun irl.
---
I thought you needed to be inside the instance to except the summon?
---
You clearly don’t understand the associated drop rate of this pattern with this particular pack in LBRS so why are you commenting when you clearly don’t know people farm this trash just as regularly as any boss drops?
---
It is like you are willfully looking at half of a situation...
---
Looks like someone vomited all over your UI.
---
I always thought special attacks work instantly and independently of the swing timer. Do they reset the swing timer instead?
---
40, just grinded SM from 38-40 and vendored everything
---
True.
---
Sure. Sometimes it's cheap and you can flip it for profit.
---
So adorable. Please continue the series!
---
Inlaid Mithril Cylinder Reagents: Mithril Bar (5), Gold Bar, Truesilver Bar
---
I mean, wowhead doesn't list any uses for Mithril Tubes besides engi and that gnomish quest.
---
That makes sense, thanks.
---
You can absolutely roll on gear above your level in Classic.
---
They didn't ban it dumbass.
---
Fort Minor’s “The Rising Tide” was one of my favorite albums of the 2000s. Kenji, Where’d You Go, Get Me Gone, In Stereo just banged. And more of course.
---
Edit: Kenji*
---
Chris Hansen: "Please have a seat."
---
That dude: "I WASNT GONNA DO NUFFIN I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE A MINER I JUST NEEDED SOME TIN"
---
Maybe the quest can be picked up earlier than you can craft tubes, so people buy them to avoid having to level up engi further before resetting? Any idea what the skill requirement for the quest is?
---
The universe is a dark forest
---
That's true but at that drop rate there is a 35.xxx% chance of someone seeing a single BoE epic within every 10,000 enemies killed. Bernoulli trials calculations show that everyone should eventually see an epic if they're just grinding it out.
---
Similar story ..... I was out questing in STV when get a random message from an old guildy to tank SM Cath. Still in shock that he plays on the same server and same faction I find out 20-30 people from my old guild “Nightmare Inc” on Stormreaver in Vanilla are playing. Small freaking world!!!!
---
Lol, at some point you was able to buy something like raptor meat for 1s, when coocked on can be sold to vendor for 3s. Anyway cost of some recipes is really low compared to vendor food
---
This game is a beautiful adventure. Yet we have one level 60 who took one path and did things one way and that’s that. Hurry the fuck up and make classic retail 2.
---
STV was fucking intense on my previous server. I was teaching my wife to play at the time. I was an Orc Warrior and she was a Troll Hunter who just followed my lead wherever I went. I remember it seemed to be pouring rain there all the time, sheets of mist whipping around, and between that and the constant paranoia of gankers, we felt like we were commandos in Vietnam. We used to have to move carefully using trees as cover to dodge patrolling 60s. It was a really immersive experience.
---
Even stopping to bandage between kills and raptor aggro was risky business. It was a slaughter ground as as much as I hated it, I also loved it. I'll never forgot the ass clenching that happened whenever you had to turn in quests at Nessingwarys and it was suspiciously quiet.
---
Details! Damage meter also has a threat meter. I have them both stacked and set to only pop up inside a dungeon.
---
I use my 2nd screen alot while leveling.  Easy fights or travel time I can devote my attention elsewhere.
---
Because up until naxx their dps is sub par compared to combat sword. In naxx you get good options with the servo arm though and some people will definitly switch
---

---
Vanilla was catered to those filthy casuals in 2004. Should be same in 2019 because #nochanges amiright?
---
42 1/2 for me.  
---
At 40 I had 38 gold.  
---
Was not really strict with spending till mid 30s
---
Priest - and bought all main spec talents as healer and quester 
---
Tailor / Enchanting.    Kept up with tailoring.  Stopped enchanting at 80 for now.
---
At lvl 40 it really picks up gold quickly.       I would sell greens if good stats for 2-3x pricing.     And all  consumables I find 
---
Main other source of gold for me was fishing nightfin.     Lvled fish/cooking to 300 together - great YouTube guides out there 
---
Good luck to all on your quest to 60.
---
Hunter LW. 
---
What spec should i take? i went for dragon one, maybe i must go for tribal?
---
just enjoy your time in a low pop server. There are pluses and minuses. Apparently you have enough time to get to 60 though which is still ahead of the curve so you're not that casual. Have you grined all your rep? Helped fellow Guildies?
---
Bc people are shit
---
Hey now, they look pretty good in the maws of my felhunter
---
Only thing I’m going to say, playing as a healer and the healer role. I need too, if I see someone dying and actually get killed I feel like an absolute failure. My ONLY job is to heal. I also agree tho, when I do aoe runs it’s incredibly hard. No one pays attention to your mana. How far behind you are because you need to loot and mana up... Pretty stressful. Again I can’t help but to heal my group. Even if they’re being jackasses. I don’t know why?
---
Even with 2 monitors pip is better imo
---
Really confused here because I copy paste your macro for prowl in any form but it makes me swap out of cat when I unstealth or go stealth. Not sure what to do...
---
Theres about 6 or 7 on my server for that price.
---
Skinning+Mining or Skinning+Herbalism for easier gold while leveling?
---
Wierd, i could have sworn that i saw it on the table
---
I’ve been trying to get my ipega controller to work with the console port but can’t seem to get it to work through my phone or tablet.
---
And addon called ClassicCodex will help you out with that, it shows available quests and their recommended level on the world map.
---
Warlock?
---
I’ve been saying for years that WOW is race war: the game.
---
&gt; no one is ever a ninja and people should just roll on things, because you cannot prove they ninjaed stuff.
---
You can prove that. In this scenario it does not seem to be the case. The hunter even passed on the item, why would someone pass on a BoE worth a bunch of gold if they haven't previously agreed upon giving that item to the one person who will benefit the most from it?
---
&gt; No, it's literally an asset worth money.
---
Like every other item you roll for in the game.
---
Ofc BoPs are more important to need on, but that BoP item you need that vendors for 4g might be just what I'm missing for my BiS that you argue I should buy for gold. So then those 4g is worth more to me at the moment than the upgrade is worth to you. You can just rerun the dungeon and get it, it will always be on the loot table, the AH price might change so I can't get my BiS so I have to get those 4g NOW. No, I don't believe this is how it should be done, I'm just saying there are lots of scenarios that are possible and trying to say ALL needs on BoEs are ninjaing and that gold should be fair game for everyone can quickly end up in some weird places.
---
We can't know if someone is a ninja or not when given a few screenshots. Sure, you might be right, but as you said yourself it's not ninjaing if
---
&gt; you agree to something else beforehand
---
which they very well might have done in this case.
---
Since we don't KNOW if the person is a ninja or not, let's just not try to shit on his name as nothing suggests he did ninja the item.
---
Edit: This has already taken up more time than it's worth. Let's just agree to not call people insulting things if we have nothing to back it up with, and even then, not always necessary to do it. Good bye, safe travels!
---
I think that would depend on the server... Check your AH first. :)
---
Why not just group up?
---
Oh wow.... I hope you are joking.
---
so serious.
---
&gt;game is so good you need to entertain yourself with other things
---
No, it came from wow. Kekekeke =/= kek
---
Ores vendor for more i think, should sell ok from mithril and up.
---
REEEE you reserved 1 item that no one in the group needs
---
Yeah gimme a call when subtitles work this is useless still
---
Pretty sure you can at least to some extent, especially on some of the more fire damage intensive bosses as your armor becomes less valuable, but make sure your healing is on point.
---
Just let me bang bro!
---
&gt;By every meta comp's viewpoint, we should've expected lots of wipes and struggled to complete the dungeon.
---
This is where you got confused.  People want fast clean runs they don't think low levels or bad specs are incapable of doing the dungeon they just don't want to slog through it.
---
Thats cool, thats a fantasy world
---
Guess its a spider horse!
---
You can have that opinion
---
Cant argue with those statistics.
---
Such WoW
---
I'm actually doing the same thing and really enjoying it too. (Currently lvl 36)
---
I've never tried combat so i can't really compare though.
---
Sure is i'v been top dps in each dungeon i went, even when not the higher lvl.
---
Plus nobody's fucking with me haha. And when they do, i make them regret.
---
That first crit with an ambush opener is so nice...
---
&gt;  why would someone pass on a BoE worth a bunch of gold
---
Maybe they don't care about money? I know that concept might be hard to grasp for someone who's defending needing on items purely for their monetary value, but people like that exists.
---
&gt; Ofc BoPs are more important to need on, but that BoP item you need that vendors for 4g might be just what I'm missing for my BiS that you argue I should buy for gold, so then those 4g is worth more to me at the moment than the upgrade is worth to you.
---
Again, there's a utility value that's higher than the monetary one for bop items.
---
&gt; which they very well might have done in this case.
---
Yes, they agreed to all need to prevent ninjaing, this is totally possible given the paladin not rolling while he expresses a need for money in the chat.
---
what server?
---
Lok’Tar Ogar brother !!
---
Just tried it 10 more times, still in the guild.
---
What does questie have to do with a browser webpage.
---
Wait? Saying the word race makes you a racist?
---
You're certainly entitled to your own assumptions.  I guess I can rest comfortably in the fact that you're likely one of the few who think so.
---
I just sent a bug report ticket, where can i post on the wow homepage?
---
Becaues its comfy to farm herbs/mining with minimap over ur character and gathering addon
---
There's no reason you cant take tac mastery as fury unless you wanted to go fury prot which i think of as a niche raidng spec for maximum threat per second - can certainly tank the instance as regular fury or arms though (i run sword spec arms wiht a mirah's song and it takes pretty talented players to give me real issues on threat). As for stances always defensive for threat unless you're bursting with execute or maybe sweeping strikes/whirlwind - you get a threat modifier in defensive of 130% (149.5 if you talent it fully)and battle zerker are 80% so youre doing considerably less threat for the damage youre doing.
---
yea im sure blizzard is gonna say  
---
&gt;now that good portion of the playerbase stopped playing, we reduced the layer numbers  
---
The reason layers exist in the first place is because blizzard KNEW there would be large player number drops. Ion said it himself at blizzcon.
---
Jellybeans is a good PVPer. He doesn't stream very consistently, though.
---
And yet I get downvoted when I criticize Uldaman
---
I didnt raid on retail vanilla 15 years ago - too busy in college / working full time etc. By the time I got into raiding, it was BC / Wrath, and for that content everyone was expected to flask for 100% of the content. But then, flasks in BC / Wrath cost like 20-30g, and gold was easier to make, whereas they cost 80g in Classic and gold is harder to make. Just not enough to go around in Classic by far.
---
Other than that, this is not a "premade" guild. We're on one of the servers that was added last, and a lot of our people are either new to raiding or new to vanilla. I had a premade guild planned, but with 6 hour queue times on herod, I had the choice of either getting to play without that guild or sitting in queue all night. I chose to play. So now I'm leading a guild, and we're number one horde side on this server, but its just a bunch of people who leveled together and decided to form a guild at end game with the purpose of hardcore raiding. Thats my story. I hope you don't think I'm a joke, but if you do, I guess you're just too l33t for me.
---
Felhunter all the way.  Succubus is too flimsy.  The felhunter can off tank a bad pull for longer than the duration of seduction.
---
I'm actually a miner IRL and In my early 20s I told a stripper that I was a miner and she gave me the weirdest look, I had to clarify that I was an actual miner and did the whole pick axe motion for her to understand.
---
Alt f4 is the universal "close program" hotkey in Windows.....
---
OH SO YOU'RE SAYING THEY DID IT BECAUSE OF GOLD!? Guess Krissam won this argument /s
---
I'm a mage, and a tailor, I haven't bought this item as I'm not high enough level yet so ofc I'll try to get it as a drop before throwing my very limited cash on it. I assume pretty much everyone who isn't sitting on piles of gold would go about it the same way. It's so logical. I just think Krissam is trolling.
---
I use adibags, separates items per categories in one big bag
---
I think he meant he’s spent 4 days played time at level 60.
---
I don't get it now, and I didn't get it the first time around. I'm only at 25 now in Classic but there is no way I'll have 70g let alone 76 or 100 when I hit 40. I have two gathering professions, but everything sells for like 4 silver a stack right now. I vendor everything I can't sell to someone else. I only buy the skills I'm actually using. Wtf am I doing wrong?
---
This guy is a perfect example of why OPs “be patient” rhetoric fails.
---
Those who need the advice are typically that way because they reject sound advice.
---
Can’t fix stupid.
---
Yeah I really should have picked up Martyrdom and improved mana burn instead /s
---
Spitting on people who gank you or who you gank is part of wow pvp servers.  Why the sensitivity?
---
https://youtu.be/n2rVnRwW0h8
---
You can offtank as Arms.  I was a Mortal Strike or Fury warrior for MC, BWL, AQ40 and Naxx.  I never main tanked, but for bosses like Geddon and Sulfuron I was not an issue off tanking in marginal Prot gear specced as Arms.
---
&gt;Every server being at Medium population or higher when I get home would say the sub count is still doing just fine  
---
When the layer disappears, or rather realm pop shrinks and thus cap shrinks, it changes the player population calculation  
---
"High" with 3 layers is not the same number as "high" with 2 layers.
---
love the style of this

---
This comment is severely underrated lol
---
Pretty noobish question here, But do survival hunter talents such as Humanoid Slaying and Monster Slaying effect ranged?
---
this guy gets it
---
I was under the impression that was the case. Thus the whole reason everyone promotes the swing timer add-ons. However another poster said I was mistaken.
---
So I don't know
---
From memory it doubles the baseline threat the same as it does for damage.
---
2-3min i'd say but the best spot to target him is beside the door you jave to unlock. Better for rogues and mages tho.
---
Priest and you can level as shadow and be great at PvP and still heal. You can Respec towards healing as you hit higher levels
---
Literally no one pronounces these things those wrong ways...
---
This is highly dependent on the economy of your server. The only thing going for over a gold on mine right now is boe drops. Which, cool, you could farm for those and hope for a jackpot, but you could also not ever get one.
---
Maybe an addon? Try disabling them all and reloading. I did it with no issue.
---
^^THIS have to explain it to every warlock
---
Completely matches the timeline.  
---
Lots of people thought they did, but they didn't.  
---
Or just tourists.
---
Really interesting video that strikes at the real values of Classic vs. Retail. Great watch!
---
Tameable
---
Or it was just Friday evening.
---
And the warlocks that want their quest. I would invite them and ask them to let me loot first, and give warriors their charms.   
---
It was some comfy time
---
Not buying a pattern that while ultimately cost 300+ gold only to be replaced is irrational? Guess i am irrational. 
---
Also, a 10% drop from a dungeon you have to farm regardless for your best hands/pants is very far from whatever strange farm you think is required for this drop. 
---
The false equivalence is your notion that “ninja looting” is anything but what is expressly stated in the ToS. A hunter needing plate does not merit ninja looting in the eyes of blizzard so you were wrong long before your argument began.
---
If they can make kids together, but their kids can't breed, they are different species. Like horses and donkeys.
---
Mages are OP in Vanilla. Everybody and their grandmother is creating one. Free food, big damage, portals, etc. 
---
Give it time. These jerks will give up, get bored, whatever. The game needs alternate classes. Next time that happens, just leave and find a better group.
---
Another vote for adibags
---
Now where's ElseIf
---
DO YOU GUYS NOT HAVE PHONES?!?!?!!
---
Yeah that's what I did and started Aimed Shot just before my autoshot goes off was more DPS than waiting til after. Idk if it's a bug or it's because my gun is 2.5, but if I wait til I shoot the auto, it doesn't start charging the next auto attack. It just sits and waits. Have you tested DPS for this?
---
I soloed it in my late 40s as a holy priest. Surprisingly easy.
---
For sure. Been running dungeons with friends mostly
---
Recently had a similar problem.  Me and my friend started our own guild hoping to be able to make a decent size guild based around Wpvp. Unfortunately recruiting did not go good at all for us and it was just us and a few people who rarely play. I just told my friend straight up (he’s also my irl best friend) that I’m moving my main out of the guild to join one of the majors guilds involved with Wpvp on my server and I left an alt in the guild to still be apart of it. He wasn’t mad at all, actually decided to do the same and gave guild control to an alt. It don’t matter if you’re in a different guild as long as you still remember to play together and go on adventures.
---
If anything the gap closes more after you get intercept and mortal strike. If you double crit you can almost 1 shot a mage near your level
---
except that scores are hidden
---
Hah we try roll for it but I wouldn’t say no to a rogue taking it either. 
---
When they open i’m pleasantly surprised because I didn’t expect it :)
---
Yeah I’m not stupid to type it in /y or /2 I knows it against TOS to promote, I have an addon tho that says what I’ve been traded or what I trade after trade is complete, so I’m assuming people got annoyed because of the constant trades seen in chat
---
What's it do?
---
Just talk to them? Tell them your goals and see if they agree, and maybe they start recruiting. If not they should understand the /gquit whereas it'll come out of nowhere for them otherwise. I don't know why people can't just talk and communicate about what they want.
---
Warrior, got it at 40. Once I hit 38.5 and it was looking like I’d fall short, I tightened the belt and started AH’ing things I’d normally vendor. It doesn’t seem like much, but when 20s instead turns into 40s many times over its amazing how your gold shoots up.
---
That and I forgot it only takes honored rep to get your 10% discount.
---
seems like a Faerlina problem
---
fuck off back to /r/Twitch 
---
##**:)**
---
Which is relevant to their sub expiring how?
---
dude...really?
---
So maps of it wouldn't exist further back than the end of WC3, right? Wouldn't that make this map fairly recent?
---
I'm hoping you'll shut the fuck up
---
Most times I tried to explain stuff to people I was told to play my own class. I'm currently running strat living for some drops and of course they are plenty of "tanks" selling their services. I'm sick and tired of warriors not being able to hold aggro from more then two mobs, have shitty tanking gear, refuse to put on a shield but still insist on master loot and getting all the orbs. 
---
Explaining to them that its very different seeing a top geared streamer tank a dungeon with DW then actually doing it with randoms. 
---
If you're wearing Mask of the unforgiven, savage gladiator chain and  devilsaur set YOU ARE NOT A TANK. At this point the rogue and shadow priests take less damage then you do.
---
If you have a Twitch account, you can download the Twitch app on your PC and download your addons from there and it will automatically update and manage your addons for you. Or you can also manually download addons from curseforge.com/wow/addon although you have to install the new version every time there's an update. If you're really desperate for help you can install Leatrix Maps and it will show flight paths, dungeons, raid, level ranges and etc. Another great addon is Questie, useful for questing as it shows where to go and what to kill.
---
Addons existed 14 years ago. Way worse ones too that could basically play the game for you. It's much better this time since Blizzard doesn't allow all the fucked up shit they did back then.
---
Agreed. I do understand the need for it, especially at 60, but for SM? Give me a break.
---
But its already updated 8(
---
Aw, and today everyone's gold resets too.
---
Literally never logged into reddit on my pc.
---
Based on another top level comment that seems to be the case. Haven't tried any of this personally
---
Why would you capitalize Damn Time?
---
Try this  
---
OnTopReplica.  
---
You can select any window and so the same.
---
Hold your breath ;)
---
Yeah, people tend to forget this and think that “it’s not fair they can farm X faster with 10 people” but they don’t consider the fact that this person has to buy every skill 10x, buy mounts 10x, obtain gears 10x, etc etc.  Not only that but the real world cost of having all the necessary hardware to run 10 copies of the game (not even counting subscription costs). All of these considerations are only a tip of the iceberg when it comes to the logistics. It’s humoring to see people get mad, I liken it to seeing that guy on the road ride up in his Bentley or Ferrari, sure he could have purchased a normal, cost effective car, but this is what they chose to spend their time and money on.
---
Once again - you see the large circles stating everyone should greed then they need?
---
THAT - by definition of the ToS - is what would classify that as ninjaing. 
---
“Stating rolling rules on an item in a communal channel -like /say or /party - and then circumventing those rules for personal gain” is ninja-ing. 
---
Your inability to see those differences is more entertaining that Classic tbh. 
---
The best part of all of this is i infer you feel slighted for being the victim of ninja-ing in the past. So now you are on this weird crusade when i would put money of the fact the event that happened to you was probably very similiar to this - so not actual ninja looting - and you are just salty lmao
---
Weapon skill is super useful for tanks too. The dodge, parry and miss rate is extremely high in classic.
---
They look amazing in full tier 2 hunter
---
When I lost 20 lbs while gaining muscle, I went from “pretty good” swimmer to “can struggle against drowning pretty well.”
---
I hope i get to meet my romanian vanilla friend. Goddamnit i miss that crazy guy
---
You have to have a sense of humor in tough times or you'll live a miserable life - and hes posting in a WoW subreddit. 
---
and i said in all seriousness... just kidding.
---
Run with some droods!  Had two in my WC group other night.  Such team players.
---
Hold yourself, you need a hug
---
They deff get more xp then u with a good group. It is faster then running a normal dungeon. Actually aoe farming out of dungeons is the fastest way to lvl in the game.
---
Another Mac user spotted.
---
It depends on your server, if you're in a decently big guild I'm sure a Guildie has an AH add on, type in guild chat. What is "shift click enchant recipe here" worth?
---
You should get a bunch of whispers with information on how much its selling for on average.
---
Cool. Glad you agree.
---
I get mad fps drops while watching youtube in fullscreen. I can do it perfectly fine with other games, even games that require a lot more juice to run like Starcitizen. Very annoying.
---
I am an adult
---
You uh, don't thunder clap one mob..
---
I didnt even cast a single mind blast and I still pulled aggro some how
---
I hear it every time I jump on any discord
---
&gt; Oddly this free flight from Moonglade to TB is the only one I don't get a bar for
---
I'm pretty sure it used to... I've just mained druid for a very long time, so I know the time... I'll have to check whether it shows in Classic.
---
Ive walked there from Tarren Mill
---
One of which is genuinely a blueberry
---
Totally unrelated but I'm just starting out in classic. What's your UI addon?  I tend to use bartender but haven't tried to check if that works in classic.
---
I have a very slow job, i remote in to my desktop at work when im REALLY bored and just drop lines. Its not all that bad. 
---
Got 300 fishing after a few days, and its pretty rewarding if you level it alongside cooking, just look up which vendors sell the appropriate fish recipe and have at it. 
---
Maxing cooking was unbelievably simple.
---
I see the problem here. 
---
Using a Mac.
---
Never let anyone tell you how to pull in any dungeon. If they don't like the way you tank then they can fuck off.
---
And there it goes, the projection
---
It's code, it's just a query language and not a programming language.
---
Ice Barbed Spear (AV reward) is on par with the Arcanite Reaper for a fresh level 60, and all you have to do is Win an AV.   Still a blue weap, but big and slow is good.
---
I’m pretty sure it goes to the first person alphabetical at least anytime I’ve seen it happen that’s who it went to.
---
I'm a wrrior it's a bit trickier
---
I only just started playing but ive seen lots of people talking about doing a "stance dance" so im assuming that is how you will be playing once you have different abilities in different stances. Ive also seen people set their scroll wheel to change stances
---
As many others have said, it’s the ability to multi-task when not doing anything terribly important. For me, as a mage, I’ll have a a youtube video playlist going that I’ll quickly mouse over and pause if I need to read something, pay attention, etc. The other extra screen I have is for reference. I’ll be typing on that one while hovering my mouse over a quest I’m trying to figure out, or looking up a fp for the zone I’m in, etc.
---
No, it absolutely should be possible. People can make a mistake on prices and not realize it until later. They shouldn't be punished for making a mistake. The only way it negatively effects you is that someone can prevent you from making a steal of deal. And they lose their deposit for doing so.
---
I can only perceive what you provide homie
---
Ok now you’re just getting ridiculous.
---
Nightfall is like what, a 4% or 5% chance?  Just the same as a sword proc.  So actually this is a good comparison to saying ONE nightfall proc is more burst, which makes sense.  Just like the sword spec.
---
“10 nightfall procs in a row”.... come on dude lol
---
Cast Ice block, wait for mobs to gather closely 
---
/Cancel aura ice block 
---
/Cast blink
---
Bandage and/or heal pot and/or blizzard abd/or flee from the scene. 
---
The mage was an idiot for casting nova, or it was a mistake.
---
And if you want to watch your own media, media player classic  from cccp codec site. It has stay in top mode and you can get rid of borders.
---
The biggest thing is only buying skills you really need. Aside from that you will get the majority of the gold you need in the last few levels because that’s when mob drops start selling for more.
---
Oh yeah of course, but OP said you can't when you can. I've done it once or twice to get some of the STV hunter quests done
---
&gt; Once again - you see the large circles stating everyone should greed then they need?
---
Yea, I see those, however I do not see anything remotely implying it applies to him.
---
&gt; “Stating rolling rules on an item in a communal channel -like /say or /party - and then circumventing those rules for personal gain” is ninja-ing.
---
So it's fine to roll need on everything, it's only ninjaing if I explicitly put out rules?
---
&gt; Your inability to see those differences is more entertaining that Classic tbh.
---
The fact you think there's a difference between the 2 is actually kinda entertaining.
---
Nice try, not an ounce of truth to it though.
---
I'm on sulfuron (french server). There has to be guilds like that on pretty much every servers tho, you just need to find it :)
---
Or just use a TV to play netflix?
---
I was hoping they weren’t because I haven’t heard or seen a single one which means they obviously can’t be very good but damn having a pet silverback would be badasssssss
---
Add awkward elif friend between them
---
Lol nobody says you can't clear dungeon with the 'non-meta' specs/classes, they are just saying it'll be slower.
---
Pretty much any comp can easily finish all leveling dungeons.
---
Haha, I play an Alchoholic Pirate character on Bloodsail Buccaneers. One of the major drawbacks is that in game alchohol is expensive so I’m always broke buying booze for him (which is why I have him send his “income” to a relative to “manage” his money lol RP) so I RP ask people for booze and then beg for money to buy booze when they don’t have it. Of course I am not incessantly asking, to not be annoying, but it’s always a fun anecdote while playing. I will typically get the “are you drunk?” While tanking my dungeons and then my character will reply “Me be ‘ot droonk, ye be drook, hic!” Haha, love it.
---
So tanks, and healers are also DD then since they do damage making that naming scheme stupid as hell and why games and gamers have defaulted to saying DPS instead of "DD".
---
I thought that was the best cata zone but to each their own
---
In raids, sure. In dungeons, having your +damage applied to hellfire, immolate etc is a nice boon.
---
I had this happen when I installed a new firewall at home. One of the ports for the Battle.net launcher were blocked. Try that?
---
Game changing
---
Bless you, Galaxy. I'll pull the update this evening.
---
It literally makes their attacks slower so yeah if the mob is stronger it makes it so it hits you less often
---
It's not that. I'll try to find it.
---
My friend was looking for a tank for scolomance, and some guy messaged him “hey are you Justin from Ohio?” And my friend noticed that it was a Druid tank that messaged him.... so he said “yes wtf, who is this?!?!?” Turns out its some guy named Tim who lost touch with Justin for 10 years and they know each other in real life but have not talked since. So my buddy was still desperate for a tank so he asked this Tim guy if he wanted to tank scholo for him, the Druid didn’t need anything from there but he said he would do it for an old friend and how hilarious it was that they reconnected. He’s been relentlessly asking my buddy to join discord but my friend hasn’t got it in him to tell Tim he’s been lying to him just so he had a tank for scholomance.
---
Need before greed is a different loot system from group loot, which I believe is causing the confusion here.
---
You came here to insult me, and instead have only gotten yourself worked up. Was it everything you hoped for?
---
Saving this, thanks op
---
Oh i agree 100% I just didn’t want to tank ST 😂 I’ve tried to avoid it the entire time just of lack of desire to but I wound up tanking BRD once or twice so far and I tanked ZF and SM a bunch too
---
Lmao, thanks. I don’t normally go complain on reddit, but that shit was so retarded. I feel better now.
---
Got it at 44 and by level 49; I had 120g again.
---
Or, you know, play with people and classes the way you enjoy clearing content and NOT adhere to this ridiculous "AOE or nothing" mindset.
---
I switched to dominos from bartender after not being able to find paging options for druid forms/shadowform/stealth.
---
40, I spent 39-40 grinding Swamp Jaguars and then borrowed like 30g if I remember correctly.
---
Theres a program called “always on top” works the same way, but for all type of windows.
---
Which part? Mojache?
---
Why would you assume someone asking if someone else was underage means they wanted sex? That's ridiculous. They might have just wanted confirmation that you were just some kid and not a severely retarded and immature adult.
---
And you're the perfect example of ad hominem and failing to actually grasp the responses people actually give lmao
---
ROFL, a prot leveler giving people advice. now i've seen it all.
---
Insult you, or rib you. Chill out my man, you got this all wrong
---
Sword is too fast, the 3.6 speed top dmg axe will always be favored since your rotations will include instant casts like MS and WW.
---
If sword also were 3.6, then sure.
---
Yea I’ve had mixed luck with the suggestion thing cuz some people don’t want to be “told how to play my class” , even when it’s hindering my class
---
/cheer
---
I'm downvoting because I hate players who have an e-ego. That goes for both you and the supposed "power". Do something worthwhile in your life
---
The mods here just go on their mood.  An unrelated “my GF made ‘x’” post with a Horde symbol makes it, but directly classic oriented things don’t.
---
Makes no sense.
---
Soapbox, feel free to ignore!!:  A creative WoW piece is neat, but is NOT related to Classic unless it refers to Classic oriented content.  A Horde cake, Alliance package, a symbol of World of Warcraft, or an art rendition of the World of Warcraft belongs on r/WoW or other subreddits.
---
During actual vanilla we once ran a full scholo run with survival spec hunter as the tank with me as holy pally as MT healer.
---
He lost aggro a few times, but it wasn't too bad
---
If you had a single set of shoulderpads and a warrior swung an axe at your head, it would glance off the pads and slice your neck, disconnecting head from body.
---
The way these double-pads are designed it protects your neck from any horizontal swings by trapping the weapon between the two pads/softening the blow before they can slice through.
---
Also they look kinda cool and I'm a biased rogue.
---
Yeah, it's very narrow-minded to not want to play with entitled assholes.
---
Miner and minor are actually the same words in French, we have a lot of bad jokes around this.
---
Yeah I'm gonna call bs on that.
---
You have to Actually read the quests.
---
I’m not expecting to have a pocket healer all the time. If you carry enough FAPs and other stuff you can avoid getting kited too bad most of the time.. warriors just get tunneled cuz we white Crit clothies to death
---
Is it stupid for me to reroll my professions at level 41?
---
I'm a 41 Mage with tailoring and enchanting, which I just picked because someone told me to. I'm pretty poor and haven't gotten much out of either of these. Tailoring is 187, enchanting is 150.
---
I know i wasted a ton of gold on these but considering rerolling either to engineering and mining for pvp grenades cause I think that would be really fun or just picking gathering professions or something else to make money.
---
Any thoughts? How hard would it be to start from scratch??
---
I have a reckoning macro I spam on my mouse button while in combat. If thats not against ToS I'm not sure why this would be. No promises though
---
Did you win the internet points yet? Shh now, it's okay.
---
So I'm thinking about starting Classic WoW, I want to go to a EU pvp server (English) which one should I choose, that is quite populated but can cater to casual gamers.
---
ah this shit again
---
IDK if I understand the route I'd be taking. Guess I would have to look at a map and see.
---
FD "jumping" also feels unreliable.
---
You forgot to take your sunglasses off before taking the screenshot
---
Cool, big grats too ya.
---
Grats on rhok delar you lucky bastard
---
RIP Doggo hope you have many fond memories you can look back on
---
That’s the approach I had until about 35, where ambush seemed to fall off some. I switched over to opening with CS and getting a 5 point rupture off before the stun wears off. It’s not as bursty but way more reliable. 
---
Also, if you haven’t bought Distract yet, do it and use it often. I use it on almost every mob. It allows you to stop pats in their tracks, turn mobs to save from running around them, and go past 100 energy through regen
---
Have been daggers and always will be daggers. If I wanted to just spam sinister strike at face, I would have rolled a warrior. The only gripe I have with Classic is this:  
---
I spent level 38-44 running RFD and never once saw the dagger. I only got my upgrade in Zul Farrak.
---
shifting into form causes a GCD, cancelform does not
---
This is gonna be a game changer, I was thinking I'd develope RSI from alt tabbing so often for podcasts etc. haha.
---
As a shaman you can use the 'hearthstone trick' to set a new place as home RIGHT as the spell finishes, so that you hearth your original place but then when you hearth next the NEW place is set.  So you bop back and forth very quickly. 
---
Sitting in Stonard, just dinged 44, and want to go back and train in Org?  Stand at Stonard innkeeper.  Cast Hearthstone.  Talk to innkeeper during cast, set Stonard as home RIGHT as stone finishes.  YOu appear in Org.  Train skills/bank/etc.  Cast astral recall, POP back in Stonard in less than 5 minutes.  You're basically a mage at that point.
---
They're not dead. They just haven't reached endgame yet.
---
Arcane Explosition has higher DPS then Blizzard.
---
It's similar with warlocks. As soon as they learn that Hellfire does more DPS then Rain of Fire, it becomes their first and only option most of the time. While I occasionally see a lock using RoF in a smart way I lost count of the number of locks suiciding next to 4 mobs and then, just when they are down to 20% health one aggros and instantly murders them.
---
Oh OK I assumed you were a mage or a warlock
---
It is. Which is exactly why i run my own groups.
---
Nope later phase
---
thought it was a dkcr screenshot haha
---
Probably should have lied. 😂😂
---
Shoot. Thanks
---
Dream wife. Even accepting to give it a try is just perfect. Hope she get along with the game and eventually wow would be your part
---
Lol nice
---
4 Minutes, I always start the stopwatch and the longest it took for me was 3 Minutes and 32 seconds. I'm standing like 5 yards past the door though.
---
Running Uldaman at 40? That last boss is going to be a killer.
---
Frost spec specifically was never bad. I think fire was considered suboptimal for all but one of the later phases.
---
The standard is 6 max... Please tell me you haven't been playing this whole time with only 2 action bars
---
Why does this somehow makes me unable to give advice?
---
The first talent you'd take as a frost mage gives you 6% hit (effectively) and means that enemies 3 levels up are barely more difficult than 2. 4 Is noticiably more difficult but I can still fight 2 of them at once if I've got full HP and mana. 
---
My brother tried to level a warrior and the difference is night and day, a mob 3 levels up for him is totally rng on whether or not the kill is even possible and the odds aren't in his favor at all.
---
calm down with the?????????
---
HOW
---
With addons, you use your time and money efficiently so you can have more time for adventures and more time to discover :) Retail in general is already way too easy. It doesn't hurt to have addons to help you out in Classic.
---
No one hear talking about how this person got one of only 39 english two letter words as a name for their *bank alt*
---
sulfuras is pretty cool
---
A few sword swings and body slashes too!
---
Client side transmog, make your character able to look a little less like a clown for you even if they'd still look like a mismatched goof for everyone else
---
Where can I sign this petition
---
"JUST FLIPPIN TAKE THAT FRIGGIN TIP AND FORNICATE OFF!!!!"
---
I found one a few days ago, auctioneer told me 23g. Listed for 20 twice, then 15. Listed it yesterday for 10g and it didn’t sell.
---
Edit: it’s also not BIS for any 39 twinks so I don’t think it will go up too much. Obviously as people get more gold to spend and level alts it’ll go up some, but I don’t think it’s a super valued item.
---
Just for further info none of the insignia giving Argent Dawn repeatable are in the game yet either.
---
Really? 30mins 30sec... Huh... Alright mate thanks, what was the earliest  and the average would you say?
---
My favorite is when they ask for water and I’m oom so I ask them to wait so I can drink up and make more then they ask “ can I just have some from the stack your drinking from? I don’t need a full stack anyways”...
---
Uhm no I need it to make you and the other dudes some water too...
---
I was definitely wondering how some bears on a BBC special were going to say "Mrrrgllllllgrrrrlllrlrllll."
---
Go for it, 150-200 in a profession isnt that high.
---
I'm fury / prot and enjoying it. 
---
I miss anger management *a lot* but im really enjoying tanking while DW and throwing on the shield in shifty scenarios. 
---
I have to recommend getting your hit gear first though becausssee im sitting around 3% instead of the recommended 7%+ and i REALLY wished i would have been more patient.
---
I wouldn't do it the first time going in to MC. The content is moderately easy, but the first time you need to have as much mitigation as possible to account for the many errors that will occur.
---
I'm curious how your action bars work for your type of game play? Do you actually press your F# lineup?? Or do you just use 1-5 with the shift modifier?
---
Either way, I think you're missing out on some really great keybinds and macros as a hunter, especially for any pvp should that interest you.
---
Edit: what I mean to say is it would be a damn shame if you're clicking on your skills.
---
 Yeah dude it seems like no matter what you HAVE to make big pulls so they can AoE, no less, they have no ability to realize that you dont need to speed run every dungeon
---
Cg
---
are you serious? its obv you've never farmed mara then. Your point is invalid
---
I leveled Disc/Holy and didn't do a single quest after level 16 that wasn't inside a dungeon. I vendored nearly everything because I didn't want to spend time on the AH. Despite having to spend a ton on water, I hit 40 with 94g.
---
I started thinking about my mount while I was in my mid 20s, and from that point on I only learned healing spells. Which was fine since I only healed dungeons.
---
Dude I love you
---
I'd give you gold my I'm saving up for a second monitor
---
-Makes casual claim about water being dry
---
-“Uh Sir? I think water is actually we....?”
---
-“SHOW ME VIDEO PROOF”
---
Or you could just like.. go play the game and figure it out?
---
With this pic Horde should be emoting your corpse too.
---
Can I even use two hand maze? So far as I've checked out the weapon trainers, I can only use staff :/ 
---
Can I do anything at all against warlocks in pvp, btw? Right now they just fear me repeatedly until I'm dead, and I can't interrupt the cast or break the fear or do anything.
---
I simply waited to start on wow classic a week after it launch to avoid any queues.
---
*slaps lazy peon with blackjack*
---
Get back to work!
---
As a WoW noob, one thing I don’t understand - how does the sword here have lower damage AND lower attack speed, yet the dps is about the same?
---
Is “speed” the time between attacks, meaning higher is slower?
---
Reserving 1 item while making a group/dealing with the usual party leader crap and farming an attunement (ie UBRS key) while the rest of you sit on your ass AFK makes me an entitled asshole? Hahahahhahaha
---
Oh it's almost as if there are a significant amount of people who don't need that 1 reserved item and would prefer to not deal with making a group and farming keys. Yes, you are very narrow-minded. 
---
Besides, check out my full pre-raid BIS that I got by reserving Dal'rends and taking the effort to organize groups and farm my own key. I hope it makes you seethe.
---
Thats cool, doesnt mean non mages have to do everything a mage wants lmfao
---
Those bars are a nightmare, cooking and first aid bound to 7 and 8, why?!
---
Maybe it was a new idea instead
---
Healer UI: 95%Netflix, 5% grid
---
Yeah! That’s what I told them. I tried to point out that it might be easier for a mage to pull with blink and nova. They didn’t want that. Thank you for being one of the good mages.
---
Where are you located in the world?  You will want to determine based off east/west coast so you have a decent latency.
---
that dude: "i swear, i just wanted to hit it for the skill up!"
---
hansen: "????????????"
---
who?
---
Did I say that anywhere I’m my comment?
---
Def should have lied on that one hah
---
Ferals have less down time due to never needing mana, so out do warlocks by a lil bit
---
It does not work inside a dungeon
---
Let's boil this discussion down to the basics as we've had a bunch of hypothetical shit going on here.
---
You're accusing someone of being a ninja, provide proof the person is a ninja, or stop accusing people when you don't have any proof.
---
39 rogue here.
---
Currently wielding [Sword of Serenity](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6829/sword-of-serenity) and [Speedsteel Rapier](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13034/speedsteel-rapier).
---
I also want to go for the [Vanquisher’s Sword](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=10823/vanquishers-sword).
---
Could anyone suggest the best combination of the two, main hand and off-hand for a combat rogue?
---
Thanks.
---
I have, and when I can make 18g in a 15 minute run, why would I add another 5-8 minutes to that run in order to get an additional 3g?
---
because you obviously know very little about warriors if you spec prot outside of raids.
---
Every war has their spies.
---
That’s the gist of it. Take advantage Berserker Rage so you’ll have more incoming rage from damage. Defensive stance when you have to run away, and tank damage to give you time.
---
Was just thinking ill play a druid or priest to spt my fiance when I get her to play.
---
Who’s this Druid not hibernating a pet and entangling hunter and standing in his dead zone? Dude deserves to die for sucking as a Druid.
---
I’m human alliance and I kinda want a night elf white tiger for epic mount. Is that possible? What do I need?
---
I do. I do. I doooo!
---
Holy cow I read those in Jr. high and you just reminded me of that series. I think the name of the first book got changed though because I bought it and started reading it and recognized it because I had read it before.
---
He doesn't like this place.
---
In purest form it’s a group of officers micromanaging every loot drop with the intended goal of making each loot have the greatest impact/upgrade.
---
In practice it’s very vague and every ‘council’ is different. As an outsider with low trust it’s hard to swallow. My guild literally lets the classes hash it out for tier pieces any way they see fit.
---
Our hunters work together for minmax upgrades and our warlocks just roll random.
---
It's basically as unfair as if I had a 15 second stun. But in addition when I get feared I get all the STV tigers attacking me at the same time.
---
The turtles resisted my spells like crazy as a frost mage. So I'm not sure it really balances out that much.
---
It really is better as a caster though, fighting high level mobs is an inconvenience for us, but for melee classes, it turns into a struggle for survival each time
---
You have a single friend in the guild that you aren't really playing with other than socially?
---
Tell them straight up. If saying "Hey this guild doesn't fit my playstyle but I'd love to keep hanging out socially and in game when you're in the same content" burns bridges, that was a pretty thin friendship anyway.
---
Yeah, I can understand that. I suppose not everyone has a neurotic brain that is fixated on being as efficient as possible like myself.
---
I appreciate that we can all enjoy this game in our own way.
---
Fucking disgusting. Blizzard needs to ban these people right now, it's against the TOS.
---
I think what you mean is bad, toxic attitude.
---
Herbalism makes fuck all untill you get to 50+ zones
---
Not hard at all especially as a mage which can AoE farm mats and/or cloth to sell for mats.  Hopefully you wouldn't have spent any gold for tailoring and minimal for enchanting so your only loss woule have been the mat sells and greens.
---
As other user stated, 150 isnt that high at all my level 10 priest is 150/150 maxed tailor/enchanting just from all the trash I was able to send her from my main..and she had a bank amd backpacks full of more mats to use whenever I get her to level 20.
---
You'll have no issues releveling.
---
Same, I hear these pronounced wrong all the time
---
You mentioning him in a negative way makes me think you are a Trans something liberal that don't like conservatives?  Im getting close right? :)
---
Switched to bear after playing with a sabbercat for years. It is a whole different world. Now I want a gun.
---
Hehe I second this, but I don't mean to be rude. Just looks like a lot of missed opportunities to play a better hunter.
---
you just saved my life
---
you can be shadow till you decide to spam dungeon and no one will bother you, you are pretty strong in direct fights. Also even when holy farming really dont feel that slow and pvp is easily avoidable in my experience, or you can get some mates and just right.
---
I always liked dungeon crawlers in which you got to play a team of people. So I'm multiboxing! I seem to get a lot of hate on reddit, but my guild loves me. I got full preraid BIS on my entire team in about a week, and now I can run my guildies through dungeons to get theirs. Its very rewarding. Just this morning I ran a rogue guildie through UBRS and got him true strike shoulders and the dalrend mainland.
---
Can you explain why a Bear tank would be harder to heal over a Warrior? I'm not talking about how shit situations where unexpected damage comes in.
---
There's a reason I have a text file called "Black Book" on other screen.
---
Easy enough to ctrl + F party leaders on parties if I feel I've seen the nickname before.
---
I don't think there is a winning or losing
---
Between ghostwolf, recall, and reincarnate, it's crazy how much QOL shaman have.
---
Edit: waterbreathing and waterwalking also.
---
Horde is asshole. Why charlie hate?
---
oh crap, you are right, I forgot to add, I'm looking for servers in EU
---
Does it matter?
---
Good one. I don’t know why but I literally thought of this but with gold and just about higher levels banking you during questing haha
---
VW is obviously miserable in his life....just listen to him

not really, you have to almost get full t1 for it to be better and it is actually on par with t1 if you are daggers
---
&gt; provide proof the person is a ninja,
---
Screenshot literally shows a mage rolling need just to make a bit of cash, if that's not ninjaing then you will have to explain that to the 16 thousand people who upvoted this thread:

---
Except this fresh new zone smells like devilsaur dung
---
I think the warrior shaman combo is more effective than warrior/hunter. But sure.
---
...and then everyone started clapping!
---
I run damage/healing meters in pretty much any dungeon I heal as they come with timestamps I see how long the dungeon takes.
---
The shortest runs are in most cases those without time spent rezzing and corpse walking or murdering the third ass pull in a row. While yes, chain pulling and proper application of AOEs can be faster  it requires a higher level of coordination then the average pug has. 
---
There are also certain big differences between how certain classes handle encounters so that different group compositions will have different issues. 
---
A paladin healer for example will easily heal a low amount of damage indefinitly, while a priest will at some point need to either pause to spirit reg or drink. The priest however has AOE healing capabilities that make all players taking damage at the same time much easier to handle then the paladin would be able to. 
---
Remember, you have no idea if that guy is specced in a sensible way for the occasion, has sensible gear and has the experience. 
---
So why not simply take a chill pill and then speed up if necessary.
---
you set your ui up like I do. pray tell, are you a clicker?
---
A ton of QOL until you get into groups that ask us to cast totems like every global cool down until we are OOM lmao
---
Distract shot is for kiting.
---
'low effort' rules are always garbage and abused by mods. It's almost like they forget we are on a site with an upvote/downvote system.
---
Also don't have a second monitor at the dorm and this is worth sooo much! :D A whole new world!
---
Carrion bird or owl with max level screech. Say goodbye to pulling aggro from your pet 😉
---
Axe smith for arcanite reaper
---
This person is not a good paladin tank, honestly.
---
You take engineering, you lead with a bomb into concept and start tabbing around with SoR, and not even double CoC will snap aggro off.
---
^ underrated comment here
---
pure indifference\*
---
I didn't know I could do this - thank you.  My wife stole my second monitor for streaming.
---
Just keep trucking till you get trash  made from the Mara quest mate.
---
3 Minutes, not 30 haha.
---
Earliest was maybe over a minute.
---
Not necessarily, but it’s annoying and improper. Especially if you pronounce something in such a way that it confuses people.
---
Is it? Where?
---
You need to be exalted with the night elves.  Once you're exalted with another race's capitol city, you have access to buy their mounts.  Typically people farm reputation like this by runecloth turn-ins.  There is a cloth quartermaster in each city.  You make the turn ins, you get rep - eventually you get exalted and then can buy the mount.  It requires a metric butt-ton of runecloth for this, so be prepared.
---
Yes. PvP is the only way to play
---
As a tank that leveled via aoe spellcleave...when any mage told me how to pull the dungeon or tell me how to play I either leave or boot them.  It's only going to get toxic from there bc they think they know how to play.
---
Should have taken a pic of the phonescreen with the webcam of the PC. Missed opportunity.
---
Exalted reputation with darnassus. Not impossible, just a long grind. Get your normal mount first, then later on worry about the rep-grind.
---
Check: https://youtu.be/5e4njNjxmFo
---
For you, no. For the first guy that flamed me and then told me I was upset, there was.
---
It is possible. Get your Darnassus reputation to Exalted. Then they will let you buy the training and the mount.
---
Easier said than done, though.
---
I know. They're just very annoying to look at &amp; are often played by annoying people.
---
Damn - never had a reason to use Opera, just might give it a try now.
---
Ah okay. The whole shifting at the correct time sounds cool, but is it highly contextual and more a pvp-thing or also a thing you do actively during leveling?
---
Thanks, I love you

According to the subs reaction, neither do you.
---
This was my thought
---
Explain
---
You don't need to tank, if you don't want, just because you are a warrior. But why do some of them dislike taking so much? I don't get it
---
Endgame in Phase 1 and 2 is fairly bare of content in the endgame. You're left to do your own thing outside gearing for/from raids. This leaves you making money and world pvp since no battlegrounds are in yet.
---
While leveling behind the curve with pvp leaves you more vulnerable to getting ganked by an overleveled dingus, it's not uncommon for people who reach endgame to burn out on pve content and reroll on pvp.
---
If pvp interests you, go pvp. Only people who should go to pve are people who abhor the idea of any pvp outside battlegrounds.
---
Good luck man. I got my gf classic and it was a doozy explaining everything like W goes forward.
---
questing in ashenvale is better imho, mage SM runs really start to pick up at 32
---
You should wait to spec fury prot until you have good gear.
---
With Shaman you mean enhancement? And what about elemental shaman?
---
Tried Warlock, thought they were okay but I did not like the whole pet tanking idea,  I was always standing still.
---
5% crit mathematically increases your dos way more than sword prof unless you are crit capped already
---
1. get a job
---
2. buy second monitor
---
3. profit?
---
Gonna chime in here too I’m arms and I always am 1st or 2nd dmg
---
You’re just going to hit us with that sad story and not share a picture of the best girl?
---
No idea
---
There are, you are wrong, and you still have no proof of your claim. Bye.
---
However, the cooking food is lacking compared to vendor or mage food. Once you hit 45 the vendor food will restore 2148 life, while the highest cooking recipes restore a mere 1392 life.
---
Amazes me when you see hunters pulling threat, it's like: You have a pet and you presumably have to manage your threat with just the two of you out questing!
---
Mages on the other hand, I just think they like to see all the numbers pop up. ;D
---
Yeah, fuck mages in general.
---
It's actually not. There was a post not long ago that said they don't care.
---
Correct, higher wep speed = longer time between attacks = slower. The axe is slower.
---
What level does the quest “bring the light” become available in SW for RFD?  Some websites have conflicting info, currently lvl 38 and can’t get the quest yet.  Thanks
---
Go out and collect a bunch of low level herbs to sell. Also while you’re questing, make a stack of herbs to sell and a stack to use for alchemy. Find out what herbs are selling for a lot of money on the AH and find those.
---
Mining right now is extremely lucrative.  Thorium is going for 80s per bar oh AH, and arcane crystals (which drop out of thorium veins occasionally) always sell for 24g+.  Mithril is probably pretty sweet right now too.  I'm a herbalist/alchemist on my main, which is great - but at least on my server mining is better if you have access to thorium.
---
Glad to help! :)
---
But he doesn't like that place!
---
So the definition of greed includes the word power, seems like what you get from equipping an item 🤔
---
Saw a Mage posting in LFG for almost an hour the other day asking for 1 more Mage for AoE runs. I asked why he didn't take another class instead, "faster this way".
---
If you can pull it off. Most mages that ask for big pulls are terrible players. I’d love to see them trying to tank while keyboard turning. That would’ve been hilarious to watch.
---
Do the wife
---
Is the a lowkey joke about the worst UI in the history of UIs?
---
Your a bad retail player, you wouldn’t get why it’s in bad taste but that’s ok, because we’re ignoring every one of you we see in chat, so soon you’ll just be running with others like yourself.
---
Merci.
---
Ça va?
---
I just didnt play most night the first week. Queues were 2 hours minimum anytime after 5pm. I just watched TV shows and hung out. I dinged 44 yesterday while finishing up the big game hunter quest with no competition for mobs in sight. It's actually better to start behind The pack and then race to 60 on the weekends and late nights.
---
What is battlegrounds?
---
is TSM4 currently broken? it shows disenchant value on items which seems to be quite off. Can someone test and confirm?
---
that's funny, i originally switched to bartender in vanilla jsut because it's paging was a lot easier for me to setup stance-dancing on my warr.
---
You're right. Radios have ro play at least 40% of their songs in french language. Movies get their titles translated more often than not, even when it makes no sense whatsoever. Like the translated title of "the Hangover" in France is... "Very Bad Trip"
---
Duh.
---
&gt;Is “speed” the time between attacks, meaning higher is slower?
---
Can't hibernate it when it's got bestial wrath
---
My warrior mate and I tried to get it to work when we were levelling as warrior/mage duo inviting priest and more mages, sometimes a lock. With smaller pulls and/or running together with the warrior and me pulling mobs simultaneously it could be okay-ish but it was both inconsistent and really no comparison to a full mage/lock/priest group unfortunately.
---
Well you can fuck off voidwalker, the only thing you're god for is sacrificing.
---
At least have you finally decided a main?
---
Epic fail
---
Nobody runs with that shit on.  100% bail if it gets turned on, and there’s apps to alert you, so go scamboi
---
the best part is 0 keybinds
---
Do you need to change the YouTube video every time? Or will it just show the videos as you choose new ones
---
the number of people making thread instead of talking To their groups/guilds is hilarious.
---
Lol you're not playing classic then why do you have an opinion? 
---
Warriors are one of the best dps classes in the game once they get whirlwind at lvl 36
---
I'm doing this right now as well.. level 27 (except questing, not grinding). and yeah, getting a chain of ambush crits is the best feeling ever!
---
Wait. Explain
---
JP is an awesome guy! Hello Mr lefty :)
---
Tbf I have multiple friends playing who has already hit 40. I just had someone lend me 25 gold. Which I was able to pay back in like a day.
---
Exactly what I thought of too
---
Who cares 95% of people I meet can't pronounce caramel or cabinet.
---
Look which potions are needed for quests. For example, frost oil, though you have to get a recipe first.
---
WORK IS DA POOP!
---
I had 12g at level 35 (made the mistake of training artisan gathering skills before I bought mount, thought it would pay off but it didnt).  You'll be just fine on money at 40 if you keep up whatever habits got you to 12g at 29.
---
i only use 1 8 button bar. everything else is keybound and hidden
---
Frost Oil is the best money maker for your level.
---
The recipe is sold from the goblin vendor in Alterac Ruins (just camp him for 15-45 minutes until you get it) and run circles around the mountain and pick up the materials to make it. Generally I can farm enough mats to make around 10 an hour and each one sells fairly quickly at around 1-2g each depending on your servers economy. They sell well because Frost Oil is needed for a quest (badlands I think) and is also pretty useful item for Warriors in PvP.
---
Good luck out there and I hope my Tip will help you earn some money.
---
This is life changing
---
Interesting how you react...so do you have like 90% of your servers mages in ignore? Hope you don’t plan on raiding if you hate them so much.
---
Thanks! Makes zero sense to me that a higher speed rating means slower attacks, but at least I understand the dps in this game now!
---
Is it the one that happens when you build a mutilisk?
---
Who the heck is talking about combos? No one in this thread that's for sure.
---
I had this issue - it was my background processes using my data bandwidth.
---
GM showed me how to make these manual rather than auto - worked a treat. Maybe give it a google
---
Found the Olympus player KEKW
---
elemental is technically viable, but you either have to stand around waiting for  your  mana to regen a lot or you have to have water on hand constantly.  Either way you have a ton of downtime and frost shock into lightning bolt spam is not really that much more compelling gameplay than shock+auto attack.
---
as  for warlocks, most  people actually don't use void to tank.  fear kiting (or later drain tanking with darkpact) are generally much faster for grinding and using the succubus or felhunter in such cases is much more rewarding.
---
Not really, just stereotypical. And I'm not a lefty since well... I'm not an American. You're definitely very far from understanding me. I don't think you have the IQ for it.
---
Raging over calling a meme a pic and a teenager yet....  good luck in life man, you're gonna need it.
---
"If your older your smarter"
---
yah clearly that's the case. Probably why the world is in such great shape and how everyone is just so happy. All those super smart decisions from our super smart older people. What a dipshit
---
pours one out for the 4 remaining Firefox users
---
I gained 5 levels grinding coyotes in the badlands. Maybe it wasn’t the most efficient thing to do. Maybe it was crazy. I did however easily afford my mount 😂
---
Sure. But if the game is highly successful for that year and millions played I think it was worth it.
---
No worries!  Unfortunately I'm only familiar with US servers so I can't be of help but hopefully that update will get someone from the EU here for you!
---
Lock tanking is actually surprisingly effective in the right situations, for those noobs who didn't know (like me).
---
1) The term everyone does include the person stating it. That is common knowledge and you seem to be purposefully ignorant of that. 
---
2) Yes, while it will get you kicked from any group it is indeed allowed when rolling “need before greed” rules. 
---
3) Try to come up with something to add when you are out of hot air instead of just echoing the last thing i said to you lmao
---
4) You are right, you’re a hunter! It probably felt like you got slighted on ever drop ever, no way it was only once!
---
I hope you have the realization soon that you are wrong or you get better at trolling, whichever is good with me!
---
Steamlink app.. Actually pretty easy to setup.
---
Those guys are animals.  Get the 2nd screen.
---
Warrior? Orange mob? Turtle with super high armor? He did this to himself.
---
So not worth it then time and money wise?
---
I was looking for a new colored shirt for my lady undead tank.didnt realize until then that the shirt was the only reason my character wasn't running around in a bikini. It's bad enough that plate armor still equates to giant floppy undead breasts when she runs.
---
Grats on the epic mount o/
---
It’s a Yu-Gi-oh reference ....
---
Just another post of someone ignoring over small in-game things. Don't think some realise you can ask for a fee and you are free to counter offer or just walk away.
---
It took me 4 days to hit 40 on my warrior. How long roungly should I be expecting it to take to hit 60?
---
if 2 bosses are taking you 15minutes it shows that you either dont know what your doing or your just talking out of your ass. 3 bosses takes me 13-15 minutes depending on rotgrips location. you're argument is invalid as I said
---
Just do yourself a favor and get a second screen! Even if you do this, you’ll use the second screen so much.
---
hoj on first run at lvl 53 LOL.
---
60 now no swords yet no shouldies.
---
Not a lefty. I think you're projecting a lot of bias since our conversation didn't have to do with politics but rather with grammar. It's a pity you can't hold on to a thought long enough to realize that.
---
Look at this guy, fucking mining! Unbelievable!
---
Centaur bracers is fine you spend a shit ton of time killing centaurs for other quests.
---
Is the PVP ranking server specific or something like battlegroup? Would it actually be easier to rank up in Phase 3 on a lower population faction or PVE server just because there is less competition?
---
this is what you get for leveling fast
---
Maybe that's the difference. I played trough it like 5 times in the last 12 years. Still explore new quests, tho.
---
But might be different for OP
---
I've been using this for a little bit. have a 55" 4k screen above my monitor but i never turn it on haha
---
Happy cake day!!!
---
If you are going to be leveling why not just play ret, if you’re gonna spam dungeons play holy
---
Someone in the guild I'm on had the same thing happen, you on Fairbanks?
---
Hell yeah! Grats!
---
Cries in “my pc with 4gb can only run wow without dropping frame rates significantly”.
---
 Gut Ripper (purple dagger) dropped today from ZF. It is now in my server  25-30g in AH... Should I sell it now for that price or should I hold it  as it will be much more expensive in the future? Thanks 4 your help  reddit!
---
That would only really be viable to AOE farm lower level mobs. For higher level you're probably better off with SoR, JoW and patience.
---
It's beyond the point of absurdity.
---
Like, I get if it is more of an inside joke... But most of them are still not being done ironically.
---
What the fuck?
---
50s a stack for mage food sounds like too much to me, I wouldn’t ignore you over it but I wouldn’t pay that
---
I use Opera but the pop-out never works with Netflix. I guess because of the DRM; Did you do something to enable it?
---
Nah you’ll go oom, level ret/reck.
---
That whole album was fire. SLip out the back, Right Now are also some of my personal favourites.
---
No, they just cant do as much damage.
---
I wasn’t able to sell a single frost oil on my server
---
You can always just not charge a fee up front and include to people that tips are appreciated :) If you don’t someone else will eventually
---
Only bitch mages ask for gold for water/food tbh. But to each their own. 
---
I always offer 30-40s for a port, which makes sense given the cost of the reagent. Then I sneak in a “and can you toss me a few stacks of water”. It always works. If not, /who mage in my area and whisper the next guy.
---
Doing all Scarlet Monastery end bosses? :)

All but melee, its 100% mee-lee

10v10 capture the flag type idea.
---
It’s called short hand
---
&gt; The term everyone does include the person stating it. That is common knowledge and you seem to be purposefully ignorant of that.
---
He says "all", not "everyone", there's a subject missing from the sentence, why are you inventing in your head that the subject should be "we" and not "you"?
---
&gt; Yes, while it will get you kicked from any group it is indeed allowed when rolling “need before greed” rules.
---
So, uhm, you're not doing anything wrong, but it will get you kicked from every group?
---
&gt; Try to come up with something to add when you are out of hot air instead of just echoing the last thing i said to you lmao
---
So it doesn't add anything yet you say it?
---
&gt; You are right, you’re a hunter! It probably felt like you got slighted on ever drop ever, no way it was only once!
---
Again, who is blowing hot air now? You have yet to present a single argument for why what the mage did was acceptable, but you attack me personally instead.
---
&gt; I hope you have the realization soon that you are wrong 
---
Maybe when you could present an argumentt
---
I don't think they meant it literally.
---
Thanks! Do you get decent money from Alchemy or is it mainly for the consumables for yourself?
---
I'm a Holy Pally so I'm not even sure what I should take at 60 haha. Thinking probably Engineering? So maybe mining would be best regardless. I'm also thinking of skipping First Aid until end game so I can sell my cloth for some extra cash too...
---
Well I’m 55 and starting to heal end game dungeons - was thinking of speccing holy soon or possibly a holy/ret or holy/prot hybrid.   
---
But I’d rather go full holy.
---
Combat daggers misses a lot of utility that allows you to get high crits off.  You don't have points to spare for the subtlety tree that let's you get closer to open with.
---
Except all the advice he gave was completely valid. But fuck that guy for playing the spec he wants to.
---
Got mine at 40 just auctioning/vendoring random items from mobs and quests whilst training a bit of tailoring. Just make sure not to dump all your money into abilities that aren’t necessary. Also a good camping spot is the Warmonger and Enforcer ogres north of Southshore in the mountains, they drop good gold/items as well as good xp too.
---
As a healing priest frost nova is helpful if mobs are on the healer or dps, can be just rank 1 to save mana.
---
Does anybody know how I can set it so that the game warns me about overpower proc when I'm NOT in battle stance? 
---
Not sure if it'll be an add on thing but sometimes it's hard to notice a Dodge.
---
Your response wasn’t constructive or useful in any way. lol

37:50 is the door sound. Haven't listened to all of them yet.
---
Beast.
---
Who said I was only killing 2 bosses?
---
I'm killing celebras, tinker and rotgrip on top of picking a bunch of flowers.
---
&gt;  3 bosses takes me 13-15 minutes depending on rotgrips location.
---
So you're making, what? 35-40g per hour? And you don't think that supports my argument that doing princess isn't worth it?
---
Amen brotha.
---
You don't have to be American to be left leaning, guess ur superb iq was not aware of that :)
---
As a rogue fighting mobs 3 levels above me is something i very rarely do. Its not worth the pain for a few extra xp.
---
Some guildies invited me (a paly) to a rend run asking if I could tank. I said yeah, thinking I would off- tank.  I get to the group and it’s 3 rogues, 2 mages, and a lvl 58 ret paly.  Apparently, the rogues and mages wanted zero competition on dal rends and briarwood Reed.  We wiped 3 times and got through the Rend event on our first attempt.
---
If they’re damage dealers, that also means they do dps. It’s completely arbitrary, dude.
---
Are there any items / enchantments that would give me +10 tailoring in total?
---
Hi fellow warriors!
---
If I understand correctly, being an orc using axes (DW) I get 3% hit rating against lvl 63 elites (bosses). Looking at BiS lists they always want you to get 9% hit using gear, to reach the soft hit cap. I'm wondering, wouldn't it be better to replace some of the hit% gear with some crit% gear, as long as you stay at 6% gear hit, while dual wielding axes?
---
And this is why I don’t understand people who say BOE rares and epics shouldn’t be rolled all-need on. 
---
Most of the time while leveling especially you’d be a damn fool to equip it (buy it) instead of selling it.
---
There is also free software "OnTopReplica" that will do with for any window you have open in the background. 
---
Works very well.
---
What are you implying?
---
So your proof of this being item being ninja looted is a picture of another person ninja looting an item?
---
No one is arguing that ninja looting doesn't exist, you just have no proof that this mage ninja looted anything.
---
Some items have no deposit so there is no penalty from flooding the market with 1c bids to show up first
---
There is no etiquette. Skin it or get boned. If you want to teach them a lesson in boredom don't loot it and let it despawn.
---
Bestial wrath doesn’t last 5 minutes. Use bark skin then heal urself with some regrowth rejuv. If he attempts to viper sting abolish poison. While barkskin is up entangle the hunter and stand in his dead zone while the hunter pet attempts to bring you down with just its dps. When bestial wrath goes off sleep it. Then just kill hunter. Fighting hunters is a joke as a Druid unless they have backup it’s game over if you know how to play your class.
---
That's WoW cartographer. That brings back memories!
---
My brother set up a second monitor for me.. he was offended I only used one.. I use it for discord..  everything else is alt tabbed like normal.

Hell even my main monitor, I hated it when I got it cause it was so huge.

I'm old.

LOL

I’m level 39 (on my main) and have 30gold to my name. Heed my warning of the dangers of playing your main drunk and visiting the IronForge auction house. Those sweet sweet blues are a gateway drug to poverty
---
If you typically play at 2am,find a time zone closer to your play time.  Low pop at 2 on the morning is 100% normal, even for all the big ones
---
Succubus, turn off lash if pain and use dark pact. That combo with drain life and dots is minimal downtime. Succubus does great damage and has great mana regen.

IF you use imp as mana battery you lose all your pet dmg.

My position in the queue keeps increasing, currently at 2400.. any reason why?

It's fun to mess with you because you seem to take this seriously, and your perspective on those things really do shine through. Thanks for the laughs :)
---
Bloodfang is awesome. Good population but never full.
---
No, I'm saying the 2 situations are indentical, yet for some reason reddit thinks one is ninja looting while the other isn't, that doesn't make any sense.
---
Just don't loot and leave corpse they will get salty and go find someone else to screw over
---
Yeah sorry, but that is one of the most insufferable videos I've watched in the last few months. The guy is constantly using smart-sounding word salad to successfully hide opinionated trivialities behind a waterfall of words. He is one of those smug guys who imagine themselves to be beyond the fray and to truly, objectively get what is going on, while everyone else is just a partisan hack. A type of person you usually meat among libertarian dudebro crowds. A dozen times in this "analysis", he bases his entire arguments on supposedly objective "facts" that are anything but.  
---
Just one example: In a classic disingenuous move, he compares Mythic Azshara to freakin Ragefire Chasm to conclude that "Classic isn't hard". By that, he hisses the point by a mile: While BFA may have much higher difficulty spikes in mythic/mythic + endgame, it also falls in a bottomless chasm of trivialized content where it is basically impossible to die, a chasm that basically contains EVERYTHING in the game and 99% of the whole outdoor world until you get into mythic raiding or high mythic + keys.  Even worse, he contradicts himself when at one point, he talks about  different playstyles and expectations by players, only to bash stuff like visiting class trainer to get new skills without any nuance as "waste of time" when looked at from a "modern perspective". Except getting skills from class trainers isn't a "waste of time" when it enhances immersion in a freaking RPG, because it means interacting with the world to get stronger instead of new skills flying into your skillbook, an entirely UI-based mechanic. Also, there isn't the "one" modern perspective...OBVIOUSLY, otherwise Classic wouldn't be a thing. Classic and games like Classic appealing to players doesn't mean they have "outdated" interests, it means they want and demand different experiences from games than the crowd most big gaming companies catered to the last 5 to 10 years. Does mean disliking quest markers and quest compasses in Elder Scrolls that you are a traditionalist nostalgist? No, it means that you want to play an immersive RPG instead of a railroaded, hand-holding FPS experience.
---
Are you serious? Those daggers are insane!
---
Yes, they do if they advertise for a group with "Reserved X item", master loot gets turned on at that boss only for that specific item. It's completely normal and many groups do it. There's a difference between randomly turning master loot on and advertising that it'll be on. You're so dense lmao.
---
I have to be arguing with level 40s here, right?
---
wow
---
False
---
Just hit lvl 40 on warr and got just about 90g for my mount. 
---
I have mining/skinning and my skinning is at 225. I had skinning to make extra money for mount but now should I take blacksmith or engineering? Or should I pay 5g to train more skinning and keep skinning til 60?
---
Guess I'm on the wrong server because on mine essence of water is 9g and 82s for 5 nightfin soup...
---
Omg we have evolved greatly since 2006. This makes it bearable on those long flight paths.
---
It was acceptable because the designers of the game state as much. 
---
Is that clear enough?
---
Yeah I’d say your best bet is to just not loot the mob, either afk or run off and do something else and wait for them to get bored. 
---
Stealing from your own faction is shitty and stupid. Obviously it’s not breaking any rules, but doing it makes you a twat.
---
Why post making a claim that is just completely false. I doubt you even know where to find the TOS, let alone have actually read it.
---
WHOOSH
---
That's hilarious. Wish I was there to see that lol
---
Leveling a prot pally. After Improved Righteous Fury should I go Shield Spec, or Anticipation?
---
I much preferred the previous post. Mods are crazy...
---
Following.
---
Wait, can you elaborate? Is clicking once also "bad" or do I miss more when clicking multiple times?
---
Organizing groups is not hard.  Farming the UBRS key is not hard.  Someone has to do both.  Four people have to join a group for every one person who starts one.  You don't deserve any special treatment for being in the latter group.
---
This guy also used bestial wrath at the start of the fight when Druid has full health half mana. It goes off of the pet at 30 seconds and Druid just ignores the pet. He’s a joke. Get off a pvp server if you can’t handle pvp.
---
Hmm, ok.  
---
Yeah I suppose I’m just looking for ways to make gold as a holy pally, lol.  Thank you.
---
You mean the resto shaman who flew to 60 on the backs of glorious mage aoe groups so I can enjoy endgame?
---
You found me buddy.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/warlock-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow
---
If they begin to do aoe pulls that the team can’t handle, stop healing them until they play proper or simply kick them. Plenty of dps around if you are a tank you can always find more.
---
I was 41. I was about 40 gold shy at 40 and so I just kept questing. When I hit 41 I went and farmed whelps and got lucky with an epic drop that I sold for 20 gold.
---
Listen, it's really easy. You try to come off as a political guy but you haven't really given any thought to these topics further than the superficial Peterson, Shapiro and similar videos. If you really want to be knowledgeable of politics, I recommend reading instead of YouTube, and actually thinking about the topics you've read and discussing them intelligently. It goes a long way instead of just spouting off buzzwords like a broken record and expecting anyone disagreeing with you to be a lefty gender theorist. I'm neither. I was correcting your grammar and you responded with a gestapo comment which I'm fairly sure you yourself didn't understand because you have no idea about history or politics beyond YouTube and maybe some Wikipedia. So, it's not going to be that easy to argue with me because I don't fit so easily into the mold you'd love me to be in so you can use your stolen phrases from the alt right. 
---
If you really want to admire someone like Peterson, do what he does and go read a book , then proceed to argue like a human being by sticking to the point and formulating arguments rather than repeating phrases like a broken record.
---
Make sure to pick up Intimidating Shout because it will be a lifesaver when you pull too much. Fear all the mobs and just run away like the cowardly wretch you are. That's the warrior way lol
---
Pretty sure Scholomance starts with "skall" like "scholar", not "skowl"
---
Interesting how you react. I'm super chill. I dont "hate" them. Just dont think the play style is fun, so I choose to do runs a different way. My ignore list has like 15 mages on it, I suppose. I actually thought when I started doing it that I'd be ignoring all mages, but, that isn't what has happened. Seems it is just a few spamming it. 
---
As far as raid. Meh, I'll cross that bridge when I get to it. I imagine I'll group with them for that. (Assuming the group isn't a gogogo aoe run).
---
Plus Firefox is one of the only browsers (excluding IE) to not use Chromium as their web browser. Even though it’s open source this gives Google a huge monopoly.
---
Tldr?
---
Poor spotted
---
Iron ore has been selling pretty reliably for me on sulfuras as well. Same with silver and gold. It’s mostly just tin and copper that have been useless, but I think copper was staring to pick back up because people are lazy and most don’t have super low level characters any more.
---
define 'enjoyable content'.
---
i played an alliance character on a pve server originally 12 years back.  this time around i decided to go for a pvp server, still alliance tho.  its a mixed bag of more excitement but also more annoyance.  especially right now with no honor system, its like the wildwest.
---
last night, for example, the scarlet monastery entrance floor is so covered with the skeletons of recently killed players that its almost difficult to see any actual floor texture.  thats kinda just an awesome thing to see.  and if you are bored, dont really care about running the dungeon this play session and just want to mix it up, i would say its mostly enjoyable getting killed by 50 horde at once, then rezzing and spending the next couple of hours joining up with a small band of alliance resistance trying to take your revenge.
---
but if you just have an hour to play and you just want to get to your dungeon where your party is waiting, bc you are hoping for a nice new armor upgrade, but horde isnt even letting you get close enough to ghost walk past the locked door.... well, then its just kinda annoying.
---
also, i think my server might be unbalanced in favor of the horde, which is kinda demoralizing.  but i guess we wont know for sure about that unless blizzard releases their data.
---
im happy with my choice and am planning on sticking it out for now, despite the unfairness of 5 lvl 60 horde killing me, a lvl 30, in 2 seconds for no reason, and then one of the druids in cat form drags their ass across my corpse while the rest /spit and kek at me.
---
I love the entire Scarlet Monastery. But I might leave some for the Alliance series.
---
Ah it sounded like you just ignore all of them that’s all lol.
---
Yet somehow the other, identical, situation was not acceptable, why is that?
---
That's fair enough, I'm just going off vendor prices which would have been something like 72s a stack. It's the most I've ever asked off someone, i think the response was worth it.
---
Fishing plus cooking means you can often level someone else's cooking too.
---
Opposite faction = Anything goes.
---
Same faction = Don't loot until you are in a position to skin it.
---
I make sure to tell my party members to give me a few seconds to build threat. After I LoS and get them all grouped together, I skip sweeping strikes (since you don’t have the extra rage from charge), and go straight to blood rage, berserker stance, berserker rage, and whirlwind. It’s not as effective as charging, but it works. Ideally you pool your rage from a previous fight to be able to use sweeping strikes as well but it doesn’t always work that way. 
---
The main thing I would do though is just ask for an extra moment to get threat.
---
Sooooo, how did it go? Sorry if I missed an update elsewhere.
---
get to the point where u can make greater fire resistance potions and watch the cash roll in
---
Daaaaamn, grats dude
---
Interesting. I wonder why the English words are so similar as well? Is it because children and enslaved mining labor used to be synonymous in the past, or something?
---
&gt;Reserving 1 item while making a group/dealing with the usual party leader crap and farming an attunement (ie UBRS key) while the rest of you sit on your ass AFK makes me an entitled asshole? Hahahahhahaha
---
Yes, yes  it does.  Getting the key and making groups is not hard.
---
&gt;Besides, check out my full pre-raid BIS that I got by reserving Dal'rends and taking the effort to organize groups and farm my own key. I hope it makes you seethe.
---
Imagine caring about pre-raid BiS.  Rofl.
---
Yeah I mainly farmed green and crimson whelplings in the swamp of sorrows and the wetlands. They drop small flame sacs that went for 1g each on my server and i managed to sell 20 of them so 20g although people caught onto it and they sell for 40s each now but im holding off until they are in high demand. Buying skills as jolanar said is also a big deal so dont buy what you dont need and skinning helped
---
well maybe, i stopped reading after the part where he stated to be prot specced. he probably asked dps to wait with damage and tanks to not use their 2h and stufd, which would not be necessary if he would be in the proper spec and a good tank in the first place.
---
Haha maybe, gnome mage looks fun with that aoe
---
Why PUG if you can't roll on anything?
---
I'm very skeptical of filling in for guilds. I feel like if anything actually good drops, I won't be getting it, and thus have wasted hours of my time for potentially no upside.
---
Thank you! :)
---
No it does not Stalin, it's only a matter of scale.
---
In regards to AOE farming I don’t tank with warriors, the eye pulling method works much better.
---
Ah that’s a good point, I guess I just don’t run into many people who try that.
---
The fact that OP used that many question marks prove he is a minor.
---
Quest is lvl 44 but it doesn't really matter since the mobs are 49-51 anyway. Doesn't help that they're turtles aswell so doing it as a melee is a pain because of the armor
---
Source: did it as 46 Enh Shaman
---
Well as an arms warrior I have no trouble taking on 2-3 mobs my own level so I think I know how to play
---
You understand this is comedy right?  He doesn't have to actually mean what he says.  He's just trying to find some funny stuff to say.  That doesn't make him a dipshit.
---
Finally!!! Thank youuu. Been watching on phone and playing without sound
---
I am in an MC guild. I conjure 400+ water in IF before heading out. I get to MC and say open trade for water. About 3-4 people do. 
---
Does your raid have no other mages?
---
I also drink a fuckton. I drink after I cast any spell when out if combat. I drink after every combat. I drink while running when mana regen is about to tick. I drink after I drink but before I drink again.
---
I did this for the first time last night. Herod was Surprisingly easier than I was expecting. Got the shoulders!
---
also easiest to kill, which was the point
---
&gt;It's much more of a hassle than joining a group and sitting AFK.
---
Taking the stairs is more of a hassle than the elevator, but if you're going up two flights neither are hard.
---
&gt;Imagine people caring about things you don't care and vice-verse, rofl!
---
I mean you clearly don't just have a preference.  You think you having gear is going to make me *seethe*.
---
Good luck raiding. Zero chance we'd take a warrior with that attitude when there are literally 10 behind you who are happy to equip a shield.  Playing the most popular class in the game and being whiney like this is a recipe for failure.
---
Probably my favourite so far, well done.
---
The more warriors you don’t let dps the more they will just make their own group and tank and only invite casters lol
---
I was 47 or 48. Lol.
---
you clearly take this way too serious which is evident by your walks of text :D keyboard warrior?
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
My you're a tall one
---
Yeah I did it right as I was eligible, ended up paying a guy a gold and two random boe greens to help out
---
Are you Horde or Alliance? How much time will you be playing this new toon per week?
---
Love em or hate em, the striders are the most unique mount in the game.
---
Just reminds me of Jim Jeffries (Aussie comedian) talking about how some woman wrote an article about his piece on rape and took jokes out of context and had to remind everyone “I’m an entertainer! This is a comedy routine! This is NOT A TED TALK!” 😂
---
I always roll need if I’m going to equip it immediately. I roll greed when I won’t. That’s my rule of thumb.
---
15g can be farmed in half an hour at 60. Just respec.
---
*amused reddit or noises*
---
Brah, it’s low level gear. No one is the asshole for needing it unless they are a mage or warlock or priest
---
The problem is that memes and jokes tend to flood the top, whereas quality posts that require reading and some comprehension effort tend to sink. It's a lot of work trying to maintain a balance with all the possible subjective calls. Mods could definitely let r/classicwow become an unmitigated meme dumpsterfire if the community really wanted that.
---
Yup.
---
I expect the same of you my keyboard warrior friend :)
---
I definitely hear what you're saying. I'm not planning on raid tanking, I'll probably either do 5 mans, PvP, or respec, so in your opinion what should my final 31 look like? 5/5 redoubt, toughness, 3/3 Righteous Fury, Shield Spec, then Blessing of Sanctuary, Holy Shield, then what? Blessing of Kings? Guardian's Favor?
---
Was it previously agreed upon to handle loot this way? If not, no problem. Besides Lvl 20. Nobody cares what you do at level 20.
---
Vendor food doesn't have an expiry date.
---
If you tank. It's your job to set limits and boundaries. There are many... Players. Out there, but these are your Players.
---
And your job is to keep them safe.
---
If they don't wanna play nice they can leave. Your job is to take care of your small innocent eager Players.
---
Nta. It can feel kind of greedy as a druid running a dungeon as offspec. Rolling for healing pieces, tanking pieces, and dps. I'll usually let my party know I'll be rolling on DPS gear etc. So when I take the 1 uncontested healing item, they aren't blind sided when I also roll on a good leather DPS piece.
---
Could have handled this better - but also, that chest is killer. But also - there's a chest piece from the quest for killing VC isn't there?
---
That's when you cast rank 1 so they can get 1 stack per cast. It's what they wanted, right?
---
it doesn't really work. Melee Leeway fucks us hard and the mob still gets 1 hit off of atleast before you get out of range, its not worth the effort for literally 1 or 2 less hits.
---
No tell them to shut up and stop crying
---
Generally you ask first to need on things that are not role you are playing in the dungeon.
---
I think you've missed the point here, the discussion is about dungeon tanking with a focus towards levelling dungeons where you don't even "need" a dedicated tank let alone a Protection Warrior. Nobody is levelling as Protection, and with there being more raid spots for a DPS Warrior than a Tank you will see more Fury Warriors tanking dungeons than Prot, because it's not worth dumping gold into respeccing.
---
In actual Vanilla most/all tanks were Fury prior to Naxx, Prot got some buffs/redesigns in the later patches to change that. I'm not saying they were DW/2H tanking but that modern trend has come about because the dungeons are easy enough that it works. People adapt to what works, in Legion I remember farming quite high M+ dungeons with no healer, for faster clears, and once it catches on everyone tries to do it (even those without the skill/gear).
---
Yeah but in retail at least, when you twink you have to turn off XP, and if you turn off XP you’ll only be matched against other players who have done the same, so it’s twinks vs twinks in retail which is a level playing field and completely understandable.
---
Feel like you should have asked first if it was ok but like you said who cares it will be replaced in like 2 lvls
---
A U T H E N T I C
---
Then add him instead and be on your way. Wasting your time ranting to other players about a fee is a bit childish.
---
We certainly had mods like this back in Vanilla. CT Raid Assist was the first one I think.
---
Showing 39 on wowhead.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=3636/bring-the-light
---
People play twinks
---
Except BoPs are going to drop hundreds of times more. So if you get a hundred of them and sell to the vendor, that's about equal to most BoEs. It's the same thing. Then you can buy one of them many pre raid BiS options each class typically has for each item slot.
---
&gt;And as someone who organized 40+ UBRS groups I can tell you that it's extremely draining compared to just joining a group and sitting AFK at the entrance. 
---
40 groups?  That's cute.  As someone who has organized probably thousands of groups since the vanilla beta it's not that big of a deal.
---
&gt;Ok, I still got my Dal'rends with reserving them and easily getting people to join. So, you can seethe about that if you want, most people don't care nor need a reserved item.
---
Most people will take convenience over actually having principles.  You're basically bragging about scamming the elderly.
---
Haha, what endgame? One of my irl friends did that with his priest. Killed rag within the first weeks. He quit and uninstall the game by now. Literally skipped the whole game. Good for you, buddy.
---
Just go to SoS in off hours and gather stacks of Blindweed. If you also have Goldthorn make Arcane Elixirs, if not just sell the Blindweed. It's pretty solid gold at that level.
---
Elemental fire sells for more than the greater fire resistance potions themselves on my server, not sure how that would work
---
Unexpectedgalaxyquest?
---
Tunic of westfall is better anyway
---
Got 3 or 4 monitor ( depends on how I chose to setup), but I still love your post.
---
I mean, we didn't transfer off to help anyone else, but the new realms are dead and it's kind of bullshit.
---
I'm honestly very frustrated by it and it's taking away from my game experience. Blizzard failed to anticipate how popular the game would be, panicked, overreacted and gave us free transfers to MULTIPLE new servers that are all bordering on dead now. 
---
And now we don't have any way back. I knew the launch wasn't going to be perfect, but this really is a real piss-off. After waiting years to finally get WoW classic, Blizzard still somehow managed to make it a terrible experience.
---
And now they have the gall to make a post saying 'mission accomplished, all of these servers are no longer layering!'. Like, gee, wow my dead server isn't overcrowded? Who would have thought! Great job Blizz. Thank you for that.
---
You just can’t admit it you like having an advantage in a fight lol
---
What a stupid post. If someone is forming a group they want the dungeon to go as quickly and smoothly as possible. Mages/warriors do the most dungeon damage, no shit people would adhere to a meta if it maximizes their enjoyment of the game. Make your own groups like you just did and stop bitching.
---
Personally, I think it was fine for you to need roll on it. You’re the one who is playing not-your specced role just so the others can clear the dungeon. If it is an upgrade for you and it’s a group loot system, need as you please.
---
How do you do that then? Run in to the right and /tar Jed? Why are you waiting minutes?
---
Well it is indeed faster this way. Also you can still grind that sweet exp while looking for group so it's not the case of wasting hour doing nothing. When group is ready and they know what to do, it's easy 3-5 times faster than regular group. So they can run sm Cath (example) for 10ish minutes full clear. Huge xp per hour. But again we talking about smart groups.
---
If you need to ask, most likely
---
Sub rogue is just way more fun to level imo too, regardless of efficiency. Combat is one of the most boring things I've ever played, mostly due to my idea of the class-fantasy, I will admit. 
---
Why play a rogue if I'm going to be a leather-wearing warrior for the entire leveling experience?
---
I play on pvp servers cuz it feels the most natural. There being 2 factions means they should confront eachother outside battlegrounds.
---
It can lead to a mixed bag of good and bad interactions,  but that's how it goes. Sure I've been ganked by a group or high level when I was just minding my business fishing. Was it annoying? Yes, but I got over it. But pvp servers can also have fun interactions. Getting mind controlled by a priest to have them buff you and be on their way. Accidentally pulling more then you can handle, and someone from the other faction sees this and decides to help kill the ones you can't handle. Etc.
---
It just comes down to who's playing the character on the other faction
---
&gt; Except that's something you said
---
Good job missing the context on that one.
---
&gt;  He used the item
---
And that's only possible after he needs on it for monetary gain.
---
&gt; Needing an item to use it is LITERALLY how the rolling system works.
---
No needing on items you *need* is how the rolling system works, needing on items you want for monetary gain is supposed to be a greed roll.
---
This is my favorite WoW sound.
---
You have a beef with him eh?
---
Not really but trying to explain it to you is futile.
---
As is posting and exposing yourself as a dick
---
I was daggers, in various builds (including Hemo for awhile) until around 40 ish. AR is a really nice cooldown to have. Now this Rogue is 49, Combat Swords with Thrash Blade.
---
However, I'm currently leveling another Rogue, who is 13 at the moment. He's going to stay daggers the whole way. I find it much more fun.
---
**Edit:** Also, some advice. Pick up Imp Gouge and Camouflage. They will allow you to Gouge, *restealth,* and hit another Ambush. You'll have to be quick, though.
---
100% as the main tank you control the instance. You go at your pace and can tell 'em to frog off. I'm not even a tank but I would leave any group if they insisted on an aoe run through an instance.
---
I played true classic and on private servers for about 3-4 years on and off.  I know they can be.  Early game though not so much.  Miss, miss, parried, 35, miss, 31...
---
You're looking at it from a perspective of 1 dungeon run. People have to make upwards of 50 UBRS runs for items like Dal'rend and it's much more of a hassle. I've actually done it and been through it all so your opinion is essentially irrelevant. Nothing has been more draining in this game than spam making these groups and typing to people who don't know dungeon mechanics the same shit all day long. And then STILL wiping to said mechanics because they didn't care to listen to you.
---
I'm saying you people are seething because you're mad about 1 reserved item and are upset because you know that many people will still join these groups. You can keep crying, but these groups will always exist and people will always join them because they don't need the reserved item.
---
People don't play twinks when there are no BGs.
---
As a prot warrior I understand why. Cause vanilla was different and it fucking sucks to tank as arms or fury (not fury prot, actual fury). I tanked as arms til 60 and its complete aids if your party is bad.
---
Go watch swifty leveling up. Hes pretty representative of the average player cause he sucks. 
---
People that say just slap on a shield don’t understand. Also fuck respecs, those are gold. Youre either dps or a tank.
---
I remember spending the first hour fighting over wolves and kobolds in Northshire with hundreds of other players. Was very cool to see so many people
---
1. Hunter
---
2. Druid
---
3. Warlock
---
4. Mage
---
5. Priest
---
6. Shaman
---
7. Rogue
---
8. Paladin
---
9. Warrior
---
This is my own super rough estimate so of course take it as gospel and treat it as if it were written in stone.
---
But pressing greed when someone else has pressed need is effectively passing?  
---
All need is the only fair way because you can't make the lazy warrior greed.
---
You can gear up b4 hand obviously, like the prime time to gear 1 up is right now as we are getting close to phase 2. Just people with an ounce of foresight.
---
Go ahead and prove he didn't need the item then. You can't because he used it, which you would only do if you needed the item. If he couldn't use it then he couldn't need the item.
---
That fact you place that above hybrid theory makes me question your decision making skills. Hybrid theory will always be Mike's best work.
---
Should be 90g
---
Didn’t know SM GY was the thing people frothed at the mouth over in classic.  Enjoy being terrible at this game and keyboard turning and dying instantly in every dungeon you run
---
Also nice moving the goal post on your own statements when you get called out
---
A socialist is trying to educate, save me!
---
Exactly. Depending on my mood or how many times I've leveled a toon through a zone I may want to take my time and read the quest and get some lore knowledge or just speed through it. If I'm questing with someone I may need to adjust and move fast to keep up with them or take my time so they don't get left behind. Its good to make sure if whoever you're questing with is on the same page with what you're doing.
---
You really want me to be a socialist, don't you? Well, I'm not. What now?
---
Maybe because when you're tanking, you're the one leading and there's pressure on you to not suck. Learning to tank can be frustrating, because your mistakes can waste a lot of other people's time. Not only that, but tanks/healers can get unwarranted critisizm when stuff goes wrong that wasn't their fault but appears that it was.
---
Was it the blue Marshals amulet? I saw that around 100gs on the AH and considered grabbing it
---
No worries, I've already gotten farther than you ever will.
---
They probably have the ports blocked or services or something like that. Try a vpn
---
Stay away from rogues.  I know it's hard with stealth and all...
---
Im not going to watch a video on some dude trying to explain a stance. It looks goofy no matter how much you justify it.
---
Hey man the truth hurts. Keep twinking and thinking you’re good for globaling a dude 7 lvls below you.
---
Yet another buzzword. See? You're like the top ten keyword list from an old 90s search engine.
---
Thank you I will tell everyone like it's fact because I read it from an expert on the internet
---
6% is your hitcap
---
&gt; Also nice moving the goal post on your own statements when you get called out
---
I never moved the goal posts, the goal posts are pretty damn clearly set at "he needed for monetary gain, that's ninja looting".
---
Dude I’ve been farming mobs my way to 60 and I’m 53 now. You saved me so much effort. I’d kiss you if I could
---
Calling someone out for being a dick isn't "name-calling"
---
&gt;If you want a specific drop for your class, just don't invite another person who might need it.
---
Imagine thinking this is a better solution than reserving.
---
Nope. You're having a very hard time arguing outside your zone of comfort, no? In your world one is either someone who acts like you or a lefty, no? The world is much more complicated than that, my friend, and if you really want to simplify things in terms of left and right I can assure you I'm seen by most as more far right than you believe yourself to be.
---
Clappinbooty here on Netherwind, legit made a macro to clap booty emote on random people walking by, lol.
---
Oh you're one of those... Lmaoooo
---
on private server clients you could put wow in windows mode, and then use the split screen feature (you know if you drag a windows to the left/right you can split it with another on your screen), but ofc...it doesn't work with the offical blizzard classic because it will just cut off half the game instead of minimizing it.
---
To make it 2 phases early you kinda do.
---
Hold that shit!!! Dont sell till phase 3 or 4.
---
It was never practical to farm BiS BoE’s.
---
What's blizzard's policy regarding VPN's?
---
i prefer to slice and dice at one combo point. i want that 30% as buff asap.
---
grinding mobs though i prefer cheap shot to garrote to reduce incoming damage significantly
---
its also not worth evis before 5cp unless the mob will die to its cast
---
i know horde has excellent quest swords to obtain at that level, check what allies get.
---
Lmao, I’m doing fine thank you. This is the second character I’m leveling to 60.
---
You do take it too serious tho, why else put the energy to write an essay when I'm clearly messing with you :)
---
Is there any way to do this with youtube TV?
---
There’s also the fact that using it puts you in melee range in most cases, which makes it a lot easier to rip aggro from the tank because of how threat works within melee range.
---
People have honor and respect. That goes beyond utility. People don't see everything with ulterior value. People can actually honor others. Even Over Money.
---
Hunter is a joke too considering he almost died from said druid.
---
As the tank. Its literally youre dungeon and all dps knows this. They talk shit? A simple reminder works... “im going afk for 30mins, u can replace me if u find someone by the time i get back.” 
---
If they replace you, get an insta group.
---
Know. Your. Worth.
---
Is that some sort of video game behind all the stuff on your screen?
---
IMO keep skinning for now. You will make more than 5g from 40-60.
---
Level the prof once you hit 60. You may also choose to keep skinning for a bit to build up gold for an epic mount, etc...
---
Lmfaooo
---
aw yiss, the kind of shitposting we need.
---
serve us more kind sir
---
It reduces the glancing penalty a tiny bit more I think so it's not pointless.
---
And I never debated the topic of genders. I agree with you on that, even if I don't believe the discussion belongs in a gaming subreddit (I'd go against gender theorists arguing in favor of non-binarism just the same if the topic came up in this subreddit). I merely pointed out a grammatical mistake.
---
&gt; Go ahead and prove he didn't need the item then.
---
You really want me to do this again?
---
The item is freely available to buy on ah, given that fact, he could easily have obtained the item if he so needed, but he chose to need roll in a dungeon the only difference between doing the 2 is the monetary gain from the second way of obtaining it.
---
&gt; You can't because he used it, which
---
So if you use an item, it's no longer ninjaing? Care to explain this thread then?
---
16000 people disagree with you.
---
I always have my ss suit nearby ofc
---
It is not against the ToS. I quite literally asked a GM in a ticket and he said they haven't taken a stance on it.
---
You can literally see that in the screenshot.
---
Keep skinning. You're at the point where you'll start making profit on the AH with heavy/thick/rugged leather. Save all your mining ore and you can drop skinning at 60.
---
I agree with this
---
This is the fun part about classic, it wasn't really designed for any meta in order to beat anything. 
---
I remember one time I saw BRD run with three BM hunters pet tanking and a hpally just keeping blessing of Light on em an healing away. Had a mage too but it wasn't a meta group and that was this dude's thing, so he left. They cleared pretty far in and then a tank guildie popped in later lol
---
I find it's more fun and challenging clearing with what you happen to find, I've had some rougher dungeons but never one I haven't been able to pull through with.
---
TLDR; I'm with ya OP, to hell with meta dungeon groups
---
Well if your goal is to troll, then have fun. I was actually treating you like a human being, but if you want me to treat you like you behave, this conversation is over.
---
This post reminded me that I used to use [Ludwig](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/ludwig). This one isn't updated for Classic yet but the author has confirmed they're working on it.
---
If there are alternatives I would also appreciate a link :D
---
Except it is geared for him, he is feral. He just healed so the group could actually run the dungeon.
---
It’s a risk either way. No promise of it going up or down in price.
---
The reality is can you do more with the gold now vs. later? In many cases the answer is yes. There is no way to know what the economy will be like in a few months.
---
What fine? If you cancel you just pay the auction house fees if they apply, which they don't for stuff without a vend price like enchanting mats.
---
I carry tank gear with me, but I hardly use it, because of the meta.
---
These are farmed heavily on my server but very cheap now.  8 for 40s last night.  I think thundering were more, 8 for 60s.  I farmed some of mine since they were 1g each at the time.
---
Thanks for your time tho :)
---
Time to go read the entirety of Dark Legacy's archives.  Cute comic.
---
The real question is, did your ass actually fall off from laughing?
---
Do it vs humanoids and have a pickpocket-autoloot-ambush macro
---
Its leveling gear.  The group are schmucks.  Let them know in the beginning next time.
---
I mean you choose not to see it, but you clearly don’t know that intent is the determining factor.
---
I went herb/skinning and I’m still just selling leather to vendor for profit. I’ve easily paid for the skinning training costs+mount and other needs. I’m 59 atm and still skinning/herb but once I hit 60 an farm some more saur leather for guild (I have my set) I’m going to drop skinning for engineering most likely (have mining/alch on level 10 alt) hope to mine most of what I need and I also have almost all the herbs to PL alchemy. Hope this helps! Ask away if any questions
---
At what point does +spell dmg/+healing become better for a leveling shadow priest who heals in dungeons? I’m 46 right now and have heard the Dreamweave set is really good. However, when I look at it compared to my current gear (all dungeon blues for those three slots), I’d be sacrificing intellect and spirit for the bonus damage/healing of Dreamweave. Is this always worth it?
---
search "jed scout" on youtube
---
Use atlas loot. Not sure about the search function, but there are all available items together with the phase when they get released.
---
What a stupid comment. You assume that every person forming a group wants to do it quickly then tell OP to make their own group. These two things cannot exist simultaneously.
---
Agreed. There are minor exceptions.
---
So... you’re a POS? Cool.
---
No fing way.  Ban them all...everyone who tries this pserver bullshit.
---
Everyone's favorite stuffed animal!
---
Just reroll Horde
---
There are dozens of us... DOZENS!
---
10/10 last sentence.
---
You truly are the hero we need.
---
Sure thing. Good luck in life.
---
Dmg is nice, but sustain will help you level and farm faster.  Get spirit int until the low 50's, then change to dmg gear
---
What's happening?

You wouldn't have lasted a day in that world.

Lol nice cherry picked false equivalency. Roy forced everyone to not roll against him. No one here forced this group to not roll need. You can go and try to ahead and prove they did but you're not going to be able. 
---
The fact that you can't understand the difference here clearly highlights your inability to grasp the fact that an item can be used by someone. Go ahead and prove that he is gaining money from it. You can't. That's like saying you don't get raid gear cus you can just buy a similar item off the AH and everyone gets to roll need on any classes BoP item, since they are hundreds of times more common, by the time you find a BoP the monetary value selling to the vendor is basically the same.
---
Don't like gnomes
---
That doesnt make it okay.
---
As a first time wow player who rolled a warlock I can confirm that my expectations have been skewed by my class choice.
---
3 yellows in my pull? I'll be ok, might have juggle a bit.
---
Me, later, on my warrior&gt; wow this green mob is deceptively strong
---
Thunderclap is less threat/rage than battle shout is and can only hit 4 targets. I usually only thunderclap if I have more than 25 rage and would waste it by switching straight into defensive stance.
---
Picture-in-picture
---
You have to be a certain type of petty to get mad over a fee that you start bashing others. Take a step back for a second.
---
You do you.
---
If you let them know you are feral but healing so the run can happen that's different, they should know that druids level as feral though.
---
Yeah, same for me. I hate aoe tanking and right now I don't even like tanking anymore. I would tnk, but not with this aoe meta....
---
Too bad this is reddit and I can comment about whatever the fuck I want huh?
---
&gt;Have any of you leveled as Sub before?   
---
I did, I even spent several hours doing tests at level 50.  
---
The conclusion was that combat does a bit more damage (8%).
---
I think Garrote is superior to Ambush, though. You lose out on A LOT for those big ambush crits- you lose a bunch of energy on the opener and you lose a ton of hemo damage because of having a faster main hand.
---
I’m a new affliction warlock so how does one tank with that build? I know there’s special builds for it  right?
---
Pvp for me always. I cant imagine playing a game where you are at war with an enemy faction and cant even fight them out in the world. Tbh so far leveling on a pvp server 99% of enemy faction I run into have been friendly. I've helped a dwarf clear a difficult cave which was fun. I dont engage in pvp but will defend myself or group if attacked. Mostly people just wanna go about their business but overall it just feels more real with option available
---
“*from childhood*” has me in absolute stitches
---
The problem eventually comes that ambush falls off damage wise. Lower levels, it can be a majority of a mobs health. But eventually, the mob’s health or scales your damage. And if you have to fight a high armor mob, it gets even worse. Notably turtle or stone golem. In those cases, everything you have hits like a wet noodle and having to sinister strike with daggers is gross
---
Because people just want a "one and done" kind of run, if they can get all the loot they won't have to go back.
---
Thanks, mate! Glad you like it!
---
Ive tried it 3 times: worked once, hit it too soon and hearthed in place once, and last time hit it too late so it didn’t change my hearth location and I had to run back :&lt;
---
There’s also a program called OnTop Replica. You can put any window or browser into a picture in picture of any size. Works great for farming and other mindless things
---
My max Char is still lvl 26 xD at least I already have 4 chars 20+ despite my limited time.
---
Not enough unfortunately. But it does reduce glancing penalty so it's not bad.
---
Low level dungeon. Nothing matters.
---
You should had asked initially to make the people spastic not spazz out.
---
Mostly anything is upgrade to anyone, for a few hours.
---
Alright ty
---
Can you highlight it? I am only see the paladins UI in the screenshot. I don't see anything relating to how much gold the mage has.
---
Makes it standard, but you do you.
---
&gt; Roy forced everyone to not roll against him. 
---
Really? Where's the force?
---
&gt;  Go ahead and prove that he is gaining money from it. You can't.
---
You can literally see him gaining money from it in the screenshot.
---
&gt;  That's like saying you don't get raid gear cus you can just buy a similar item off the AH and everyone gets to roll need on any classes BoP item,
---
Now who's making a false equivalence? BOP gear represents a much higher utility value than monetary value based on the fact it isn't freely available to be picked up whenever you wishl

Aww I missed it lol

xD probably true
---
&gt;Would be interesting to see some data on it.  
---
Hello, I spent a few hours comparing sub (swords) to combat (swords) at level 50. Conclusion: combat did about 8% more damage.
---
Yeah Im 46 now and I don't really need the gold atm. Think I'll wait and see...
---
Yes saying "you all greed" is stating, clear as day, that he is going to roll greed /s
---
I think youre wrong lol
---
You just changed my life dude. I have been tabbing on windowed mode for years...
---
But also jeez your actions bars take up way too much space! Lol
---
It’s server based by your faction.
---
In theory, yes, a lower pop server makes it easier. In phase 2 PvP vs. PvE will matter simply because it’s only world PVP and you will require the other faction to be flagged. Keep in mind though there minimum number of honor required for ranks. If you don’t have enough world PvP you could be #1 on the sever but not enough honor to rank high.
---
In phase 3 with battlegrounds the PvE vs. PvP server is sort of a moot point simply because the honor from BG’s heavily out weighs world PvP honor. At that point the lowest population sever with smaller faction is the “easiest” way. However, the wrinkle in that thought is though, rank 14 is a hard cap of like .4% of players so if you have a larger group of PvP did hards with the same plan as you it may actually be harder for a top rank than another sever or faction.
---
Regardless of the approach the PvP grind is brutal to get rank 11-14. You cap at 1.5 levels per week so have a minimum of rocky 10 weeks anyway of non-stop grinding all day everyday due to 11-14 being limited to number of players plus minimum honor.
---
It seems to be just a coincidence. "Minor" obviously derives ultimately from Latin, whereas "mine" in the sense of "pit or tunnel" came to English via French where it has Celtic roots, according to \[Wikipedia\] ([https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mine#Etymology\_2](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mine#Etymology_2))
---
Because they also offer well fed bonuses.
---
Low effort memes bring in more comments which brings in more discussion. 
---
Whenever I find a topic discussing something I really want to talk about it has like 3 comments, but a low effort meme that is within the same topic will have like 200 comments and I get to enjoy the discussion.
---
So I think its pretty balanced if you just read the comments.
---
Sounds nice, but I hate sneak not being lvl 3
---
SS does not reset auto timer but the extra attack proc from the sword talent does. That's why it's still good to time your SS
---
Surely this is a satire post right? It’s pvp on a pvp server... does there need to be a reason?
---
He would have kicked if they didn't listen. Did you not participate in the debate they had about it later? 
---
How about this. Cross post this to r/asmongold and see if those 16,000 people still agree with you.
---
Shit, even with dual monitors I've used always on top when mining.  Until I get a headache anyways lol.
---
Yes, i must be poor for buying a dedicated gaming pc and not throwing money at a lesser produkt 👏
---
What if that guy is a dps war? Those are worthless :V
---
Alliance
---
But they aren't. 
---
In your example the person writes "all greed" so people do that, then he needs. Prime example of ninja looting.
---
Here we can only see that one person needs it, we can also see one person passing on it. Nothing indicates that this item wasn't reserved for the mage or that the group hadn't agreed to let all BoEs be treated as BoPs if someone actually need the utility it offers.
---
Ill do melee, thanks.
---
Probably will block it but it’s worth a shot
---
The only ones really worth it are wardens staff for feral tanks and edge masters handguards you'll be paying 1k gold or more for em
---
Wait, I have form macros set up are those not needed in domino?
---
Uuuuh! Thank you thank you thank you :D
---
The key talents are 5/5 fel concentration and siphon life. Drain tank with siphon life and drain life. Both these skills scale with spell damage/shadow damage so stack as much as possible and you got some really good self healing.
---
I did it in vanilla so I could know when my name wasn’t visible to others when hiding in a bush or behind something
---
While true, and I’d agree if your really want to push doing ZF farm until 50 then BRD/LBRS you maybe able to shave it down a bit. Generally speaking assume the 4 days.
---
They are 40s each on my server, If I saw them up for 40s a stack I would buy those and wait until the layers are removed, then post them back up for 10x profit.
---
My girlfriend said the alliance looked boring and picked a female Orc cause they looked the most bad ass lol.
---
Lol bro. He's not the dipshit in this conversation. I promise you.
---
I think it's more that Pally can't taunt the mobs off a mage once he's pulled them.
---
No, I still don't get it. Could you explain it again?
---
Fair enough, I meant more so in the context of repeatedly running a dungeon for something like the Truefaith Pattern drop.
---
If the enemy player is your pet and follows you anywhere, maybe you can accept a summon from a warlock and have fun with it that way.
---
I usually avoid this by tanking on my feral druid since cat and bear armor is pretty much interchangeable while leveling.  I’d say you’re fine though.
---
Spamming battle shout is a lot better than demo shout
---
Well there’s 3 bottom bars and 2 side bars. Definitely
---
more than the standard two max.
---
Lol you had so many cds ready how did you not kill the low druid :(
---
I laughed out loud in the work bathroom stall.  This is literally what I say while leveling with my GF.  Just anytime I can’t get a hit or get a glancing blow.
---
Vs casters?
---
If you're really playing clever you can map it out and sell Cooking Kits for guaranteed 1-300 cooking by providing the mats and recipes required and inform the customer when to use what recipes. 
---
I used to do this at the start of BfA and frequently sold my kits for anywhere from 7k all the way up to 25k with about a 3-5k up front cost by regularly scanning the AH for good prices on supplies.
---
Aliens.
---
I'm really far removed from the situation, so don't worry. Most responses in the thread are echoing : OP is a dick. Not to say you shouldn't charge. But I've yet to see anyone be like "Wow, that warrior was so petty!" Other than you

You're pretty blind then, aren't you?

There it is. Mage gains 50g.
---
I used to play a mage in old vanilla and bc and I just ignored any whispers about water, portals or whatever unless they stated how much they'd pay in the initial message. It's not worth the time.
---
Dev: eh. Close enough
---
I'm not entirely sure I agree with that, Edgemasters seem to go for between 300 - 500 hundred at least on my server.

What about rares though, what should I expect there?

Wind serpents are the best pets and their swim animations prove it.

Firefox isn't using chromium. It uses gecko. What your comment probably meant to say.

stash that puppy in the bank and forget about it for a couple months.  If you don't need the cash, chances are pretty good the price will inflate later.
---
Yes - the way to do it is turn in cloth to exalted. Then buy the tiger riding and the 900g epic mount.
---
This will cost you about an additional 400-600 gold in runecloth. Just don’t buy the epic horse if this is your plan.

Do we have any official info on how Herod looks under the helmet? I always imagined him a lot younger, definitely with hair. No idea why.
---
I looked into it a little bit: According to [this wiki page](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Herod), he appears in the Old Hillsbrad Caverns of Time, where he has the generic human child model. This dungeon supposedly happens [seven years before classic](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Old_Hillsbrad_Foothills). If any NPC with the child model is, let's say 16 years at most, that makes Herod 23 or younger during Classic. Seems like a testament either to his prowess in battle, or the Crusade's lack of recruits, that he appears to be somewhat high-ranking at such a young age.
---
People with basic intelligence, yes. You should join us sometime.
---
Ope, good call definitely misspoke.
---
I was in your exact same situation and I don’t regret leaving. I didn’t want like a hardcore guild but I seriously wanted the ability to ask ppl in the guild if they wanted to run a dungeon and have at least a few people say yes
---
Played correctly and with the right talents, warlocks never really oom either.
---
Ports are 1g for me (outside of dungeon runs). Not worth my time to meet up for 50s.

I was on a 512kbps ADSL line back then. 200+ ping wasnt exactly uncommon.

Hi, what is the hit cap? I saw the blue post about 8% and 9% but only confused me. I don't know which is the hit cap.
---
Also, what is PvP hit cap. 5%?
---
This. You have to run out of the instance, summon yourself there, then hearthstone to a vendor, do maintenance, then accept the summon. So it's more iffy to use in dungeons where the entrance is camped (Blackrock and SM f.ex.)
---
No. You needed the gear, so a need roll was appropriate. It’s the same as an arms warrior who’s tanking rolling on a 2H that drops. You’re there for the gear as much as they are, and you have just as much of a right to roll on it as anyone else who could use it.
---
If the tank didn’t want to compete for leather agi gear he should have either reserved it or made his own group and not invited anyone else who would need agi leather...
---
Go back and watch the VoDs with him discussing it with asmon. It was ruled a clear abuse of his power within the guild. That's why people were so pissed

Debuff slots make it hard to not be elitist sometimes :/
---
Like I’m fine with more casual players or less meta specs because you can usually make up for the dps loss through coming prepared and playing well. This mindset doesn’t work for taking an arms warrior though - no matter how good or bad you are MS will take a debuff slot due to its high priority and that’s not something you want in a well run raid.
---
Could just ask why?  I know a lot of groups have carapace or finkle’s skinner on reserve and they don’t want it ninja’d.  When we would take a pug in our guild, we made it clear that Beast was ML for Finkle’s because it was the only thing we needed out of there.
---
I hit 40 last night as a warrior and just started leveling my cooking/fishing. Been saving any meat that’s dropped on a bank alt but from the looks of this guide most of what I’ll need to get my skill up can be fished from a few select spots.

Same happened to me earlier today, it is quite annoying, but you can fix it by either hearthstoning or esc&gt;help&gt;character stuck.
---
For deep protection tanks, do you regularly stance dance? What is a scenario where you should?
---
The game already has a guard against bids lower than the seller will accept: the minimum bid. OP is complaining that players are not using this feature as intended because other players typically see the items with the lowest current bid first. So sellers misrepresent what they consider the minimum acceptable bid in order to get more eyeballs on their items.
---
OP is not suggesting that we halt this practice. Only that Blizz should make it riskier by not letting people cancel auctions. I think it's a good idea. If everyone could see the honest price of items on the AH it would save everyone time.
---
You're still just arguing consistency.
---
&gt;Axe has better burst potential. 
---
Is objectively wrong
---
&gt;Burst needs to be reliable. 
---
is still

Which is why the axe is generally better.

No, he gained the ability to craft that robe lol.

There are quest mobs in Blasted Lands around the portal that cant be killed without the quest, and they stop attacking (but your damage numbers still show up) at 1% HP. Those might be of use to you.

I had a pretty good first attempt at this, but I pushed her a bit hard a few times. I often tried to make her to a lot of the work, but overloaded her a few times. Otherwise, I've been pretty good at letting her think for herself. It was definitely a learning experience for both of us, lmao. Luckily she wants to play the game a lot still, recently did RFK!

If you already have your mount, I wouldn't sweat the respec costs. The time you save by being able to solo quest as Shadow is way more than you would spend farming back that 15g.
---
If you respec Shadow now, you have 8 extra points to put back into Holy to get at least a couple of those healing talents back so you can still heal dungeons comfortably for the next 10 levels or so.
---
How do you guys decide how long something will go in the AH for? If it doesn’t sell do you place it on there again?
---
Awesome, I will definitely try this out tonight!
---
Vol-chan was just looking for his oniichan
---
Louis?
---
&gt; Unfortunately this just isn't true, off-tank for adds, sure, but for the majority of boss tanking?
---
Except it is, multiple top guild on private servers have proven it, almost all bosses can be maintankt by a bear.
---
Nice job! I just hit 60 today but haven't done Mara, BRD, LBRS, etc yet. Circling back and joining in as DPS until I have decent gear for comfortable tanking.
---
You are a rogue, im sure the tank needed. pos
---
Crap, I think Google may be your best bet my friend, I am no iOS expert, haven't used it for years.
---
Correct. It can't be dodged, blocked, or parried, but goddamnit it sure can miss.
---
It’s Honesty the worst part about going dagger. You’re pretty much guaranteed the best leveling swords you can get through a few dungeon quests. Daggers seem so much harder to get, maybe saw 2 daggers drop the entire time I was grinding to 60.
---
Spawn of Hakkar is in Sunken Temple, I think.
---
Edgemasters only gives a marginal dps increase to orcs/humans. 10% more damage on glancing blows, which are only 40% of your white hits (special attacks can't glance), .7% hit and .7% decreased dodge on bosses, so roughly 1.4% hit. Compared to the Devilsaur set bonus of 2% hit and the 1% crit and 28 AP on the gloves themselves.
---
Edit: I think that theoretically Edgemaster's would become good for orcs/humans if a fury warrior could both get 25% hit AND 54% crit while wearing Edgemaster's. Then the decreased chance for the boss to dodge would further increase their crit cap. That being said, those stats are not achievable, so don't worry about this.
---
What about people that have 5 points in tactical mastery? It allows us to keep 25 rage when stance swapping. I get told I should thunderclap when there's 4+ mobs a lot
---
Uh what? Gouge doesn't remove you from combat
---
the Google Chrome PIP extension works with this too, just tested it
---
&gt; Of course I wouldn't give someone 100g just because they asked.
---
Yet it's the same thing that happens in that situation.
---
&gt; Provide proof this mage did actually ninja the item or don't say anything at all.
---
I'm not sure what proof I can provide that isn't right in front of your face, the screenshot literally shows a mage need on an item purely for monetary gain.
---
If you're rolling off role (for the run you are on) without previously discussing or its otherwise unwanted then yeah YTA. At low levels this doesnt really matter too much, but its behavior to generally avoid. Discussing it before is the easiest way to not have issues
---
someone explain how this is more fun than the pvp? isn't this a pvp server? my warr rolled 5/05 and his fishing skill is like 12.
---
3rd party perspective is he is saving gold - hoping you were a giving guy...he asked you. You seem to be saving, too. He thinks a good person would just help out. You think youre a good person and want to help yourself. He gets annoyed you cant just help. 
---
Hes looking for a friend. Youre looking for a customer. He assumed youll be that way about everything. He avoids you. You take an ego hit. Then post here.
---
Id trust my instincts, too. If i were him
---
Shit. I'm a complete WoW noob and I know this just from fighting (or attempting to fight) a few mobs just 3 or so lvls higher than me. It's pointless. Not only do they melt you but you can barely get any hits in.
---
Look, pal, I've been playing for I can't remember how long as hunter and, look, if I remove the quiver...
---
*Character shoots anyways.*
---
WHY NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT THIS!?
---
Gandling! Enough ppl for all content, decent prizes on AH, not too bad worldchat.
---
Does anyone know of an add-on that can alert me if healer has aggro even if healer doesn't have healbot installed?
---
pvp server. reroll
---
Warrior dps gets pretty silly once they get sweeping strikes and whirlwind. That being said, the ones that absolutely refuse to learn to tank baffle me. Had to tank Uldaman last night at 41 because the level 45 warrior “didn’t have tank gear”. You don’t have a shield and one hander for bosses? Get out of here with that shit. You should have that regardless of whether or not you’ve ever tanked anything in your life, if nothing else, to have an interrupt option while pummel is on cooldown.
---
Tons of swapping isn't Mana efficient, so yeah it's most used in pvp. Technically cat dps requires a strange and dynamic rotation if you want to be competitive at a raid, but you also have to get gear to do that and many people scoff at a druid melee dps in 5 mans. While leveling, you'll probably only swap forms rapidly in an emergency or about every 2-3 kills when your Mana has refilled to self heal. The nice thing is you can go forever without food or drink generally since by the time you need it, your Mana is usually full again.
---
Yeah i meant like how to use talent points on it, and its spawn of hakkar i have not son
---
I don’t understand what happened. Looks like you lost a fight and no one helped?
---
Yes. An implied “we” which the developers have clearly stated will be assumed given the nature of vague statements being used as defense. 
---
It is like you have no intention of reading the rules which are clearly outlined and available to players...
---
It was not normal for within 1 week of server start.
---
It is all fine and dandy now. The server is always full during main times, enough to give you a 3 minute queue. But never fuller. And it still has a decent population during the night.
---
I'm a shift worker so I can play anywhere betweem 1am to 12pm.
---
I call it Turtlemore. I made lots of money as a solo warrior there around lvl 38-40. Basically I just killed/skined those turtles and fished the wreckage to pass the time when my friends weren't online and was able to get my mount right at 40
---
None cause you can get drops from dungeons that are good enough for raiding.
---
Thank you :)
---
If I weren't poor, I would give you an award.
---
Today I was fishing and a Tauren came and started to beckon me to follow him. I did, suspiciously, but he just wanted to point me to an island with water elementals. I thought he wanted me to help him kill them and emoted "no" as I didn't want to go there as a frost mage (those dudes are immune). The tauren cried and left and then I saw that he was pointing at floating wreckage! Dude just wanted to help me get loot. And this was in STV, on a PvP server. Thank you, gentle cow!

This might be more what you are looking for.

You want HoTw and the lion imaged talent in feral. That gives you a fuck ton of passive stat boosts to make you viable. Bonus you can heal then too
---
30/21 is the way to go (or go 4/5 hotw and 1 in balance for nature's grace)
---
MINER ? I HARDLY KNOW ERRR!
---
When I first played wow I was a solo dps player. I still like to do quests and not run dungeons multiple times. It feels weird to do something multiple times from a character perspective. "I already defeated the druids in wailing cravens, what do you mean do it again"
---
Still the same thematic play style, but I prefer to heal
---
Yes!!!!! You’ve made more. Keep them Coming they make excellent cellphones lock pages or screen savers! You are a true artist. Keep it up and someone will see your talent and hire you. 
---
Never quit your dreams cause is incredible. Truly makes my day.
---
*System* -&gt; *Sound* -&gt; uncheck *Error Speech*
---
No need to thank me.
---
If your Taunt is resisted you can go battle stance and mocking blow. I'd use 2/5 in TM for 10 rage. Also if you have 1 point in improved Taunt it will come off cooldown exactly when Mocking blow expires.
---
Low level dungeons, no. If this happened in like SM+ then yes it's a dick move, but at that level it really isn't that big of a deal imo
---
Dude thank you this is so brilliant. I love watching joe Rogan podcasts when farming herbs n shit and listening to stories about dmt or Scientology shit
---
I can appreciate that, but it wasn't the question. I would personally like to get those items and I'm not sure how much to pay for them.
---
I dont ask for tip but if he does there goes 2 mana pools of stacks.
---
What happened? It's odd that guilds would chase someone from a server
---
That’s an ignorant opinion. Heard all three of these many times.
---
Fuck that stick to greens.
---
Thanks for the lead. I'll start digging unless someone else posts.
---
I've seen a few of these type of images and I assume it's from a similar thing is it an anime/cartoon series of classic wow?
---
Now you can keep an eye on those ehehehe :D

It doesnt need to be on anywhere but the bosses.  You're just asking for that purple boe on trash to get taken.

I was playing and logged then back on just to check when I seen the post. 0 issues.
---
 Was playing through that whole window yesterday. Logging on and off as I cooked dinner and what not
---
Trying to kill literally anything near Brill on launch was a slog. It was super fun through trying to tag mobs with my buddy.

Favorite part of classic thus far.

It is.

Dinged 40 &amp; HS'ed to Darna to buy it straight away
---
&gt; He gains the satisfaction of knowing he made a positive contribution to humanity.
---
I'm trying to put this as politely as possible, but if creating a screenshot of an incredibly common occurrence in-game (not enough/barely enough money for mount, who can relate?!?) counts as content creation, let alone a positive contribution to humanity, we have significantly lowered the bar to a point where the only path forward is pushing the ground below sea level.

Exactly! if i see a car unlocked its free game to take whatever i want inside cause they're a "rando". If you're not in my circle of friends im going to steal from you if i see an opportunity! Gee, I wonder why I have only two friends and no guild!

They did? I did not hear that, but that didn't happen til after reddit blew up calling him a ninja.
---
There are two main aspects of PvP; world PvP and battlegrounds. Phases are referred to as when blizzard is releasing classic content that align to raids and PvP.
---
World PvP requires people to be flagged and willing to engage. Could be hit or miss. The ranking system comes in phase two before end of the year. This may force people on your server to PvP flag to gain honor as it’s the only way. In phase 3 (probably early spring 2020) there will be battlegrounds where regardless of PvP or PvE sever players queue to join and it’s isolated to this. Honor farming is mostly done in battlegrounds so PvP won’t be an issue there. In either case this really only matters at 60 for anything honor related.
---
Chrome has an extension called Picture in Picture and does this exact thing for any video played in the browser.
---
Anybody else having issues on Mac?
---
My game finishes loading and my OS crashes, forcing my MBA to reboot. I'm on latest Mojave on a 2019 MacBook Air. The game ran flawlessly until last night and now I can't play anymore.
---
The final boss is 51 and has like 30 non-elite mob and 4 elite mobs and like a million health... I don’t think you’re thinking of the right place
---
Oh yes your right sorry ... still there really isnt "speccing" in classic for pets.. just get the highest rank of lightning breath u can and dive. And spec into increased focus under the beast master tree then u will change the resistances that u give him based on the dungeons and raids that you go into, and depending on if u want to use him for lvling add natural armor and stamina if ur just using for dps just add stamina so he survives longer in aoe situations ..thats really all u can do in classic.
---
On the market is essentially whatever you're willing to pay
---
Yea, classic raids are absurdly easy. Bis is a personal achievement.
---
Mods ability to critically think before removing your post was low effort. Mod should probably be removed
---
For deep protection warrior tanks, does heroic strike generate more threat than shield slam?
---
Imo uldum wasnt all that bad in Cata.
---
Not really, but I do think that the community needs to do a better job of enforcing quality code that goes into addons before it's allowed to be deployed to places like Twitch.
---
Hot damn, Twitch is now on the table!!
---
You are definitely right.  However, I've found that fishermen seem to have a mutual respect that other gatherer professions do not.  Probably most likely because you are not actually competing for the same resources as they don't despawn like herbs, ore, or mobs.  I have 300 fishing, a 50% of mine was done in contested zones (duskwallow march, azshara) and I think the entirety of my grinding I wasn't ganked a single time in those areas.
---
Yeah, no. If a healer needs on DPS gear while other DPS need it in places like BRD in the 50s, that's a problem. Healers/Tanks get the privilege of fast groups, so they can get 2nd priority on DPS gear. I think the cut-off is around ZF where this starts to be a big deal.
---
The discs are also on a horde quest.
---
Oh for real? Thanks a bunch, man.
---
How do you do dungeons? I have a few dungeon quests but can’t figure out how to do them.
---
Did you explain the difference?
---
Writ's third leg and Mug o' Hurt if you can get them cheap.
---
Writ's usually go for 3g in my server and Mug was 5g last time I checked.
---
plus one for this one
---
People hate him becuase they have lost everything no life-ing and living the same way as him, yet he has made millions doing it and is extremely successful.
---
Its mostly just jealousy. The guy doesnt give a fuck, just loves video games(wow) , and is being rewarded handsomely .
---
I don't understand why everyone always complains about whatever other people are trying to group up for. If someone reserves something, just don't join. If it's getting out of hand, they won't get enough people for the group and maybe reconsider their reserving stuff.
---
No, it has been the operating norm since initial release of World of Warcraft. Everything else is your failure to look into a topic before you attempt to armchair expert a conversation.
---
&gt; if you were able to keep your dagger updated it would be good.
---
This is one of the main reasons speed levelers go Combat as well.  If you're just leveling an alt that you can fund sweet daggers to, you can level up very fast as Sub.
---
It does in pvp
---
*laughs in pve server*
---
Yeah but when you don't kill them in the .5 secs that you have melee time on them, you just lose. Nova, blink, sheep, block,.. there's no way a mage of equal skill will ever lose to a warrior. Way too many people don't realize that just because you're higher health doesn't mean you're winning a duel. If the mage is at 10 health but you have used all your options and he still has a few of his, he is winning.
---
They’re the same fucking thing, and people have said both for years. I personally say “dps”, but I know what people mean when they say “DD” and I’m not gonna comment on it because it literally doesn’t fucking matter.
---
This was before affirmative action in Azeroth though... This game is a history piece.
---
First, Thunder Clap has a 0.8 modifier to it's threat generated. In other words, it generates 80% of the threat that it says it generates, or instead of 180 it only generates 144. Right off the bat, that's less than Battle Shout, which is 70 threat PER PERSON it buffs. 5 people? That's 350 threat. There's a hunter pet? That's 420 threat. Now, that is divided evently among the mobs in combat, so in Thunder Clap's best case scenario, it generates 144 threat on each target, while Battle Shout would split the 350 threat between the 4 for 87.5 threat. But wait, defensive stance and defiance boost the 350 threat to 523.25, so it's actually 130.8125 threat on each mob. 
---
So, you're thinking "Well, 144 is still higher than 130" and you'd be right. Except Thunder Clap costs 20 rage, while Battle shout costs 10. And you can keep spamming Battle Shout (each application of the buff generates threat, even if its just refreshing the duration). Now, if you had infinite rage, sure, Thunder Clap would be better threat. But if you have infinite rage, you're probably being hit pretty hard, in which case you'd want the 10% decreased damage received from defensive stance.
---
Oh, and if there's a hunter pet, it makes battle shout generate 156.975 threat on each mob, straight up beating thunder clap.
---
Sulfuras is good. 52% horde and 48% alliance. Mostly people are relaxed and just having a good time
---
No ques
---
That's all part of it.
---
Dope
---
All I can keep thinking about is how frustrating it must be to play like that though. Or is it easier than I expect? I can imagine spending 3 minutes trying to mouse-over a corpse to loot it, getting pissed, and uninstalling it all.
---
It was good on private servers where you could make facestab meme builds, but in Classic, not so much. Having to stealth up behind every mob is a pretty big time sink.
---
I mean really, no matter what spec you choose, Rogue still kills things pretty easily with just about any weapon, but going for a "daggers" build is going to be slower and less efficient than the standard Combat swords.
---
Also, what the fug mobs are you fighting that an Ambush crit is "90%" of their health? Even with an epic dagger (Gut Ripper), Ambush was only critting for around 40-50% of an equal level mob's health.
---
prolly a ninja
---
What, your comments?
---
How can I get those 30 seconds of my life back
---
Oh you do? How tedious, figured it was just like warrior.
---
Not at all.  
---
Seriously - and trust this - the end game hype and ‘requirements’ you see are bullshit for anything more than trying to accomplish progression.  
---
Almost everyone will be happy to fill another slot in their group with a rogue. No one cares about your pre raid BIS or your consumables. They’ll just ask that you be competent and pay attention.  
---
You’ll be able to find plenty of groups. You’ll get cool gear. And very very few will be weeding you out of their groups.  
---
People forget how hard it is to even form a raid the first place, even with a guild. As soon as the 55-60 pop grows to a more representative size, PUG for raids and large instances are going to be popping up like mushrooms in the Washington winter.  
---
I’m sorry that so many people on this sub and others (not necessarily assuming you but I’ve seen many) that are being intimidated by hardcore raiders to ‘have to have BIS before MC’ or ‘you’ll get kicked if you die more than once.’ It’s such BS.
---
I believe its this? It IS kind of hilarious how broken the server is

I only used them when i was healing.  They allow you to hover over a person in your raid and party frames and hit a key binding to heal or dispell them without actually clicking on them to target them.   Was nice to be able to keep MT targetted for keeping track,  or the enemy targetted so you can wand them when you have the time.
---
This was my 17th run and by the way, got my HoJ the day after this one, after 53 runs :)
---
Because you need 100% attention to farm mobs in a circle yeah?
---
Seems like you’re having a bad day, hope the rest of it goes better!
---
At this point, I've listened to so many sounds that I can't even think of the one I'm trying to find anymore haha
---
Did you know there's an option to turn off chat filter?
---
Honestly I'd pay up to 1g for a stack of lvl 45 water. That's still a discount of 60% from buying it from vendors.... 40s(36s Honored) for  5 is f-ing stupid.
---
Quested all day yesterday on my level 50 priest and almost died. Finally found a mage in Org to sell me water for 10s a stack. It was like i died and went to heaven.
---
As a tank I just now started to question if I really am good at tanking, or if everyone is just pampering me to have a tank available.
---
I ressed someone, then they tagged my mob.
---
Feels like so long ago
---
Realm pop websites have been nearly eliminated by a change that Blizzard made to the API to stop census addons from working, for precisely the reasons you posted on your OP. They don't want people choosing servers based on population/faction ratio for some reason.
---
I've stopped learning every skill and only selecting the ones i need, haven't bought any now for ages, wasted a ton of money doing this at early levels
---
Go for the mace because it looks dope.
---
As a mage I agree
---
I looked up the threat table for warrior the other day and it appears shield slam, sunder armor, and revenge all generate more threat than heroic strike. On top of that, HS eats the potential rage generation you get from your next white swing.
---
Does it matter
---
lol i can chainpull yellow mobs w/o bandaging/food as warr. warr leveling is really not that bad as long as you stick to what you can handle. don't fight orange mobs
---
It's like I'm really there! Totally realistic, omg this is epic
---
4th most popular rn actually making them a middle played class.
---
Damn bro. Didn't know showing a screenshot of being 1 copper away from a mount was that profound. That's truly incredible.
---
76 gold at 40!  I only have half that at level 44.
---
Is there an addon that tracks boats/zepps or shows the time (in server time) of when they'll arrive/depart?
---
Didn't Blizzard say they are adding Talisman of Binding Shard back to MC loot table for the duration of phase 1?
---
Just pointing out it’s not very intuitive - an in-game graphic shows weapon stats with all numbers being higher = better, then “Speed” conversely is not. Typically in games “speed” when referring to a weapon/damage is “attack speed”, not “amount of time that you are not swinging your weapon.”
---
Anyone who has not played wow would rationally think a higher weapon speed, just like higher weapon damage or higher dps, would be a good thing.
---
Contains some TBC info, but otherwise good. Upvoted :)
---
“Looting &amp; Group Interaction Policies”
---
Thank you for telling me! On my server it’s a little bit more to sell on the AH.
---
What is this crap, it is supposed to go like this:
---
Pull a pack, never LOS, get life drained by summoners, let patrols add another pack, wipe. Rez and run back to where you were but pull those two ghouls you skipped earlier, die. Rez...hearth.
---
Do you guys not have multiple fingers?
---
Gold is only two dollars. Anyone on this website can pull together two dollars.
---
How much does it cost for the level 40 mount and training? :o
---
Run away. Run far away (or play solo.)
---
The community is very unfriendly. Especially to new players/returnees.
---
If you weren't a private server player, you are shunned. If you ask a question in chat, you are told to Google it.
---
They are constantly rude and harassing to PvE players.
---
It's not worth your time to try to find friends or a guild. You won't.
---
If you want to immerse yourself in the game, don't use Quest addons.  If you don't care about the journey to 60 and just want to get there as fast as you can, use them.
---
Tanks can roll on whatever they want,  tank set, healing set dps set. Tank privilege
---
Down to earth? Absolutely. But, by his own self-admission, likely a douche. He said he doesn't necessarily act differently on stream; he acts like an exaggerated version of himself. Well, if this "exaggerated version" is a grade-A dbag, so too, probably, is the real self. 
---
But hey, that's all inference so take it for what it's worth I guess.
---
It’s a bit disheartening to see so many people say that it doesn’t matter at all. Loot rules mean nothing to so many people. Another reminder to always make my own groups I guess.
---
yeah that's why he said leveling gear lol
---
&gt; 'm not sure what proof I can provide that isn't right in front of your face, the screenshot literally shows a mage need on an item purely for monetary gain.
---
That's not even proof according to your own criteria that you don't ninja if you've agreed upon something beforehand. You can't prove they haven't so you can't prove he's looting.
---
Also, that's the big difference between this screenshot and the other one, in the one you linked there is an agreement to greed, which the ninja does not follow up.
---
PVP only - It's 5 seconds to ooc; Improved gouge puts it at 5.5 secs, just enough to get that restealth and opener. &lt;3
---
Devilsaur is the better choice as an orc or a human. There is a diminising return on the benefits of weaponskill.
---
If you look up this table for weapons skill: https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/attack-table#glancing-blows
---
Then you can see at +5 weapon skill you get around 15% Glancing penalty and at +8 you get around 5%. Every weapon skill after this doesnt add much. Which means you only effectively take use of 3/7 of the edgemasters added weapon skills.
---
Hence why the devilsaur set is better.
---
Maybe its just me but when people *hahahaha* with caps it's a little annoying
---
Managed to get Edgemaster's on my warrior. I know the benefits of weapon skill against higher level mobs and bosses, but can anyone tell me the bonuses to crit/hit chance against same or lower level mobs?
---
That works on single-pulls but isn't helpful for AOE group or multi-target pulls.
---
Uh... what? Lmao. This has to be a troll.
---
Never played retail. If I'm tanking 100+ runs of BRD for a 1% drop item, explain why I should take your meme spec enh shaman when there are a plethora of others that want to run with me. Supply and demand.
---
When you form groups around what people want, everyone wins actually.
---
I don't think it's a good idea to take things too seriously early on, but when you're talking about rare shit for pre bis then I don't understand why you wouldn't be more picky.
---
I’m still using Meteor Shard at 35. Hoping to get Black Menace sometime this weekend, but after that, I have to hope for a few purple Mara groups to get Satyr’s Lash.
---
How much should we be tipping lockpicks/BS/Tailors/Portals, etc.?
---
I wouldn't pay it either, lol. People can already buy better food than a mage can make. You're charging money for something that costs you nothing. The ignore is a bit much though. I only save that for extreme harrassers and gold farmers.
---
Im doing the exact same build. Going up to preparation and then probably dumping the rest in combat. Do you think its worth it to take hemo?
---
that was 3 words
---
There's an addon you can get that will show vendor prices in the tool tip.  It's super handy when you post something, refresh prices and then mouse over to see if you can get more by vedoring it.
---
If I have to have action bars taking up half my char then this is not the move. Idk why that bugs me haha just move that shit down
---
Don't roll a warrior if you're not willing to tank a lot, just like you shouldn't roll a paladin if you're not willing to heal a lot.
---
If you want to dps then roll a dps class, not a tank or healing class.
---
Macro that shit up you damn noob!!
---
Exactly why rogues level sword spec for the extra procs. Granted they are DW and have slice and dice up to increase attack speed all the time
---
If I'm outdoors and I didn't crop the photo it's actually okay, bad framing in this screenie

So, in a way, you're right. Without a pocket healer, warrior pvp is merely ok. We don't suck, we hard counter some classes, get hard countered by others. But with a pocket healer, we dominate. A warrior/priest combo is pretty dangerous.
---
You say that not everyone will have a pocket healer. This is why I have endeavored to make friends with every good healer I have come across in dungeons. Sure, I may not get someone who can play with me every time, but now that I have over 15 healers on my friends list? I'm bound to be able to get one that can help me. Especially since they don't want to be out by themselves either.

Which server are you on?
---
Trolls with southern accents? I dig it
---
The Truefaith Vestments, Robe of the Void, and Robe of the Archmage patterns all go for roughly 100-150g on my server. If you can get for cheaper, then that's awesome. As far as BOE's go, look at how deep into the phases they will last...some things last a long time, like the Warden Staff for Druid tanks. I would happily invest a few hundred gold for that. But am I going to replace it in the next week or two in raid? Eh, maybe keep those items sub-100g or find an optional slot piece.
---
The player name is Farts?
---
Nah, you just swap your dagger in with a weapon swap macro on Ambush and another macro on Hemo to equip back to your sword/mace/fist.
---
I've been ambush spec with hemo and I've been having a good time. With remoseless attacks ambush almost always crits and it makes killing things easy. I know combat swords is probably more consistent and better later on but ambush is just plain fun and has been effective for me.
---
I agree. I can see it is very efficient and you dont need to waste time stealthing up to mobs. But it doesn't feel like I'm s rogue.
---
The word looting appears 0 times in blizzard eula or coc, so can you help me a bit with finding it.
---
It’s slower for sure, but it’s actually not that bad. If you tweak the mouse sensitivity you can get it done quite easily. Most times I just leave the mouse cursor near my character and it’s just a quick flick to loot the corpse. I enjoy it. It’s a comfier experience but definitely don’t like doing it for that long.
---
If you are just Jed/Rend running, you should be 5 manning it.
---
Keep tailoring. You're already too high. You don't need to have your mount right at level 40 anyway. Your primary goal should be leveling, and yes I understand leveling is made easier with a mount but there has to be a balance of priority. Get tailoring to max now or at 60, get your archmage pattern, make the robe, and if you want to drop it then that's up to you but don't forget about the ZG set bonus in later phase.  
---
You need to make sure the DE materials you're selling aren't lower cost than simply vendoring the green. I suspect being an enchanter from early level has caused you to miss a lot of gold which is why I always tell people to level enchanting from level 60 unless you have people helping you.  
---
Keep tailoring where it is OR level it, up to you. Stop leveling enchanting. Make the smart sale on greens vs enchanting materials. Stop worrying about getting your mount at 40. Getting it at 43 isn't a bad deal either.  
---
Joana got his mount at level 43 iirc during his world record run back in the day.
---
Question regarding mods. I installed a bunch of them overtime manually and now I'm seeing there's a twitch app for it. Is the twitch app easier for updating mods? I feel like that's the only huge hassle for me when using them.
---
I’m an Alliance mage and my wife hates me. 
---
Take an upvote for being a good hubby tho lol.
---
Just buy a used 19 inch 1280x1024 monitor for like $20 bucks on classifieds.
---
I’m leveling a rogue alt right now. I got him the Outlaw Sabre at lvl 21 with fiery wep. I might try out sub daggers in a few levels when I can get claw of the shadowmancer
---
I don't think this guy enjoys the game much.
---
It does. You’re not in the right spot.
---
Yeah, i was pretty much vendoring anything before blindweed on my server. Even swift-thistle(for speed pots) wasn't worth anything which was pretty weird since those get a lot of use in PVP. Blindweed was actually worth some solid gold, as well as sun grass, gromsblood... ect. Still the moneys not great. I've made way more money selling mithril bars than I did off herbalism. Finally I made a mage-alt and gave her alchemy just to use up all the worthless herbs I had sitting around.
---
Scumbags! Traitors! Infidels! These people should be marked as traitors and treated as such ... For the horde!
---
What is the best LW specialization as a 40 hunter. As I'm leveling up i hear one is better than other, although mail armor seems good to. Which is best in certain circumstances? Thanks. I'm leading towards tribal
---
This would work great on Zandalar Tribe (EU) upstairs in Ironforge's Stonefire Tavern, or downstairs in Brill's Gallows' End Tavern.
---
An easier way to get it working would be to install the Picture in Picture Extension(by Google) and that way you only have to hit alt+p to get the pip to show up.
---
Strictly speaking, that depends on how many mobs you're tanking. Battle Shout (assuming you hit all 5 members of your party) is only better if you're fighting 8 or less mobs, then demo shout is actually better threat, since Battle Shout's threat is split evenly among all mobs, while demo shout is flat threat on every mob it hits. Granted, the majority of the time you will fight 8 or less mobs, but good to know when you should swap.
---
i walked into that cave in arathi one time, for the booty bay ore quest. when i got to the deepest part, i see a mage just SITTING on top of the tallest rock in the cave, as far from me as possible. then he whispers me, “are you a miner” lmaoooo. very funny experience tbh.
---
I knowww 😭
---
Right not like it’s a picture of you in a raid watching Netflix. If I’m gonna do anything on WoW half assed it’s grind mobs or questing.
---
As an fellow undead I feel with you. Does this happen to other races to or only ro UD?
---
Actually good as fuck, nice rap and nice banter.
---
NODE!!! I SAID I WANTED TO TAP THE NODE!!!!
---
I know this isn't a serious reply, but it's actually kind of amazing, how Mining can change entire landscapes, even when it's done entirely underground. There are some big hills in the German Ruhr Area, that were made entirely from overburden.
---
 this is it right here
---
In most 5-mans in this game, the tank needs to put in 3 times as much effort as anyone else to keep things smooth. And with the way threat (especially multi target) is, you need your DPS to work with you. If they're not trying to work with you, your workload litterately doubles and you're struggling with an empty rage bar, trying to keep things from killing idiots in your group.
---
Most DPS just randomly spam 1-3 buttons while watching twitch or something.
---
Plenty of jerks on both factions. You better find a RP server.
---
If you undock your browser window and shove it to the right side of the screen, it will then give u the option to click another window tile and split the screen 50/50, usually WoW won't resize to a perfect 1/2, but if u do it to the browser window first then click WoW it works.  Great for 21:9 monitors.
---
You just won yourself a tank!
---
*what a space for jokes*
---
Well, that was your decision. Just don’t turn to altoholism.
---
I'd keep it. It's rare to find something that is far and away the best for such a long time.
---
Is there a strip mine joke in there somewhere?
---
Im seeing a lot of bad information. If you are on a pvp server then you may want more stam and int, but your 2 best stats for lvling are spell power and spirit. Spell power increases mana from life tap but does not increase life lost, thus reducing the overall number of casts used, it also scales at close to if not 100% with dots. Spirit is the only stat that increases what you do by a "rate" at a meaningful level. Stam and int add flat pools of hp and mana that require time/energy/resources to refill, they aren't good unless they are needed and are spent, health you dont lose is health you wasted and didnt need. Every point of spirit is adding up and increasing the amount of mana and hp you generate at a constant rate, like interesting accruing into your bank account. 
---
TLDR: Sp reduces number of spells used, decreases TTK(time to kill) of mobs which increases efficiency, int is an empty bank of mana that has to be refilled after use, it mostly doesnt increase leveling speed unless you have a seriously low amount to begin with. 
---
A warlock with 100 int has 1500 mana
---
A warlock with 100 spirit gains 25 mana every tic (2 seconds) (not the real numbers just an example)
---
9% 300 wep skill
---
6% 305 wep skill
---
Not sure for pvp
---
I am 51 and wear the 2h sword from last boss uldaman which has compared to maraudon drops nice weapon dmg but to be frank my mob dmg is wack and I am in one of those situations where I sometimes need a m minute for a mob that is my level. What is a good weapon I should get. 
---
Also what things should I plan on the next levels?MC attunement with 55? What other stuff can I start to do now or the next levels to prepare for endgame?
---
I think I want to tank with max level, when should I respec without loosing the ability to solo content/quest? My classic dungeons knowledge never was the best and I feel like as tank you are responsible for the group in terms of leadership. What are good guides I could read in terms of tanking dungeons/raids? Should I even consider tanking MC without proper experience? I tanked a lot playing wow just never really did MC as I started playing at the end of classic.
---
One last thing: where can I find stance dance macros and other useful stuff?
---
A guildie of mine would advertise Blackstone Ring drops (preraid BiS ring) which come off princess. He would say 25g for a garunteed ring, you pay when the ring drops. All this while doing his princess runs and getting gear to vendor. Lvl 60 for warriors/paladins, and 45+ for stealthies who can run by the mobs. This netted his profit significantly by giving people runs while doing the princess runs he was already going to be doing anyways.
---
wtf heals?
---
:O is this when I registered to reddit?
---
That 3-500 is still the early price, as a server matures it will get closer to that 1k normal price.
---
Only downside to locks is the lack of movement increasing effects. Druids have 30% movement in cat form by 21 and then 40% instant cast travel form by 30
---
Edit: I hate autocorrect
---
in 2004 when this game was made. gaming as a whole was not as received as well as it is today. why would they spend resources making art for a demographic that wasn't even playing the product? I feel this akin to bitching at Victoria's Secret for not selling male underwear. or maybelline/covergirl not making "men versions of mascara, foundation, and blush". Either create make-up for both sexes, or not at all.
---
exactly, the demand for tanks or whatever is so high they can get away with reserving stuff then why shouldn't they, they are getting rewarded with what their service is worth. if you don't like it, make your own groups.
---
So you have to train there? You can't do it in capital cities?
---
People saying 300-450g....
---
Pfft, here I am with my +15 healing wand I got for 3g.
---
It’s cool... if that 5 healing causes a wipe at the cost of 297-447 gold, I can live with that...
---
I’d rather buy Truefaith AND eye of shadow.
---
[https://puu.sh/EoSzU/685f302ee1.png](https://puu.sh/EoSzU/685f302ee1.png) Would you mind commenting on this build?
---
My hit gear is currently: Voone's vice grips (2%), Windreaver greaves (1%), Blackstone Ring (1%): 5% total,. I have Wyrmhide Shoulders (2%) but its leather and has no other stats, so I can't really use it while tanking.
---
I'm working on getting the Girdle from Drakkisath (1%) as well as the Blackcrow bow (1%) from LBRS. If I were to obtain these pieces I would hit 7% total. Any other recommendations on where I can source the hit %?
---
I look at the vendor price,  AH fees and see if it's worth posting.   If i can post it for 24 hours and still make profit on vending it after the auction fails, ill try my luck once then vendor it or send it to my bank alt to DE.
---
Also depends on level and stats and knowing if there's a quest item in that level range thats good.  Like any leather pants with agi in the lvl 30 range arent worth trying to sell because Triprunner Dungarees from the Gnomer quest are so freaking good.  So I'll immediately vendor/DE those instead of eating the AH fee.
---
From my experience you make more money DE'ing nost greens and selling the mats on the AH instead.   There's no fee to post those.   There exceptions,  like lvl 40 plate greens with a lot of str/stam might sell well to a warrior wanting to upgrade all his old mail pieces.   Low level shoulders, helms, and necklaces with decent stats.  Ranged weapons with stats for rogues and warriors.   Its all a risk though. 
---
 Having the auctioneer addon helps a ton. Consistently scan the AH and build up a database so you can see how much other people have posted the same item for,  shows the vendor price,  and will recommend vendor, DE, or auction.   But it's all based on the database you collect by scanning your auction house.   So i try to do that at least once a day.
---
Hunters will still be brought to Naxx, don’t worry. Especially if you volunteer for Nightfall duty!
---
Tribal is the traditional answer for access to devilsaur gear.
---
More like stick to greens.
---
Not really
---
Or just accept that you'll play solo a lot. No pity for hybrids who refuse to play their useful role.
---
I could be wrong but I remember there is something in tos who don't allow using cloud to play
---
Turn them to farts
---
He's saying to eat them
---
Slow MH (3.7 is the fastest you want ideally) and WF weapon is the best way to gear an enhance and yes, it will peel off tanks a lot. Especially when you get a fat WF crit. Also NEVER use frost shock unless its on a runner. Frost shock might as well be a taunt with how much threat it produces. 
---
Ele has issues too but not as bad as enhance. Luckily enhance can typically kill the mob its pulled pretty fast so i wouldnt get too discouraged.
---
What no.
---
At 300 its 9%, at 305 doesnt matter the race its 6%.
---
Consumables.
---
Specifically free action potion.
---
Main problem is that you’re competing with the healer to gear for viable raid spec
---
Patch 1.8 speed doesn’t matter as much as it originally did due to *Weaponspeed Normalization*. The extra skill in your weapon matters just as much if not more in leveling.
---
October 5th 2019.  12:44pm Eastern.  The moment a Reddit post changed my life.
---
I think vanilla raiding is really spec based. Many classes only have 1 viable spec to raid. Warriors aren’t like this though they can put out really good dps so expecting them to tank is stupid. I was between rogue and warrior and the tanking issue made me choose rogue.
---
I am sorry you are searching Blizzards ToS and not Classic WoW like I stated lmao
---
Because I do not have faith in you, “If a group establishes clear rules for specific loot distribution using channels that are visible to all players (such as party chat or raid chat), then breaks those rules by distributing the loot differently, Blizzard will consider this a loot scam”
---
“These rules would need to have been stated in game in a place where all raid members could see them. If a scam is confirmed any items that traded hands will be stripped, and destroyed. We cannot redistribute the loot to another player in this case.”
---
This meme doesn't even work because skull shape varies between the sexes and races.
---
no, but FAP and don't intercept until they blink.
---
Not really relevant, but I was thinking the other day how cool it would be to have an interactive historical map of Azeroth similar to [Chronas](https://chronas.org).
---
Also you have this wonderfully thing called intercept.
---
Then you leave and instantly get another group because the hell with rolling against people for loot when you're a tank. Can make your own group and fill it instantly.
---
Do you have an imgur link to the original? Love this one too
---
What type of SM runs are best for leveling at lvl 33 (warlock)?
---
Paladin has to be slower than Warrior. Warriors eventually get some items and skills and start speeding up leveling. Paladins are pretty much the same from the moment they get Seal of Command.
---
I want some of whatever you're smoking.
---
Intercept has a longer cooldown than blink, if they nova blink and channel frostbolt they can blink again and make your intercept useless.
---
Everyone asks, "can you teach me first aid?"
---
But no one asks, "do you want first aid?"
---
did... did you just reference based god? What year is it?
---
Well I can't find those either, so do you care to link?
---
Wasn't inferring that, but it's all very light on the detail
---
As a mage, this needs to be discussed. I dont play perfect (mainly because strats differ grp to grp) , but I always feel I'm being micromanaged like a per by my group. I feel they are tilted by other mages prior to me joining .
---
No, just go fap
---
I got herbing up to around level 100 and dropped it for mining after being unable to sell anything for more than what vendors were offering. Way better money.
---
That sad, I have an alt with alchemy who is loving it.
---
No. They can go play another game fuck the scrubs
---
I haven’t had any issue getting pre raid bis and off tanking a few of the starting MC bosses with PUGs on my server. Maybe it’s diff in a guild.
---
I picked up mining and skinning in hopes to make some gold but they sell a little higher on the AH than the vendor. 
---
Is it better to level up other professions since there is no market for skinning or mining?
---
Theres and extension for Chrome which is Calles picture in picture. Lets you Play any media in Chrome by the press of a button. A Tad bit easier
---
4 BRD Arenas + 5th run being extra bosses to wait out the instance reset timer.
---
Interesting, does that still work with the quick getall scans?
---
You seem to have looked into the character a lot deeper than my 5 minute Google search. I wouldn't be surprised to hear that his presence in Old Hillsbrad is not entirely accurate, considering Blizzard's track record in such things.
---
&gt; I imagine him a bit older than Sally and the rest. A vet of many battles who wants nothing but to fight. And after training so many inept recruits, he's bored to death.
---
Putting all the lore from above aside, it's interesting what a different personality I projected onto this character that has, at least to me, always been kind of a blank slate. I always pictured him as a young and hotheaded, but extremely talented warrior.
---
Omg this is so good haha
---
48 - I hardly use it being a druid. Love travel form so often find myself having to make myself use the mount. I had the money since about level 39.
---
Is this true? From the patch notes:
---
"we’ve also identified a fix for a separate issue that was causing Battle Shout and most healing spells, effects, and buffs to incorrectly split the threat they generate between enemies that had members of the buffed party on their threat list."
---
I read that as battle shout threat was being split when it shouldn't have been, but could also read as "was being split incorrectly and is not being split correctly." It's a little ambiguous.
---
They do more damage than you, bring more buffs than you and can offtank.
---
Wht do you bring to the table apart from lockpicking and a cc thats most of the time not usable?
---
Its almost like people want to form their own group with what they want.
---
This sums up by opinion better than what I said.  It's so true.  It's like a mage refusing to sheep.
---
For Alliance, the quest starts with that necklace. For Horde - it starts with a couple Orcs in Ogrimmar.
---
Mail is very good, but keep in mind that all LW specs can make mail, Dragonscale can make a few pieces of mail other specs can't. Tribal LW is more sought after by guilds as it has better gear for druids and rogues than Dragonscale has for shaman and hunters.
---
Want to make your own gear? Choose Dragonscale, I did as a shaman. 
---
Don't choose Dragonscale because you think the other specs can't make mail, that is simply not true.
---
How do I do this for old school runescape lmao
---
the problem i have with this post, is it automatically assumes the mage is at fault.
---
in most cases ive had to aoe the pubs ive been in. including, brd, lbrs and strath. but i dont wipe, why? because the tanks generally understand the role they fill when a mage is aoeing.
---
ya wanna know what it is?
---
**Pull the straggler mobs back into the aoe and off the other squishies**. your not supposed to tank anything, infact trying to tank an aoe group is actually dumber then trying too aoe. its common sense that having 10+ mobs on you is going to kill you.
---
this isnt to say the mages are never at fault. its best done with another caster that can deal dmg to multiple targets (like a warlock dotting or hellfiring, or fire or frost mage). but it can be done in non aoe groups. and mages should rarely ever pull, but spamming blizzard on a group of mobs with 2 other decent dps simply allows the tank to dps as well (*most tanks you see in dungeons sub 60 arnt prot, theyre arms*) while saving the healers mana as the mobs are usually chasing after the mage with a 75% movement speed debuff.
---
ive done it in full melee comps, and ive done it in more spellcleavey type comps.
---
the issue is, being a pve mage is easy. super easy, spamming blizzard and doing a little soft kiting doesnt take alot to figure out (tho there are mages that fail at this). but a tank or healer have much more difficult jobs in pve (*this being relative, as pve in general is easy as shit*). the tank has to manage threat, but more importantly control the fight in anyway he can and healers have too keep up whomever is taking dmg without pulling extra mobs on themselves. when either of those people fall short, the groups wipe.
---
now some things i will say, first mages shouldnt be using AE spam against mobs that are a real threat to them in non spellcleave comps. you'll get one shot (*if theres enough of em*). but doing nova+cone is a solid way to do up to 1200 dmg on each mob before you blink back out to blizzard them. generally youd start with blizzard and if they got close you would nova+cone then repeat.
---
but for some reason there is a circle jerk of "lol mages are why i wiped". its just not true alot of the time.
---
the problem is almost always a tank trying to do his standard job in senario's hes not supposed to do it in. let the mobs chase the mage, if the mage doesnt know how too kite and aoe, thats his fault. its dead easy and any mage should be able to do it. but if he does know what to do it, you trying too aggro the mobs will just get you and everyone killed.
---
so this is when you can blame a mage
---
1. the mage is spamming AE like a moron and is in melee range and dies.
---
2. the mage is pulling mobs and is in melee range when he casts any aoe spell... and dies
---
3. the mage doesnt have imp blizzard but is spamming blizzard on targets...and dies
---
4. the mage trys to aoe without full mana, ooms with the mobs being half hp...and dies
---
5. the mage trys to pull mobs pretty much at all. (*unless they were told too*)
---
times when the mage isnt too blame.
---
1. when the healer spaces out and afks for 10+ seconds in the middle of a dangerous portion of a dungeon (*happens more then youd think*)
---
2. when the tank decides too pull to many mobs and insta dies
---
3. when one of the dps somehow manges too die despite the enemy mobs being aggroed between the mage and warrior. with a 75% movement speed debuff on them
---
4. the mage isnt even aoeing
---
5. when the tank isnt bunching mobs up properly to aoe (*not using los to pull ranged mobs in, ect*)
---
6. when the 'healer' decides to dps instead of heal
---
bad mages sometimes wipe teams, bad tanks or healers always wipe teams.
---
when i first started doing non spellcleave dungeons again for the first time after SM, i had thought the same thing as everyone else. aoeing in the wrong comp can wipe you, and to this day i still say a large number of mages should refrain from it as i just expect them all to be stupid. BUT when i met a 60 warrior who was tankin for a guildie/friend of his, he told me out right "all of that dont aoe stuff is bullshit." he then explained basically what i did here, albeit way faster then this wall of text does. 
---
since then i try too aoe anytime the tank seems competent (*and the mobs id be aoeing arnt going to fuck me. like if they have an aoe healer or too many ranged mobs*) and ive been fine (*note, i always test if a mob can be slowed using a r1 frost bolt. because if they cant be slowed it can get bad fast, if your the only aoe class there*). otherwise i simply spam frost bolt and watch some shit on youtube (*cuz thats how easy frost mage pve is*). 
---
its easy too scapegoat an entire class (*most of which is because people are jealous they cant aoe farm or make portals/food*), but we should really refrain from that. (*even though classes with pets are usually the ones that wipe groups. like warlocks that walk around with a succubus instead of imp, or just hunters that dont dismiss there pets*) its not always there fault, sometimes its the fault of the group for not explaining shit to em. which is what i gathered too be the OP's point. even if his original reasoning for it is wrong (*aka mages aoeing = bad*).
---
The extra dodge chance and the nature resist.
---
Absolutely incorrect.
---
This means nothing to me. Just reroll or put up with the ganking.
---
I see someone else pasted it, but one of the comments on that guide goes to http://old.elsanglinreborn.com/zone_base_fishing_skill.html which is also relevant for me :)
---
Flembag, i would argue this a bit. When low level a fast 1h and shield with flametongue is amazing.
---
Group with a healer who can dispel Magic (Priest or Paladin).  And make sure to interrupt Poly cast on your healer (don’t waste your interrupts on Frost school).
---
Same. I've been using it for years even on multi-monitor setups.
---
It has a lot of features.
---
I will! And then I’ll come back later to harass and demean you personally if my experience is even the slightest bit different.
---
Fap , frost protection pre pro, engeneering .
---
Please explain how that is racist though, for real, I'm confused by your thought process
---
Ahh yes ive got deathpaw and the lbrs one lined up atm, i wanted BT son of hkkar but settled for spawn as son isnt in yet and deathpaw or lbrs one
---
Usually a group will just do anger/golem since they're pretty close. It takes longer than the reset required, but it's well worth the time investment so eh.
---
I really don't see why you would take more than 1 in silent resolve, that's mostly what i mean.
---
Honestly this could have just as easily been a warrior wearing that full BiS leather
---
He’s fucking with you
---
I get my air pods to work with discord by signing into discord with my phone, works great

Get used to people blaming you for everything that goes wrong in dungeons.
---
Give a paladin or druid great gear for tanking that far outclasses the content they are going to tank, and yes, they can main tank some fights. But they both have critical weaknesses that can only be partially overcome with gear.
---
Druids cannot become uncrushable, period, and the gear they need to be uncrittable is very difficult to acquire. Other than this, they are actually pretty good, because their threat generation is very good and they have a taunt.
---
Paladins have a few more issues. They can become crit immune far easier than druids (though not nearly as easily as warriors), but becoming uncrushable is nearly impossible, if not outright impossible. But even if they manage this, (A) their single target threat generation is still less than a warriors, especially if they are using warrior gear to meet the uncrit/uncrush goals that a warrior gets by virtue of shield block, (B) they don't have a taunt, and (C) once they are oom, their threat generation plummets. You can help A &amp; C with gear, but if you do, you sacrifice a ton of mitigation.
---
&gt; I bet you made quite a bit of money if you were doing each dungeon 1-3 times
---
You actually don't really make that much money from dungeons. I'm level 38 and I've been doing alot of SM throughout this bracket. I've noticed that you don't really make alot of money through SM. most of the drops are silver/silk and it's just not very good gp/h when that loot's being split up by 4 other people. Grinding mobs and then vendoring the trash is probably one of the more consistent money making methods at low level.
---
I started running BRD at 52 as well but I'm starting to think I have been blessed by Blizzard at this point.. I got my HoJ on my very first BRD run, Savage Chain took me about 5 runs I think

Yeah that works great I do this pretty much every pack, unless it's some weird pull. You end up doin a lot of damage by the end of the run lol

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

So sorry to hear about your girl. Hope it comforts you to know that her spirit is now one with the universe and her boundless love now surrounds you at all times. She’s still there for you when you when her, and she will be waiting very excitedly (but also patiently bc she’s a good girl) to reunite with you one day!

Sorry, you asked how much we would spend on pre raid bis and that is how much I would pay. I have a rogue and the devilsaur pieces go for about 200g each on my server, which is way to high for myself. If maybe they were sub 100g I would think about it.

This is great haha.

I have LOVED alchemy/herb since the beginning in vanilla. Never found it tedious or annoying. I just loved the aspect of going, wow my character can do much more than just killing things. Getting new potions to make, making yourself feel stronger because of them. I regret not going alchemy at the beginning of classic. I went ench/tailoring... idk why.
---
In a low level dungeon like dm I'd say it's not a big issue, but later it's usually correct to roll for the spec you are using in the dungeon at that moment, otherwise hybrid classes would roll need on everything. To avoid future discussions just announce to the group your intentions about rolls at the beginning of the instance.

You're a muppet 😂 go learn what real racism is.

In my experience as a rogue furbolgs, harpies, and whelps seem to have much lower armor values than other mobs of the same level.

Women have always been a huge part of wow's success moreso than many games of any other genre.

One of wow's big selling points was it was a game that quite a few players enjoyed with their formerly non-gaming partners.

Ele shaman is fairly fast post 40.  Between the capstone talent and the clear casting talent you can usually do several yellow pulls in a row unless you get unlucky with resists or clear casts.  I could clear the troll camps in the hinterlands with 1-2 water stops each.  Talented lightning bolts are pretty mana efficient.
---
That specific example is actually very viable, especially if you run with friends or guildies. Make sure they know at the start that’s what you’re doing the dungeon for and they’ll let you have it if it drops. If not, you need new friends.
---
World drops like edgemasters or warden staff are different because they aren’t target farmable. They drop anywhere.
---
T1 obsoletes whichever you pick. I went dragonscale for class fantasy. Also, the Black Dragonscale set is sexy.
---
Thanks man, saw the opportunity while questing near Dalaran.
---
I'll agree with you here, it's definitely not racist, yeah it's offensive somewhat. Which is fine, comedy is meant to be offensive. You don't have to read/listen to it, that's your right. It's not racist though.
---
I too would love to hear this.
---
Goofy doesnt mean useless. So it might be that we are in something of an agreement or at least not disagreement here.
---
Thunderclap on the initial pull, yes. But after that it doesn't beat the threat output of tabbing and sundering/revenging. Those skills just put out so much more threat than tclap ever could.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
Casters, dps. I can't melee, stopped trying. I don't like being overly responsible like a tank or healer.
---
Yo! He doesn’t need to roll on those drops, he just wants to do damage and just be on the top.
---
He feels like top dps, a rogue. In spite of those AOE Mage blizzard throws. 
---
But fuck em, he passed the rolls, it’s not about the salary
---
It’s all about reality, and grinding some drops
---
Growing the guild, making sure that roster stays full
---
That means when he passed the roll the PUG is picking it up
---
If you drop engineering and pick it back up, yes you can get goblin instead.
---
Isn't that the case with most NPCs? Those giants in Feralas just stand in the water and swing their mace at you, looks dumb AF. And other mobs have a swimming animation but don't show their attacks in water. Don't even know which one is worse.
---
r/gatekeeping
---
Not to mention that you can also solo outdoor elite areas with calculated pulls, and patience. I've done so many quests just slowly tanking elites 1 at a time. I almost never feel like im out of resources to deal with a situation. Throw in some potions between shifts and leveling is more like a challenge of "How many mobs can i string together in a single combat?" Gotta use all that rage!
---
a warrior thats refusing to tank is just like a shaman thats refusing to heal, a pain in the ass for everyone involved and not someone people will like to group with. play however you want, but don't come crying if people are rejecting you for being selfish.
---

chance to hit increased, chance to glancing blow decreased, all that increased hitting causes your procs to happen more often, sure you have reduced experience gain for green but you save so much time in combat efficiency and not having to eat/drink as  often its just so much more enjoyable and legit faster.

Edit: If you havent already, the elite quests from The Hinterlands provides the Rune of the Guard Captain trinket which has 1% hit. That might be your best bet as far as non RNG sources based on what you've told me so far.

Tooth of Eranikus from Sunken Temple would also be a really viable choice if you're an orc.

Yes but if you don’t swim regularly and then jump into a pool after a big weight loss, you’re not going to be able to swim anymore.
---
People who are swimmers probably learned how to swim while they were skinny, or practiced a lot after their weight loss, since it’s their sport. If you learn how to swim and you’re fat, then you lose a lot of weight, you won’t be able to swim anymore. Or, not well, at least.

I leveled vanilla combat, but TBC/Wrath as sub. Chonking mobs for 80% of their health with your opener is glorious. People forget you can sinister strike with a dagger, and while it's not as ideal as a nice slow sword, it's leagues better than gouge/backstab for dps.

Is +healing gear better than +spirit/+intellect for leveling as a holy priest? Everyone says yes, but I ruin my mana regeneration and can't get enough +healing to effectively use lower rank heals.

Loot Scams
---
When a Master Looter establishes clear rules for specific loot distribution using channels that are visible to all players (such as party chat or raid chat) then breaks those rules by distributing the loot differently, Blizzard considers it a loot scam. If a Master Looter refuses to honor a specific agreement, you can contact Support to report that player for scamming. Include details about the rule established and how it was broken. Blizzard will review the chat logs and may suspend the player or remove items depending on the findings.
---
Due to the privacy associated with these investigations, we will not release details regarding an investigation's findings or any actions taken against other players. Loot removed during a scam investigation will typically be left unassigned.

that's not to mention most of his guild is D-bags. had one ninja and didnt think much of it. had another one a few nights ago asking for a healer for about 20 minutes, i agreed to under the pretense that i needed one boss. we kill their two and they all leave. 
---
The guild is scum and i don't associate with it anymore, if i join a group and i see someone from that guild i leave and let them go back to looking for a healer.

And pressuring another player to fill a group role they did not sign up for isn't selfish?

I expressed myself a bit poorly and maybe I am wrong as well, please correct me if I am. But what I am saying is that while shadow weaving and Swp are good you will probably apply mind flay also but that is it, you already used 3 debuff slots, but that is probably fine because 2 of them are good. But when you start to add the second and third shadow priest you are starting to have to sacrifice something and that is when the raids dps start to hurt, maybe not your personal dps. But yes it is up to every guild to decide how they want to play. Both MC and BWL are pretty easy so there will be plenty of guilds that will clear it without trying to maximize their performance.
---
While it would be discriminating, it wouldn't be racist. Your language isn't tied to your race. The easiest way to disprove that is that basically any race could grow up in any country and learn their language. So attacking a language might be discriminating a specific culture or group of people, but it aint racist.

Right? I did a little research asking a few Warrs right when I hit 30, and figured out it time-to-gold ratio was worth it to just buy all, purchased all for 8G at the time and had the axe at 30 which was worth it imo.

Its an anorexic lonely dude trying to get a sense of power trough a game and then makes a cringy rap song. Alright.

that setup is perfect!

If you're grinding greens sub can actually be faster because DPS over extended fights is much lower with daggers, but initial burst is much higher and often enough to enough to kill the mob outright.
---
Definitely easier to find weapons for combat tho.
---
The Bonebiter is better and WAY easier to get, imo.
---
changed my life thx

Might wanna finish reading the rest of that statement. There were two ACTIVE landmines between us, because not a single one of the THREE ranged DPS in that group killed them...

It rly strains the credulity of the game world when the game itself is constantly breaking the 4th wall and shoving pop-up menus in your face.
---
Oh right on forgot about their dodge
---
Yea, no.  When you have tank or healing built into your class, refusing to pick up your role is a dick move.  The group shouldn't have to spend another 20+ minutes spamming LFG because the fury warrior or shadow priest doesn't feel like it.  If you absolutely refuse to tank, then roll something else, or stick to PvP.  Don't tell them that you could tank, but choose not to, and then expect them to carry you as a DPS, when the could easily find a mage, lock, or rogue that brings more to the group as a DPS anyway.

One thing you can do is bind two keys together, so say you use 1-5 a lot but have trouble reaching 6-9 you can bind shift+1-5 for some more of your frquently used skills but keep them in that sweet spot. Don't forget about nearby keys like f, g, or r.
---
If you’re alliance, skip the WW Axe and get Bonebiter. It’s better.
---
Yeah it's hyperbolic obviously but the same line of logic is applies. You're basically just saying it's been like that way for awhile and it's stupid to talk about it and do something because of it.
---
Looks like you're one of those people who can't do anything but takes a statement at face value. To hell with nuance or context. That would be silly.

so much this, the double stanards :D
---
Switch to any spec you like, WoW is supposed to be fun!
---
But on a more serious note, Shadow is pretty great damage-wise IIRC and also fun to play. Can be pretty amazing in PvP as well.

You can heal just fine with shadow spec (just not in shadow form) until level 55 or so dungeons I hear.
---
is english not your first language or am i having a stroke or something? i'm not understanding any of this

My record is 5 flips in a row

exactly, looking for a tank can take ages. if you have a druid or warrior in group thats doing his part you can start right away and not waste 4 peoples time searching for a tank.
---
I really don't think so, if you lost a lot of weight you will become much more physically capable its the truth! You may be able to float better cuz ur fat but to say you were better at swimming is just dumb and wrong, you lose weight you will be stronger, have better endurance, and be better at swimming, there's no way swimming is that different from being normal bodied or being a fatso its the same freaking motion.
---
Right when they turned the classic servers on

While leveling, priests should heal dungeons if you are doing them. You do not need to spec for healing though, just use your leveling spec and heal the dungeon. Dps priest should be used only in special situations and when you are destroying alliance.
---
Care to share how with VLC? Ive only ever used it for playing video files and clips.

No it isn't. It's funny

This is why I chose rogue. Combat swords. Slice n dice, sinister strike, eviscerate, rupture. 4 abilities for dps rotation. Rupture is a case by case basis thing though. So technically you could away with 3 button rotations.

Had I played Alliance, this plus Shadowmeld would have been my biggest draws to being a NE.

Not to mention, once you get your hands on the axe you plow through mobs so fast you're going to get that gold back much faster. People who farmed the elementals to "save up gold for their mount" actually ended up hurting their finances in the long run.

Thrash blade from mara quest shreds. I switched to fury once I got that and the grind to 60 was ezpz. Throw an enchant like fiery or crusader if you can afford it cause you’ll be using it for awhile! At 55 I would recommend starting to run a lot of BRD. Try to get HoJ and some good starting tank gear and of course good XP. You can tank dungeons no problem without being prot. I would definitely recommend starting raiding as DPS or off-tank that does the ads on bosses instead of trying to start as main tank.

I literally leveled to 60 enh frontloading spells. Please tell me how you get around drinking after every 2 mobs, oh sir genius of leveling. After 40 it slows down A LOT compared to Warrior or even Pally.

The real damage for hunters is weaving an aimed shot in between 2 auto shots. The closer to 3 seconds (pref over 3) the better. The fast bows are a waste of ammo and make it so you lose a lot of autoshot damage by the aimed shot eating your next auto shot.

Definitely some worthy items of using if you run into the mask from ZF and possible some darkweave armor. 
---
As I leveled my priest I had at least 5 shadow damage items, and a few that didn’t give any other stats.. 
---
when you get around 50 it’s a noticeable difference since your mana pool is really small and not much spirit to regen from. I haven’t came across any numbers with people comparing the two, but if you end up getting armor pieces like devout then i would def pick those expecially if your on a PvP server. 
---
The shadow dmg helps most when your bursting/ farming elites that can do heavy dps.
---
You would use both - HS is off the GCD, so assuming you have a TON of rage (tanks should have basically infinite rage BWL and later) you can use them both nonstop
---
You got an id for those minerals young man?

I’m going to be cheap and just use the 2h mace from BRD with the armor, hit and crit. Then try for the one in Tribute Run when that’s released.

Even vendoring skins is a good way of making money. When you get to level 40+ then you can AH skins/ores/bars again as they hold some value.

Horde is it then. It’s not PvP so it’s not like it really matters.
---
It is fairly easy to heal and do light dps in dungeons. Just watch your mana pool and threat. I throw sw:pain on things and occasionally hit them with holy fire. Later in the game you will have to focus purely on dps or heals. Which ever you like....
---
Should have rolled need

Not true. The time that they're rude is when you don't ask questions and mess things up for a party. For being told to Google it, that's easier than spamming chat, which is annoying.

If you go with armoury or higher then the mobs are too high level compared to yours = takes longer to clear due to your low damage.

The best would be if you got to initiate the fight with your charge. And then if they blink you use intercept. But that is not always possible. You have to LOS them, if possible.

It's not, human extra threat is better than the extra dodge.
---
During Vanilla I healed as shadow just fine all the way up to 60 before switching to holy.
---
I'm currently 32 and shadow healing just fine.

PvE it's not terrible. One of the main issues is going oom (out of mana) so you fall off on longer fights.

But in PvP where fights tend to be over pretty quickly shadow does really well.

So first things first, get consecration if you want to tank. You can tank without it, but it isn't worth tanking without it. It gives you a ridiculous amount of AOE threat even without improved righteous fury and is amazing at getting threat on secondary targets. I like divine strength over divine intellect as you will still have to drink often and 10% more int doesn't stop you from drinking while extra strength gives more threat output and better blocks. Imp Seal of Righteousness is better for tanking but spiritual focus is very nice for PVP or open world PVE if you pull multiple mobs.
---
For the prot tree going by 5 point intervals. 5/5 Redoubt.
---
3/3 Precision (threat and all your DPS comes from auto attacking while soloing, the toughness is minimal damage reduction) then 2/2 Guardian's Favor if you have trigger happy mages/locks in your party or are on a PVP server, or if you trust your group to really not screw up much 2/5 toughness at this point.
---
3/3 Imp Righteous Fury, 1/1 into Kings, and 1/3 Shield spec.
---
Go for 3/3 Shield Spec then the last 3 points you can either get Guardians favor if you missed it before, put it into toughness, or Imp Hammer of Justice for PVP.
---
1/1 BoS 4/5 Reckoning.
---
Finish off 5/5 Reckoning, these last 4 points will be Guardians favor, finish off toughness, Imp hammer of Justice, or 1-h weapon spec depending on what you want to go for.
---
Finally, 1/1 Holy shield.
---
Finish off by dumping points into Ret for Deflection (parrying an attack not only is great for damage reduction, it also makes you swing quickly after the parry) or Illumination if you want to heal.
---

It's indeed not racist, but it doesn't have anything to do with ignorance or knowledge either. It's literally a joke and a funny comeback.
---
Guys this isn’t like clicking a button to enchant something and expect a tip... you didn’t lvl conjured food/water, you basically ask for a tip because you leveled a toon.... lolwut 
---
Next thing you’re gonna hear about is priests charging for fort buffs? Heals? 
---
You def on your bullshit.
---
Exactly.
---
One more to put next to the MethodJosh track
---
the only hard part about leveling paladin is staying awake haha. it's pretty hard to die as a paladin when you have decent gear, even when you pull two or three mobs by accident
---
Exactly
---
You should be farming Blackcrow or Carapace Spine Crossbow and running a 2/31/18 spec, reducing points in sure-footed and putting them into aspect of the hawk as your gear allows. Mask of the Unforgiven with the hit and crit is far better than Beaststalker.
---
Mara farming is deff the way to go!
---
I’ve seen those advertisement. Actually not a bad idea.
---
I drink every 5-7 mobs with shield and 1h with WF. You must not know how to level efficiently
---
I think that's fairly common, we do the same in Germany
---
It was a funny moment, why attack someone having fun with a game we all love?
---
I’m leveling a Mage right now and I’m curious how much Portals &amp; Food are at high levels?
---
&gt;All day I had been seeing groups for dungeons with stuff like no hunters, no cloth dps (no mage or warlock, really?)
---
I'm pretty sure this is less about meta and more about just not having loot roll competition for the items they want. You may just be overthinking this.
---
Wait for Samuel L. Jackson to distract them a bit further down the coast.
---
There's also a neat little program called always on top that will force any window to show over wow while it's in borderless fullscreen. I use that with BetterDoscord so I have a small discord window always visable in the top left while playing. Also works with chrome if you want a guide or twitch open.
---
I don’t pvp at all, but I still wouldn’t roll on a pve server
---
Just to clarify, it’s a medical patch on her neck.
---
Accurate
---
?
---
Completely agree...or just make Speed mean attack speed so it’s attacks per second - instead of 2.0 for 1 swing every 2 seconds you’d have 0.5 for 0.5 attacks per second. Multiply your dmg by attack speed and get dps, pretty straightforward.
---
Can someone plz go back to 2005 and let Blizz know?
---
That winky face is WILDLY suggestive. I’d be happy to commission a piece actually. Do you have any other means of contact besides Facebook? I haven’t been on since high school.
---
I have had mostly positive experiences on incendius horde.
---
It was to give you an idea of how often you actually miss, the minor increase in spell damage doesn't make up for it.
---
Thank you! I knew how to do it on Chrome but couldn't figure it out for Firefox
---
Ahh yes the gank squad has answered the /1 signal!!!
---
I mean stuff like runecloth ... Like everything.
---
Only kill mobs that are 36+ i dont believe it can drop off mobs below that. Other than that good luck. It's complete luck as its a world drop so not really an item you can try to farm. 
---
My best advice - grind to 60. Dont do quests. This will give you the highest chance of possibly getting it.
---
What level? I did that too @ lvl 34-38. Becomes a bit harder later on. I literally leveled to level 60 with a Shammy. Warriors do more DPS, and only have to eat, which can be gained via fishing not having to buy it. Warrior leveling is a lot easier than shammy leveling post lvl 40. I literally have leveled both to 60 since August. My warrior made it in almost 28 hours faster than my shaman, with half as many deaths. Please, go level a warrior to 60, after you hit 60 on your shaman and tell me which is faster.
---
what double standard?
---
HI! Haha
---
Instance reset is not working with logout tp? It worked last 5 min for me
---
Usually your raid groups will save you a debuff spot for you to throw a CoE for mages, or a CoS for Spriests I guess? Amplify curse tells you specifically which curses it amps, I think just CoA and curse of exhaustion. I can see you doing this on any priority target.
---
Recount has a threat meter (I think)
---
A lot of mad people in the comments, but I love shit like this. Stir the drama pot and don’t let the haters stop you from making interesting content.
---
Thanks man :)
---
It's very selfish to want to force other people to play a way they don't want to.
---
Wtf is your bartender lol
---
I loved the series. Didint read the final 3 books though
---
Looks like you playing on your I pad ?
---
"logout tp" ? What is that?
---
The way we'd do it on pservers is just using the instance reset command and then logging out, and when you logged back in, you'd be outside the instance portal. But this doesn't work in Classic, if you use the reset command while inside the instance, nothing happens.
---
Seems fine to me I don't think there are any rules about colluding with the other faction
---
Please tell us what the rules were based on the OP's post.
---
This is true and you’d be right if the sword wasn’t so much faster.
---
Now that I’ve got my mount, I’m using all my money to buy all the super cheap shit being put up on the AH. 
---
Hoping to make a lot of money reselling these 2 gold twink items
---
You may have a problem, I know AA doesn't sound fun but it may be your only hope here..
---
But you can only use slam in pure dps situations, ie raiding.  If you're being attacked its useless.  Not too mention you won't have enough rage to utilize slam until geared up at 60 anyways.  While leveling 2hnd fury speed doesnt matter, but you should probably stay arms till 50 anyways so you can get tact mastery for stance dancing.
---
I ignore those groups and just laugh at them.
---
Highkeylow69 thinks so
---
I kind of did too, tbqh.  Would have warranted an extra chuckle out of me.
---
I used 12345qezxcvb as my 1-0 keys.  Shift for situational, Ctrl for toggles, and Alt for consumables.  There are a few combos that don't work well, like alt 5, but I would only bind things like potions to that for example, where your effectiveness doesn't depend on timeliness or accuracy.
---
I moved my micro bar hotkeys to F1-F8, so inventory is F2, map is F5, etc.
---
Westfall?
---
Aktshually, arcane explosion is more DPS. Nova &gt; flamestrike &gt; coc &gt; AE. Now the next mage’s turn.
---
There's no way in hell you would ever cast slam while leveling lol
---
this is on a PS right?
---
The joke is even lazier than people paying for leveling and gold services.
---
You must be really fun at parties
---
Oh, yeah.
---
Maybe you should.
---
I get killed by horde skulls almost daily trying to fish schools.
---
If hes doing pretty much nothing but impeding your farm - yes it can be reported. I would mention it to him before actually reporting it though. Sometimes letting someone know they can lose game time will change the behavior. They fixed this issue with Sheeping but forgot banish i guess haha.
---
Before endgame raids, Warrior is tank regardless of spec or build. Have fun tanking as a warrior however you like - whether it's fury, arms, prot, or a Frankensteinian combination you threw together because how you want. You're still tank, though. You can just be a tank with great DPS.
---
If you're going to be a warrior, it's because you want to be on the front line, which means you WILL be tanking. Riflemen and Archers are Hunters, not Warriors, and Skirmishers and Flankers are Rogues, not Warriors. Want to be a Non-Tanking DPS? There are 7 other classes you can roll instead.
---
I always have a VPN on. I think they only suspend your account if you log into another part of the world so just don't VPN to another country.
---
Ya... I just did 1-56 on my alt warrior, before deciding not to swap mains, and it was not hard to tank anything 1-50 or so at all. 
---
BRD was a bit harder cause my gear was a bit behind, but honestly not bad.
---
You will never have enough rage to use slam when levelling.
---
Let me guess, dumbass warrior?
---
They could just go to Ungoro if they really wanted to make their time worth while
---
At least liberals can make 4 posts on this sub without having it removed 4 times for the 4 same mistakes.
---
type   about:config   into the address bar hit enter then hit accept the risks on the page that comes.
---
I mean, you should probably be using stance dancing macros anyways. Stuff like defensive taunt, defensive pummel, battle charge, berserker intercept, etc.
---
He could sure. Can still entangle the hunter and stand in his dead zone while killing the pet. He won’t die with his HoTs and barkskin up. Not to mention he didn’t use innervate until he was dead.
---
Holy shit I had no idea a PIP could be attached to a game display. That's so cool! Thank you so much!
---
You say that now. Lol
---
You already seem set on 2H fury. You should do that. I greatly prefer MS with WW axe. Sweeping strikes, +5% crit, MS instant attack.... If my white swing and MS both crit on charge I chop off 60% HP on something my level
---
This is exactly what I did. I spent all of level 39 farming gorillas in STV and skinning them and collecting the coarse gorilla hair (I think that’s what it was) which vendors for like 80s a stack. Just vendor all the leather and gorilla hair and any greens that drop and you’re good to go.
---
work work
---
My MacBook Pro already heats up and runs thru battery like a mofo when I play WoW if I did all this my shit would explode. 
---
Thankfully I have iPads and Xbox’s lmao
---
Nope, but classic wow is a solved problem. Feral dps when played at an equal skill to the other dps classes is poor. This isn't new information.
---
Pretty common. 5v1 against alliance.
---
Also slam would be better with the axe as well...right?
---
Sword spec extra attack is actually an attack swing reset.  So you have to time your attacks right after a swing connects to make sure you aren't "wasting"the proc on just speeding up a swing if you instant attack right before a white hit would land anyways.  So while sword spec is really good, especially considering adding in wind fury, it also plays differently than just having axe to fish for more deep wounds procs.
---
Yes and if using the Bagnon add-on, make sure the bag is displayed as they can be switched off.
---
meet
---
A lot of guides had boar, raptor, turtle etc. But this guide was just fish fish fish! Some of which were cheaper than 30 copper
---
yep
---
The best main hand around 40 is actually the hammer from Cath. Got it on my rogue and it slays.
---
A feral powershifting can keep up. Thats what people dont get.
---
 Edit: you people saying this must not have seen the recent dps charts. Classic isnt private servers, which you people seem to think it is.
---
It doesn't. No.
---
You probably will if you keep them on a bank alt until bgs launch.
---
If you got 2 pieces and he got 0 is that really fair?
---
Does this make you wrong?  Are you an asshole?  Should do something different next time?  
---
No one can really answer that but you.  Though people who share are generally looked at better in the community.  It isn't wrong, but also it doesn't need to be wrong for you to opt not to do it.  Just think about the tank next time you need a group, he'd probably rather run a dungeon with the bro that passed on the chestpiece for him, then the guy that needs all the loot for all the specs.
---
Obviously YMMV, but keep in mind everytime time you take more someone else gets less.
---
“hey its me ur old frien”
---
you think you do, but you do
---
How are the auction house price fluctuations for you all? I find that prices seem to go down on the weekend. Which makes sense to me because most people have more free time to play the game and farm mats! Say for example on the weekdays i find that essence of air goes for 10g +. And before i logged last night it was at 6.75. I feel like i should be taking advantage of these lower prices and reselling. What have you all had luck with buying low and selling high? Peace!
---
It's the hardest time lvling as a mage the first lvl you gain a new water
---
Conjured x2 water
---
Sit
---
Trade
---
Repeat
---
Don't play innocent, you guys are just as bad
---
I don’t know why subreddits have so many damn rules and bots. Aren’t the votes supposed to decide what people want to see?
---
They're still damn good tanks even in "DPS" spec.
---
In fact, DPS isn't even a specialization from what i've seen. Groups are "Tank, healer, and Bums Along For The Ride" because they sure as hell aren't caring about actually doing meaningful damage.
---
Mainly used on bosses. You mostly use shadow if you have more locks and shadow priests. Elements for mages and shamans(?). Agony is mostly used on tougher mobs who take more time to die or PvP
---
I'm right there with ya bro I have no idea what's going on here at all.
---
I was going to say this.
---
Yeah, THAT works. Resetting and teleporting back to the entrance on your own, doesn't work.
---
What do you mean
---
The first spell I cast got resisted then I died to my second mob because of lag... It was not great
---
Yes. you will miss out on set bonuses though.
---
Just understanding aggro mechanics. Try to attack the same thing everyone else is attacking. If a green/blue item drops, only roll need if you need the item. 
---
If you're not the tank, try to stay behind the tank so you dont pull anything extra.
---
You’d want the slowest, hardest hitting option for either spec. The axe would be best.
---
gives enough time for autoloot to finish by having the emote
---
I feel the opposite.  Tons of people demonstrated to me at level 20 that they were not the type of player I wanted to run with.
---
This kind of shit is where those relationships are forged.  The real truth is by level 25 no one cares about the loot here.  So ask yourself which matters more a tank on your friends list or offspec gear you're gonna replace with quest trash 45 minutes from now.
---
Firemaw
---
He gave Quin the gloves and gave 100g to each of his group members.
---
Druids are the masters of running away, when it comes to taking down a single mob, if the druid is kiting properly, only hunter is better.
---
It's actually fine on alliance.
---
On horde you get outlaw sabre and the first blue quest dagger is from ST hakkar quest.
---
On alliance, there's no blue sword quest reward until SM, which also has a great dagger reward, which can carry you to life force dirk.
---
What matters is the max dmg of the weapon, which usually tends to be the slower weapons. In this case 154 vs 124. Hit chance shouldnt be a concern since your goal is to fight mobs lower level than you.
---
Mods prob never played as a warr
---
Careful not to hit this on a site with a video ad hahaha
---
Is this an add-on that tells you how long each flight will be? Should I just google inflight?
---
Abuser? Please clarify.
---
Oh I've seen them. They are below hunters and above shadowpriests.
---
Jesus Murphy, boys. Rag's up to something fucky.
---
You should really study some humor jokes and stuff
---
That's a high-DPS Tank, not a "Can only DPS" class.
---
I have no idea how Locks can dungeon tank but I think what you described is just for solo “tanking.” For dungeon tanking you use a lot of threat generating moves like searing burn and hellfire.  And probably some other stuff.
---
Nice advertisement OP.
---
I always say this joke on discord when I see a mine.
---
Do YoU MinE iF I MiNE? 😛
---
Better than hearing "turrent" in Overwatch instead of "turret".
---
its actually worse on my server. Typically horde gank squads only show up after alliance camps peoples corpses
---
Are you saying that skarm just out gears content when he talks about feral tanks? One of the points he makes is that a druid is easier to gear as less competition and they don't need as much gear. 
---
The uncrushable and crit immune is overstated a bit, warriors sacrifice a lot of threat to be that defensive and later in the game when bosses are doing more damage warriors are gearing more for threat anyway (because DPS gets so high warriors need threat more than anything to be able to hold aggro). As soon as you have enough mitigation to not get one shot warriors gear for threat and can even consider duel wield tanking just for the threat.
---
I love warrior but it seems like a lot of warriors want to be the only class that can tank when druids are defined a perfect alternative for most fights. Feral has a bad name because until patch, I believe 1.12, dire bear do gave terrible armour contributions, so they generally were awful. Prot paladin is a meme for raiding though.
---
Honestly the drop rate is not so good and you're probably going to have to eat after every 1-2mobs so I would consider buying them from the AH if the price is somewhat decent!
---
I always forget ads exist I haven't seen them in so long. Painful going on other people's computers and sitting through ads just to see youtube.
---
When did this happen?
---
"Hunter is an immersive class"
---
Bit weird, innit.
---
It depends on your server economy.
---
Just whisper the healer to not heal that dps, and let them have aggro. After a few deaths, they'll either learn or bail. If they bail, easy enough to replace them. If they learn, they are now a better, more respectful dps.
---
Is classic still worth getting into? I was a little skeptical of it when it came out,. but I see now that everyone's been having a blast. Did I really miss the boat or will I have people to party with and do dgs 19-60?
---
I’m on Netherwind and have had nothing but good interactions. Might be because it was a server that was added later so people are just going to be more relaxed by nature because nobody that was going for world firsts would be around.
---
What are the lower pop servers currently?
---
WhatsApp, Instagram, email ;p whatever you like. I mean - if you want something else than Ragnaros we need way to send you pictures. If you want this one, it is enough to contact us here, direct message.
---
I get it, i've deleted my FB after school ;p but now, when i am selling glass it is amazing tool ;)
---
Do you need to be 60? I’m 58 and would love to solo for Barman Shanker
---
slam is 15 rage and doesnt eat auto attack. what are you talking about never having rage to use slam?
---
All of Sweden play on Gehennas H
---
Sure. Why not ? I dont want to play that way. They don't want to play my way. What's it hurt?
---
Otoh a lot of people are picking tribal to make devilsaur gear, adding lots of competition on the things he can craft.
---
That's just your server then
---
Need more addons
---
Edgies are 800g on Herod and will eventually go to closer to 2k.
---
i am seeing devilsaur recipes to learn for over 35 gold on heartseeker. is that a good or bad price?
---
That was really awesome man, makes me want to level a Druid!
---
Are you aware, that people are allowed to make ignorant jokes to make others laugh without actually hating others? Its a foreign concept im sure, seeing as you sound like a product of homeschooling.
---
World isn't supposed to be lfg channel either but it is.
---
It doesn’t, axe is still much better. 
---
Sword spec in general is waay better though, but if you go WW sword you’re insane. The other guy just made a long comment disputing the other dudes point about axe crit being better than the double hit chance
---
I still see plenty of people running all levels of dungeons every day.  I started about 3 weeks ago and don't feel like I've missed anything.  I'm on Benediction/Alliance so it might be different on Herod or Faerlina which were popular at release.
---
How much gold/hr does this make
---
Jesus Christ
---
Also, follow up, does anyone know what are good leveling recipes to learn or train once you reach 40 for mail?
---
I do as a combat rogue, rotation is unbelievably simple. I’m usually the top dps, not out of skill, I’m not bragging I think it’s just the class balance and I have better gear then most.
---
RIP to the other 2 locks that got the mojo mask stolen from them.
---
literally would be me.
---
Yes, the addon name is exactl InFlight ;)
---
Yeah. You’re the POS for taking something someone was clearly interested in using. POS.
---
See, I'm fine doing that stuff. First off, Nightfall looks badass and is one of my all time favorite weapon designs.   
---
Second? I like to be useful. I mean, in BGs I'm the guy focusing on objectives - not trying to rack up KBs. Support/utility may not be the most glamorous job, but it's a needed one. And it's one that usually earns a lot of respect and compliments, too! :D
---
Dang... wish I was there for the spectacle. But I am at work so I didn't get to see the shenanigans lol.
---
POS.
---
This did not age well lul :)
---
I'd say combo of duskwood and wetlands.
---
POS
---
It is best trinket for basically every melee for a long time.
---
get used to standing on a trap as you grind, and good luck
---
The ancient bone bow is much better. For one, the slower the weapon speed the higher your damage is and aimed shots will be. Also what the other guy said, the fast bow eats your auto shots. As far as Beast Stalker's Helm just go for mask of the unforgiven. %2 hit and 1% crit, good stuff
---
That has nothing to do with it lol. The only time you ever cast slam is if you have an excess of rage after using BT/WW on CD, which you 100% will not lol
---
Is this bis? That’s a large commitment for a item if it gets replaced soon!? Just curious my lock is leveling so I’m interested.
---
I'm in this comment and I don't like it
---
You spelled pornhub wrong
---
This. Every other streamer/wow celebrity has said a ton of times that asmon is a good dude or very chill which is nothing like how he is on stream.
---
     Asmongold the wow streamer is a character, and people cant get over that idea.
---
You're an idiot lol
---
I never even realized that until you said it, but  I do hear that a lot. Must just be an accent thing.
---
I called out someone on ninja looting in a similar situation yesterday... reddit was not pleased.
---
I ended up selling mine for 150g. Had it up for a week around 200-300
---
It's classic. Look at the clock under minimap.
---
&gt; slam is 15 rage and doesnt eat auto attack.
---
Slam resets your swing timer lol, and it has lower priority than BT and WW, meaning you will literally never cast it.
---
Pedobear has entered the chat
---
Huh? Felcloth is impossible to farm for over 1 hour without disruption on a PvP server. Unless you're in a group or low pop server I guess.
---
How cloth weapons work?
---
Isn't the damage that shows on my staff just for hits?
---
I started a mage but realised this as well and then started a warrior alt.
---
As long as we all agree that the 'ch' is pronounced as a hard 'k,' these seem to be reasonable pronunciations
---
How can I tell if I'm good enough to tank Deadmines? 
---
I'm Level 21 and I've not played a Warrior before. I'm not sure how decent I am because I play with a group of 3 DPS usually (never a healer) -  one great Rogue, and 2 ditzy Mages. 
---
Should I just go for it, or is there a way I can figure out if I'll do okay? I don't want to waste people's time if I suck
---
You'd be absolutely shocked how often the sound and the video don't actually align in documentaries.
---
Northrend in game is much smaller than Kalimdor or the Eastern Kingdoms, though. Isn't it supposed to be smaller than either of those by at least a factor of two or three?
---
I only use Thorium during boss fights in MC, even though it’s not really necessary
---
Rogue used to be my main and your concerns are valid. In vanilla at endgame I'd spend all night being unable to get a dungeon group while a healer friend of mine wasn't even 60 yet and getting invited to UBRS all day. I was level 60 from when he first started the game and he was able to complete his 8-piece dungeon set before me.
---
Nowadays it seems Rogue is less overcrowded in classic, however now they have a new problem. All the BiS DPS guides for like Warrior and Hunters will reference leather and one-handed weapons that Rogues, who have no option to use anything else, would otherwise be using. Back in the vanilla these metas weren't as well known/defined.
---
So competition for Rogue loot is certainly higher as every non-caster DPS will be rolling on your only available upgrade, this is becoming a problem for even organized raid guilds right now. I ended up re-rolling a healer and found I actually enjoyed that role more than DPS anyway.
---
That "name" translates to "Fuck You", so not even ignorant. Dude's way too white to be a native speaker.
---
You should let Nintendo know that they pronounce one of their Smash Bros titles wrong
---
I was running BRD with a guildie because they wanted a specific drop. We were having a hard time rounding out the group so we pug'd a dps. As we get to the boss with the drop hes talking about putting ML on because he doesn't trust the random - guildie wanted +healing item and pug was caster dps. Talked him out of it and he got the drop within a few runs.  
---
Even with good intentions it just comes across as scummy and makes you and your guild look bad.
---
Which is about 20g an hour.
---
Warriors are one of if not not the highest dps classes though. Did apes do their speed runs with over 20 fury warriors
---
But as a raid leader I’m not taking a shit ton of warriors either lol
---
&gt;Pre BRD it literally is.
---
Yeah man you LITERALLY just equip a shield - then you're the alpha chad tank no sweat.  Just do the same thing you do as a dps player just put a shield on that's the only difference.
---
LMAO “all need” is clear enough in context. You just wish it wasn’t for some reason?
---
How the heck are people pronouncing cabinet?
---
That is nice! Will have to try it out
---
Show her how it can appeal to her.
---
My GF is very non-confrontational. If I had described PvP and raids she would never had played.
---
Instead, I explained and showed her crafting, questing, exploring, transmogs, guilds and the community. She loves the game now. 
---
Be prepared for her to not like it, it's not for everyone and that is okay.
---
With Blizzcon in less than a month, I’d expect some news on what will happen with the future of classic.
---
Dude don’t even worry. I’ve healed all the way to UStrat as a shadow priest. All you need is healing gear which isn’t hard to get if you’re healing the dungeons.
---
I have an add on that makes every skill like that (overpower, revenge, execute) glow when they’re available, and I just put overpower on my action bar, even if I’m not in battle stance so I know when I can use it. Not sure what the add on is called but it’s a pretty popular one
---
"Stance Dancing" is easier than it sounds - you can just macro any stance-dependent abilities to their stances.
---
/cast Charge
---
/equip Sword
---
/equip Board
---
/cast Shield Slam
---
I want them to give us the option to copy our classic character over to a new xpac.  I'd hate to put a lot of work into gearing a 60 for pvp and then dropping it :)
---
Then you ban memes or make some explicit rules regarding what memes are allowed.
---
I tank all the dungeons as pure dps fury raid spec. It’s really no problem. I have a tanking set of gear in my bags at all times. I usually just dual wield tank to help with threat. Just make sure you keybind marking stuff as skull because it’s hard to keep aggro on multiple targets when your dps splits. Just get comfortable with swapping to battle stance for mocking blow. If I have a really big damage warlock in the group I’m basically just rotating taunt and mocking blow the whole time, but it’s fine.
---
The reason warriors don't have to worry about mitigation and can focus on threat is because even with no defensive stats on gear, they are still uncrittable/uncrushable on a boss with shield block. And in Skarm's video's he mentioned that even when dual wield tanking, he has a macro to swap his shield back on and shield block if he suddenly gets hit real hard.
---
Also, dual-wield tanking is not going to be as good as it was on private servers, because the boss parry chance on private servers was 5%, while here in classic its 14%. If you don't think that's much of a difference, then you've never tanked a boss that hit worth a damn. 
---
Druids do have a few advantages that shouldn't be left unstated, though. They do generate more threat than a deep prot warrior. However, a fury/prot warrior, once he meets certain stat levels from gear, will out threat a druid, even without dual wielding. And he'll take less damage while doing it. Druids also benefit from having a decent armor advantage, which does help mitigate the crushing/crit blow problem, but warriors still take less damage with shield block. Finally, druids do have an easier time gearing up, because pretty much nobody wants druid tanking gear except druid tanks.
---
Are druids viable tanks? For some bosses and for trash, yes. There are even some fights where you might prefer a druid. But there are a lot more fights where a warrior is going to be straight up superior, and there are no fights that a warrior cannot tank.
---
Also, the pools all over STV and in Booty Bay have lots of chests with crafting mats that sell very well.
---
The shortage is the reason I levelled in prot/heal spec as a pally. You can imagine that finding groups was not hard, heh. Now at 60 I've gone healing but I do try and collect some tanking bits when possible.
---
I'm sorry you feel like you're entitled to take advantage of someone.
---
Same with me. Everytime i got ganked it was 2+ alliances out of nowhere. Other night 2 lvl 60 + 3 40 ganked me and my friend while questing out of nowhere. 
---
Each factions does this with one another so there is nothing to complaing about.
---
Item wise Dragons would be best, as that's the mail spec and has some BiS items. Of course tribal has the devilsaur set.
---
Remember all these items are BoE, so you're not really missing out of anything.
---
What it comes down to is, are you alone or do you have friends or guild mates who have some specialisation?
---
If you have a tribal leather worker you trust, go dragon and ask your friend to do the crafting for you.
---
You can look under his helmet, he in fact has black short hair and no facial hair.
---
No new raids in p2
---
Lol why would some downvote this?  What a dbag
---
Battle shout generates the same threat regardless if the buff is already present or not. All that matters is how many targets it hits (friendly targets) and how many mobs it has to spread the threat out among.
---
Honestly i got lucky. I went to work one day after she had watched me play to level 40 (retail vanilla) which took me months back then. She called my direct line and this is pretty close to the actual convesation
---
Her- Baby do you care if I play your game?
---
Me- Yea i dont care, you can play games if you want
---
Her- Can i get your password
---
Me- Wait... what?? What game are you trying to play???
---
Her- \~very long pause\~ Its ok if i cant
---
Me- WHAT GAME ARE YOU TRYING TO PLAY??
---
Her- WoW
---
Me- \~gave password\~
---
there surely just be, but I'll leave it to the professionals.
---
Lucky guy I have tried my wife won’t try video games other then some x box games with me.
---
While technically correct if by any city you mean tb, UC, and org.  The 3 ports are nice but they're not super cheap either.
---
In other circumstances, maybe. The cave and indeed every mob in a square kilometer around him are elite. He would not have made it, especially considering his health was dropped to 30% by 2 hits of the elite mobs immediately after he got the egg.
---
He was fucked, theres no other way to dance around this.
---
Aye, that you do. I typically am first on the damage meters, as the tank. As I get to harder content, the margin is slimming, however, because I can't 2-hand tank as much, but it still is nice.
---
might check the version of ff you're using
---
What shield is best to go for after the Aegis of the Scarlet Commander?
---
I swapped from fury to arms at 34 and I definitely feel weaker damage wise but the ability to swap stances and keep rage is just too good for a pvp server. Instant disarms, whirlwinds, overpowers. Not having to sit there and wait. It feels good
---
Lol soon after you had to buy a 2nd pc
---
I'd say humans and orangutans have pretty decent swimming instinct.
---
 is it really that hard to just use those abilities as needed? i feel like the macro ignores the fact that you might not yet have enough rage. 
---
nevertheless thanks for boiling down the video to the only relevant part.
---
Nobody really knows yet; we don't know exactly how many greys/herbs/greens/etc are going to drop from the lashers.
---
I'm giving about as good as I'm getting, but if you have further complaints, here's what you can do: write it down on a piece of paper... and then take that piece of paper with you when you piss off.
---
It's heaven. Currently I have 300 classic wowhead windows with searches on items and quests. Mostly watch Netflix though. Having chats/discord and tons of other stuff there too.
---
Have you met girls?
---
for 3 i think you're talking about atlas loot
---
I feel bad. My guild invited me at level 57 to do UBRS knowing i would have to be carried due to avg mob level being 61. Jed was there and dropped the trinket and i won it. I am sure some of my guildies are salty but i was told to roll since it is my BiS

That is why blizzard has a grief report mechanic. Lol yeah bend to my will blizzard.
---
Honestly, it boils down to, I don't want to have to be re-specing every other day, and keeping track of an extra set of gear in my bags.
---
re-spec'ing is just too damn expensive.
---
I don't.  It would just last you slightly longer before you replace.  Either way it's too weak an item to see any real value from the ench.  Fiery on the butcher would see you from 26 to getting the thrash blade, and it's boe so far easier to obtain
---
THANKS
---
Shadow better DMG.  Discipline walking fucking tank
---
I had a clicker ret pala guildie in cata, he was doing just fine too. Used keyboard only for movement.
---
What kind of gear are you rocking? This is pretty sick.
---
GY/Lib. Arm boss is lvl 40, so you wouldn't be much help there. :)
---
I know 6 people who game on pc. None of them have more than 1 monitor.

Another vote for Gandling. Pretty busy, can get full of an evening, but decent amount of action and some good Guilds
---
Poor little guy :( \*cuddles\*
---
Got it. Yeah, I'm playing night elf, so I think I'm just gonna have to deal with it. Thank you though
---
Before...what would make you think otherwise?
---
Atlas loot doesnt work on classic afaik
---
Prob no one since this is an awful post
---
I like a lot of what you wrote here, so I'm going to limit my post to one small point I disagree on. I just want you to know that there's a lot of good here, and to take this minor criticism in that context:
---
I'm lvl 53 right now (warrior) and I still tank some things with a 2-hander. It all depends on the healer, his spec, and his gear. For example, when I have a shadow priest healing, I mostly stick to swordnboard outside the initial whirlwind after charging. But when a holy priest is healing me, I can stick almost entirely to 2-handed tanking, because their mana holds up so well. 
---
Oh, and the dps I add definitely does matter. I regularly do 45-60% of the group's dps (depending of my dps are good or tards) as a 2-handed tank. If I strictly swordnboard, that drops to 20%. That's significant. And the healer can still drink while I'm going to the next group to pull.
---
That's it. You're overall point is correct, there comes a time when 2-handed tanking is not really practical anymore, there's just situations that still allow it.
---
1) i use threat plates and disable threat to only show in dungeons
---
2) wow-pro guides is what i was using on twitch, there's a few others too like tourguide, guideline, and azeroth autopilot
---
3) atlasloot to look at boss loot tables, allthethings to see a tooltip showing where items dropped from
---
Yes. As Alliance I’ve been pleased to see plenty of Horde being owned in STV
---
Thinj about that... how many people had i0h9nes to make a shitty video like this 15 years ago?
---
How recently did you update it?  I know they had some errors as to what an item disenchanted into and have been putting the corrections into the most recent releases.
---
I healed a couple of resto druids through strat and scholo. Not much issues there. So talents shouldn't be an issue. Equipment space however i can sympathize :)

👎

&gt;sign up for
---
There it is!  We found the retail baby.  You don’t “sign up for” a role in Classic.  You’re going to be expected to perform the roles your class is best capable of when the group requires it.
---
I'm more concerned about someone in your party reserving items
---
Tanking shortage flopped around for me late game, as a healer. A lot of people who could heal in the &lt;40 without respec or any particular gear changes didn't put the effort in or decided they don't like it.
---
I did end up making a druid to tank with when I was discouraged in the 30s, but made it to about L20 before I realized that I wanted to play it casually but tanking is anything but due to time to find groups + length of runs.
---
I wouldn't give a shit what other people think mate, tell them to do one and play how you like
---
Yeah and while i was farming there were some annoying harpies in TN cave that like have aoe silence you cant stop for 7-8 seconds.Slows me down alot and big problem when more of them spawn.Meanwhile they are best to grind for warriors/rogues.
---
Different mobs suit different classes
---
What talent build did you go with in order to do this? I'm 46 right now with 31/5/0, I'm debating if I need to put into prot or just spec the rest into fury until raid time
---
I got one of those mouses with a numpad (plus + and - keys) under the thumb. Changed my life wrt keybinds in games, I can do nearly everything I want without even touching the keyboard. I do 1-6 for main actions since they are right under my thumb by default, plus Shift as a toggle if I need more. Then I do 7-12 for less common things like buffs/dispells/conjuring food/hearthstone because I have to reach down slightly for them.
---
Actually blizzard changed full to mean “the server is full and there will be a queue” but they scuffed it up and it hasn’t been updating properly in the last week or so.
---
They actually changed what all the realm population indicators mean just recently for Classic
---
So 90% of players running pug UBRS? Lol
---
BIS is always need from what I know
---
Get the shadoweave mask (and full gear) around that level, they should be cheap to make. The shadoweave mask is even better than this mask. Both look good.
---
1 is Plater, i think?  i use that and it does what you describe
---
You can find my name on EJ forum thread headers if you care.  Shield Slam is shit, and is a bonus, not required.  
---
Or were you one of the neglected wana be dps warriors that was told to off tank all the time, and you have delusions of grandeur?
---
Why do you feel entitled to get it? He can sell this and buy a BoE for for himself. Did he ask you to greed on it?
---
Threat meters also only work if everyone uses them. And would only show one target at a time. I thought healbot aggro showed even if not everyone was running it, just have to wait until they get hit, but I could be wrong.
---
This is in essence a cry for help post from you lol.
---
Talk shit but make a post about not crying but then explain that you have it worse.
---
I tank Strat/Scholo/LBRS/UBRS all in fury DPS spec which is my raiding spec. I just equip a shield and tank. 
---
Warriors especially who can tank are very highly valued. As soon as I log on I have people messaging me asking if I can tank a dungeon for them. I started tanking BRD when I was LVL 52 and the DPS and healers were all level 60. Ofcourse they pulled threat from me but nobody complained.
---
Is it a ninja if he won the roll fair and square?
---
As a frost mage if a freezing band dropped while I was in a group I would NEVER expect it to go straight to me without everyone else getting a fair chance at it. That's how pricey items work homie.
---
They?
---
yeah the 3 of us needed it and he needed it too and won the roll... a fucking priest
---
nope, you are wrong. horde warriors don't slam, they spam hamstring. slam is only used by alliance warriors that get their hands on a bre or something.
---
Can someone explain why this is bad? :(
---
Man, that really reminds me of what it was like when my SO first got me into WoW back in Wrath. I hadn’t really played a lot of games before that point, and I definitely remember struggling with things like looking around with the camera or positioning myself correctly with respect to mobs in order to actually hit them.  Also, I’d played a game before that used WASD for movement so I knew about that, but I didn’t know I could strafe, so one of the first things I did was to bind over the E key lol.  My SO didn’t discover I’d done this for a long time and by then I was very used to that keybind and also very used to moving around without strafe, so it took a loooong time to fix that haha.
---
Thank you!  
---
Mostly tier pieces and SP/healing gear with a lot of stam and intellect on it.  
---
If you're interested in a more detailed breakdown I'm working on a new video that will explain my talents/gear/matchups etc. so stay tuned!
---
Good luck! Been trying to get mine to try for years. Just want someone to play with 😒
---
I'll grant that the early raids are pretty easy, but from what I recall (15 years mind you), AQ40 was quite a challenge, and Naxx was no joke at all with only a very small portion (like 1.5%) of raiding guilds managing to clear it before BC came out.
---
Thank you! Always wondered how to do this reliably.
---
Whenever i aggro i drain tank if i cant get away.Works well vs single mobs ,only bosses at higher ends would kill you fast through that tanking +heals.Locks also have way more stamina than mages ussualy
---
The rules have always been, and should always be, you roll on loot specific to the role you’re filling in that run.  Did you come as a healer? You’re rolling on healer loot.  Now that said if you were to ASK to roll on rank loot that’s different of course.  But if everything is left unspoken you roll for your role.
---
&gt; found the retail baby
---
Nice try - Vanilla warrior from 2005 here.  I'm not even playing a warrior right now (yet), just hosting a controversial discussion.  The true irony is that I love to tank and plan on tanking when I do level my warrior - shhh don't tell anybody.
---
I'm very interested, do you have a write up instead of video by chance?
---
Tanking sucks with pugs everybody starts to aoe at pull had a hunter pull with multi shot its not fun at all thats why you cant find one.if you can avoid pugs then you'll be fine.
---
That mask beats shadoweave.
---
Might just be me... but what signifies the difference there...
---
Don't lose sleep over it, fuck that guy, wow is a community game, if he ends up with a shitty reputation over it, nobody to blame but himself
---
talents ARE an issue.  If I do something, I do it right!  I am not a tank, unless, I'm a tank.  And that means, being properly spec'd for it.  Do you honestly believe a resto spec'd tank, can be MT in Raids?
---
I hope i never go back to being a pleeb
---
Oh no, the poor victim at the top of the dogpile.
---
If you don't like it, then take my advice.
---
Or your own guild if bads.   Either way I don’t have to deal with you.
---
what are you talking about, battleshout works perfectly fine and is a great tool for aoe threat.
---
Hitting a bit of a wall. Currently 48 and not sure where I should be questing anymore. Hinterlands I’ve all but cleared out of quests, and I don’t see any more Searing Gorge quests at the moment. Everything I’ve heard says Un’Goro isn’t feasible until 50ish. It’s been annoying trying to find ZF groups. Any advice?
---
Not a chance is that true.  No warrior who played in vanilla and likes to tank would ever “host” this discussion.
---
Pretty funny, but there are several better examples of talent trees that are useless at end game than feral.
---
PvP since I’m new. I’m open to try RP as I have never done that on any game. It seems a bit odd though.
---
Nope
---
The infinite dragonflight did it.
---
That's kinda funny, I'm leveling the same exact way. I went 11 points into assassination for remorseless and the free energy / combo points then went to subtlety for the increased ambush damage, stealth speed / cd and increased ambush crit chance.
---
Same thing as you said, I'm level 31, ambush crit for 450-550, sinister strike for 2 CP and eviscerate for the kill. I'll kill 4-5 mobs in a row before having to stop for food / bandage. Average kill is about 5 seconds.
---
PvP is absolutely disgusting - most horde just panic after I ambush them for 50-70% of their health.
---
I'm able to kill level 36s (4 levels up) and sometimes I'll 1 shot green mobs. I'm trying to grind out gnomer to get the high damage dagger.
---
I have professions in engineering for the stun on the hand Grenades so that casters have to go through my gouge, kick, and bombs to cast.
---
&gt; Yet you still responded out of anger
---
I'm not actually that angry, but if you idiots want to leave obnoxious messages, I'll respond in kind.
---
full doesnt mean it is queue but it is rly close to queue. few minutes oater you probably sit in queue for few minutes
---
Especially those damn skeletons. You had to find a single spawn then stay on it and group with everyone around you. It was crazy haha
---
Unless you are running with friends/guild members I consider BoE drops fair game to everyone.
---
Is there a way to do this but for twitch?
---
stockades stuff would be cool as fuck in this style i think
---
is your guys' attention span to small that you have to simultaneously be watching some form of entertainment while gaming?
---
As somebody who hit 60 for the first time and keep seeing this phrase, I disagree. I hit 60 and started raiding and I think this game is extremely boring now
---
There're EU servers for a reason.
---
It's an epic BoE. Those are always all need...
---
Pagle seems fun.  I'm on Alliance, few of my friends are on Horde.  I'm prepared to slaughter them if you have any desire in aiding in that endeavor.  Or join them, either or is fine.
---
Server seems pretty busy.
---
1. Elvui has this or probably any other nameplates addon
---
2. Questie for the icons, GuideLime + a guide specific to your faction and/or race for an optimized path
---
3. AtlasLoot (recommend the Atlas maps one as well to add maps)
---
this! thundercrap should only be used on bosses for the debuff or as a quick ragedump
---
Distract at 22 was a game changer
---
I appreciate all the input. Today is the day. I am choosing a server as we speak. Yesterday I got caught all up in irl BS.
---
See if she has a power fantasy.  Sneaking around the enemy.  Healing or protecting allies.  Wanting a pet, etc.  Sometimes the social aspect or the big world appeals.
---
It doesnt though.  Your stealth is stronger and you move faster, so it's easy to move to mobs and set up.  You're talking about fractions of a second, not "much longer".
---
How do you farm/save gold as a Holy priest?
---
I dinged to level 60 around a week ago and since then, I haven't been able to save/make any significant amount of gold compared to while I was leveling.
---
I'm guessing that buying raid consumables might've been the biggest factor but even then, I just can't seem to save gold at all. I'm 250g away from buying the epic mount and I just want to buy this and get it done ASAP, so that I can focus on other stuff such as buying raid consumables, professions etc.
---
Do I just spam dungeons? I can't even quest or farm solo thanks to my holy spec. 
---
FYI, my professions are 300 herb and 200 tailoring.
---
I duel level 30+'s... made this twink to compete with other twinks. You are so mad because you cant participate in the fun I guess.
---
That is inaccurate. A better way to phrase what I think you mean is "It's actually the best race for mitigation."
---
Strictly speaking, that rephrasing isn't true (avoidance isn't mitigation, it's... avoidance) but it'd be far more accurate. 
---
Human is the best race, because threat is everything in classic, and humans generate significantly more threat than any other race due to weapon skill.
---
Yes I think that's exactly what it was: Medallion of Grand Marshal Morris
---
Dropped from LBRS trash
---
Left a 39 Hunter to becoma an Alchemy Bank alt after waiting hours to get one. 
---
Ill slowly level it with rested but the Warrior will be my main. 
---
I am Fury but Ive tanked all the way up to UBRS.
---
Show an interest and spend hours doing something she likes that you're not interested in.
---
I would just give a Warrior free food. Tanks are a lot more in demand than DPS. You never know when that Warrior might be a tank for your dungeon and he can easily get a DPS replaced than getting a Tank replaced. And Warriors can tank in DPS spec. They just need a shield and know what they are doing. Also it's not like that food is costing you anything... You are a Mage.
---
Most people I know have not gotten theirs until the mid-40s.  I got mine at 43 or 44, I forget.  Only buying skills you really need is a big factor.  I also went double gathering until after I got my mount.
---
any smart person would, in real life, a video game, whatever. I also like being even with other twinks and not being at a disadvantage. I also challenge level 30+ every day to duels and have victories vs level 39s, so you being so mad at me personally shows you are butthurt completely out of context by the concept of twinks alone. You either got stomped and it still hurts or you cant afford to have fun. Get over yourself.
---
I have the perfect compromise. Tell your group that everyone can roll but you get +50 on whatever your roll ends up being.
---
Yes but the amount of exp needed also massively increases
---
I'm about to respec into prot and try aoe tanking or die.
---
Paladin is really so boring to level and they said Retribution won't be so bad. Well it is and it's even worse than I thought.
---
So I'm rolling prot and I can heal/tank dungeons, whatever the group needs. I have noticed the shortage of tanks but up until now (lvl 38) it hasn't been a problem for me. I do notice many groups endlesly searching for a tank for high level instances- Stratholme, Scholo and BRD seem to be searching for tanks without much success.
---
Yeah.  
---
Classic/vanilla has literally THE BEST mini storylines ever. 
---
People like you rush rush rushing to 60 don’t even know about them- there’s no point for you to even be in classic, as you don’t get what makes it amazing. 
---
Christ, if acti-blizzard could make a world this immersive and story driven today, they might not have to fallback on a decade old game. 
---
I feel for you guys unfortunately;  it’s like having the greatest American novel handed to you and you just read the cliff notes.
---
Perhaps they do not want competition for drops?
---
Before the pitchforks are let loose on this soul, if you run with pugs, etiquette implies you pass to those who need it.
---
However, since it's a pug, needing will be a loosely applied term.  If someone needs some coin to buy their mount... you sure as bet they gonna need on it.
---
been looking for something like this. thank you!
---
Hey look, the three warriors can decide who wants it the most and buy it.
---
Spam dungeons for prebis and herb in the mean time.
---
Plenty of people were taught to swim just by throwing them to the water and letting them survive.
---
It does
---
Oh so maybe they already had a mage or two?
---
nah, you'll just have to strip your own
---
Maybe worth something but minor and miner in french is the same word : mineur

So funny how so many people cannot help but comment about phone pics. Yes, most people know how to take screen shots. It's not a high def required image and just uploading a phone pic on mobile reddit takes 1/10th the time. Stop acting like jackasses about it.

Amazing
---
dont trash it, you can turn it in for a quest in org
---
*shrug*
---
"Don't be greedy. BoE's represent an upgrade for everybody."
---
I can't make it any simpler for you.
---
Yikes, did the mage realise ?
---
Warriors don't have many tools to generate aoe threat, so grenades or even sapper charges are very helpful for that.
---
I do my homework while auto-running to a quest at the other side of the Barrens
---
Isn't this how EVERYONE gets into tanking? No tanks so you finally decide \[get pressured\] to figure out how to tank.
---
It might be because Dan wrote an article about how 8chan was full of child porn and 8chans response was to try and claim that made Dan a paedophile.
---
Dodged a serious bullet there, imagine if he didn't buff again!  Whew
---
I reiterate.  Turn it on is an insta bail and I could give two shots less for your reasoning.
---
It doesnt work for me :( Ive tried on windows and macbook.
---
Yeah and he can buy his truefaith with the gold he gets from the axe. It's BiS for him too. Get over it.
---
True.. I made this mistake on my first run but my friend corrected me
---
If I have problems with bad players I should play with good players instead, thank you for this very useful advice
---
I just went through atlas loot last night and from my observation dungeon leveling is awful for sub rogues. The gear is very few and far in between. I am not sure about quests though
---
Alliance and horde guilds working together to get a monopoly on the devilsaur skins (devilsaur leather) same is happening on Gehennas EU. Really hope blizzard punishes these people harshly. They use discord and other means to communicate outside the game in order to organise this.
---
I ended up getting my mount money by 39, but mainly because I fished STV for a day or two for the remaining 30g I needed. I just played the AH for any greens and blues I found while doing  dungeon and questing. I also did a bit of herb gathering at the start of the server before the market got fully saturated.
---
Can confirm with flyweights comment he was last seen in Varrock west bank
---
Oh, I missed the question then. Maybe there is a wowhead addon
---
did you set the correct output and input devices in discord settings
---
Thanks so much!  
---
What can I say, druid is really fun, you won't regret it.
---
Nice failure at a rebuttal so you spew some literal nonsense lmao. I'm a cancer to the community for using a fucking built-in feature that some random moron on Reddit with an irrelevant opinion doesn't approve of? Get over yourself, you're pathetic. Also, look in the mirror kid, you're spreading cancer and talking shit to people for using in-game features.
---
You mean for less. you get less exp for anything a
---
Other than yellow.
---
You like that, you fucking miner?
---
How many skills have you bought?  What have you purchased on the AH? How much ore have you sold on the AH?
---
What other comments? I replied to your self-masturbatory comment, where you turned an example of players using efficient farming methods to brag about your highly questionable and ultimately inefficient 4man dungeon clearing.
---
And why are you so angry? Yes Shield slam was Shit, that's why nobody used it, and like I said people played Fury, you'd have to be basing your playing on 1.12 to think Prot was the popular tank spec.
---
You know here I am trying to point out that 2h/DW tanking is popular in Classic because it works, and you've decided to use that not only attack me but throw in as many brags about yourself as you can during the process, and through all that you never got to the bottom of why people do it. My guild is one of the top in Classic at the moment, I won't name drop but if you go to WCL you will see them there in the top 10, right look at those names and then ask yourself how do they tank dungeons? They dual wield.
---
If you only buy skills you need and keep bag space for vendoring greys should be good if you start saving at 30.
---
This isn't toxic at all and you're generalizing.
---
Chill out
---
I'd like to join.
---
If you dont chew Big Red then fuck you.
---
Maybe read rule 3.
---
Gooood idea
---
Farm gold in a way you personally enjoy that happens to be reasonably efficient. This can be farming solo, doing dungeons, soloing dungeons, gathering professions, producing professions, playing the ah, camping vendors, or finding some cool niche.
---
Then just buy the BoE off the ah. This applies to basically everything; its almost always more efficient, and enjoyable, to farm gold and buy what you need.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
&gt;how much would you spend for a pre raid BiS rare or epic item?
---
Market value. Determining that can take some time; just check the price of your goal items every day while farming for them, and keep an eye on trends. For example, maybe Devilsaur is dropping while Arcanite is going up, so you get your Lionheart Helm first.
---
-----------
---
This also depends hugely on your class. A warrior can't get any better than some BoE pieces, no matter his spec, but a mage can forego BoEs almost entirely until ZG drops with Bloodvine.
---
Wait your point is about boomkins now?
---
For a guy who can't read very well, I find it funny you're insulting others earning potential.
---
Ooooo

You should take dragon scale. Just buy the devil saur set as it might be too difficult to farm the Mats needed. I think it's not worth the competition.
---
&gt; etiquette implies you pass to those who need it.
---
Fuck this. Common sense says in pugs you roll on every big ticket item that's BoE. Trusting random strangers is hilarious. You don't owe them shit. They didn't run that dungeon for a once in a life time drop lol.
---
Likely had too many mages and/or reservations on loot
---
So i was running SM GY for fun and then i decided that i wanted to run SM armory, i made a group and we entered the instance we had: me a lvl 38 mage , a lvl 34 druid tank, a lvl 32 priest healer , a lvl 37 shaman dps and a lvl 36 hunter.
---
The run was going smooth but then we wiped and the mobs respawned so we had to clear them again and then we wiped again which made the healer log off so then we decided to try and keep going, the tank would heal and the hunter pet would tank it worked for a little and then we wiped for a third time, so instead of getting a tank we got a lvl 40 rogue, and guess what we didnt wipe that time but instead the group disbanded.
---
But after that i decided to buy the druid some seeds because he didnt have any, and then he was nice enough to send me 1g and 20xsilk cloth
---
I realize its classic and #nochanges or whatever, but blizzard could have fixed this 15 years ago by making stuff "bind on need" rather than "bind on equip." Want to be able to sell it? Greed wouldn't bind it. Need it for use? Its bound to you then.
---
I've been trying to hang out in the cities for a bit during peak hours to sell my arcanite transmute.  Between looking for buyers, I listen for people buying portals or food/water.  It isn't huge, but I usually grab up 1g here and there for ports and hopefully someone wants arcanite.  I usually give up after \~30 minutes if no one is buying transmute, but one night I had about 15g to sit in town and watch chat for a bit.
---
maybe don't buy overpriced fashion gadgets
---
It's very possible. The game is absolutely clogged with mages.
---
Joining a guild IS useful advice in Classic WoW.  Community is the main reason we all wanted classic back and it blows my mind that people choose to play with random pugs all day like they’re on retail using LFG and then complain about the quality of shitlords they’re finding.
---
Do you realise that people only tells you about using the slower attack speed weapons just because the hamstring kiting?
---
Lol get off reddit and get your dick sucked. Jesus you fucking loser.
---
If I had to guess it's because this is their alt and in higher level dungeons some mages spam the AoE spell Blizzard that you get at level 20 but if you're doing RFC you're probably not 20 yet. 
---
Don't worry about it you'll find plenty of groups as a mage you're one of the top DPS classes. Just be mindful of your threat and maybe even install a threat meter add-on if you want, tanks in classic can't do AoE threat nearly as well as retail tanks and if you pull threat off the tank you're in for a painful time.
---
That's seriously the truth, when I was lvl 20 I thought I peaked but I'm 31 now and it's still the same, ambush, as, evis dead.
---
I can kill 4-5 mobs before stopping to heal because they don't have time to do damage to me.
---
At 30 I started fishing hard, fished the fuck out of the coast of wetlands, then the coast of stv mixed with the coast of arathi/hinterlands. Started on about 40g and Currently 36 with 135g just from all the junk you get from fishing and killing mobs/skinning them along the coast.
---
Probably about a day of fishing overall.
---
Nice one, any way of making Firefox remember the size and position of the PIP window?
---
Yes. He also was aware the locks were only on the run for that item. Yes it was not reserved but wow is that a shitty move.
---
Yeah, I've heard this many times. Like I said, I've taught *thousands* of people how to swim. No one,  and I mean no one learns to swim by being thrown in the water. Many people have told me that's how they learned to swim. It's just not true.
---
Well I’m usually civil but you were really rude to the other guy who responded to you for seemingly no reason. So I have to ask, how in the world did you level cooking up to 300 and not notice that the food it gives you buffs your stamina and spirit? And I’m a hunter so I can’t weigh in much, I don’t need to eat for health very much.
---
Actually I don't think I have blizzard. That's the one that rains ice right? I was waiting until the mob got close and using my instant up close frost to freeze all of them but a couple of times doing that I took the threat from the tank
---
 Be aware you will get scholo groups easy but not a raid spot easy.
---
Wow what a horrible friend you've got
---
In a group of randos, BoEs are usually a free-for-all need roll. If you don't want that to happen, consider defining loot rules ahead of time and/or using the "need before greed" loot system. 
---
Yes, it's a pre-raid BiS weapon. Sometimes. Based on my googling (so correct me if I'm wrong), it's only better than alternatives if you're an orc or have Edgemaster's Handguards. Given the availability of alternatives and the conditional status of it being BiS, I'd bet good money that some of the warriors would have sold it on the AH anyway. 
---
Trusting random players to be honest about need before greed with a BoE epic is a shitshow. That's why these discussions usually lean towards just having an all-need practice with BoEs.
---
Or some other type of cloth wearer. Intel/spirit cloth isn't limited to mages. Even some paladins will pick up cloth gear for healing.
---
yikes. More projection. Embarrassing.
---
Not at the moment but, it so happens that I'm starting my stream for tonight. (you can find the link in the video description)  
---
I'd be happy to give you a quick rundown on it if you'd like.
---
Difference between leveling dungeons and offspec at cap, but sure.

I can't get past how many action bars you have cluttering your view of the world

The only person who is angry here is you.
---
Not really, it's been escalating since we've had idiots that think threat doesn't apply to them and that failure is always everyone else's fault. These are the players that got frustrated when their 1-button macros they were gleefully mashing stopped giving them success. They then went and cried on the forums and now we have retail.
---
Now they're back to do it all over again.
---
I don’t see anything wrong with this. It’s the same as if gold dropped to me. I’m fury but I told everyone to need on a Krol Blade that dropped. What’s a Krol blade to me is a truefaith vestments or archmage robes to someone else, we all need that shit.
---
If they are bias why did you use them in your argument? Lol
---
"First time?"
---
Yikes a react dev. Embarrassing.
---
That makes sense
---
When does lockpicking become worth the effort? Even nearing 200, it feels like you still get pennies.
---
You shouldn't focus to much on that mail aspect. You have a pet, use it. The enemies shouldn't hit you too often. Use the gear with the best stats
---
It is much faster. Combat can pull two mobs or even 3 or 4 mobs at once constantly and consistently with bladeflurry/adrenaline rush. Sub has to attack 1 mob at a time, in stealth, and even after 40 an ambush crit does about half of the targets health not the 80-90% it does in lower levels. Also in sub spec you have 5min evasion CD. combat can get 3.5 min. As well as the increased hit and weapon skill.
---
It's really no question that it is much more efficient. But sub rogue is hella fun and better in pvp so do whatever you like to do.
---
What’s been happening to you on Kirotonos for you to say that? Alliance side?
---
Something like this: 
---
“Hey babe...come help me make a new character”
---
Then make her choose the class, the look and the name. 
---
Then when it loads into the start zone direct her to the first question mark. 
---
Game over.
---
Not sure if your IQ is literally 12 but if you join a group that is advertising Master loot and then you leave knowing full well the group rules, you're an asshole who is going to get blacklisted and have his name spammed in chats so people know not to group with you ever :) Then we'll see who is going to be giving shits when he doesn't get invited to most groups.
---
Yes, absolutely.
---
Yeah! I think that's exactly what I was thinking.
---
I think you’re looking for r/equestrian
---
So what is the standard rule for locked chests in dungeons. Does the whole party still roll for it, or just rogues who put in the effort and time to be able to open it?
---
Virgin neckbeards are scared of women and hate people on relationships. They see these posts as if someone was bragging like if being in a relationship is  a massive goal.
---
I played a Mage in Vanilla and i play a Warlock in Classic. Both are fun and cool, so you cant chose wrong.
---
From 250 you can go into BRD and unlock the gates etc. That will lvl you up pretty quickly. 
---
As for the benefits, it comes indeed from chests and lockboxes. Thorium lockboxes can actually contain pretty decent loot incl. travellers backpack and orb of perception (both worth a pretty penny on the AH). If you pickpocket aswell then the Heavy junkboxes can contain a few decent items aswell.
---
But all in all its not the most lucrative endeavour .
---
Laughs in mage aoe
---
I'm guessing it's a joke and that most people are whoosh'ed

Not really. In a large aoe pull, healer may not even be on my screen. Thanks for your help tho

I wish Apple would have shown this off a little more, I found it on accident. It’s super awesome.
---
Exactly.  MC/Ony/BWL all had significant nerfs before the TBC pre-patch.  AQ40 only had a nerf to C'thun to actually make him killable (He was mathematically impossible to kill for the first 3 weeks to a month after AQ40 released), and I'm not sure Naxx was ever nerfed.  Those 2 instances aren't going to be a cakewalk like the others because they are in states closer to what their Vanilla release states were.  If MC was released in its original Vanilla state, we would likely not have seen an MC clear until at least week 3.
---
That helmet is so overrated. It's cheaper to level engi from scratch and buy a green lens. There are also greens with tons of +healing (albeit quite expensive as well) and postmaster helm (BOP) if you value int high enough.
---
The thing he'd be doing again is not buffing lol... he didn't buff before and he'd not buff again.  Man plz stop this hurts to watch
---
I did not know they can Rez and heal
---
Thought about that but didn't find anything
---
If your action has a bid on it and you cancel you get a % fee as well. Not sure when this was added and it might be later than vanilla, but I remember seeing this since cataclysm at least
---
Just tell her about the roleplaying aspect and how  relaxing it can be from time to time, if you are rolling on a pvp server explain the implications and when you get to dungeon tell her how is it to play with others.
---
Use your spell to track minor nodes
---
Don't. Its really distracting in movies when you recognize the scream...
---
People are trying to help. Clicking and keyboard turning is incredibly detrimental to your pvp fights and even raids and and dungeons. Even just a random mob. 
---
If you are casting a spell at a member of the opposing faction, the opponent can just walk through you at the end of your cast and it won’t go off. 
---
Clicking is just bad for everything and usually means your not using your mouse to move or turn. Which means you have to keyboard turn. 
---
Start off slow and use keybinds for your main attacks and maybe your main defensive abilities. 
---
Binding strafe to a/d opens up q and e. So 1-5, q,e, f,r,x,c,v are all pretty accessible. Use some of those and get used to it. 
---
Once you get your muscle memory and stop clicking, you’ll see how much of a difference it makes.
---
I was actually considering not rolling a tank because of this prediction, but I love tanking too much. Turns out my concern is unwarranted, and I have all the groups I could want lol.
---
It's the only thing I can imagine lol.
---
Imagine rewarding someone for not being a piece of shit.
---
&gt;typically cant even be bothered to dps the right target. 
---
This is wildly accurate in my experience at 60 so far. 
---
*however* 
---
Some of my favorite groups have been UBRS runs with 4+ warriors and a WF totem. 
---
Everyone drops their shield and we just go hogwild through the dungeon. Its an absolute riot.
---
You described the reason why I went tank way back in burning crusade as a paladin.
---
What's so OP about them?
---
They always end up been alliance and I can't trade them!
---
That had to be a clusterfuck of epic proportions.
---
wep can have more +spell damage than any other slot.  upgrading to a new wep can be incredibly  useful
---
Shaman instead of a sissy dress-wearer. Storm, Earth, and Fire are at your command. But only if you're horde.
---
Look, i assume you're a good player, you sound smart enough to know what to do, how to do it and when to do it but you have to understand that the vast majority of people are not like you. A lot of people haven't played wow vanilla for 15 years and are just not good at the game. Your comment is the problem with the AoE meta. You over estimate the skills of average players and you fuel this dunning-kruger effect of people that read comments about how AoE is easy, that it's faster ect. They go into dungeons thinking that they can do whatever they want, however they want whenever they want and that it's fine because LOL classic is so EZ. "Classic is challenging for new players but easy for experienced players" is a way more accurate description of the game.
---
Just to give you an example of what's the difference between you and "the average mage". You probably start with blizzard, when mobs gets close to you, you cone of cold, ice nova, move away, do more blizzard cone of cold, blink. You know the typical mage aoe kite. I've leveled a mage doing AoE farms on private, i know a good mage can indefinitly kite mobs without getting hit. The average player though looks more like, ice nova first (already you must know this mage is fucked) then cone of cold followed by arcane explosion and when the roots break he blink away from the unslowed mobs and now tries to blizzard. The disparity between those two players is "extreme". But this guy think he's as good as you. And this is the problem, this why this aoe meta is completely fucked and is so annoying. 
---
If i were playing with you i would totally be down to go full aoe and clear as fast as possible. Unfortunately i really don't often meet good players like that in pugs.
---
That's basically what it's for and why it's so good. +5 skill adds very little against lower level mobs, while against orange (+3) mobs it's a *massive* difference maker (assuming your weapon skill is maxed).
---
Ur bars hurt my head

YOUR A DWEEEB A LOW LEVEL ONE!
---
Transmogs? What are those?!!
---
I love my pig. Underated hunter pet imo.
---
He could quit instead
---
I think he means through soul stones and health stones.
---
You ought to actually read the post next time. It's right at the bottom. 
---
"And just for the record, I'm of course totally fine with people reserving items, making it clear to everyone that an item is reserved ahead of time and then putting it on master loot when we're at the appropriate boss."
---
This... is actually correct. Slam is only worth using under 2 conditions: 1) You use a swing timer to ensure that it has the smallest effect on your auto-attack as possible; and 2) Bloodthirst and Whirlwind are both on cooldown, and even after slamming you will still have enough rage to use both when they come off cooldown.
---
And you are right. There is no way they are generating enough rage to meet the 2nd criteria while leveling.
---
Hey I get it! Your treasure hunter racial found your party really good loot! Sweet post dude! Sorry about the other replies you’re getting!
---
Not really worth it unless you really want world PvP right now.  When phase 2 comes out, you can queue up for BGs, which I always liked better.  Maybe at some point, things will evolve to casual world pvp like many people describe, but right now the bulk of it is just too many players on both sides crammed into a competition for quests and resources.  On top of that, alot of people are trying to power through to 60 so you could have a numerical advantage and still get camped.  Plus, anytime you ask for help or call out ganks, you have the wannabe hardcore pvp alpha boys shrieking that if being ganked by 60s for an hour doesn't bring you to a shattering orgasm, you should go back to retail or roll on PvE.
---
Yes... yes they are. They are not the Master Race
---
Herod hoes about to be ANGERY
---
What server is he on now
---
I'm on Heartseeker and I call B.S. There is at least 10 alliance to every horde player. Going to be a mess phase 2 if blizz doesn't do some kind of horde only transfer into the realm.
---
So essentially it would be as if I was facing a yellow mob?
---
 My character constantly yelling “I need more rage” “not enough rage” is way more common lol.
---
They've got Siphon Life and Drain Life, which transfer health from an enemy to you, as well as Major Healthstone. The rez comes from Major Soulstone. I put it on healers usually.
---
And if you're low on mana, you can use Soul Tap to convert health to mana and then heal up again.  Oh yeah, they have some decent CC as well.
---
Go look up "warlock drain tank". It's a hoot.
---
Farmin' that sweet Reddit karma haha.
---
Imagine watching Asmongold and then complaining that he's coming to your server.
---
yea but they all wanna be snowflake dps
---
I always thought mine referred to mineral.

Holy shit you really, really need to stay in school.

---
Was this a month ago?
---
Blasted lands and Azshara is proabably your best bet. But do note that in classic there arent enough quests to take you the whole 1-60. You're expected to also grind/dungeon grind some levels.
---
Hope it helps
---
5/5 imp slam 2h fury spec is better than MS spec, at lvl 60, yes. It is, however, harder to play well: you have to use a swing timer, not have too much latency, time those slams wel, and judge your rage well enough to make sure that bloodthirst and whirlwind are able to be used as soon as they come off cooldown (even a half second delay on these abilities makes it not worth using slam).
---
While you're leveling though? Forget it, slam is simply not worth it. You just don't get enough rage.
---
Asmon is rolling an Orc. Asking for Horde gold donations in Durotar, they are saying they will take over the realm and camp all alliance.
---
Dis you lag for a whole hour???
---
It was a boar genocide in Durotar at launch.  Just furiously hitting tab looking for a boar that was alive.
---
Unfortunately not the first time this has been posted here. :/
---
How? Shadoweave has more shadowdmg and that's priority Nr. 1 for warlocks. And if you mean it's better because of that int, int is like 5. priority for locks.
---
Thank God my server has 0 prominent streamers it is so peaceful.
---
He's doing it for the LULW's in chat, it's gonna last less than an hour before he goes to Faerlina.  
---
Do retards actually believe him?
---
Just get to Durotar and give him your gold, pal. What else you gonna do, sit in Orgrimmar losing your hair to anger?
---
That's true. But you just said new server.
---
Herod would be a mistake. He already gets yanked as it is. Imagine going someplace you’re even more so unwanted.
---
What is the best area or dungeon(s) for level 32?
---
I have 3g at lvl 30 😓
---
Only bad warriors stay "LF1M tank" for preraid dungeons.
---
If you don't want to tank, don't choose the best tanking class.
---
its more than believe, they give him money
---
This. You are getting the extra crit chance, it's just not displaying the extra crit chance in your spellbook. This was a thing in classic, and so they didn't fix it, but you can at least rest assured that it's not adversely affecting your dps.
---
I did let the mobs kill him a lot of times, the bot was in red gear and decided to ress sickness for 30 min.

Deviate Delight is the chill comfy cozy dad server. It’s rp-pvp though. So there is ganking risk, but IMO ganking stories are the most memorable part of the original classic, so I felt comfortable settling here.

You had to be the one.

I'd kick any rogue that did that, but feel free to play the game how you want to.
---
For questing I'd say Shimmering Flats, the southernmost part of Thousand Needles.  Big open space with lots of mobs to kill.
---
For dungeons probably Scarlet Monastery graveyard or library.  But I'm playing Horde so I'm not sure where the best Alliance spots are.
---
ROGUE
---
You should have gotten to 250 tailoring just by saving the mageweave and runecloth from leveling.
---
Then you can make mooncloth every 4 days, which depending on the price of mooncloth, can be an easy 15g or more.
---
Bro u should try getting the swinetusk shank from RFK, drops pretty frequently and is a solid upgrade from meteor
---
Thanks for the detailed reply! I'm already at 27, with my first 11 points into Consecration, and I'm glad I asked.
---
My build already mostly looked like that, but I went for a few points into Toughness already. I'll be putting the rest into Precision, then go for Righteous Fury, Kings, Shield Spec, and continue from there.
---
Again, thanks so much. I'm glad I asked.
---
It does not stop you from auto running or running in general, BUT, if the opposing faction member is hold right click to control their camera angle, distract will do nothing but glitch their character a little while they continue running in the direction they intended to.

In other areas of Germany, there are holes that swallowed entire villages

I sense sarcasm in that statement 🙄
---
I like combining things. I never farm for money, but I earn money doing something else I'm interested in. Grinded timbermaw rep to honored - I probably got some money while at it too. Done 40ish scholo/strat runs because again I cared about reputation. So while it's just selling trash to vendor and g/h isn't the highest, it's still something to get while also getting rep. I think I made it to 7k/21k exalted or something there. Epic mount wasn't much of a challenge to earn.
---
It's one of the cheapest epics on my server, between 12-20 gold
---
Dont buy every class ability only the ones you use often right now

You can get the addon "auctionator". Let it scan the AH. Then when you mouseover items in your inventory, it will tell you what you stand to make from a vendor, directly on AH or how much the DE mats will sell for.
---
Its an easy way to keep track.

**Honest Tip**

Don't waste your time. Even if you do get her to play she won't make it past level 20 and when she quits you'll be disappointed.

**Tip for unmarried men**

Don't marry a girl who doesn't game-it as much as you. It's better to be single than to marry someone who will shit on you for doing what you enjoy.

Everyone rolls as you may not have access to that chest unless you were in a party.  You can open if you have the right level of the winner.
---
That's a thing people do? Do I wait for level relevant stuff? (I'm level 24 rn). Will that help for BGs?
---
No longer works, blizz patched that

Haha. I guess that would be a cool idea to consider as patron exclusive rewards.

"Keep. Summer. Safe."
---
Please share some jokes, need a laugh
---
So the Breastplate of Chromatic Flight is a crazy chestpiece you get from collecting some hard to drop items.  I'm pretty sure it is one quest out of a few for some other crazy items for other classes.  What are all the 'series' of this quest that involve the items for other classes? Thanks.
---
I think that's an orc. Hard to tell though.
---
Its masser and secunda
---
Yeah kinda true, I mean I suck also sometimes to safe my mana, but depends on the group. Everytime I have alock in my group... well bye bye mana. Or a really really bad group, then there goes nothing without using stuff to keep all alive, which is dumb, cause dd should take no dmg, unless its aoe you cant avoid.

I'm a level 60 holy priest with a level 30 mage alt. I will be leveling with a friend who is playing a warlock alt so what class should I play with him ?
---
No I get why you made them anonymous. You were looking out for them. Just wanted to give you a heads up about that Rule since the Mods don't like posts that Name and Shame people.
---
Casual Core.
---
You mean normal person?
---
Again, not entirely true. 
---
How much rage do you gain from a Dodge or parried attack?
---
How is my statement mocking the poor? Its a simple statement that just because YOU cant afford something, doesnt mean someone else wont buy it. Explain how is statement is mocking or untrue.  
---
As to unemployed, I work as a bus driver. In my state, 20 hrs/wk is full time and affords a good wage and full benefits. This means that I get a 4 hour break during down hours of the day to farm. I make between 70-130g/hr farming devilsaur during these off times. 2 hours a day (which is less time than some people take in a single dungeon) can net me 140-260g. If I do this once a day for a week I make over a thousand gold. Rinse and repeat.  
---
The other poster being toxic regarding the price of items, just because he wouldnt spend the money on it is the real point of these comments. There has already been evidence linked that a +33 healing wand will sell for 2k+ gold. Thats a fact. No sense in arguing it.
---
I leveled until 21 and couldn't take it. Didn't think it would be this boring.. So I switched to Druid and never  looked back.
---
Why do you call them idiots though?
---
why do we need to label each other, it's a game just play it how ever you feel will be the most fun
---
For portals, I charge 1 g for higher levels and 60s for lower lvls. People don't blink at paying it.
---
For rogues, I just do 10s for the lower lockboxes, maybe 20-30 for higher ones.
---
For professions, depends entirely on how high lvl and rare the recipe is. Making wool bags? The tailor would be lucky to get a 5s tip.
---
Yeah. I really like him for PvP, but I think I might end up as our groups raid tank. I'm already the main dungeon tank and I always have my rogue for pvp
---
I got it last night at level 39

I'm still on step 0: getting one.

Idk but Faerlina is a toxic cesspool.
---
All I managed to find was the motherfucker who caused guild-destroying drama in 2009, using the same fucking name.  Just about made me sick.
---
Well, BGs aren't out yet and won't be for many months. You'll probably be 60 by the time theyre out. So don't worry about gear for BGs yet.
---
But people don't get into PVP only when they have BiS gear, lots of people do PVP without ever setting foot in 60 dungeons or raids. When the Honor system comes out, you can buy gear with honor points you earn from killing opposite faction players.

---
Due to their ease of leveling and being best class in the game, literally everyone hitting 60 is rolling mage alts. So I wouldnt roll mage
---
People will been to export data from details and share it with the community. Best bet for you is to message people on Reddit who are posting they found Ironfoe and ask them to send you the data.
---
Yeah the mage was clearly in the wrong but rules are rules.
---
Everyone will understand it's not complex
---
For leveling, you want +dmg gear and so dreamweave is good.
---
For healing, you probably want int and spirit rather than +dmg. Maybe if you had good gear with +healing (which is more than +dmg) it might be different.
---
You put it on your player of choice before they die, they can the res.
---
Semicasual
---
Not an expert but would imagine that Blizz would need to merge some realms if they did what we want
---
Same thing on Faerlina. The two main guilds doing it being &lt;clc&gt; for horde, and &lt;Vampire Clan&gt; for alliance (often see Olympus with them). They're always grouped and travel together, only killing those outside of the select guilds. This lets them keep a monopoly on it as they're able to essentially farm 24/7 without any competition at all.
---
That being said, they have a monopoly on it and skins are still super cheap. They're out here all day making mere silver per kill once profits are split, so while annoying at first it's mostly become a "... but why?" situation as you can make far better gold/hr elsewhere.
---
Yeah I was in the fence with saying SM/ZF and changed it to ZF in another comment.
---
But...getting a friend or even someone random to do it for you is not that tough...or you can strip naked, die and run back. Takes all of maybe 30seconds a minute tops longer.
---
I have no problem with people having fun and posting videos...this guy is clearly advertising his stream.
---
No they probably aren't going to do them yet.
---
No, and considering we do not even know when phases 2,3 and 4 are going to launch expect a long wait for information.
---
Oh but if I don't put it on them before I don't have a Rez?
---
troll? you got Devouring Plague as undead... fuck troll, they suck
---
Hahaha, take your damn upvote. XD
---
Sorry, gruntofthesmitey, but Domillowmew used correct grammar. “Imagine if he didn’t buff again” is a confusing use of the negative but correct. The thing that the mage would repeat would be failing to buff, which he did the first time. Failing is the repeatable action.
---
Wait I have a software for this. You're telling me YouTube already has this functionality?
---
I say it more like warryer and am American
---
I wouldnt group with you on principle for this kind of extra snitchery. Its just so childish. So what if he wouldnt buff, Im sure your timed MLG LBRS run would have suffered tremendously.
---
This comment is proof in the pudding how... Never mind, you won’t get it anyways.
---
Just report to blizzard and send them the clip. Not sure we need a Reddit post about it.
---
&gt; getting a friend or even someone random to do it for you is not that tough
---
Doing it 5 times in a row every hour is, though.
---
I’d be happy just knowing it would be on the same time frame as original game or something. Execs prolly still trying to figure out why Classic is such a smash hit
---
Druid. Can do everything.
---
Wait so just made a video about admitting to cross faction colluding? Isnt that ToS but hard to prove but now this video is pretty solid evidence.
---
Ahh Yeah your right. Shoulda blacked his name out too. Gonna delete the post because I didn’t think about it.
---
What do I do when I'm sort of in a rut with leveling my character? I am enjoying my alliance priest but I just can't seem to find the motivation to level and will often just log in and log back out. Should I try alts maybe to see if it's the class / faction, etc or should I just persevere? Thank you.
---
How is it childish to not want to group with a bad/dumb player?
---
So is it working for you? Because I have it updated to latest and its still just showing 100%
---
Thanks for the info, now I just have to decide if I wanna level another character on a pvp server. Running rogue rn on westfall but thinking of have an alt warrior on benediction. Is retail worth having my second character on? Or do you think should I just stick to classic
---
All I've ever done and I got Warlord in Vanilla and first 2 seasons of Gladiator titles plus 8th world Kil Jaedan kill. I think people just like to think that "streamlining" their play makes them good versus actually being good. Scripting and macro people take intricacy &gt; ability. We just do our thing. Downvote more :)
---
Ok, so reset the instance yourself. Strip all your gear and run back. Like I said it takes a minute at most longer than inviting someone, logging out, and having them reset.
---

Yeah there is no reason at all for them to tell us this.

I’d expect to wait at least a year before hearing anything at all. We don’t even know when phase 2 is coming.

I wait for a player to loot whatever he needs. If he then moves away, what's left is fair game.

The only bad part about this is that horde on Herod already outnumber alliance by a lot.
---
I’m supposing when 40%&gt; of the pop is 50+
---
Because excluding someone just for a buff is stupid and the kind of elitism people pretend to rail against. Maybe the guy doesnt see the point to it? Is he still a good player that does mechanics? Does he wait for the tank before going HAM? No you wont know because your int didnt go up.

First you will summon your SoulStone then choose your Target of choice and use the soulstone on them. Your target will gain a Buff which allows the player to resurrect upon death. The Buff is active for 30mins afterwhich you need to summon a new soulstone
---
I was about to argue that paladins should be way higher. I'm keeping pretty good speed leveling my Paladin right now. Pretty much the same passe I had on my lock, and I consider myself a pretty fast leveler on lock.
---
Imagine getting all ur info from streamers and then believing it lul
---
Must be fun to do this with your mom! Mothers who try to do what their children do are cool!
---
Warlock is fairly self reliable in most cases and can hand out health/soulstones so you can revive one another.  And since you have 2 casters already, I would vote rogue.  
---
You can DPS from behind like you would having a tank once your friend gets voidwalker (note the voidwalker wont take nearly as much threat).  The warlock will have spell dots up while you do direct damage in melee form.  The warlock can tank mobs if the pet dies while you finish them off or throw in a good stun.  If there are 3+ mobs that you can't handle, you can stealth in and sap one to take the load off.  If your warlock pet/warlock dies, you can vanish while he uses soulstone to self revive.. no one has to do a corpse run.
---
In pvp you can open (warlock dots up) and after your damage/stuns are fired the warlock can fear and you can continue damaging.
---
I think thats the best fit unless you want to play like a shaman/druid but already having 2 casters you might wanna try a melee out so you don't get burnt out.
---
You didn't watch the clip it wasn't fair at all...
---
Even after all that, slam is literally unusable while leveling because it suffers from spell pushback and if you get pushed back even once it's not worth casting.
---
My guild is Thundercats, we say HOOOOOOO when someone joins. But when they quit we go OOOOOHHH
---
P2 has been confirmed it will be released before the new year. I'm hoping for the Christmas break as the world PvP will be carnage.
---
&gt;Because excluding someone just for a buff is stupid 
---
No. Refusing to buff party members because it costs mana is extremely stupid. 
---
Not wanting to group with a stupid player is smart.
---
Join the Fairbanks classic subreddit!
---
Ok, long explanation, TL;DR at the end: As a mob has more defense than you have weapon skill, they gain an increased chance to be missed. Base miss chance is 5%. each 1 point of defense they have over your weapon skill, until 10 defense, gives them 0.1% increased chance to be missed. From 10 to 15 points, they gain a 0.2% miss/point of defense. In addition, if a mob as 11 or more defense more than your weapon skill, they gain a flat 1% bonus to their chance to be missed.
---
Therefore, against a 63 (skull) boss, you have a 5% (base) + 0.1%x10 (first 10 defense) + 0.2%x5(next 5 defense) + 1% (flat bonus for &gt;10 defense higher) = 8%. Wait, I thought the hit cap was 9%? It is. That's because for enemies with more than 10 defense above your weapon skill, they ignore the first 1% hit you have from gear, effectively making the hit cap 9%, even though the chance to miss is only 8%.
---
Now, if you have 305 weapon skill (human/orc), this has a dramatic effect. First, the difference between the boss's defense and your weapon skill is only 10 points. So they not only lose the flat +1% chance to be missed, they also lose the 1% hit suppression. On top of this, they also lose the 0.2% miss/point x 5 points, so another 1%, making their new chance to be missed 6%, and that's your hit cap.
---
Finally, to answer your question directly, +8 skill to swords would grant the aforementioned benefits that humans/orcs get, and in addition reduce the boss's chance to be missed by an additional 3 x 0.1% = 0.3%. Therefore, your new hit cap is 5.7%.
---
Unfortunately, since hit comes in flat percentages, this is effectively still 6%, but that's still much better than 9%. 
---
However, there are other effects of weapon skill that make this sword even better. I won't go into the math on this and just give you the results: The boss loses a 0.8% (similar formula to hit) chance to dodge your attacks. Since there is no other way to reduce this, you will straight up hit 0.8% more often. Naturally, this is good.
---
What's significant is that the damage reduction of glancing blows. Glancing blows, which make up 40% of your white hits on a boss, cannot crit and reduce the damage of the attack by 35%. Weapon skill doesn't reduce how often they occur, but they do reduce the damage penalty. With +8 weapon skill, glancing blows will only suffer a 5% damage reduction (though they still cannot crit). This is huge. Even humans/orcs can only reduce this to 15% damage reduction.
---
TL;DR: Your new hit cap is 5.7%, but that's effectively 6%. In addition, the boss dodges 0.8% less often, nearly another % of hit. Finally, your glancing blows (40% of white hits) suffer only a 5% damage reduction, vice a 35% damage reduction.
---
It's a very good sword (for non human/orcs; for human/orcs, it's merely an ok sword).
---
Mage is superior in the sense of AoE farming (which becomes very lucrative later in the game)
---
Lock is superior in solo leveling 
---
Both have top end game dps ability if played right and geared right. Both are monsters in PvP.
---
With some NPCs, simply standing next to them for long enough will put you on their threat table. You'll know it has happened because you'll enter combat.
---
What talents do you recommend?
---
I chose The server you’re on. My character name is. 
---
“Veny” (Rougue) &amp; “Trinny” (Mage) 
---
Plz add me I’m a literal scrub rn.... maybe if you got discor I could add you there. I’m playing on a trash laptop so I may not be able to handle all these programs up at once. I’ll probably have to use my phone to talk on discord. I have a pretty good headset though so it should be fine.
---
As a warrior tank, I hate people who wont buff.  Also try to steer away from rogues due to them normally not paying attention to their threat, and going for the same gear.
---
I will bring a druid even when lower dps than a rogue, due to buffs.  Giving me, and the hunter 3% crit is amazing.  Added on with thorns (for me) and mark for all.
---
Keep trying my man, these people who say alt+f4 is not to quit guild aren't doing it right.
---
I don’t think hunters can track treasure chests? unless you mean they can track in general
---
Hope she whole heartedly enjoys it
---
and trolls get shadowguard which doesn't eat your inner fire, procs blackout like crazy, does more damage with gear and is not cleansed easily. add hex of weakness (spamable mini-ms) and its an ez choice.
---
Just stick to sunder to increase white damage for more rage and overpower activations.
---
what if they were both? /thonking
---
For some languages 0 is the button before 1 so it is alright.
---
It makes sense, 23 is grown man with definite potential to be a masterful warrior. Especially since 16 is like the benchmark for an adult in times similar to the ones depicted in Azeroth. Especially with just how much fighting has gone on since Old Hillsbrad. 23 is enough for Herod to be the beast he is, and I assume the player character is even younger.
---
ZF i would consider a leveling dungeon as well. its only in BRD and above that you start getting BiS gear with the exception of mara with the princess ring. ZF is early to mid 40s gear.
---
That's surely just a default human model since they didn't need to actually design his face.
---
I can no open, is that the graph about exp vs the mob level youre fighting?
---
Stats are very important, and weapons usually have a ton of stats.  So its still important.  But yes it won't increase your damage at all (unless the weapon says "increases damage and healing from spells by X" or something like that.
---
Miner, I hardly know her.
---
Yeah but this is English we're talking about, nothing makes sense.
---
Some almost shirtless night elf male would look pretty damn good...
---
Trying alts seems like a good idea.
---
Though it might not be the class, it might just be the leveling process. It gets generally harder as you go up in level, you start seeing less progress per hour, etc.
---
I met my friend's younger brother playing Heroes a year or so ago.
---
A random kept trying to join our comp team, kept denying him but he would sub sometimes. One day after asking where everyone was from, it boiled down to him living a neighborhood over. After that he tried to PM me asking to buy beer(he was 16). Immediately blocked his account, cyaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
The title of this post is incredibly hyperbolic and stinks of elitism. It was an LBRS run. Not a world first Mythic kill. There was no bullet to dodge.
---
Frickin nah he just created Horde toon on Herod
---
No if you're interested just practice in open world at your level.  I like to go to a zone a few levels below me and start out so I learn the classes im fighting's last minute ditch efforts.. then I scale up to my own levels.
---
Also you will wanna hurry.  Once Phase 2 pops off the PvPers of the world are going to become way more aggressive since they get awards aside from personal satisfaction.
---
A tip is a tip. It's not a fee. Tip whatever.

Yes, I did read this. nice little jab there. You did not specify if you would leave if it was put on ML even though it was discussed prior. Please see my part where i said 
---
"Ok, but what if its the boss the loot that is reserved is from? Hard to ensure you will get it if you leave it on group loot... or are you saying if its spoke about previous to the fight and ML happens its ok?"
---
Maybe you are projecting to me because you own reading comprehension was poor?

Shh, it's not rogues fault they don't stack intellect.

2) What about just have macros? Still working on my pick pocketing.
---
I just made it over this hump too.  I had to circle back around to hinterlands and I did some extra grinding too.  I actually downloaded questie just this last weekend, trying to trudge through 48-50.  You're too high for good XP in ZF, but a full clear of maraudon would probably be worth just under half a level for you with quests.
---
The damn iron range in Minnesota is nuts too.
---
How is it elitism to not want to group with a bad or stupid player?
---
The problem is you don't seem to understand or acknowledge that not wanting to buff party members because of the mana cost does in fact make you a bad or stupid player.
---
I've heard pvp was gonna be next year
---
Wow you're offended. Stop trying to get people banned because you disagree with their playstyle.
---
You can legit take 5 seconds to look up a podcast with Asmongold to realize he's 100% working people.
---
This is like the guys who somehow thought Kaceytron was being completely real too.
---
I played OSRS for two years. 1-300 fishing is a walk in the park comparatively.
---
Because Shamans can hit like trucks in melee. But this really depends on if your weapons are up to date and what playstyle you're actually using. There's a \*ton\* of options for shaman while leveling, not only are there like 4 leveling builds there's also all the different weapon enchants. If you have windfury and a slow 2 hander, you can reduce a player from 100 to 20% in a single hit when lucky.
---
But even without windfury it's pretty good damage imo. If you have a strong two hander (or even one hander at lower levels) combined with rockbiter or flametongue or frostbite, you get some pretty good hits combined with totem damage/buffs and shocks. I just consider shamans to kind of be like warriors and paladins but with a bigger toolkit thanks to all the different weapon enchants and totems.
---
My solution was to put 10 points into sub for the improved stealth. After that I went for a pretty standard combat levelling spec. I might not have the super chunky ambushes, but I stealth up to every mob and stun them, and it saves so much eating/bandaging time. Those 10 points are so worth it, and makes my rogue playable for levelling.
---
Hi asmon. Love you
---
HOES MAD
---
I tanked for most of my playtime in Retail since it was the only role I ever enjoyed. But the issue on retail is the same issue on classic; tanks are in high demand for dungeons but getting a raid spot is nigh-on impossible due to most guilds already having established tanks either from Retail, or from very early on in the release. I'd roll a Warrior Tank alt, but I know for a fact that once I hit 60 I likely won't be taking part in any raids unless I lead PuGs myself (as I used to) and I'm not sure I have the patience these days.
---
Plus, levelling 1 character is painful enough currently!
---
They look like cells taken straight from a high quality animation. Needless to say I love it.
---
Nope sorry.  You cannot do something again without doing it at least once.  If mage didn't buff in the 1st place, he cannot buff again.
---
Seen it a lot, but I think they're 1) letting you know they are taking a quick break to prep for the dungeon rub, and 2) letting you know that they are intoxicated and may occasionally say something silly or go afk for 30 sefonds to swap a song when distracted.  It's no different than someone telling you that they're new to the game or haven't run this dungeon before.. it's just a courteous heads up. 3) just trying to make likeminded friends in the game where they don't have to worry about being 100% sober and focused as they're just there to have a good time.
---
There's obviously going to be a crowd that just thinks smoking weed is cool and wants to announce it.  So that is am obvious case.. but in my experience most people are much more mature and just throwing it out there to see what they get back.
---
I've played the game high a lot and have met many others in the same situation.  It's just a fun game to play high but we are self aware that someone may not want to deal with it in a dungeon run.
---
I've never seen someone use it as an excuse as the person below suggests.  And I've been with a number of drunk folks late friday/saturday nights as well that talk about being drunk and also don't use it as an excuse.
---
I haven't noticed any correlation between sober mistakes vs high/drunk/intoxicated mistakes nor an increased chance.
---
I'm, more often than not, drinking/smoking while playing and it hasn't been an issue in the slightest.  I do vibe with group members better who are in the same state of consciousness.. but I don't think that someone who is sober playing is more annoying or worse of a group member.
---
Explain please?
---
I would be happy for a date on the upcoming phases...
---
Seen some loot that is not hunter loot, mainly plate gear and maces, pisses me off. Everything else is ofc viable hunter loot.
---
That reminds me I broke my G string while fingering a minor...
---
New guitar strings it is.
---
Idk this is kinda pathetic on ur part. All these mages acting like they're actually working a job and have to "charge for their services" lol. It literally takes u all of 10 seconds to conjure food n water chill tf out.

For items that have the effect “increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to X,” does this apply to AoE spells in the same way as single target spells? For example, if X in this case was 12, would it increase the damage done by each “tick” of blizzard by 12, or would it have a reduced benefit for AoE spells?

That hunter named Headshot must have been very confused when he logged in and didn't have a bow or gun.

The only problem with that macro is that it recasts, cat form even if you're already in cat form. Which I don't need, since it's very mana costy D:
---
Aye. Paladins are a great class. What people need to understand is that hybrid classes were a thing in Classic. Paladins can tank, but not as good as warriors or druids. Paladins can heal, but not as good as priests (yes, they are the best single-target healer, but that was probably not what blizzard intended), paladins can dps, but not as well as... well anyone.

Best guess is a bug due to latency.  Escort quests are shared on the server as the NPCs travel and cannot be active for 2 separate parties at a time.
---
You guys may have nabbed it at the same time but the Horde got credit due to latency/queue in assignment.  It may have bugged out completely for both of you (who knows without the hordes side).  The fact that he kekd may mean he received the quest too and/or is aware of an exploit.
---
Best guess and only a guess.. but it makes sense.

Manipulating reddit threads...

First the deleting and reposting of threads, now this.

It's a bit out of context in the image. He had joined the group initially for the xbow which no one else needed. One member left after first run was done and we needed replacement for second run. I made sure to ask him if he was okay with a hunter joining or if we should continue to search for a class to avoid loot competition. I agree - reserving items is pretty dirty!
---
I guess it's a bit of a fine line between casual and average. My main point is that wow players generally put a lot more hours into it than other games or the average gamer on any given game. So the "average" is skewed upwards, because everyone is going at it hard. I realize that "technically" that means the average wow player is therefore higher, but it still just seems skewed to consider that as your average gamer overall, simply because the overall hours get so high so fast.
---
No, just stop watching his shit and stop spamming reddit?

Scum

Sucks for herod, hopefully he doesn't look at Skeram

This is how I feel when women tell me no

YES. My first alt is 100% going to be a tank. I spent an hour looking for a tank for Uldaman last week, and even longer looking for a tank for Cath a few days before that.

Should at least give her the default UI for the true classic experience!
---
A very fair and valid point. You need very specific things in order to 2-handed tank past 40, points I've already detailed. The average player should just stick to what works: swordnboard.
---
If I were tanking and had to gather up mobs for some reason then yeah I would prefer you just stay in stealth until I settle in on a spot and start focusing on building threat. Then if a skull is marked kill skull. If no target is marked, assist the tank or hit the one with the most sunders. If you pull agro, feint and assist the tank again because he probably switched targets.
---
It's not always easy and tanks don't always mark like they should but if you're at least trying to focus the mob he has the most threat on you'll usually be ok. If he gets mad because you're doing all this and still pulling, ask him to mark a skull and slow your DPS.
---
But rogues are not and should not try to be off tanks. Some try and results are not usually good.

It’s not super worth it for a priest. You give up a lot of spirit, so it ends up becoming less efficient overall, but each mob will die faster. Spirit tap is the only thing that makes leveling a priest tolerable.
---
I can’t understand why you’re so triggered lol. OP clearly isn’t trying to be “MLG”, he just wants a buff and the mage refuses when you should be buffing members in your party to make the dungeon easier. It’s just common courtesy. 
---
If he doesn’t want to play with people like that, then that’s his choice. The only person who is anything here is you, for being a hypocrite. You chastise him for not grouping up with someone based on his principles, then you say “I wouldn’t group with you based on [this principle]”.
---
no u

Asmongold makes me EleGiggle a lot and I BibleThump when he logs off. I hope he teaches that naughty server a lesson.
---
You will thank yourself when they show up again and you can make sure to avoid them! Even if it's only three people so far. The majority of my notes are positive from awesome people I've grouped with!
---
I always wondered if being a tank makes you an asshole or if assholes are drawn to being tanks. I actually love tanking and I feel like I'm a chill dude, but even running around with my friends I've known for 20 years, I feel myself being snippy with them. Especially questing at level 15 when the Warlock is like "Go do your thing." - "Pull more! Pull all of them." Like "Mother fucker yes, I'd love to, but we don't have a healer and y'all don't have AoE and you loot shit while three mobs are still hitting me, so I'm gonna pull at my own pace because we've died three times like when you decided to pull out your blueberry to help tank and pulled five mobs and I get rage starved and I said wtf are you doing that damn thing is gonna die and then we're all gonna die because I don't have agro on shit and can't get it because I have no rage because I haven't been getting hit )%#\*&amp;(\*#$%@#&amp;\^$8......."

Thorns is so huge low level. I healed an rfc run as a druid and my thorns was 16% of the warrior tanks total damage.
---
nice thumbnail lmao
---
Not while leveling
---
Fury warrior here - started tanking BRD at 54, I say just go for it!
---
If that's the case then change the form number accordingly, I just assumed it was 2 since that's what you used.
---
Honestly I never thought I'd say this, but I hope he does. It'd bring some alliance here so we don't get our shit pushed in all the time. (He does play Ally right? Idk, I don't watch Streamers)

---
Yep, got a lock I downloaded the addon specifically for because he wouldn't give me (heals) SS or a health stone, yet demanded I heal his constant life taps. He would also start fights with low health and then pull and get himself killed lol
---
Ended up in a group with the DC once more later on and i told the group he would slack so be carefull. True enough he was gone the second rends loot was rolled for.
---
I do see him every now and then in lookingforgroup and i ask him if his connection is better or if he still gets DC after rend :P
---
Yes, while levelling.
---
Whenever we engage Herod I always think of [this.](https://i.imgur.com/RZ851SS.jpg)
---
Asmon joined Herod? Why? Gonna make his life hell.
---
I've only seen DD used for FFXI. Usually in wow its dps but I honestly dont see why someone would get butthurt over the different terminology lol
---
&gt;As a druid, can I spec feral or balance for leveling and still be viable to heal 5-man content?
---
Yeah, abosolutely. Until you reach endgame dungeons, you don't actually need to be heal-specced to be an effective healer in 5-man content. Though if you're leveling as Feral, you'll want to keep a separate set of int gear if you want to heal in dungeons, because past level 35 or so, the Mana requirements of healing dungeons start to be too much to handle with no int.
---
&gt;Also, are there any addons that show other players' health bars above their heads without having to mouse over them?
---
There are addons that do this, but you can do this in the default Blizzard UI too. It's under nameplates options, and there's a keybond to toggle on and off friendly nameplates.
---
Jimmies: rustled
---
Feels bald man
---
Yeah but he will bring trash alliance who ninja.
---
Shortage? I'm considering quitting already because my guild has too many tanks and I spend most of mc playing with my dick instead of bringing anything useful 90 percent of the time

can anyone provide a mirror. google throttled the request and I can't download it anymore :(

So far every undead I've meg who wasn't grey level to me tries to gank me even if I see them on critical health and just wave at them previously. Is BBC nnn there a reason for this? Tauren for some reason seem way more chill than any undead I've met
---
Not sure what you mean. Arms is quite fun to tank with. Lots of bouncing between the three stances, utilizing all your warrior skills. Battle stance for charge, thunderclap, and overpower; defensive stance for threat; berserker stance for whirlwind and berserker rage. 
---
It also does more aoe threat than prot. Single target threat, I'll grant you, is better as deep prot. And if you have dps who are really pushing you on single-target threat, than they're probably raid geared, and if you aren't raid geared and they are, than yeah, it's gonna be rough.
---
Sorry if I rambled a bit, but I'm not exactly sure what point you're trying to make :(
---
Edit: I think part of my problem is I have no idea who Swifty is, but apparently he is awful lol.
---
who cares if they are trying to fix it, they've had this issue since wotlk
---
You okay fam?
---
Op found someone who happens to use  not only a similar Nick name. Roll not only on the same server (no idea if op lives in a similar region still.) But the same faction. Happen to be a similar level...  And end up getting partied up for uldaman in the exact same evening? Without both playing the same roll. Odds seem pretty damn low.
---
Though not as low as when I can't find that last quest item I need in classic...
---
I deserve my best in slot chest piece that dropped, yes.
---
25% stun resist
---
Even worse. “Okay” “yes” lol wtf
---
Asmon can go fuck himself. Fucking no life scamming douche.
---
Best quality of life is binding strafe left and right to a and D, then use Q and E as keybinds! Turning with the buttons is redundant as you do it way more smoothly and precise with the mouse
---
It's called "He isn't going to leave and is trolling you"
---
No, it's because you sound like white trash
---
No way. Same here.
---
not a chance, i like the OP will heal or tank instances and not a chance i am passing on dps gear.  expecting your tanks and healers to pass leveling gear to dps because they are filling that roll is bullshit and clearly you dont tank or heal
---
What caused this?
---
Ahhhhhh... posting on reddit because someone put you on ignore. Have you put your ego back together yet?
---
Making reddit mad isn't bannable.
---
Stop spamming asmongold shit, nobody cares
---
What a bald fake drama baby bitch.
---
Can you losers go away?
---
I believe AOE spells are just auto at 33% max.
---
Channeled spells are 100% but calculated over the duration of the channel so effectively 12.5% per tick for blizzard.  You will not get the full 100% per tick it is calculated over the entire channel duration.
---
Off the top of my head but Google wow spell damage calculations and youll get all the numbers.
---
Very much so. You can (and should, to make life easier for yourself) be fully dps specced and be just fine healing 5 man content until you get to endgame dungeons. How far into level 60 dungeons you can heal depends entirely on your own skill, but anytphing up to and including BRD will definitely be possible. Just keep in mind that you'll need to keep a 2nd set of gear on hand, don't go healing in str/agi gear!
---
//forgot to answer the second question
---
To show friendly health bars you should be able to just hit alt+v, that'll bring up the default bars above players. ..at least I think that's what the keybind is. It's definitely a base feature though, you should find it somewhere in your interface options.

If you come across Fattymash as horde on Whitemane. Do yourself a favor and find someone else.

I found a fucking Robe of Insight. It could have been a Warden Staff or Edgemasters, or a Underworld Band ...or a Kang. Bascially any Epic in that Range is better. ._.
---
Sold it for 105g was pretty happy cuz I left work early to chill and play lol
---
Never seen a child with a beard before.
---
At this point anything is better. It took me an hour to get into BRD last night after dying consistently all the way through, and instantly dying on rez's every time. I died around 25 times. The group did 2 Arena runs in the time it took me to go from Searing Gorge into the instance.
---
happy to spot the another pair of GROB MOB!

TBC was absolutely incredible. Wow has declined but it didn’t start with TBC.
---
Asmongold is a trash human being. I’m not giving him or any content related thereto direct clicks.
---
Move along.
---
you shouldn't be buying gear if you're not 60 in the first place. waste of gold. you don't need the best gear for your level for both sets. over time you should build up items for each set, and people (in all of my experience) don't care if you dont have all int gear, as long as you play your class decently.
---
On your launcher do you see a drop down menu above play for Warcraft?
---
You telling me that my comment was out of place and that I shouldn't take it seriously was telling me I couldnt voice my opinion. My comment itself was something semi related to an unnecessary overreaction by the op for thinking this person was a pedophile because they were asking about their age, which is ridiculous, and you felt the need to butt in and bitch. I dont have yo put up with that shit from some geek.
---
Rouge has to be the #1
---
No :)
---
Enhance should always have been a tank spec.
---
Really enjoyed your art, would love to support you but sadly I can't right now
---
Or go as healer but state at beginning you're rolling on ret. If they say u cant then heal the next group
---
I would've liked it more if the majority of the zone wasn't an Indiana Jones reference.
---
Is this on the twitch / curse app ? I can't find the addon.
---
Lol to think that I might be ganking your 60 year old mom someday :).
---
Also on ally side Pyrewood here, good to know.
---
it'll calm down man. just wait it out. give it an hour at most.
---
Of course I do! You have so much information about me.  I must be white trash because I didn't agree with you. I'm devastated, truly.
---
This is literally how classic was. There were exceptions where some people would be allowed to spec off the meta, but that was within guild groups. Wow has become too much about min/maxing and everyone thinks it's the only way to play. My only suggestion would be to find a guild that will take you for what you want to play.
---
There are plenty of tanks. People just don't like tanking because it means that we must deal with bad DPS that can't grasp the most basic common sense.
---
Blizzard has made it pretty clear that they don't want to change anything with gameplay, even if it's bad because that's what makes it Classic. True Ret paladins aren't good however the non hardcore guilds will most probably allow you to play ret and if you feel like you're being put into a role you dislike in dungeons, try making your own groups or tell the group leader beforehand you want to play as ret.
---
That's good to hear. All of the Hunter info I've poured over has given me the impression that I need to forget about certain pet types in general, giving me false impressions. Taste over efficiency is how I'd like it.
---
Thanks for the info. Lightening Breath it is.
---
He did, thanks
---
I'm interested in protecting pally, how does it work? Run into mobs then pop consecrate?
---
Yay a show that's ruining my saturday leveling.
---
It's gonna be a no from me dawg.
---
Op this is an advanced meme. Should I file it under World of Trailercraft, Trailerpark of Warcraft or Worldpark of Warboys
---
you right. also the idiot thinks I'm gonna quit cuz of him. lolz
---
In my experiance start them out doing something like a profession to get them hooked, for my friend it was Engineering. She wanted to build all the cool on use items so she had to farm to build them.
---
Hahaha, please quit. Nothing of value was lost.
---
Its so obvious he's here to piss everyone off. yikesmoncringe is here for content plain and simple.
---
it happens man, you'll get gear better pretty soon. i know it sucks a fucking lot to get ninjad, but on the bright side you're still levelling so gear upgrades are common.
---
\*these are the realms we as streamers said we'd play on so we don't ruin the game experience of other people because they deserve to have a good classic experience too\* Asmon: Fuck it, the only experience that matters is mine.

This is such bullshit. Him and his community are going to just fuck the server. This was supposed to be streamer free.
---
Can you please go to an alliance dominated realm, the horde population on Herod already outnumber Alliance by so much. =(
---
The crybabies and whiners throwing fits are hilarious. They have no idea how much he owns them by the reactions they give and attention they give.
---
they took my money either way 🤣
---
Well your fairness is causing 100% of people to list things st 1c to make the AH a pain in the ass for new players to use.
---
Not to be that guy, but Else is an actual name.
---
&gt; So I have to ask, how in the world did you level cooking up to 300 and not notice that the food it gives you buffs your stamina and spirit?
---
How in the world did manage to miss the sarcasm in that?
---
It was a warrior yes, but the hunter didn't need the crossbow so there was no need for reservation thankfully.
---
This is why he is rolling there. He is trolling Herod players who don't want streamers to come. 
---
It's likely the joke will get old sooner rather than latter.
---
I was 99% sure I was correct but I keep seeing memes about hunters “needing” on items like what I mentioned above so I wasn’t sure if I was missing something
---
Well played rogues are amazing in 5 mans, and excellent DPS in raids. Interrupts, CC, CC mid fight, stuns and poisons all have potential utility to a group. A good rogue can make a dungeon a breeze. There’s also rogues who just do none of that and hit things. Be the first and you’ll find lots of groups.
---
q e z x c t the one next to 1, and if you're like me, bind ctrl to mouse4 so you can use ctrl+ all those keys, and ctrl+shift+ all those buttons. And then there's Alt as well, can do the same with that.
---
The whole point is that the horde are teaming with alliance which is tos
---
I honestly feels bad for the people of Herod, that’s why whitemane is the best realm if you can get past the fact 99% of horde don’t speak English
---
I got mine on curseforge. (not sure if I'm allowed to link here)
---
"I just want to DPS!"
---
That's because they're idiots. I'm often asked to innervate by a healer and due to the fact that I am not a main tank (even if I am off-tanking) or that I'm DPSing at the time, I am able to dish out DPS or off-tank as well as pop out when it's a good time and give the healer an innervate.
---
I've saved a whole lot of groups from wiping due to that fact alone or being able to at any time start tanking or emergency heal.
---
Or the fact that I can res the healer in the middle of combat.
---
Anyone would be stupid not to want a feral Druid. Feral can't heal for a long period of time but it's a fact that they can easily save a group from a wipe - even a raid.
---
And whether or not people like it or want to admit it, bears are as capable of tanking for most raids. They are for damn sure superior for 5 man. 
---
That said, no tank is useful with groups or raids that can't get it through their heads how to manage their own threat.
---
You know...sexually...
---
For tour next character focus on killing greens, get skinning and vendor most of it. I'd recommend an addon that tells you which quest rewards vendor for the most.
---
Yeah I mean, something like a cat or raptor would be, in terms of numbers, *better damage* than your wind serpent, but it's a really, really small difference in your overall damage output, and I'm of the mind that when the difference is so minor, it's better to just go with whatever you find the coolest. WoW is a game, after all.
---
And tank
---
Trash Made is what my mum calls me.

---
I never played feral in tbc but as a warrior in the raid I loved hearing that noise
---
keep doing it.  blizz can ban you for any reason regardless and change their ToS whenever they want.  once layering is gone people, mostly everyone is 60 except for the losers, everybody will be bitching here and on forums and blizzard will do just that.
---
While I always pay mages that aren't in my party if i randomly w them to make food, 50s per stack is way too much.

I'd install it and check it out yourself, maybe you can find a video on it. It makes it feel more like a quest giver talking to you than reading from a scroll.

You can speed up the text or make it so you can click through it if you read faster than the default as well.
---
I find the text itself is also a lot cleaner and digestible than default font.

The art style is simple but cute, love it! Reminds me of the old The Flaming Ruby comics.
---
Please tell your wife this should be a regular thing from your adventures together
---
Why is that weird? There is 15 million daily twitch users and it’s actually amazing for managing addons and keeping them up-to-date with *one click*.
---
24 hours gives you a better chance to sell and therefore keep 100% of your deposit though.
---
24 hours also works during any time of day, where 2h and 8h can be entirely off-peak hours.
---
And you're talking about PvPing
---
48 is actually the half way point in terms of xp needed. 43 is half way in terms of mobs you need to kill.
---
I'm sure he'll have no trouble at all finding a guild. Warrior DPS are in high demand- because they are the strongest physical dps. There is comparatively more competition for tank slots since as you mention there are significant numbers of warriors that think they want one of the 2-4 tank spots in a 40 man raid... We had to CUT tanks for MC.
---
Furthermore there's nothing wrong with a player wanting to play a specific role if they accept it may have consequences like more difficulty filling a group. Just because someone wants groups to have accountability doesn't mean they have a bad attitude. What is toxic is trying to pressure someone into playing something they don't want to play.

Turning with buttons is nice when you're left hand moving only, like, when you're  readin somethin on the phone with your right hand etc. But I've never needed to strafe without being able to hold down LMB. So why have special buttons for strafe?

As a lvl 60 warrior tank it's just incredibly draining. Most players don't have the patience required to actually let you do your thing, hell I had to legit yell at people because they simply forgot how tanking was working back in the day. This isn't retail, guys. I can't just charge in, thunderclap all the mobs together and you can start AOE nuking. That's not how this works in classic, it's supposed to be a very methodical dismantling of trashpacks that are outnumbering your party. And this is coming from somebady that wanted to tank classic again because it's the most demanding thing to do, but it also can be almost too demanding. As I said earlier, draining is probably the best word I can find to describe it. Let me give you guys an example of Strat Living from a tanks perspective, averaged over a couple dozen runs:
---
You all enter the dungeon, buffs get shared and you pull the first pack. You charge in, thunderclap and then swap to defstance and you hear a slight humming in the background. The rogue unstealthes and ambushes the one elite mob that's in the trashpack while you slowly come to terms with the fact that the humming is actually slowly manifesting into blue crystals that rain from the sky. At this point you've swapped into defstance, have ~10 rage left and you start tab-sundering but that's obviously not enough to hold aggro against these wildly differing DPS approaches. Oh and the first mobs start breaking away from you and run towards the mage that is still happily channeling his blizzard into the cluster of mobs that's slowly walking towards him at this point. As a tank you either start trying to grab those mobs back with intercepts, taunts and more sunders OR you actually focus on the elite mob that is now starting to chip away at the rogues jaw. 
---
Fast forward to a later scene, still Stratholme: You've entered the church-area on crusader square and it's getting interesting. Not only does the very basic infantry mob disarm you if you have insulted them and their mother hard enough by spamming taunt, they also start randomly charging your casters. Every single pull in the crusade part of stratholme requires your full attention. You cannot slack or your group will feel the repercussions of your mistake. Didn't mark properly? Now the Scarlet Battlemage sheeped your priest and you're about to die. 
---
After hating your life choices for every second you're almost at Balnazzar, but Archivist is first. Pretty easy bossfight and will you look at that? Righteous orb dropped, fuck yeah. Everyone but the rogue rolls greed, he chooses need because he wants to get crusader on his sacred charge. As a friendly reminder: Back in classic it was common courtesy to give the orbs to the tanks because they cannot farm anything on their own. Wanna go get some thorium? Well, everyones trying to get their hands on that. Runecloth? Fuck no, you need like 40 seconds to down a single mob. Elemental fire in arathi highlands? Well, that could work if the competition wasn't so incredibly high.
---
Oh and on TOP of that you also have the highest repair costs because you wear plate. Speaking of gear: You'll get everything you want, because paladins are usually locked into healing if they want to raid and you simply have the authority to say "I want hand of justice if it drops" which for me personally lead to being almost fully pre-raid BIS equipped in two days of spamming dungeons, combined with a bit of luck. Why should I run Scholo over and over again if I don't need anything from there?
---
It's pretty far from optimal for quite a few reasons but it's definitely more fun and it certainly works. 
---
Most group quests will likely be impossible to solo, at least without Prep for 2x evasions. This isn't really a big deal though, there's not many of these and you can always skip them if you can't find another person to help.
---
Any advantage you gain from the high burst is more than outweighed by things like time-between-kills and managing multiple mobs. With equal gear and weapons, sub will have lower kill times on average but much higher time-between-kills due to the high energy costs, slow stealth speed, positional requirement (distract costs 30 energy or 4 seconds of time). Not to mention Ambush can and will miss/be dodged which costs a lot of time because you will either have to vanish (and hope you don't need it again for at least 5 minutes) or swap to a non-dagger and slowly kill the mob like a sub-optimal combat rogue. Then throw in Blade Flurry, Riposte, and things like Weapon Expertise (way under-appreciated for leveling), combat will just have a much more reliable and efficient experience.
---
Combat is incredibly boring and I hate everything about it but it's by far the better leveling spec and unfortunately, it's basically required if you want to raid as well.
---
There’s an episode of trailer park boys, one of the newer seasons, where bubbles is brewing beer. And they had the alchemy potion making sound in the background
---
Maybe even a *whole gold*.
---
&gt; How is shadow in PVP? Can you actually gear up as a shadow priest?
---
Shadow priest are good in 1v1. They aren't *as* desired for organized PvP. They go oom quick (you have to downrank dmg spells in PvP too, to play effectively). They have a really simple gameplay.
---
&gt; Which is considered better in BGs: spriest or warlock?
---
Warlocks. Top tier burst and good CC. They are very good in both organized PvP and pug BGs as well as any other kind of PvP. It is a very desired class.
---
&gt; Which is better for soloing at endgame? (Like farming, rep grinding, and anything else that can be done solo)
---
Warlock. It has more farming options. 
---
&gt; Best Warlock Race?
---
Orc on horde (stun resist) is probably one of the most OP race/class combos in the game. However, Undead is not terrible. Gnome (escape artist) &gt; human.
---
&gt; Thing is, I've heard that Alliance warlocks are at a severe disadvantage in PVP, since undead have WotF.
---
True, but once you get really good gear you wont have any trouble killing rogues who jump you. Warlocks just scale incredibly well with gear.
---
Also, warlock is the burst class on alliance in organized PvP.
---
His stream currently has 2/3rd of the Mercedes super bowl stadium watching, not sure how that’s dying. I may not like what he is doing right now but to say it’s dying is actually retarded.
---
Heroic strike can be turned on/off because it only activates on your next melee swing. It's not an instant weapon strike like execute or mortal strike. Spamming any ability doesn't do anything though because there's still a gcd for everything.
---
How does this relate to asmon?
---
no they werent
---
Oh yeahh...The horde...forgot about them, which is the way I like it ;)
---
Lets just turn this around. Entitled boomers feel like they should have first dibs by birthright
---
If the Alliance are hunting him the high level Horde should let it happen. See what happens when Him and his low level mob get wiped repeatedly. He will leave then.
---
Yeah this sucks and after Blizzard said no streamers could be on Herod!
---
... oh wait...
---
Surely you understand the difference between the word DYING and DEAD. Considering at the start of launch he had 100k+ viewers and thats only been DYING sense launch. Also why I said he feels like he has to do this to stay relevant IN HIS MIND. People ;like asmon are so egoistical that yes, in asmond's mind, hes dying.
---
Over at rattlegore we would like horde. You're always welcome.

---
The fact that you people get so butthurt is actually hilarious. imagine being this upset about streamers.
---
I feel some of the more hardcore guilds are the most casual. The faster you clear content the less raid days you have. My guild clears both ony and Mc in under three hours. But some guilds will not prioritize loot for someone who can't make every raid.
---
But tbh, my guild is currently recruiting casuals, we don't need someone to make every raid, we need someone we can swap in and out when they are available and to fill up our west coast raid.
---
RIP Alliance to Horde ratio. Already 65:35...
---
I did the exact opposite, got a druid to 31 then rerolled a paladin.
---
You aren't forced to be the healer, you are choosing to be healer. They can ask you to heal, and you can say no. And they also have the right of not taking a Ret Paladin into their group.
---
The issue with minor buffs and nerfs it is actually a very slippery slop. Buffs and nerfs aren't an exact thing, making something like Ret paladins better changes the meta in a massive way, and could lead to more buffs/nerfs being needed.
---
Best just be upfront with the groups you join. Tell them you are mainly a DPS, will/willnot heal for the group, and that you will be rolling on Strength gear and healing gear.
---
Just this video and the seconds of hearing him talk gives me the same feeling

He's not in the dark about why people don't want him there. He specifically chose Herod because it would piss the most people off. 
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/RelatedAdorableBeefPlanking
---
He's just saying that "We are people too" and "You can't tell us where we can play" stuff in order to make people even more mad. He's also showing the Reddit posts in his stream so that his viewers can enjoy the pain you are expressing in your comment. Just so you are aware.
---
you could you know stop giving him attention
---
Auctioneer will tell you the last sell price and the current moving rate. That should help. Unless the item hasn’t been sold on ah in your realm yet.
---
Solo grinding mauradon around that level should be good.
---
As a tank thats what we do. Running guildies through dungeons. Sure i could go solo farm something or whatever but theres alot more going on than just collecting orbs.
---
I had one and can’t find it for the life of me. I would love one right now, it is relevant again
---
Bald fan mad
---
You know how to make Asmongold reluctant to not play on Herod? Buy store mounts. If he plans on playing on Herod I will make it my goal to be that player to give that 0.1% sell increase to Blizzard on store mounts. Stay if you want Asmon, just ask yourself is it worth it if 1 or maybe more players join my protest and buy store mounts the longer your on Herod. The choice is yours. I'll speak with my wallet and get every store mount possible including the bad ones if you plan on staying.

Absolute 0 aggro applying on all party 3 consecutive times, after a gun pull

Just need more people to do their part. But yea I know what you mean.
---
Imagine being this upset by a streamer. Stupid nostalgic boomers think they'll relive the original wow experience again. classic is a different game.
---
It was his roommates wife's boyfriend who did it.
---
Nice...
---
I am sorry to be "that guy" on this thread - but you admit yourself you barely get to play, but yet you think they should change the game from what it is to suit you better?? 
---
I know its annoying but its the same for warriors. They are brought to groups thinking they will dps and then end up being "nominated" to tank it. Vanilla class balance sucks - we all know, but changing class balance is bad. Every class has a hard counter and doing this will change that quite a bit.
---
Ninja looting logic
---
I have been fishing for a few hours because I'm at work and can't actively play. Work as been slow enough that I can mindlessly fish. 
---
I hearthed to org and started selling my fish and on the AH and checking my mail before buying more lures and heading to a new location. When checking my mail I get locked off and a message that my accounts suspended. 
---
No GM tried to interact with me and I was actively chatting with my guild. They must have some type of bot(irony right?) doing these bans without verification, based on thresholds.
---
I see Elder Scrolls reference, i vote up!
---
Trolls have Hex of Weakness (mini mortal strike) and shadowguard which procs Blackout. It's really good.
---
“*was* in the TOS back in the day”
---
“*is* in the current EULA”
---
Can you spot the difference?
---
No they did it on private servers because it wasn’t bannable there
---
Cross faction collusion was bannable and got you banned in Vanilla.
---
Since this has been moved to the internet and has become better over time and the advancement of playing, what makes this special?
---
Aleays preferred the theme of dark magic so Warlocks was always the choice.
---
But in general Mages got mobility, kiting, rooting, a nice self heal and a half decent cc, Locks on the other hand got tankiness, CC, self sufficency in combat(mages have that outside combat, pets(a hassle if you don't know how to use them well or a massive advantage if you do).
---
It looks like you were banned for botting

No. literally sitting here fishing while work was slow. 
---
You can see my details here https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ddsf35/suspended_for_6_months_for_fishing_too_much/f2miool/
---
Yes combat can pull multiple mobs, but it still costs them a ton of hp.  
---
Any speed you gain from multi pulls is basically lost by the fact that you have to eat more frequently.  
---
you still get the 5% hit from combat (unless you're going CB/Prep) if you're going sub daggers, so I don't really see how that's a factor.
---
When I hit a rut I like to work on fishing/first aid/ all professions. Just something a little different.

"I can't answer a simple question, better call other people retarded"
---
Yep nothing else we can do to keep sanity
---
Making idiots like you upset isnt bannable.
---
Welcome to the cringe compilation
---
IIRC swifty was not actually trying to f the server, it just happened to to mass of people
---
whats going on here is intentional
---
Semi hardcore is more prominent for me, Europe.
---
But yes it's been around since even vanilla. OP is just clueless.
---
This is a private sever gimmick and was bannable in Vanilla.
---
So bannable now. Cross server collusion has no place here.
---
Nostalgia, mostly. It also has little lore peices for each race and dungeon.
---
Which is sad as hell.  Anyone that donates to him needs their head checked.
---
explain how anything he is doing is against blizzard tos.
---
Nobody thinks like that retard.
---
Asmon just made a Horde toon on Herod is why.... xD
---
He is bored right now cause he blew through all the content and they only thing he has to look forward to is his weekly raid lockouts because he isn't going to do any rep farms (actually he bought his Thorium brotherhood up in one week from people giving him money).
---
I expect him to go back to retail soon or to continue stunts like these.
---
It'd actually be \*less\* resources used just to use the same armor texture for both sexes instead of making a separate one for males and females, one skimpy and one not. I think you're being silly. Men deserve skimpy slutmog outfits too, and it's questionable that they don't get to have it and only women do.
---
If you're using cheapshot (no positional requirement), you don't really need those 10 points in sub if you're fighting mobs your level or lower.
---
Practice stealthing as close as possible to the mob as you approach. If you do it right you can stealth basically at the same time the mob aggros, it runs to you, and you cheapshot as it gets in range and before it breaks the stealth.
---
Pretty much eliminates the time-cost in stealthing between mobs.
---
VLC has this option aswell
---
Auctioneer tells you what people list things for, but has no idea if sales are actually being made at that price. Which is what the question is looking for. There isn't any reliable way to track that, other than seeing if its the same person listing an item day after day.
---
Add this one, confirmed to work (substitute name of junkbox):
---
 #showtooltip  
---
/use junkbox  
---
/cast Pick Lock  
---
/use junkbox
---
...There's an extra space infront of the showtooltip since I don't know how to get around the Reddit formatting.
---
This thing would have been over within 5 minutes if no one had given him any attention.
---
Were you using Fishing Buddy or any add ons that may have made it look like you were botting?

Okay......
---
Imagine having no social life or friends to where you get validation by throwing money at a streamer for him to say your name
---
Probably overlap in typing. Looks like the "yes" was to "miner????"
---
You don't think "if you need for purely monetary reasons, that's a ninja" is a valid point?
---
I highly doubt asmon thinks he is dying. You understand most people on twitch are characters right? Having an insane jump then drop isn’t dying, that’s how hype works. But I get where you’re coming from

Time to make yet another reddit thread about how streamer is ruining muh classic vanilla experience and then get even more mad when I get made fun of
---
A very dedicated Horde.
---
I have a # sold and an average of those sold, and a current moving price. So maybe I have a different add-on but I don’t think I do...
---
Getting stunned is the worst thing that can happen to a warlock because they have no way to get out of it. Warlock PvP trinket removes Fear, Polymorph and Charm effects. The only stun a warlock can remove is paladin Hammer with Felhunter's Devour Magic.
---
Furthermore, it's a very common CC. 25% additional resist chance to that is just very effective for everyone. Even moreso for a warlock.
---
Well, if you don't know, how do you expect me to know?

Essence of fire  -&gt; essence of earth transmute will make you x3 the amount of gold

My progamer tip : cry into a pillow after the hunter ninjas a fucking warrior/ pally weapon with the completely wrong stats for them.
---
Ugh, these post are annoying. Just let it go, he'll stop soon.
---
The flexibility of our language to be understandable even when mangled and broken thanks to context is what has allowed it to conquer the world and become THE language of the international stage.

Fussing over and trying to maintain the purity of the language is what has lead to the fall of the French and Chinese empires.

Neither is your keyboard it seems.

searing pain for aggro
---
soul link for mitigation
---
DS -&gt; vw -&gt; sac for more mitigation or you can sac -&gt; hellfire for aoe threat
---
here's a nice video on the topic: https://youtu.be/Jh1dGAEbdIs
---
Are you saying that the rallying cry... doesnt go out during the ony attune quest roleplay?
---
That's what I meant
---
Adding to what others have mentioned so far, your combat tree will have a talent that slightly helps. Keep an eye out for that.
---
That email says 1 thing and you are saying something else. It’s above any of us here. No way to confirm and verify any of this
---
problem is if you're specced into siphon life, you can't have soul link, which is crucial to lock tank spec.
---
true lock tank spec (although still meme spec, it's viable with a willing group for endgame dungeons) requires 31 demo for SL and probably DS for quick vw sacs
---
Ele is surprisingly strong. Just wear a staff with decent DPS and you have like 80% of the right click damage of an enh shaman with the added benefit of throwing nuclear bombs at anything within range.
---
You can macro pick pocket into a stealth opener like cheapshot so it just automatically does it, helps a bit with getting junkboxes.
---
Or she may just be the one ganking you one day
---
ambush does not fall off damage wise wtf.  it scales insanely.  250% weapon damage plus 290...  With opportunity the damage is pretty absurd when it crits.  I was hitting 1k ambush crits routinely in the early 40's.  
---
Won't deny that stone golems which are immune to gouge are a pain in the ass, but turtles are fine.
---
Go Druid
---
Slower weapon is more base damage for bigger overpower, WW, MS and cleave. That's the main point, not hamstring kiting.
---
because an entitled PoS is lagging out an entire server because people dont like him? yea, id be super pissed too if it was my server on a day off
---
riptose does almost a much as a backstab for 10 energy its damage is far from underwhelming
---
Find some guild mates and spam sm
---
It has not. People have tried to answer it using flawed logic and/or assuming the person is acting irrationally.
---
Sorry **you** can**'**t, read or see.
---
He dyes his hair now obviously : P

But the constant complaints are exactly what created retail. You canr just pick and choose Which AlL changes to make without enraging the community
---
All those Horde who I helped kill mobs with. You are the mob now. /sob
---
Sounds like they started the quest, not you. They likely got the click on 'accept quest' button juuuuuust before you clicked it leading you to think you'd done it yourself.
---
No we’re not, I still hate him
---
&gt;the kind of elitism
---
there we are. it's 2019, where buffing people with stuff that only costs mana is now considered elitism. 👏👏
---
Which, I hate to say it, is one of the reason I find some female streamers to be so immensely boring. Their chat/followrrs are typically quite embarrassing too.
---
There are some female streamers that are fucking awesome though, and they are the ones that don't get all dolled up and just be real on stream. I'm sure this comment will get white knighted but I find it to be more common than not.
---
what do you mean by "past 100 energy through regen"?
---
I'm the same way honestly. I've been focusing on my Alchemy because I know as soon as I hit 60 and start pumping out Flasks or Transmutes, the money will start pouring in.
---
imagine not being able to use any lfg/trade system because thousands of "invite to asmon" spams happening, can't even play the game...
---
Ayyyy weed lmao
---
Thank you. I pride myself on originality and never using overused or unoriginal Reddit comments.
---
Ironic isn't it, you're the one who can't see that there's multiple steps to crafting the robe, yet I'm retarded and don't understand gear can have multiple steps.
---
The only way you can possibly argue this isn't a ninja loot is if you think winning the pattern means the bop robe suddenly appears in the inventory.
---
Nice to know my Tauren has some great armor to look forward to.
---
Sorry, this is a low res version of the artwork. In the high res version the color of some lines is red, representing scars. 
---
Also, the way I interpreted him, seeing as he is seen being a bully when little, I thought he would be older than Renault Mograine. Aaaaand have you seen official artwork of Renault? He resembles a 35-40 year old man.
---
As a non-Herod player I look forward to this war between the Twitch and Classic community.
---
Yeah plus you get to enjoy lifelong RSI from all the sit/stand spamming you do to abuse the batching system!
---
that progession doesn't really exist for alliance.  No outlaw sabre, no wingblade, and the quest that gives the sword of omen also gives a very good blue dagger.
---
Lots of the same soundbytes are used in a lot of different places. Once you really remember one, you start hearing it everywhere.
---
For example the sound effect when you plopped down a police station in Sim City 2000. I hear that a lot in TV shows and movies when they want to put in background noise of a police radio.
---
hope u are banned :\^)
---
wasnt talking about classic, retail
---
Tranq shot is required for raids so its optimal to bring a handful of hunters
---
I said that the other day and got downvoted for it. He wants the hate and negative attention.
---
Its an AoE comp featuring a priest, three mages, and either a lock, tank, or another mage depending on the dungeon. The -cleave naming convention evolved from an old cleave-based comp name from TBC arena; when other irregular comps were devised they were given names like beastcleave, shadowcleave, etc.
---
Why do you think your position is the default.
---
yep it is all about finding that common ground in order to get a group together being honest about reserving items and not being a loot whore about it. that crossbow might the only thing the warrior tank needs for his pre-raid BiS if he didn't reserve it or even mention this is the only item he needs and set to group loot it would be outragous to need roll the crossbow if the hunter also needs it but it is also the only reason the tank is even there tanking.
---
people calling it abusive to reserve items needs to learn to set standards for yourself and simply not join the groups that gose to far for you.
---
Why? They basically rolled out the velvet carpet for him. Why wouldn't he take the opportunity to thank them? Have you not seen how people have talked about him, his friends and his family?
---
No-one playing on Herod is a victim.
---
Thank you nonetheless!
---
These threads are golden for Asmon, too. Everything is content, and as much as people hate to admit it, he is really good at turning anything big or small into content. 
---
If you go in with that mindset you will understand everything he does. Dude's getting paid, and all the more power to him for it.
---
Agreed, I am just frustrated and wanted to talk about it.
---
It made me start watching trailer park boys for the first time. Boo on the mods.
---
Feels good to be a European today.
---
But then what's happening when you reach a city? If you die/feign death he resets and runs back or does he just go nuts and messes things up?
---
Also don't guards pull aggro off you instantly at the gates?
---
My wife leveled a melee character first, and I held her hand a lot. She got to raiding and realized she didn't just *not care for* tanking, she really disliked it. She re-rolled a mage and I kinda just let her do her thing (I was trying to get ready for raiding on my main). She blossomed into a heck of a mage, did her own research once she hit max level and got all the details on ideal spec, spell rotation, etc. She had a BLAST playing mage and was known for damn good DPS in raids, too.
---
Sometimes (even unintentionally) you have to just let them sink or swim on their own. Just be there for them when they need help :)
---
Yes. The quick scans results are identical to the slow scan. Do a scan Wednesday night for midweek data and Saturday night for weekend data for a couple weeks. You can certainly do a daily scan but it might be overkill.
---
If you invest some research time into how auctioneer works you can easily make a bunch of money with only about 30 minutes of your time at the  auction house window.

"Can you try. Not. To hit. Every. SINGLE. One?!"
---
/wave
---
I honestly think Asmon is cool, but I wanted to play on a server without huge streamers. That’s why I chose Herod.
---
This is kind of a dick move, since a lot of the streamers seemed to understand that some people simply didn’t want that element on their server, and that’s why they decided to play on Faerlina, because they decided to be considerate of others and make the most amount of people happy.
---
A specific streamer server was announced, and everyone who wanted to play with them could do so, and everyone who didn’t can choose another server. Now, over a month down the line, when everyone makes their characters and puts time into them, he chooses to switch servers. Not to mention Herod is already teetering on a Horde majority, so this would further imbalance the server.
---
Asmon can do what he wants. It’s only a game after all. This is really selfish though, hopefully he reconsiders for the sake of people who don’t hate streamers but just wanted to enjoy a server closest to what we had in 2004. I’m sure he can understand that, considering he loves the game so much himself.
---
If you’re reading Asmon, we love you, but please give us a break dude.
---
this is fucking amazing, more please!
---
I swear you're drawing at the same pace and places I'm leveling
---
Distract costs energy so it causes energy to start to regen. If you use your opener when 95 is going to tick up to 100 (it takes a bit of practice) you’ll get the full energy amount instead of 5 since you used more. Not sure if that made sense
---
I'll probably level an ez mode class to farm gold for me.
---
I've been sitting in SM and Arathi for the longest time trying to avoid having to go to STV for this reason haha. I just need a break from all the ganking so I can actually level and complete quests :/
---
It's not. But for some people turning that screenshot into another form of media is rocket science.
---

I have never had this issue, people generally give me what I want or I will dump their asses 2 bosses in and find a group that can live with a pally tank.

Avoidance is still mitigation. In fact, it's 100% mitigation on proc.

---
I'm not part of any cross faction collusion, I made this ticket to ask for help on getting those people doing it banned.
---
Yes blizzard can change their ToS, I'm hoping they will. But I seriously doubt blizzard will mass ban players for cross faction collusion just because we cry on reddit about it.
---
I actually do to train weapon skills!
---
Not only this, but it helps everyone get geared.
---
By reserving the crossbow, people who want the crossbow will find another group where no one needs it, so instead of having 1 group where 2 people roll for it and 1 where no one wants it, there's 2 groups with 1 person needing in each.
---
Blizzard stated that they do not support it, and if you get scammed, you get scammed and will not get your gold back.  They did not say anything about punishment or being banned in the post I read.
---
Cab-net. Basically ignore the "i". Definitely a midwestern American thing, at the very least. I've never said it any other way, dont know that I care to try at this point.
---
This is legit. My alt grinding will be glorious. I love you!
---
I do use AHK on my work computer for repetitive tasks.
---
On a server where finding tanks is a PITA I see no harm in tanks reserving stuff, but watching dps have something on reserve then begging for tanks is 10/10 hilarious
---
Are you sure you didn't figuratively level them?
---

Not sure this is comparable since Azshara is the end boss of the third big raid of an expansion and green gear in Classic is in some cases as good as epics in retail

You're welcome. We, asmonslaves, looking forward to play together and enchancing your, oh i'm sorry, OUR server economy.

You already have Q and E as strafe by default.
---
If you use A and D for strafe (instead of turning) then you free up Q and E for important or frequently used buttons. If you're a melee class, mouse-turning is really REALLY helpful, so that means you don't need A and D for turning if you can do it with the mouse.
---
Everything you've said up till this point suddenly makes sense.

Yeah that's what I was going for, that's a better representation

I really wish there was a "pants" slot like the shirt slot, so we could have cosmetic underlining for skimpy leg armors, and remove the under-layer from existing leg armors. Then, you can choose to be skimpy or not.

Find a good fishing spot or just anywhere you can mindlessly kill enemies until your bags are full.  That way you are getting some xp at least but also making extra gold you otherwise wouldn’t have.

I play a priest as well and have had similar feelings every now and then.  I think its a “I’m nowhere near leveling/don’t know where to go” issue vs anything specific with priests.  There was a while in the 20’s and low 30’s where I would get 1-2 quests per zone and had to jump around continents a lot so I just fished and killed/skinned anything that came near me.
---

I leveled a rogue to near-max just to get the hang of mouse turning.

I never said you didnt. Ot doesnt change a single thing about my argument.

I think plater
---
I get that, but saying “speed 3.4” is a terrible way to convey that imo. 
---
How does it make sense for a weapon with a higher speed rating to have a slower attack speed? “This axe has a really high speed, therefore it must swing slowly”

So let me get this straight, as soon as he received the loot, it was a recipe in his trade skill without him doing anything else?

Recount add-on.

I've looked, what is the add-on called? I cant find it.

I was just about to write that.

But i was gonna add this:

Well to be clear, I was agreeing with you.

I have my wotlk guide. Waiting to be able to use it when patch 3.0 rolls out
---
Never seen this post before, very new and interesting
---
Thats a weird way to talk to your new leader
---
Hmm, might give it a shot. Figured it would be nice for when I go out for smoke breaks or watching some TV before bed, if it actually works decently well.
---
I don't think assmongold is a cool dude at all. He promotes ninja looting, griefing and general ass hattery. He's toxic and brings nothing but that sort of crowd around. He is literally the worst.

ah thanks for explaining

Yet everything you've said to assert i was a retard has been so disconnected from reality it's not even funny.
---
Free extra damage for warriors!
---
One of my favourite parts in that WoW movie (which wasn't THAT bad come on guys) was that rando Murloc
---
amazing how you can be that unlikable and uncharismatic, and still have such a decent following.
---
But it's an upgrade!
---
And I can use the melee stats for when I mongoose bite and raptor strike!
---
So Scarlet Monestary (a short run run from Under City) or RFK which is like directly across from SFK and a little south.
---
I'd run RFK once or twice it's super easy amd fairly short and has an escort quest at the end.  You probably have the quests from Ratchet already (for the sniffing goohers make sure you loot the crates near the guy left of the ratchet bank if you are facing the bakers so you can control the gophers).
---
After that go do some quests in another zone or bind yourself to UC and run SM until you get bored of it.
---
People who support things that you dont support are sheep. Got it.
---
I would just send him mail Rick Rolling him
---
Not always. As DPS I farmed the UBRS key and reserved Dal'rends and a lot of tanks didn't care because they wanted other items like the Carapace. So me and the tank would try to mostly get casters for Rend/Jed runs and it worked well.
---
I highly doubt he stays and actually puts in any time in it
---
May I ask what extensions for Firefox and Chrome are able to remove video ads?
---
I mean, If there was a way to prove it I would. I submitted an appeal, there's a decent amount of proof because I had been engaged in an active conversation with my guild. 
---
Honestly, I'm a good dude who just play to pass the time because work has been stupid slow.
---
But why tho :(
---
How high have you gotten them?
---
On early servers there won’t be much margin on low level items. With skinning, for example, I vendor everything until I start getting heavy leather.  Mining and herbalism mats don’t get very profitable until high level stuff either but most of the low level stuff is useful and has a low deposit so I would stockpile full stacks and just watch the market as servers get more money and economic movement.
---
Youre not doing yourself any better with this. You cant win this war. If your character and time you invested mean anything to you, then throw away your pride and suck it up. You've been harrasing Asmon, the Jesus of WoW, since classic was launched and when he strikes back you start crying? Well, too bad, the time has to come to pay for your sins.
---
They are going to upgrade it right to the vendor and we all know it.
---
Yup. Game is a disaster right now. I’ve bought the boe parts of all t0 sets for all the classes I might ever be interested in playing. Cost me like 18g. People are just dumping high level blues and boes in general for nothing.
---
Have you even played a warrior in classic?  Hamstring kiting is not viable because of the melee leeway that mobs get.
---
Maybe say something not retarded before you act like a smug little shit
---
It does matter. The dude pulled a dick move. Level does not diminish an asshole's actions.
---
i'm sure blizzard will get right on suspending someone for rolling on a server lmao
---
I didn't find it so I had to download the zip file and did it the old way.
---
Not to mention it's the most satisfying sound
---
I'll respect your prefrences when you dont sandbag raids. Fact of the matter is, on some classes like ele, balance, ret, etc you need to be elite in skill and gear to even hit the average geared and skilled meta classes. 
---
I'm raid leading, and have a prot paladin I cant decline because of politics. They don't get tanking assignments because they do not have the tools to take and establish aggro. The few times i've tried to delegate tanking responsibilities to them, they have shit the bed because of lack of taunt. 
---
Respecting everyone's choices is great right up until you need to rely on them to kill the boss. This isnt a single player game, there is a social metagame. Specific classes and specs have issues that can't be overcome, this isn't retail, this isnt a balanced game, this is Classic World of Warcraft, where balance is dogshit and you will be excluded from content in favor of more desirable players, based on your spec. 
---
Various roles need tools, and not all classes have all tools.
---
Can we just automod these threads. So sick of seeing this guys name.
---
No it is not great lore slow down enjoy the quests finish each zone and see where it tells you to go

Dont get it. Whats coming phase 2
---
definitely undead
---
I did all of SM yesterday! Glad to see I’m keeping pace with these releases! I’m encouraged to continue playing just so these moments are fresh in my mind. Keep it up!
---
Pre-raid BIS is bullshit. Just because some dude listed them on a wowhead guide or something everyone just wants those items and nothing else will do.
---
It’s ridiculous, just play, have fun, run dungeons and pick up loot. MC and ONY are not hard regardless of your gear...
---
Twist: use Together Forever instead.
---
This mentality is cancer. The worst part is that too many people believe this gatekeeping bullshit and would rather stick to their guns than contribute to the overall discussion.
---
You dont really go there to level is where I'm coming from.
---
Are tanking pets necessary or really helpful for questing? I'm at 20 and finishing up Silverpine Forest. I've tried both boar and cat and neither can hold aggro. Most comment I've seen just say get a cat for the dps. Thanks.
---
Miners not minors!
---
Haha, no good deed goes unpunished.  10 minutes later lowby horde is sitting there asking why the alliance are now killing him after so much peace.
---
You can get the swing timer add on if you don’t already have it (if you don’t have it absolutely get it). After getting this you can watch your damage knowing which hand is hitting as your hits appear.
---
Someone probably reported you for botting and a GM scanned your account actions and the AHK was flagged.
---
Im not sure how they conduct their scans and ban decisions, but im certain they don’t ban anyone for fishing too much or staying in the same place for hours.
---
Tanking is easy, herding the cats isn't.  DPS do alot to make your life hard when you try to tank.
---
Anyway, tanks are scarce to begin with, and have no incentive to do dungeons with you once they get the loot they need.  Sucks but it's the reality.
---
Sounds like this benefits blizzard and does nothing to effect Asmongold, be dumb with your wallet if you want!
---
It changes everything about your argument, because that's literally what's at the core of the issue here and since I, whom you've commonly refered to as "retard" or variations there of, is capable of understanding this, yet you seem unable to, what does that make you?
---
Honor gain.
---
Yeah this is true. Though it was funny.

He literally admitted to wanting to try to control the economy through gold donations.

Hey man your best success is to just let her do her own thing. Let her come to you for questions. 
---
As soon as you start telling her what to do and where to go she'll get frustrated and quit. Remember the first session is probably going to be something basic like learning how to move the camera, character, and interact with quests.
---
We all look back fondly on the discovery of the game and how noobish we were. Dont take that experience away from her!
---
It's time and effort put in outside of dungeons to level it, just like a profession. It's not something a rogue can just max out passively. Your warlock soul stone argument fails because that's something that can be done in the normal course of running the dungeon. Rogues have to go to obscure places for multiple hours to level lockpicking. 
---
That being said I let my groups roll on them, occasionally I'll tax them by taking the silver.
---
Its so you only have 4 movement keys as opposed to 6, this lets you reserve some of those great keys for spells instead!
---
How about BFD? Has a great wand but unsure good inn to be at for that
---
Who is this horsefaced cuck and why isn't he banned?
---
WoW is literally weird role play nonsense. (And it's fun.) What game are you playing?
---
I mean, what mage doesn't have tailoring?  We lvl it to get a chest piece and make bags.  But no, I didn't think to mention anything until the pattern dropped.
---
Id bang her
---
fingers crossed that the fact I was engaged in gchat helps my case but I have a feeling they dont actually review these things.
---
Thanks, mate! Glad you like 'em!
---
Warlocks healing/pets/dots/fear make them better at solo IMO having played both.  They arent as good at kiting and don't have feign death (though they do have a soulstone for instant revive once per 30 mins and a good way to regain health/mana when they want while fighting whereas the hunter will need to eat/drink).
---
The mentality that in actual Vanilla there were no “specs” or “roles” in the way Blizzard’s pruning and LFR has made it today?  That’s not cancer it’s reality.  You have a tool kit, by class, that you’re expected to use in order to help your group.  The “cancer” is the mentality that you shouldn’t have to do that which is what lead to the homogenization of classes and restriction of spells by spec not class retail has today.
---
no, thats the joke. no one promised anyone that servers would be "free" of streamers. anyone complaining just needs to deal with it. yeah, it might stink, but there is nothing wrong in specifically doing this in and of itself.

Good in theory, probably really disastrous in practice if it becomes meta. (If the notes are public that is like Yelp)
---
Were you clicking on the bobber yourself? Or just mindlessly pressing 1 and nothing else? 
---
They can see the exact timing you’re pressing your buttons so if you are using AHK for fishing you won’t get unbanned.
---
You didn't bind a key to Shift + whatever the key you're using for draing life is?
---
Can we talk about your action bars and keybinds?
---
Whats the joke? Its over my head.
---
Yup.  Faction imbalance destroys servers.  They're just not fun for either faction.
---
I levelled with a hybrid ass spec and respecced to combat around 52. That's the way I'd do it. Going back to daggers soon though I hope
---
wasn't it in vanilla?
---
similar to how focus functionality was in vanilla but they removed that
---
So in Russian Fozruk(Фозрук) sounds like Feezruk(Физрук) which means P.E. Teacher. And there is a tv show called Feezruk. So every time someone is looking for him, they call him Feezruk and the chat starts talking about the last season of tv show.
---
do you realize how delusional you sound? there's nothing reportable about rolling on a server and being popular
---
let me know when he's intentionally calling to crash servers, until then you're just mad
---
It's like the challenge of classic is patience.  If you blow through everything, you will get bored.
---
Blizzard likes to think pservers aren't a thing.
---
Fake news
---
happened all the time in vanilla dude
---
The thing is, if the stats of a weap of lvl 20 are the same as a lvl 40 there is no reason right
---
Maybe I'm crazy but energy is always ticking, regardless of it being capped or in combat. Just install an energy ticker addon and use your opener at 100 energy right before it ticks for the same effect.
---
are you new to wow and pvp servers? This is one reason for warmode being put in for retail. Most pvp servers have historically always been heavily lopsided to one faction over another. Some servers are alli heavy, some horde. But this is nothing new
---
Most people use higher-damage pets let's cats and raptors because their ability to hold threat is more important than how much damage they can take.
---
You are. It's only showing the retail version though on CF? so please do link it.
---
Watching that play-stage I see ;^)
---
Combat is super fun imo. Play what you enjoy. Sub for pvp for me.
---
Indeed, hopefully you're over-blowing it. I could be wrong of course and some new toxic lowbie ganking trend goes rampant, but it'd be unnatural and without good reason is all I'm saying.
---
On dragonmaw blizz banned a truckload of douches for this
---
/spit Prominence
---
Very much so. It's hilarious watching people get so upset and add even more attention to it and continue to make it more and more hilarious.
---
I did this, train fire ward and they don’t do any dmg to you :)
---
&gt; whats going on here is intentional  
---
Which is what I said.
---
&gt; Looks like Asmon is attempting to disrupt the server now.
---
Your faults for rolling on Herod or Faerlina. Don’t complain about login times when you join an already full server
---
Its extremely easy. Speed buff on boots. Sac voidwalker for heals. Run around in a big circle.
---
I'm a fury warrior and sometimes I'm just too tired to tank because it's more work. I still tank, just not after a long work day
---
I'm well aware of his point and part of my point is that fan service doesn't need to be directly equivalent. Just because one armor piece of a bikinimail for females doesn't mean that it has to be bikinimail for males. But they should include some kind of desirable fanservice that women might like too.  
---
And the answer is never "don't", it's "make an effort to do it equally in future".
---
Faerlina is the server that's going last the longest.  Despite streamers and their following, Faerlina is the only server I'd even consider playing on because every other server is going to be smaller and have less going on.  It's no accident that the biggest shenanigans and events are happening on Faerlina.
---
EDIT: guess people don't want the perspective on why I like Faerlina.
---
Wait u cant make fused wiring though. Also im benediction horde. “I will find you, and i will kill you”
---
I actually swapped from Chrome to Firefox recently, it feels much better to use, imo
---
The whole specific streamer server was just a decision between some streamers as to where they'll go. It was never anything official, nor are they in anyway obligated to go there. People overreacting and overexaggerating and making posts like this is precisely why he's doing this, it's just free content to make people mad.
---
I've seen so many arguments on this topic. Personally I'm in the camp that if an item is BOE, worth a lot of gold, and I'm in a pug then it should be all need or all greed. If you want an item on reserve make it clear from the jump. In this case everyone but the hunter was a bud so he had 4 rolls to win that item and still happened to lose.
---
If I were in the hunters position I would have done the same thing, except I would have kept the 200 gold.
---
See how it says old tos at the top?
---
I’m ruling out possible issues that would affect the macro. I did not specifically bind `&lt;shift&gt;` to a key. Let’s say the macro is on the toolbar, assigned to `T`:
---
Pressing `T` should cast Drain Life on the mouseover target.
---
Pressing `Shift + T` should cast Drain Soul on the mouseover target.
---
A Pally and I helped and got helped by a few horde killing Mai’zoth in STV last night. Neither group could do it on their own but together we were strong enough. We even let them get the first kill and the stuck around to help us do it after respawn. These are simpler times. The world will change before us.
---
&gt; Is he still a good player that does mechanics? 
---
Not giving other people more mana is failing mechanics, there's so little that buffing is a mechanic.
---
Cheers everyone
---
37 I think, shellfish boyeeee
---
The other benefit from shield block is preventing Crushing Blows, which deal 150% damage.  You can’t get crushed on an attack you mitigate.  Since blocking counts as mitigating and thus prevents crushing blows, and Shield Block gives 100% block chance, you can’t get crushed with shield block up.
---
Hey guys, punkrat here with another video...
---
He already made almost 1k gold in few minutes by begging. Looks like he is welcomed on Herod.
---
I think you can safely disregard edgemasters. Same with Orc.
---
The macro I use is basic, but works fine. There is probably a more refined way to do it.

You can use this with all the shapeshifts for powershifting.
---
I'm an idiot so I couldn't agree more!
---
But did you bind anything to Shift + T?
---
Thalnos?
---
Bingo. You want to level fast? Prioritize green quests and mobs. Kill everything between you and your objective, and do it again on the way back. Sneak past orange mobs because fighting them is not worth your time. Likewise for grey, unless they drop mats you can use - like I'll scorch my way through cloth droppers for easy tailor/enchanting mats.
---
Well if that is the case, awesome. I just complicated everything for nothing hahah
---
The drums of war thunder once again.  Lok'tar Ogar
---
There's nothing bullshit about it, it's a literal thing. Items that are "Best in Slot" prior to Raid content.
---
Whether or not they're required for raiding is entirely another story but it doesn't change that obtaining the items themselves are a goal of its own. Which can also be fun.
---
It was/is a scam.
---
Reserving items is for losers
---
Hey man if you really want to spite Asmongold you should give me $50 to buy store mounts too!
---
Yea, i started classic with the mentality of "Red=Dead" but around 40 decided to play nice. Only reason being... i knew i would have more than my fill of pvp once p2 launches - and it was slowing down my leveling speed because id get bored and go "hunting"

They absolutely get it just not in the same ways as females do. Fact is while men and women both enjoy bikinimail, barely either of both genders enjoy men in bikinimail. Even women who like fanservice like other things, I hear forearms are popular.
---
Just don’t go in with the expectation that you need to constantly have threat or always be the first to pull and it’s fine. Theres no perfect tanking experience in pugs and that’s okay. It’s still a lot of fun to tank imo. Leveling a warrior does suck pretty hard though.

---
Tell the group you’ll heal but only if you can roll on dps gear.
---
I love you man
---
I’d rather not.  For one, I couldn’t play a controller as I have played a keyboard for 14+ years.  It would be too alien.  Also wow takes up enough of my life already, I’d be extremely non productive if I had this in my hands.
---
Pretty cool stuff though!
---
The madness of world pvp in p2 will be much more memorable than bgs.
---
This bear sound is EVERYWHERE if you pay attention.
---
Early level is hard for Pets to hold aggro I found. Either key bind or have growl (pet taunt) on auto cast (right clicking the spell) ..  I believe tanks can just take on more mobs and maybe hold a little more threat? . I’m not a experienced hunter so not sure but later levels I had no issues with my pets holding threat (raptor &amp; cat)
---
Hey, peeps! Sorry for the shameless plug but since my first comment always gets buried I want to remind you all that my current Patreon goal is to create a fan comic book based on WoW Classic. If you'd like to see something like that achieved, consider taking a look there. Also, at any tier, you get access to the high res version of these pieces and the wallpaper version as well.
---
Here is a general broad description of the comic project: 
---
Set within the World of Warcraft universe, we'll join two groups of characters as they embark in a journey filled with hardship, strife and unexpected lessons. One group start their journey in the harsh, rugged land of Durotar, home to the newly settled orcs of Draenor and the native Darkspear trolls. However, the winds are changing, and they utter words of dark, wicked forces gathering within the great Horde's home, Orgrimmar. The other group are brought together in the seemingly peaceful Elwynn Forest which shelters the mighty capital Stormwind City. But all is not well in the shining jewel of the Alliance as rumors have it that the king, Varian Wrynn, has gone missing.
---
Though worlds apart, both of these parties will realize that old wounds never heal. They will learn that it is in time of peace that you must prepare for war.
---
Better for a warlock doing what? Your questions is too broad can’t give you a good answer.
---
Wait you met friendly horde that didn’t gank you while leveling? Come on over to bigglesworth where horde lock down flightpaths and dungeon entrances And kill you from rooftops and areas that the guards can’t get them in contested cities.
---
You're asking about reserved items, if it's okay, I quoted the OP (Not me) who said reserving loot and turning on ML for that boss is fine. I don't see the issue. Common sense says they turn off ML after the reserved item is done.
---
Nah the mentality that leads to people like you calling others retail babies. It discredits whatever you think is right. And please, spare us the garbage on your ideas of what causes homogenization. It's unreal how wrong you are.
---
From what I read yes.  It used to be in the interface options but was removed at some point.
---
Name checks out with attitude.
---
There's a meme from the film The Ballad of Buster Skruggs where in a scene James Franco is noosed on the gallows but its the second time in the film he's been in the same situation. And he turns to a fellow criminal in a noose next to him and says "First time?" in an attempt to make him feel better or something.
---
Yea, but I think that was "nerfed" at some point so it was no longer possible as he was essentially unkillable if he ever made it to sw.
---
It’s 90g total at 40 for riding +60% mount.... at 60 it’s another 900 for the 100% speed mount.. both mounts and training are sold in the northeast valley in org (forget name) and the vendors are all the way in the north part of that valley (where the pathway to Aszhara would be on retail wow)
---
I’m out of the loop.  Is he re-rolling?  Or how did he transfer to Herod?
---
Or is this more fake news horsesht used for marketing?
---
Nope. I didn't describe having to look at a phone taken picture as "precisely destructive". I'm talking about quieting down any comments about it.
---
Yup I know, however I already leveled to 60 =) I'm running a resto build now to raid, and a ele/resto build for PvP.
---
Will do and update with response.
---
No, I don’t have anything bound to Shift + anything
---
That's a keyword I've not heard in a long time....a long time.
---
I only use 4 movement keys. I hold down LMB to strafe with AD. I thought everyone did it like that.
---
I'm curious about others weird group experiences. Ones that went surprisingly well or surprisingly aweful.
---
Story time!
---
It was a meme going around

I thought he was on faerlina or w/e its called? im on EU servers so I dont have to think about this stuff :D

You're saying that people not discouraging phone pics / not encouraging screenshots is "destructive". Its pathetically hyperbolic.

Just keep giving him attention, I’m sure that will help...

he's going bald who cares, that's an issue he has to deal with and will never change, him holding the sever hostage like a little baby, won't change him going bald.

I mean which one is better to use. Especially leveling.
---
Okay, 2g is ridiculous lol. 40s for a max level lockbox I'd say isnt too out of the question. I generally dont want a tip if it gives me a skill up. But each to their own. Just like the mages who charge a lot for portals or food.  I understand their time is worth money, but eh.
---
I generally haven't been questing at all. I find grinding non quest mobs that are a few levels lower than me to be more effective than questing.
---
I'll pick up and finish a quest or two if it's near where I'm grinding, but honestly most quests don't seem worth the travel time or, as you put it, fighting other people for drops.
---
Hard disagree on everyone here. Combat is more efficient. It’s more dps, less downtime, better weapons, can cleave, don’t have to waste time positioning for ambush, gouging for backstab, etc. My first rogue I leveled daggers, and the next 3 I’ve leveled as combat. Its more efficient.
---
You can check server subreddits, but they're not super active. You'd probably have better luck checking your server's discord, those seem reasonably active, at least mine does.
---
Its in english lmao, maybe take a second before posting.
---
I'm confirming nothing, but want to say that we're aware of the Asmon spam. That's all I want to say at this time.
---
I’m so surprised they haven’t opened paid transfers yet
---
That sounds good thanks guys
---
Just go feral druid, you can tank it dps or off heal
---
100g this guy doesnt even log off his character.
---
Yes I do
---
I think that does more to show how favored the druid should be. The hunter didn't really do anything special, but he didn't have to because the druid just stood there and let him shoot.
---
Friendly horde? So you mean a single horde player who less than 4 levels above you? Because those are the only one who won’t attack you on my server. 
---
Dead serious, they refuse to take even a reasonably balanced fight.
---
&gt;Classic WoW has the worst tank shortage of any iteration of WoW I’ve seen
---
It only seems that way because you are focused on 5-man dungeons right now. The situation flips on tanks when it comes to raiding.
---
I've always loved tanking first and foremost but in most expansions have been pushed to DPS because there just isn't enough for tanks to do outside of 5-mans.
---
I had a 60 arms dps warrior in my group the other day still using it. I get that it's a cool weapon and all but goddamn there's like 300 better weapons between 40-60 lol.
---
What’s happening? I’m out of the loop here. I just noticed queue times came back for a bunch of servers this week.
---
Too late to call them my time unfortunately now but I have managed to send a ticket now :)
---
and they wouldnt be doing it without their dear leader. whenever a cult does something, who is responsible? the leader tellin them to do it of course

---
I've been playing since Vanilla(some on and off with xpac I didn't like). I dont believe I've ever had any actions on my account. Hopefully they realize that when reviewing.
---
It was terrible.
---
Pretty silly.  Everyone here is mostly for the gameplay/nostalgia.  You can read all the lore like a book instead of having to play the game in the order you find stuff unless you are a fan of choose-your-own adventure.
---
On a single playthrough you'll only get a small piece kf the full puzzle unless you don't care about the game and pick up and complete every single quest you ever get.
---
If lore is fun to you still go for it--I would probably recommend a roleplaying server though.  Prettt sure WoW has books published though if you care about lore.  A handful of titty twitch streamers read them if you care for audio books and boobies
---
I’m not a fan of Asmongold, but he’s just a random dude playing a video game.
---
If people on reddit just ignored him, shit like this wouldn’t happen but people on reddit seem so obsessed with hating him.
---
“I don’t like asmons stream but I watched for 12 hours today and just came here to be toxic about him being toxic”
---
Stop crying it helps nothing and just fuels this behaviour
---
Stunning and brave opinion.
---
It goes out on head turn in
---
"late 2019" so probably late November or December.
---
Interesting, those are all reasons that I wouldn't want to be on that server... to each his own I suppose
---
\#push
---
That's why I don't fight mobs equal to my level. I get better XP/hr rates killing greens than killing yellow mobs.
---
Less misses / dodges / parries - more crits on lower level mobs.
---
There is obviously a lot of lore in the game, but it's more spread out in the world. There is no big, overarching story line quest or anything like that.
---
A lot of good stories in certain quests and a lot of good stories in books and random NPC dialogue, but as an MMO it's really more about exploring and living in the world that Blizz has built than following any real story.
---
Druids best for soloing
---
You can't reason with these people. I learned the hard way. Just sit back and enjoy the rage.
---
No, AHK is not against the rules, they've said so explicitly.  So long as one press = one action, you can use AHK macros.  If you try to use AHK to automate many tasks with one press, it's bannable.
---
Yikes dude, these wannabes need to stop at this point.  So many people trynna leech off of streamers by shitting on them in videos, LUL
---
100g you're an annoying asmon fan
---
This is hilarious
---
Asmongold is a literal mongoloid and a piece of shit. His content is incredibly fake, and forced, if not scripted. Why he has such a large following is beyond me.
---
Just ignore the dude. His content is fake, and so is his relationship with pinksparkles. I can't wait tonsee this guys career diminish.
---
P.S. I don't play on herod. I just fucking hate asmongold.
---
Im probably gonna get some gold via tanking
---
Bartender does all this too. They're both solid. Use whichever one is updated. I've gone back and forth a few times over the years - they are entirely interchangeable.
---
Cya tomorrow
---
Because level 28 elites can be taken down fairly easily by a group of level 23 players.
---
Fuck that, no such hordes on Golemagg.. time to die

Great story. Do you plan to write a follow-up detailing act two?

I AM FORSAKEN!

It only says v1.2 classic fanfix. Wich is not the name of the addon.

So no, it does not say at the top of the addon what it's called.

As I said, the odds of that happening to OP is small,  but the odds of that happening to someone is not that small. You can watch Matt Parker's talk ["When math goes wrong"](https://youtu.be/6JwEYamjXpA?t=2859) if you are interested in the probability around similar things. (timestamped to the story about a couple that had a photo randomly taken of them when they were kids)
---
This is it. My favorite joke ever made in classic.
---
Good ideia. I'm in r/classicwow's discord but couldn't find a guild based on Westfall. Gonna look for a Westfall discord. Thanks
---
Off topic, but I have been very curious how this relates to my class as well. I am a 35 Elemental Shaman and have been buying up cheap +Nature Damage armor - but am always struggling with mana so I've been thinking Int/Spirit may be better. I'd prefer more damage, which is why I'm doing this but wasn't sure if I was making the right choice. Any input would be greatly appreciated.
---
Not an opinion if its true.
---
Pwnd
---
I really love my warrior and I like tanking. I hate tanking for pugs though, and taking shit from people who dont understand how warriors work. I had a priest drop group on the first pull when the warlock dotted all the mobs and then dropped his meteor storm. Of course I lost aggro, I had 1 sunder down on the first mob I marked and no rage. 
---
Another time a "dps" warrior 4 levels above me tells me "Hold aggro or I kick" as he heroic strikes the boss over and over again. 
---
Shamans windfurying everything, rogues not attacking the marked target, mages opening with blizzard, hunters opening with multishot... People dying left and right because they dont understand I have TWO tools for immediately grabbing aggro, and ones on a 10 minute cooldown, and both will only save them if they *stop nuking the mobs*.
---
I love tanking so much for a competent group. Struggling through dungeons with slobbering fucking morons telling you youre trash because they dont understand how a warrior works is so painful. I was hoping the higher level I got, the more people would have been punished for those mistakes and would have learned how to play, but no. Somehow these guys get to level cap and *still* dont understand how to clear a dungeon without it turning in a clown fiesta.
---
It doesn’t say the name in English. Maybe take a second before writing bullshit. 
---
It says XYZYZY v1.2 Classic - fanfix (I assume it is fixed by fans). So the name is still unknown.
---
I can't believe that people spend heaps on pre 50 gear.
---
It's a common application to automate things though...
---
Player-created content implies that there was content. He did not organize anything, no dungeons, no raids, no pvp, no rp of any sort. What he did what bullying pure and simple. Streamer with clout and followers disrupts server activity because he is bored. He says that he only wants Blizzard to have a say in how people play the game, yet he shut down all city and trade chat demanding an apology for some perceived slight, is that not dictating play? looks like hypocrisy.
---
Terrible song but LOL @ the salt from /u/SgtKeeneye...

Yeah it works now, the only issue for me is that, I cannot leave stealth with this macro, I'd have to make a shift mod or an other button for it.
---
Auctioneer has enchantrix included. It tells you the odds of each drop. You can manually put in enchanting reagent values and it call recommend of it's worth disenchanting and the average de value.
---
&gt; What is it that reddit did to Asmongold? 
---
They dared to not worship him.  They spurned the gods.
---
Kill anything that drops loot that's about 5 levels below you. Zero chance to kill you or really even hit you much, but killed in mass quantity yield a bunch of gold. Just find something that drops something / anything you can sell and go ham. You actually kill faster in any other class in that case most of the time since you have no mana and you're one bandaid away from a top up.
---
I agree with this but i did not see where he said "if its discussed and ML is done im ok" which is why i asked. He said "If you put it on ML, im dropping out. I dont care if its a joke etc, etc"
---
I was just asking if he bends this rule in the situation where it was previously discussed. He wanted to talk crap so i took my jab back =)
---
Lots of likes? 
---
You're being downvoted I to oblivion. Might wanna reevaluate your video.
---
Victory or death!
---
He’s just playing the game by rerolling horde. Being popular isn’t against TOS so be mad at the spergs following him but not Asmon himself.
---
The addon is called FindParty, but it only works on KR realms.

---
Warlock provides more group utility than Hunter.
---
Both are top tier for solo, with Hunter maybe having a slight edge.
---
Pretty even in PvP, with top gear in the later phases Warlocks have the edge.
---
My personal recommendation would be to stick with the Warlock, but I would say that 1-30 is a small time investment compared to how much time you will spend on your main character. If Hunter really calls to you, there is no better time to reroll than now.
---
Where is your rank 1 frost bolt?
---
What happened? Did that idiot migrate?
---
I'm gonna comment here just in case someone comes up with an answer because I am also interested in this lol
---
Remove the `!` in front of `Prowl` so it becomes:
---
    /cast Prowl
---
Better to use for what?
---
Very different answers for different things. For questing or mob grinding you’ll want more Stamina so you can use Imp.
---
What class are you? All of the "healers" have a DPS spec.
---
Oh OK haha. I thought it sounded pretty unreal, like if McDonald's would suddenly start refusing service to dentists or something
---
Just last night on my Hunter in Desolace I was suddenly stormed by a pack of 37-42 Alliance out for blood, roaming the lands searching for anyone they could kill. I had a guy my level tell me to let him know if the Alliance were acting up because his 60 Rogue main was "keeping them in check" by camping them for half an hour. Oh..
---
When I was doing this a level 60 just paid me slightly less than AH value for them whenever I found one while we were both trying to kill them
---
I bet this guy has asmongums and got offended lol
---
Was it ever datamined what it says if you opened it?
---
I know they changed the item in the future and it just says "All the pages are blank", but that seems like it could have just been changed while they modified the item.
---
Had a hunter roll need on Robes of Arugal in SFK. I won it but I was still mad af
---
Only weaklings use rank 1 frost bolt
---
I've leveled 3 characters to 30 after my first to 60, and after that first 60 dungeon groups have all felt awful. People demanding faster paces, skipping quest objectives of people who need it because it hurts their exp/hr, class elitism,  all of this on  top of generally poor play. Combine this with people who gravitate towards other roles first generally not wanting that leadership role due to a lack of dungeon knowledge or a lack of wanting to corral 4 other people around XP Disneyland for their own XP and gear, and it's no wonder why people don't want to roll tanks. 
---
My druid will stay heal/dps until it goes full heal at 52, and I probably won't make a warrior until I have a full guild group to level with.  Tanking isn't necessarily difficult in Classic, but being reliant on the kind of people you tend to get after that first surge of players certainly is.
---
I wouldn’t even know what that means.

Get enough people from your server to report him for spamming/trolling, he'll get a small ban or silenced at least.

I found [this Westfall discord](https://discord.gg/FY77Ey) server. As for a Westfall guild that I like, not yet.

That's the guild's actual name.

Also, not true if it is an opinion.  😂

I challenge you to find me one non-indie game where additive coefficients are applied to a critical strike at the end of the calculation without having any effect on the crit itself.

You're a complete moron if you quit over asmon coming to your server you do know they offer free transfers?

Get what you like.  So what if other people like/get it too.  Just consider yourself in good company.

lol what raid do you think you're going to MT

Except what he's doing can be classified as harassment and is a reportable and bannable offense.

Don’t blame Asmon. It’s his shitty fotnite-esque fanbase that sucks.

I haven't done many dungeons as a warrior yet, I'm level 48 arms warrior and have done a ton of solo grinding and questing, I've kinda hot a slump and not sure where to get my levels at now. I have a tanking set and was thinking about joining a cleave group to tank ZF or something, is the exp pretty good? Should I do ZF? Or do you have any recommendations for a alliance arms warrior to grind at on a horde dominated server? I don't mind grinding the same mobs for hours and hours in a quiet place. I found a cave in feralas that I grinded from 43-48 im about 12hrs, I'd love for some recommendations on something similar!

People roll need on BoE greens if it’s an upgrade and no group I’ve ever been in has said shit.

BoE blues - people almost always just greed, unless someone asks - common.
---
Recipes?  You can need it if it’s for your profession and especially if it’s for your class (and BiS) - any other answer is honestly against common belief structure (as your ample downvotes have shown) and it’s the community as a whole that decides what constitutes what a ninja is.
---
spamable 1 button rotations were also a thing in vanilla. Write the macros and you'd never have to think. Good times.
---
The "vanilla macro api" wasn't much of an API, or macro for that matter. it was all done with straight lua code.
---
As far as snapshotting, Pretty sure that wasn't until like WoD or something.

Does she have a premium tradechat?

When do I use rend? I'm 26 and arms, so I have improved rend. I always level and dungeon with a holy priest so we go through everything relatively easy.
---
It just doesn't seem to be worth the rage unless it's going to be a prolonged fight and I'll be flush with rage to reapply whenever I want. I know in pvp I should probably apply to rogues, but are there other situations to use rend?

Horde sucks

Line up the action bars or something. This hurts!
---
Essentially, I think blizzard recently stated all servers are down to 1-2 layers.
---
We tried this and when our guy accepted the summon it didn't do anything.
---
Nah. You'd think tanks are so popular and everyone likes them. But it ain't all sunshine and rainbows. Once you're done with dungeons, what next? It is hard to find a raiding guild, especially a good one, as a tank - guilds funnel gear and resources into their tanks, so you really want someone you know you can trust in that position. It wasn't uncommon for tanks to get geared up and leave guild. Even for pugs, you only need like 3 tanks out of 40 people so there's nearly as much demand for them as in dungeons. And on top of that, warriors kinda suck at farming, especially with tank build.

Use rend until lvl 30 after you will use rage on sweeping strikes + cleave.
---
Once I got sweeping strikes with my Whirlwind axe things got dramatically better.
---
Google wow fanfix addon and ta da you figured it out on your own!!!!111!1!1!1
---
I don't really follow any of his stuff, but apparently yeah, no huge streamers on European servers.
---
The flight pathing is highly questionable.
---
Rend is mostly for solo questing.  It is not good threat and isn't worth the rage if mobs die too fast, as you have already figured out.  Definitely not worth the debuff slot on raid mobs.
---
Remember for tanking your best threat abilities are Revenge &gt; Sunder &gt; Heroic Strike, although you will rarely have extra rage for heroic strike.
---
No it really won't.  Go look at faction balance.  BG's can't come soon enough.
---
Same

Says the guy who wants to act like it's a big deal to post a dumb screenshot on the internet for strangers.
---
I didn't know 21 pilots ex-boyfriend play this game?
---
IF you are gonna join a cleave group for ZF you don't tank. Every warrior goes in battle/berserker stance with 2h. If you wanna tank a dungeon just make a normal grp.
---
Love the Druid class. Being comfortable healing, dpsing or tanking just makes the class fun. Non raid instances are easy to tank, heal or dps without a problem. Makes getting dungeons done sooooo much easier
---
So, let me ask you, what constitutes a ninja loot to you?
---
That would create a system where blizzard decides how the loot system should be used. As it stands now the community gets to decide.
---
It entirely depends on your server. On Judgement EU I deleted my 60 Priest because the player base are racist and transphobic pieces of shit (or at the very least, bystanders to /world who let it happen) and I got tired of reporting people and seeing the same names day in, day out. 
---
I only got ganked twice on my way to 60. 
---
I’m now a lv42 Warlock on the Horde side and I have been jumped in every single levelling zone where PvP is on by default. Luckily as a Warlock I can do a quick seduce with my succ and usually survive, but sometimes I get outplayed/overpowered. A Hunter with Broken Tooth who jumped me whilst I was half mana on a mob in Badlands just utterly destroyed me not 10 mins ago.
---
I’ve also been annihilated by a few 60s passing through. 
---
So, yeah. Completely server based when it comes to that and which side is worse.
---
I get ganked by alliance scum that have at least ten levels over me. 
---
Tauren are peaceful folk, leave us be

Zero truth to that.

You don't have to give him attention to be affected by him, you could not hate him and not care at all, and still have your gameplay experience negatively impacted. Even on servers where he and other streamers don't play, they spread the cleave meta to the masses, warriors that think they are tanks with a 2H (not even ravager), and mages mages mages...
---
Granted, while complaining doesn't hurt the issue, it certainly doesn't help either. It all just contributes to the echo chamber that reddit is, people like to see content that they agree with.

Folks,

I am currently sittimg at level 50 with talents in arms (30) and fury. I want to tank in the endgame, but was wondering at what level (or dung) did you respec to prot? Do you respec between prot and arms/fury when you're out tanking or out questing?

Is the exp/hr that good?

I am not the person who asked for this addon. And why in the world would you call an addon “fanfix? That makes no sense.

General chat of both factions is filled with these same statements. Seems crybabies know no faction.

yeah guess i mean at 20k subs he's just looking to make content which is fine, his stream highlights are funny af recently, i really enjoyed him trolling reddit/herod, all these pathetic people over reacting is so funny

in the grand scheme of the game asmongold doesn't even matter, chill people.

They are 100% gonna say phases release dates during blizzcon quote me on this

I love you
---
If you don’t have last stand as a tank you are doing it wrong
---
Man is it just my server that has to many tanks or what? Pretty much every group is looking for dps so often that I’m considering rolling off of my tank with how hard it is to get groups...
---
Actually, doesn't work that way.  If it's an opinion it can be true or not true.
---
Questie
---
If you reset twice (say you want to make sure it's reset), it will count for 2 and not 1. That could explain your issue
---
I had a lock who literally killed himself with Hellfire. He found it funny at least.
---
Yeah if you're offering 30-40 silver, there's no way I'm portaling you unless I'm right next to you. No travel
---
That's why you just stay a DPS spec for all the pre-raid content but tank anyway. You'll be totally fine as fury or arms tanking 5 mans/ubrs. Just make sure you have a shield for the end game dungeons.
---
Oh wow thanks, that's very cheap for such a legendary sword.
---
Imagine being so triggered by something you can hide that you delete your toon
---
Yes there is!
---
You can do this with profiles :)

For example, use the Default profile for your first role and the character specific one for your other role :)

It won’t change what spells are in your bar ofc but it will change your bars/keybindings with one click :)

Dear god this. Disable all.

Haha yeah maybe one day she will remove it for something else
---
The bigger question is those mages, can they resist aoeing right away and focus the target you and the rogue are fighting? Most mages can't, which makes tanking for them very difficult. Our AoE threat is really bad.
---
Is there an addon that will display healing numbers over the targets head similar to how damage is displayed? I've found Miksscrollingbattletext so far, but I really don't like the overall look of it.

Rolled PVP to be with a friend. Switched to RPPVP to bypass long queues. I couldn’t care less about PVP, but I’ll RP the shit out of my humble fishing/cooking/mining/smithing orc who happens to be a warrior on the side.

Whats it like to be that ignorant?

I felt this way tanking in BC too! What's different? (Genuine question, I only started playing during TBC)

As a priest, I've already met a few locks who were OK except they wouldn't use drain life (or even healthstones) to heal themselves up. I just compromised and put up a renew when I can and knock them to the very bottom of the priority for heals.
---
It is, but it's on the retail version. Download it manually into the Classic folder.
---
You can turn that off

Yeah I really hate this too 😔

Made a warrior as my first ever WoW character to play as Tank. I’m 50 so far and haven’t had too many horror stories. I can say that last night I joined a group to play DPS role and it was SO MUCH MORE RELAXING! No need to worry about who is being aggro’d or who to attack first. I just attacked whoever was marked and it felt like a vacation. I don’t get wtf the dps are doing when I tank sometimes. Always nice getting compliments on my tanking even though sometimes I feel like i do a bad job too.
---
how can I get your job
---
I swear the 'Ret is the leveling spec' is a Wrath (*maybe* TBC) thing that somehow got retroactively placed onto Vanilla.
---
Going Holy and stacking 'Eagle' gear lets you AoE 2-3 mobs and heal yourself pretty easily by level 20 with Consecration.
---
Going Prot at 40 (admittingly it's a very lackluster tree early on) with Blessing of Sanc, Holy Shield, Ret aura, and a shield spike also lets you AoE grind much easier (going into Holy afterwards to get Consecration again makes you an AoE monster).
---
Ret is the 'pull one mob and auto attack for days' setup that gets Paladin leveling meme'd so badly. Added on that everyone playing Ret goes HAM on Strength so has zero mana to do anything after they drop that Crusader-Judgement and then activate SoCommand.
---
I believe it’s need for need and greed for gold. That’s the whole point of the system, **but** people will be douches and ninja loot so always needing is the best way to fight this issue. Blizzards solution was to just get rid of the system.
---
That escalated quickly
---
I found him yesterday and was following him while trying to put a group together to take him down. Someone messages me and says they are ready and they have a lvl 60 with them to make it easy. I invite him but he says no join us, which I do without thinking. Suddenly, Fozruk starts to fade and horror sets in as I type to the party: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!?
---
Layering has its disadvantages and lesson learned.
---
You can auto turn decline then too
---
I agree it is viable, but anything is "viable" if you know what you are doing. Problem is that most people DONT know what they are doing and are just copy catting. It always puts more strain on the healers, but Ravager is definitelty the best AoE damage in the game, and as a result, the best threat.
---
I had a level 50 tank in mara though with WHIRLWIND axe, not even ravager, who proceeded to need roll on green 1hers and shields cause of course he didnt have any, obviously just trolling for gold anyway.

I absolutely cannot wait for you to do the level 60 dungeons / quests. Rivendare, Rend Blackhand, etc. are going to be absolutely amazing.
---
I'll continue to be nice even when I have something to gain from murdering horde. It'll only fuel my desire to beat the shit out of the rude ones more.
---
The extent to where hunter "falls off" is in the top tier of raiding that 75% of the player base probably won't get to.  I would only worry about it if you're in a raiding guild that raids 3 times a week or more.  Hunters remain extremely powerful except when measured up next to rogues and fury warriors in the very top raiding tiers.  Rogues and fury warriors are bonkers at that level, so saying hunters fall short isn't really saying much.
---
This power "fall off" is something that most people will never feel.
---
Rolled a druid coz i wanted to do everything, best decision i could have made. 
---
And all the tank rage is righteous, having done both... poor tanks... (1/3 me :-) )
---
You deleted your max level character because people were dicks in world chat and no other players stepped in and solved the problem for you??  It kinda sounds like the assholes won, and for that I'm sorry. You don't have to let other people dictate your own behavior and ruin your fun. Sometimes in the world things are super fucked and unfair, and nobody else is going to step in and fix it, try not to let it get to you.  Don't be afraid to be the change you want to see. Maybe next time you speaking up will be the reason some other member of the silent majority doesn't feel quite as bullied. There are always going to be assholes out there, but they don't own you or your fun.
---
I use something very similar but it's called Chocolate Bar - I prefer it after finding that Titan can be a huge resource hog.
---
I don't understand why some mages have such a stick up their ass about handing out buffs and water, its literally free and yet some of them act like you asked to roll on a BOE spelldamage blue while playing as a melee dps. It's gotten to the point where I politely ask for water the second I join the group and see a mage, before we even enter the dungeon, and if they start with the bullshit I just leave.
---
&gt;Useless, in other words. Destructive, to be precise.
---
And then
---
&gt;You're blowing things out of proportion. Calm down.
---
You're an idiot... lmao. Goodbye.

Purple  is probably chose more but green is green, can’t go wrong

You are fine with arms spec until Molten core :) And the xp is nothing special but nice change to questing.

I don't have shift bound to anything. I play esdf though so I have more keys available.

thank you for the great video!
---
Hi, unit frames are Pitbull with flat texture. I like minimap there too, also looks nice in bottom right corner :)
---
No matter the phase, am bad to the bone. Every player of a rival faction is KOS.
---
If you want an easy time finding a tank, announce that it is an all caster group with no melee. I'll drop whatever I'm doing in game (as long as I'm not already in a group) and come in a heartbeat.
---
Nost became famous because of Sodapoppin. You're delusional to think otherwise.
---
Dude I love you. With Worlds group stage just around the corner that would be pretty much necessary
---
It would be great to hit 60 while Fnatic makes out of groups. Kappa.
---
Do you seriously have trouble understanding the content of the post due to the method OP used to capture it? (Or any post, ever)
---
Or are you just being an elitist nerd?
---
They told you not to need and you needed anyway, yes you were in the wrong. How do you think the tank or dps that can use it would have felt if you got it when it’s an even bigger upgrade for them because they can actually produce way more dps than you with gear upgrades, especially warriors. If you want to be ret it is your right but other people might not want you, if that makes you uncomfortable then re-roll or make your own group.
---
Haha, you and me both! xD but there's a long journey between here and there :P
---
Lmao
---
Priest heal cant be more simple
---
They way macros work is a [ ] is an binary expression. It's either true or false. 
---
When you have multiple [ ] sets together. It uses OR logic from left to right. The first set to come up true causes it to execute and skip the rest of the conditional sets for a spell.
---
so basically you need to do
---
    /cast [equipped:Shield,stance:1/2] Shield Bash; [noequipped:Shield,stance:1/2] Cleave

Oh no what will you do with your life

It was a joke.. did you miss the " 😂 "?
---
My wife and I do live strat for money, first 2 orbs on reserve having a healer + tank combo is a bankroll combo that lets you meet competent dps to add to the FL real quick.

Damn, maybe I should put tank instead of engineer on my Tinder profile.

Yeah, doesn't work. Believe they fixed that bug in beta.
---
Kinda goes both ways though, don't judge an entire faction based off of a couple of dicks. 
---
Killed a gnome yesterday that was one level above me, then was body camped by two skulled alliance. 
---
I fully expected to be killed after killing him, maybe even being killed twice just to one up me, but camping me is unnecessary.
---
Imagine having 100+ hours of progress made just to throw it all away because people disagree with you on the internet. Imagine having that free time to just throw away.
---
Kinda hard to solo when horde gank in packs of 3+
---
I can only assume its faster, but somehow making an extra stop in Desolace doesn't feel faster.
---
See but you farmed the key, you brought something to the table besides DPS. Honestly thank you for that. You’re one of the good ones!
---
It was unnecessary, when the macro worked, and this way reduces the number of bar space required.
---
It really is!
---
Can't believe I got downvoted so much for being silly.   Do you obviously think that I don't know it makes no sense?

This guy was sitting on top of that mast in Booty Bay for at least an hour, attacking anyone who came near enough. I hope he gets banned from all the reports, and Blizz adds guns to guards. He was positioned particularly well to hit people who arrived at the alliance FP...

Yo, if you're doing LBRS runs, you're not really new to the game. You'll have a couple hundred hours played by that point.
---
yes.

1. I specced as ST frost, do I still qualify as AoE DPS for AoE dungeon groups? https://imgur.com/a/EEGAU1C (currently lvl 32)
---
2. Does anyone know of a guide/video that teaches how to AoE in dungeons/solo?
---
single target crit immunity/crush immunity and more threat, or 6% armor  passively.  
---
Neither are worth giving up for a 10min CD 30% health boost.
---
Always great to log off stocked, and with stuff on AH
---
Maybe not intentional, but swifty and his guildies knew that the server was probably going to crash and they did it anyways. The whole vod is still out there.. they only unbanned him to stop the mass server spam.

Welcome to vanilla.
---
Is there a macro to cast the fishing command and also auto click and loot the catch? Or would that not be a macro and more of a bot thing, thus being nonexistent?
---
I think you should reconsider speccing healer while leveling, especially if you're primarily going to be doing open world stuff. Until the 50's, any of those classes wearing intellect gear with no points in healing specs at all is roughly as effective at healing as someone fully heal spec, AND much better at dealing damage. You'd save yourself a lot of grief by not committing to being nothing BUT a healer while leveling.
---
The tank deficiency is really real, more fury wars need to realize they will get the DPS gear faster as a tank 😂
---
I found that organizing groups non-stop was much harder than farming the key tbh.
---
Them arms are thiic
---
Yeah, that's against ToS. Report them for manipulating climbing to have an advantage in pvp. People always get warned, and banned for this in duskwood.
---
Be careful what you promise, I farmed hand of justice for two weeks.
---
I personally wont join a loot council guild.  To each their own though
---
Right click in ~~Firefox~~any browser doesn't do anything for me in Netflix.

It’s crazy how many questions on here are answered/dismissed that way
---
Okay so
---
A) It says NOWHERE in the ToS or EULA that cross faction collusion is prohibited
---
B) A GM literally says it is not prohibted
---
C) None has been banned for doing it despite plenty of evidence and outrage
---
And yet you cling to the faint idea that it is somehow bannable because it was against the ToS 7 years ago?
---
I tried using your from your addonbackup....I liked it but I didn't see any target of target which was killing me

So I reinstalled full roth ui over yours, replacing files, and now I dont have the length of the bars like I want or any 3d portraits.
---
I'm actually looking for something like this that we can use guild-wide. Any ideas?
---
Currently we're considering setting up a channel in our discord for problematic / blacklisted individuals since it would let us attach screenshots and the likes. We've had push back, though, from people who find it cumbersome to alt-tab for each check.
---
Since you MUST use the mouse to find and click on the bobber, you can't do that with a macro, and thus having a program to do that for you is considered botting.
---
just report him for terrain exploiting they've been going after people who do that pretty consistently since classic released.

This lie has been going on for over a week lol
---
I have something called ShowMyHeal, but the numbers show up over my own head. I have mixed feelings about it but it does the basic job.
---
It's very common, yes.
---
I've been watching Worlds while I play as well :)
---
Sick ty
---
Yes.  Do not start specc'd as a healer.  Priests can do absolutely fine without a single talent into holy up to almost 55.  I respecced holy/disc and farming anything is a grind compared to shadow.
---
I never played a warrior back in Vanilla. Just got my Whirlwind axe at level 30 today with the help of guildies, this turned me into a wrecking ball. Temporarily at least.

Ahaha sorry for my english ^^

How well will PVP gear stack up against raid gear in BGs? I didn’t initially plan on raiding but I’m wondering if I need to do so in order to be competitive in BGs.
---
My mom is 59 and wants to try it.. I am afraid the game will be too hard for her.
---
For guilds that plan on long term progression loot council is a real thing. Main tanks get several pieces early and based on needs for other later bosses other classes get preference on several items. After the first few runs loot gets spread around more evenly. It can be a bummer to raid for hours and recieve no loot but eventually the purple will flow. Consistant raiders will get preference as well. Is it split dkp and loot council or just loot council?
---
You must be a really nice and smart guy, seeing how you call your server population racist and transphobic pieces of shit because of few people in /world chat, god forbid you ignore them or leave the main shitposting channel
---
That's pretty rude if he transferred tbh. There's a reason everyone wanted to know what server streamers were gonna play on. Feel bad for people that made Herod their home.
---
I like the green.  But it’s all just personal preference.
---
A macro that auto clicks the bobber for you is impossible, by design.
---
To automatically loot, though, you can just turn auto-loot on.
---
I only raided in vanilla and a bit into BC, but zero-sum DKP is the fair system... loot council inevitably will piss someone off eventually.  DKP is a free market economy, what’s an item worth *to you* and how many points do you have to pay for it ?
---
It's still BIS regardless of your crit.
---
Must have been a strimmer! Reeee   
---
/s
---
Normal as in the most used, yes.
---
However in more casual guilds I would recommend DKP or something similar, because casual guilds are typically more easily corrupt and worse at fair loot councilling, and DKP or other point system are simple and fair. Loot council when done correctly is the best though.
---

Why do you say such nonsense?

The cleave meta has been the meta since burning crusade released originally.

I personally wouldn't bother. Hemo is a 6 point detour that is only worth it if youre going to make it your main builder - which is only worth it if you're using a really slow MH

**M A L D**
---
Not necessarily re-rolled, but I did respec my druid. I'm still at 21 resto so that I have Nature's Swiftness, but all the rest of the points are going into feral for better tanking. I get so many more groups as tank than healer already that I'm actually thinking of just ditching healing.

I mean sure, if you're grinding. But if you're just going to be grinding mobs, Combat would still be better because you don't have to stealth behind every mob, and you even have cooldowns to fight 2 mobs at once.

As in just dumb logic?

Cash shop exclusive? smh
---
Having growl highlighted to autocast and not dpsing too hard are the two keys to letting your pet tank. I rolled with a dps pet and it went fine (like a cat). I'd send pet in, let them grab initial aggro (which always seems to give an inherent little boost idk), Serpent Sting and then just autoshoot. Arcane Shot doesn't do a ton of damage for its mana cost, and casting it on CD prevents your mana from regenerating, so I found that just using Serpent Sting kept my mana high, didn't steal aggro, and I could smoothly chain pull 1 thing at a time but over and over again with no downtime. Occasionally bandaged my pet in between if needed.
---
Had green in vanilla on my rogue, so I’m going purple on my mage this time when I have the gold.
---
Hi, im the other horde on HS.

It was bad on beta. Not better than any other method

Good, that will give me time to hit level 30.

I feel like a huge change is coming. So often I try to be the nice Orclock, but soon... I don’t know if I can keep that up. Getting attacked every five minutes changes a man.

The famous farting giants of Feralas
---
This without layering would actually have way less people in the same area because the servers would be crashed and no one would be playing.
---
This is the question we need answered!
---
Yes, loot council is meant to gear the whole raid team in the most efficient matter to where who deserves and needs the item the most. When people say they don’t like loot council it is because they get mad someone more deserving received loot or that their loot council doesn’t know what they are doing. 
---
I never had a problem with it in a serious raiding environment but the guilds i were in knew what they were doing.
---
Dkp has many flaws, people passing on huge upgrades to get a shiny weapon, people that don’t play well getting bis gear for another class, list goes on and on. I would never even think about applying to a guild that uses dkp in 2019.
---
Might just be me but I feel like you're just mad your undergeared wifey beat you in a duel 😂
---
There's nothing illegal about controlling the economy, its done or attempted on every server.
---
I dont get it.

Warrior tank and dps warrior probably shares less loot than dps warrior and a rogue.

Does this let you add notes to opposite faction players as well? I'd love to remember at 60 who let me go about my leveling business and who ganked me relentlessly in a zone they vastly outleveled...
---
I like ur hat
---
That’s not delusional at all. Nost was already popular which is why streamers like Sodapoppin decided to start playing there. That is not to say the didn’t make it more popular, though.
---
Just you and the other 8000 people who have posted a pic of it on this sub
---
You can sell your tanking services.  Either ask for straight gold or you get the first righteious orb in a strat live run or something similar.  Tanks are so in demand that it is viable.  You kind of do have to be a half decent tank to charge for it though.
---
Otherwise hte suggestion above to kill mobs a certain number of levels below you is solid also.
---
I rerolled Druid cus every group I tried to get in was looking for a tank or healer.  Has made getting dungeon groups so much easier. 
---
Even if I’m dps’ing in a dungeon we can go a lot faster. If the healer goes oom I just shift to caster form and let them mp5/wand the next pull.
---
Pretty sure they already had server transfers off Herod.
---
How well does PVP gear stack up to raid gear? Do I need to raid in order to be competitive in PvP or can I just grind the honor blues/epics?
---
As a enhance will I still be able to heal a dungeon proper or will I have to carry around int gear?   Also would it be more gear efficient to run elemental so that I can seemlessy switch from healing/dps?
---
Sorry it took so long to get back to you.

What’s the add on that shows the -21 on your screen when u get damaged?

Eh, I dont think anyone who wouldnt play is playing because of him.

Shortly before World War I, the German Kaiser was the guest of the Swiss government to observe military maneuvers. The Kaiser asked a Swiss militiaman: 'You are 500,000 and you shoot well, but if we attack with 1,000,000 men what will you do?' The soldier replied: 'We will shoot twice and go home.'
---
A lot of people still think that if you reserve in any way, shape or form you're a "scammer" lmao. They seem to think that the master loot feature is exclusive to guild raiding or some shit.

Do not respec just build a tanking set of gear.

Others have stated correctly that it does not make you swim faster.

I passed most of the Night Elf population going the opposite way, and had very little quest competition in their starting area. The ones that remained were super confused when they saw a human in their tree, lemme tell ya.
---
The time I don't really care about. You can buff yourself up if you aren't already, but no pre hotting or pre shielding (harder to argue with mage since it's so long duration most mages are perma shielded when running around in world). As for who gets opener: Rogue &gt; Druid &gt; Warrior  is the priority. Which means a rogue will get opener on druid or warrior, druid will get opener on warrior, and warrior will get charge on anyone else.
---
Well it's not like anyone here or Herod is remotely nice to him so what the fuck does he owe you? Nothing lol. Every other post on here is something about him yet everyone claims to not care. :)

But you can tank like it’s retail it’s just harder work and more satisfying being a good tank. If you are running a full defense setup it’s you playing wrong.
---
I like playing Druid. As a Feral build I can tank or DPS and emergency heal as needed. 
---
While leveling, cat-kill mob-heal-cat-skin-attack. Sit at full life and health.
---
You actually don't have to respec. Going deep resto is garbage because Swiftmend is garbage, so the real good healer build has you grabbing a bunch of balance talents. However, you can just grab the 21 points in resto you need for Nature's Swiftness, and dump the remaining 30 into Feral. This build leaves you slightly worse than a dedicated feral or resto druid, but for dungeons the downgrade isn't enough to outweigh the flexibility.
---
Does mean you need to keep a spare set of gear, but you should already be doing that anyway since levelling as feral in cat form needs strength/agility/ap anyway.
---
Seen to many drama fridays to say this is a good idea :]], but I'm sure your attempt will be different

Thanks for the great info. One thing, how do you get her to agree to try it. 
---
I used to play vanilla/tbc/wotlk/cata/mists, then I quit when I met her. She knows I used to play but doesn’t know I do now (opposite shifts every 2 weeks). 
---
She thinks it’s a waste of time because we’re “adults”(some people seem to use that term loosely, including her). 
---
I know if I could get her going she would love it. She used to play games like runescape, Habbo, cs, Dota, etc. she now plays games occasionally (mobile, switch, sims), but refuses to try wow. 
---
Plz halp
---
It was only a matter of time though, eventually every streamer is gonna need some newish content to break up what they’re doing. So why not roll a character on the other faction, and what a better place to roll the other faction than on the other largest pop server? Of course asmon is doing it for shenanigans, but to think that Herod was going to forever be streamer free is silly.
---
Imagine caring so much about how other people spend their free time. Some people just like the grind.
---
I don’t think it’s something broken that retail could “fix” it’s basically just so you can’t escape the predicament of fighting two mobs at once.

Yep. Don't even have the decency to bandage or eat between pulls. Just tap to 20% then stare at you. Savages

I'm on Herod and don't want an even bigger faction imbalance, but some of these comments are so funny that I'm kind of loving it
---
You clearly cant read between the lines.
---
Let me spell it out plainly for you. 
---
If calling out someone for getting pissy about screenshot vs photo is destructive and useless, then by that same logic, the original comment complaining about screenshot vs photo is equally destructive and useless. And by condemning one but not the other, you are indirectly signaling that you side with the original complaint.
---
So let me ask again, do you have trouble understanding the post? No??? Then stop defending people who get pissy and try to shame people who post photos
---
Tried to copper feel from her
---
As a warrior, the sound I am most familiar with is "whoosh".
---
it does this for horde org-&gt;ungoro is some bullshit 6 layover, better to fly to gagetzan and then ungoro
---
Female undead Warriors have the best animation of classic &lt;3
---
clear. thank you
---
Smoking is bad.
---
No pretty sure it was real, maybe was cancelled tho
---
nice, thanks
---
I'm starting my whirlwind quest tonight on Grobulous. If any of you want to preemptively pay me, I will gladly preemptively fuck off.
---
Dude Ninja's loot, makes a fail guild full of trash players and now that he sees Olympus sinking he wants to leave and come trash a new Realm. We dont want or need his moldy cockroach infested playerbase adding to a queue time.
---
You should come join us on classic though! You will enjoy wow much more!
---
you have a whole keyboard's worth of bindings to use, how does not having extra mouse buttons make you a clicker lmao
---
My Parents and every single one of my Aunts and Uncles are in their 50s and have never played a video game in their life. Maybe they played like Pac Man at an arcade in the 80s but certainly nothing like WoW or Skyrim.
---
Never agreed nor disagreed with you. 
---
Just said trusting a GMs word as law was a mistake.
---
Good catch, I meant Razorfen Downs (RFD) not SFK.  Had SFK in my mind because I just did a power group through there.
---
But it's not.
---
Just go for ravenger at that point
---
One of the comments says it seems to be functional in classic, Can't hurt just dropping it in your classic folder and seeing if it will work.
---
What are your unit frames? They look like xperl but i cant find any working version to classic. Pls help :(
---
I'll share my experience. I played as enh until level 45, at which point I switched to ele.
---
I healed lots of dungeons as enh. Until the mid 30s, I never even broke a sweat on mana, with no int gear at all. When I healed SM Lib as enh with no int gear, though, I found it was getting a lot harder to heal. I was using basically my whole Mana bar in every pull, and if we had messed up and pulled more than we meant to at any point, it would have been a wipe. Drinking to full mana between every single pull and not having enough mana to handle an emergency sucked, for me and for my group. So I started collecting int gear for when I healed.
---
For what it's worth, I didn't have to carry the int gear around with me, I kept it in the bank.
---
Having that int gear handy, though, gave me a headstart when I decided to respec to ele at 45. Really, I should have done it at about 40 or 41. Once you get some of the high-tier talents like Elemental Fury and Lightning Mastery and Elemental Mastery, you can deal amazing damage as ele, without even having to drink too much, at least not any more often than enh does at that level. However, before you get those talents, ele is not that good. You don't deal great damage and you have to drink way more often than enh at the same level.
---
I think a good roadmap for someone leveling a shaman is
---
1. Start as enh, heal dungeons whenever you like, just collect melee gear
---
2. At level 30, start collecting int gear alongside your melee gear, and use the int gear while healing in dungeons
---
3. At level 40, respec to ele, continue healing
---
As ele, you can heal probably anything up to early BRD bosses just fine, but I'd want to be a specced healer for late BRD, Scholo, LBRS, or Strat. So either respec to resto at 55 if you want to dungeon grind the rest of the way to 60, or stay ele and primarily quest or DPS dungeons the rest of the way to 60.
---
You can 1-3 shot mobs and players all the way to 60 with the starting level dagger. No need to fret over having the best one all the time. And if you want the best weapon in-hand at all times it’s super simple to set a macro to equip dagger to ambush and then equip other weapon for SS and other attacks.
---
buying gf
---
thanks all. Got a boar from RFK today. Problem solved, for now...
---
what is he going to do? kick has like a 8 second cooldown and fearing cant work because theyre forsaken
---
Well, my mother is 61yo and is raiding tomorrow
---
Boo hoo wah wah goo goo gaga
---
Classic, wow!
---
Let me just say LOL.  In all seriousness, with no sarcasm whatsoever, I actually find this hilarious.  I really do want to say how much this nonsense is brightening up my workday and for that, have an upvote.  To give you an idea, my first thought upon reading this was a mental image of Dave Chappelle in full plate armor, yelling "Just because I'm dressed this way DOES NOT make me a warrior!"  
---
But all that aside, you still missed the point that I made by a mile.  You need a group because you want dungeon loot.  The group needs a tank because the group wants dungeon loot.  If you refuse to tank, then the group does not need you.  It really is that simple.  
---
"But, Muh Warrior's Right To Choose!"  Funny, that sounds like it totally isn't the group's problem.  If your guild wants to team up and run you, good on them.  If you want to solo grind to 60 ranting in global about how shields are the work of the devil, have fun.  I'm gonna be in this dungeon over here buffing this tank we just found.
---
Alliance on DD in STV... Your numbers arent that low there. Lol.
---
Why would you assume I don't care about this person? He was a person with feelings. He had family that cares about him. 
---
He lives in the democratic West, where he should have been innocent until proven guilty.
---
Or to appeal to those in the 'believe all women' camp: Every time something like this happens, you lose somebody that is sympathetic to the core message. Somebody like me.
---
&gt;Titanomachia
---
Titanomachia wasnt a faction figthing the Olympians - that would be the Titans.  Titanomachia is what the war between Zeus and the Titans was called.
---
ur gunna raid org and kill the homeless orc begging for gold?
---
Just to play mods advocate, just because your post got upvoted doesn't mean it's relevant to this sub. People upvote dumb shit all the time. Look at the front page
---
the slog in the 30s mostly comes from goofing up your quest consumption and not having a lot of good questing areas. when all you have are high yellow/orange quests, it really feels like a slog on any class.
---
NYPA.  Take it to your realm forum or discord to publicly shame another player if you feel you must.
---
Is phase 2 up?
---
I generally do a scan every time I log on my bank alt so the search tab updates accurately, only takes a few seconds so its a part of my routine. Any hints on that research?
---
Wait. Where can I find this info? If you have a link I’d appreciate it! I’m on my phone, I’ll look when I’m back. I’d definitely appreciate a pointer though.
---
No. They are in a set order, they don't change places based on the order in which you learn them.
---
I just learned aquatic on my second druid (after cat this time). On both druids, the order is Bear, Aquatic, Cat.
---
They are ordered, however, in the order when you can learn them. Since aquatic form can be learned before cat form, it is second on the bar.
---
Everyone needs a tank for dungeons. Nobody needs a tank for raids. What's the incentive to tank for people?
---
you realize the O and the E are on the opposite side of the keyboard right
---
That was a rumor. I have several lvl 60 players in my guild, all of whom said they have received no boost.
---
I don't get it.
---
Where’s magmar?
---
I like rogues a lot.
---
I also like pvp a lot, and raiding a bit.
---
The thing keeping me from making a rogue is that you need 2 completely different specs to do each... And that seems really expensive and annoying.
---
Is it that big of a deal?
---
Unless they were getting to that point pretty early. I couldn't have bought all of my charms even if I had wanted to. There weren't enough available for one of them (forgot which type) and the others were 50s minimum. Luckily I decided to do the troll grind after checking AH and ran into a warrior shaman duo so we 3 manned everything.
---
&gt;Another time a "dps" warrior 4 levels above me tells me "Hold aggro or I kick" as he heroic strikes the boss over and over again.
---
this sentence makes me irrationally angry.
---
Yesssss! This! Im a tauren hunter and I was closing my playtime for the day...out of nowhere a rogue ganks me and I was like dude....Im
---
Just a tauren hunter on my way to graze....Normally I wouldve fought back but I was tired
---
no
---
All i can give you is that the addon from curse in addition to bartender4 gave me lorti ui actions bars but not unit frames, but when i downloaded Punkrat’s addon package and drew his Lorti to my addon folder... ecerything worked.
---
Looks like Stormwind to me
---
nothing against you op,  it isnt classic that is causing this problem it you on your end,
---
Sure got me there bud. Basic logic just doesn't work on some people.
---
It really does seem that way, something could provoke some real discussion and conversation but if any of the mods dislike or disagree with it, it disappears.
---
&gt; Spell power increases mana from life tap but does not increase life lost
---
It absolutely does. My lifetap drains more than 600 of my health, which is way beyond  what last rank lifetap + improved lifetap does.
---
Elemental fires aren’t even worth farming now. At least on my server. This was my main money maker on p servers but for some reason they don’t cost a lot in classic.
---
Your scalloped potatoes are FUCKED
---
Kromcrush horde unite!
---
You used a shitty analogy, stop trying to defend it and think of a new one for the future to avoid downvotes.
---
Comparing anything to slavery is not “nuanced”.

Case closed. Disabling replies.

could you upload your settings by chance? The orbs just sit in the middle of my screen.

Holy shit

Please enjoy this you f****** casual!

Recently I started playing as a Gnome Warrior for fun ('cause I find gnomes funny to play) and I thought about this:
---
Will I have a hard time being accepted in a guild because I "can be harder to see" while tanking up in the front line?
---
(No PvP intended.... yet)
---
You can get WW axe a fair bit earlier than Bonebiter unless you find a group willing to carry an aggro magnet around Cath.
---
You sure loot rules were stated ahead of time at the beginning of a run? Profession privilege on non-BoP recipes/plans/schematics is a house rule, not a generally accepted one. 
---
More common is the Need on all BoEs rule, which should be the norm. (Since all need gold)
---
I hope Blizzard do nothing about him, cause a ban or anything, will resolve in even more focus on him. Let him be dumb for a day on Herod, and he will move on to something else.
---
Edgemasters is not worth it on human, feel free to check it out in the spreadsheet
---
Not a question about warriors but on these posts can you attach links to past class Friday’s that have been done? Seems like that would be helpful to a lot of people
---
no evidence whatsoever
---
Deep wounds, impale.
---
The crit stacks with those, dont forget to add them in.
---
Spolissack is a ninja looter. Just take my word for it
---
It's not even a contest combat is so much faster. If you average a mob kill every 30 seconds blade flurry alone increases speed by 25%.  Ya maybe a green 21 can be ambush crit for 2/3 it's hp but not after lvl 35.  5% hit from combat is huge. Imp gouge for first aid, imp sprint to remove cc.... Ect ect.
---
Yeah I think so. It is just much easier than keeping track of a DKP system, and true RNG where you just roll shit off favors lucky players and doesn't reward players that necessarily put in the work.
---
Now what you explain sounds like a shitty loot council. In general you don't want to completely gear out certain players or let people get multiple drops, because the only reason people raid week after week is for loot. 
---
If one player completes everything they need, they will stop raiding generally if they don't have close ties to the guild. They could just leave your guild as well. If a player isn't getting any loot, they could leave the guild.
---
What I would do is raise your concerns with your guild master/officer about not getting even a chance to get loot despite being there the whole time, and what I assume is doing the right prep and having decent DPS.
---
Questie let’s you track more than 5 at once, but I’m not sure if you’re able to disable the other tracking features. Always worth a shot!
---
Karl
---
Thanks, mate. I was so lucky with that roll. We had so many casters who rolled for it.
---
the other day when i WASNT streaming or recording, i fought a mob and we parried off each other 4 consecutive times each, repeatedly. the parry haste was nuts for both of us
---
It's funny to say that when all the sims and bis items disagree with you.
---
It's moments like these that are why I'm mostly a pacifist on a PVP server. These moments are magical and I've had them happen like a dozen times so far.
---
He has actually recently(about a week or two) banned all ninja looting across all his guilds. if found out results in a /gkick
---
Well I tried scrolling down to those options manually (all the options are in alphabetical order) and the videocontrol options weren't even there, unfortunately.
---
You can buy it from another player but have to be exalted to learn to ride it
---
Paladin has decent soloing capabilities since there are several damage-increasing talents in the tree, but it is not flexible like druid and you may find yourself needing to build your spec around getting certain buffs if your guild needs that. I think a major advantage to Pally is that you can heal quite adequately as Ret (or prot) if you talent correctly, since the major throughput talent (Healing Light) is quite low in the tree. Paladin healing is extremely simple and scales very well if you play as a pure Holy. Because it is plate, gearing up casually is fairly simple since you can use the best caster gear from every armor type.
---
Druid is the most complicated and is probably the weakest healer, but will also be the most rewarding if you would like to solo things. Druid healing has some idiosyncrasies that you will need to learn to play around, such as how players can only have one set of hots at a time. Resto druid is probably the easiest spec in the game to gear up as a casual raider since you will have very little competition for gear if you are content to wear your tier set (which is not optimal but functional for a casual healer).
---
Shaman has some of the same advantages as pally in that it can take gear from all of the other armor types, however it is probably the least capable at soloing as resto since you'll want to put nearly all of your talent points into the resto tree.
---
I am least familiar with Priest however I know they're the most capable main spec healer at 60.
---
All healers will solo best with a different set of gear (one that focuses on damage dealing). Paladin and Druid are probably the easiest to play casually since both can benefit from basically anything you can wear. You can solo as Holy by playing as an ersatz Ret with a 2h and str gear (or heal as a ret/holy hybrid) or you can stack spell damage to benefit your Holy Shock, Consecrate and Judgement of Righteousness as deep Holy so that you can use any general int or spell damage gear you have. Druid forms amplify the effectiveness of whatever gear set you use in a similar way. Pally, Druid, and Shaman are all desirable in raid for their buffs alone, which can mitigate the need for good healing gear to a degree.
---
Paladin is probably the best overall for a casual player. Very simple toolset, powerful buffs that make multiple paladins necessary for raiding regardless of gear, and decent talent options for soloing.
---
I'll look into it when I get home, but I always update Mozilla when it prompts me to.
---
There's a riding skill for every racial  kind of mount which you need exalted rep to learn(except with your own race)
---
Idk most of his videos are either guides or talking about tanking in very general terms. I think a lot is applicable and I would tell any aspiring tank to check him out
---
But he isn't planning on rerolling on herod?
---
gaaaah, unfortunate. so the only way for a dwarf to get the strider mount is basically donate 15000 cloth
---
That one quest took me 2 days to finish lmao
---
Druids can't equip axes.
---
Absolutely ... I expected pickpocketing to carry a big weigth of my gold for the first mount. Had to find a new idea for that.
---
So you can talk to people on other servers? I dont actually know whats going on here if some1 could inform me please
---
Give up. But put a comfy couch and tv in your computer room so she can watch Netflix while you game
---
He got a handjob at a fair.. from a miner.
---
There are plenty of streamers on Herod you are not aware of.
---
No. Standard racial mounts can be bought from other players if they haven't used it yet, but you still need exalted to train to ride it if it's of a different race.
---
There is a recruitment section on the realm discord where guilds post needs, raid times, rules etc.
---
Check that out if you haven't yet.
---
Pretty much every class has a different spec for PvP and PvE content.
---
If you want to always be optimal, you will be respeccing constantly no matter what.
---
Some classes have it easier than others, but Rogue certainly isn't the worst in this regard.
---
Combat is decent in PvP. Don't have much experience with Dagger specs in Raids, but as long as you aren't trying to top damage meters you'll be fine.
---
Whatever kind of person he doesn't like probably
---
I picked one up second hand right before Classic released.  Nice.
---
And incase you dont know, ram riding is seperate from horse,saber, or mechanostrider riding. So you do still have to be exalted with that faction to learn to ride it.
---
I have questie already so I will look into this. Thank you!
---
Time to never quest in hillsbrad again :P
---
That emoji doesn’t signify you’re making a joke, it signifies that your opinion is irrelevant and you have no meaningful thoughts to contribute.
---
This comment didn't age well.  Seems like a man with the power to command Hordes of players isn't 100% altruistic after all.  He just queue bombed Herod, fucking over the native population for some 'drama'.
---
Huff nitrogen
---
Time for everyone to do their part and roll Alliance to gank him.
---
Lmao wrong. Because I could of took that pattern, sold it, and bought the pattern for my best in slot piece. spoiled brat. easy to tell when someone was never told no as a child
---
The problems you stated are common. It is what came after DKP. DKP has its issues but it solves the problem you stated
---
Awesome. I got the mageblade in MC. The stats on this are crazy though. Which one is better to use?
---
"He isn't on pornhub"
---
*I can fix that...*
---
He can roll for 2H mace, it's like his only choice he has for cat dps.  And EVERY Druid is CAT DPS, even Resto ones!  You were wrong. 
---
He probably just grabbed the axe to explode your brain after your mace tantrum.
---
Feels good to be European everyday.
---
And on your cake day, none the less. How dare he.
---
They're clearly a dick and at fault, but this is yet another example why everybody needs to adopt the all-need philosophy with BoEs. Trusting strangers to pass a bag of gold to you out of altruism is only ever going to hurt you, and attempting to publicly shame them very rarely has any impact.
---
If you put her on a pvp server your a mad lad.
---
Hey! What are you using for the minimap? I have tried a few but have not seen this one. I think this looks really neat so good job!
---
I also really enjoy creating my own UI design. I like to download Ealign so I can make sure everything is even. My plan for when I hit 60 is to only have my spells with a cool down showing so everything else will be hidden. Opie is really good for that kind of thing!

Ye but karma

Any mage that doesn't automatically pass out at least 3 stacks of water per mana bar in a group immediately upon entering the instance without being asked is awful at their class imo. As a former mage, the behavior of the people playing it in classic is very frustrating.
---
Why would you even consider bringing another human-being into this world... of warcraft? Shame on you. Addiction is a serious issue and you're asking us for advice on how to pull someone else into this world?... of warcraft. The best thing you could do is forget about it. Let her live her peaceful, ignorant life away from this life-sucking abomination of a game. Find a hobby she will enjoy without the need for a drug to be involved. Shame on you, sir. Think about this.
---
Beeig part of two big guilds ,make azeroth great again( which ended or changed name) and fairy tale which I'm enjoying at the moment,plenty of people healthy chat
---
DoT snapshotting wasn't a thing in Vanilla.
---
Edited, although I would say that its just showing proof of incident.
---
Because handing out buffs and water is not AOE damage, which is all they care about after watching Twitch streams
---
Good job I'm fury then.
---
And good job hamstring kiting isn't as effective as private servers.
---
It would remove the ability for everyone to all roll need for an equal chance at a BoE
---
This guy gets it.
---
Do you legitimately think that? He clears MC and Ony every week. He literally did this just to make everyone mad which drives more people to his stream. He is also the Main Tank and hasn't actually ninja'd any gear other than for scripted content. The T2 helm Ozzy said he didnt actually want it before/after rolling because its a bad DPS helm.
---
Hey at least our populating is high now :/
---
That's why you don't answer a comment 1 sec after reading it
---
I actually don't plan on raiding. I will switch to arms for PvP.
---
When you shift click someone's name it puts the sever name at the end, very annoying. I don't believe it allows cross server communication. It would be because blizzard are using the new code to run wow classic and this would be something implemented in the code (that's new) hence the meme no changes because classic would not do this.
---
Nah he is just stirring up shit for publicity
---
It’s 15 bucks...  she’s probably worth it ...
---
All horde players see that message, you need to go to org and get the necklace recovery quest, which has you go out and find that necklace, then turn it in
---
To be honest, I have no clue. I will have to study the possible combinations.
---
The funny thing was, just before we engaged the boss - I was joking how if Azuresong Mageblade drops, it is mine without rolling. I am a mage it is a MAGEblade, and it says Nizzresong right there. One of the guys told me "Just watch me rolling 100 on it". Two minutes later, this happens.
---
Go pick pocket brd and get yourself jumper cable recipes
---
I respected at 56 for exact same reasons. Worked out for me.
---
You can ask a GM, they usually do it and grant a day or two.
---
No, there's no trial or starter edition for Classic. You can let her play on your account, but you can't play with her without paying for game time for a second account.
---
Addon Called ActionBarSaver should do this
---
Because alliance never does that!
---
Put this on a banner and paste it on every gaming sub please.
---
“Your auction has expired”
---
Tank and heals get health stones. DPS who ask get health stones. Heals get the soul stone.
---
I can tap the mana back, the healer will heal me, and my DPS will trickle off for 6 whole mobs while I get shards back.
---
Then we clear the stupid dungeon and everyone goes home happy.
---
This isn't hard. Why would you actively work against your own success like that?
---
Much deserved, enjoy the ban. Hope they change it to perm.
---
Since when is being a selfish cunt a built-in feature?
---
Awesome Work!
---
We are getting closer and closer to Grand Inquisitor Whitemane blasting some major toots
---
You could all roll greed. Unless, you know, you actually "need" to use it, then you need.
---
Absolutely, no pre-shielding or prehotting - that would give a large advantage and not really a duel starting fresh.
---
Ah so it doesnt actually disrupt game play, thats good i understand the meme now haha ty
---
0/31/20 (or similar variation) makes an awesome Druid hybrid kitty/healer.  However they are not the easiest healing class to play. Piest and Palie are easier. Plus no free rez for "oopsies".
---
If I grind out the blue PvP set, will I be competitive in BGs or do I need to obtain raid gear?
---
It's a lucky situation also based on the racial. You can use it every 30 mins. Nothing to do with warrior
---
im currently lvling a shaman alt and i sometimes heal dungeons. you bet im going to roll on enhance gear. if you think im going to pass on that 2h axe or that leather/mail dps leveling gear, then sorry but no.
---
Not op but I'm 27, and I usually only watch his highlights, It's entertaining me
---
Why wouldn't he? This is just to stir up drama. He will likely only play offline over the course of months for his character just like he has for his alts
---
I prefer if a rogue focuses on one target. I would put out marks so everyone knows what to attack but often it is a caster. If you pull aggro right away you are probably attacking too soon but if the mob is about to die you can just kidney shot it and continue to focus it down otherwise maybe use vanish to rest your threat. If it is a caster you can "handle" the mob longer with tools like kick, gouge to interrupt cast. But some tanks will not like dps pulling threat at all so be aware of that. I don't mind if it is under control, if mobs are running all over the place then there is a problem.
---
I'm trying to find other ways before spending money for a game she potentially quits two hours in.
---
I dread the phase 2 release. Right now engaging in pvp is a conscious and meaningful choice. There is no inherent reason to kill people from the other faction. If you do it, its because you made that decision in this specific case. Be it whether you are fighting for ressources, personal reasons or the luls. You made the decision to kill that player and he knows it.   
---
Honor removes this level of "interfactional" interaction. Enemy players are reduced to a ressource themselves. Its not about the player anymore. Its just about "can I kill him and do I get honor for it?". Every other player facette is rendered pretty much useless.
---
I always felt bad about killing the minors in hillsbrad.
---
Yeah, would send the duel request and need to follow or wait when they decide to hit the accept.
---
Does the Warlock Life Tap spell add to the DPS add ons?
---
how  the fuck do you collude without communication? what kind of mental gymnastics are you trying to pull here
---
I mean, it's already a great idea to give Hillsbrad a wide berth, it's just going to get somehow worse!
---
This one wins.
---
Fantastic, and this is from a lvl 45 quest?
---
TBH that's probably what's going to happen. They're probably aiming for winter 2019, which puts release closer to March 19th, 2020.
---
RemindMe! 27 days
---
Do you really think that hundreds of mindless zombies would have gone away in 5 minutes after taking the trip there just because they didn't receive attention?
---
It's extremely convenient how the "best" candidates in most loot council raids are members of the officer team who, when questioned, only like to spout about their "commitment" while ignoring they've missed more raids than 3 of the other Mages in the group.
---
Ah yes 100% agreed! Put that buff on just like a Battle Shout and get into the brawl.
---
&gt;I mean do you really think hes going to abandon his current main which has a Bindings of the Windseeker
---
Whatever brings him more viewers
---
Do you bandage and eat food to heal yourself?
---
This ⬆
---
Fuck that bureaucratic noise
---
Thats incorrect. Dps is the unit of measurement in which damage is dealt. DDs are the main source of damage. Yes, tanks also deal damage, but their dps is way lower and it is not their main purpose. Dont try to reinvent the wheel, zoomer.
---
Nah ill do whatever i want
---
“Waited up to thirty minutes” lol that is nothing.
---
*STV has entered the chat*
---
Suprisingly, I never got credit for that quest.

Battle groups for battleground phases

/beg
---
Nothing needs to beat them. you said you need to be rank 14 to play warrior... That's simply not true there are plenty of other weapons warriors can use and still be effective.
---
Lol damn dude nice retorts really got me all on all my points there.
---
oof
---
Thank you, I'll do that! Why is it so essential for warlocks specifically?
---
Which nameplate addon are you using?
---
I always go about 25 yards away, rebuffs i dont care im gonna setup my poisons and stealth + accept
---
Implying there's a single difference between the mindset and average player of the two factions
---
One of the mages biggest pros in being in a group...is giving people water...these guys are just assholes.

Like retail tokens for gold you mean...  And tbh boxing isn't a guaranteed win if you are ready for that fight.  With the right class there are a lot of things you can do to ruin a boxers day.  Fear being my fav.  Nothing more frustrating to a muliboxer than having all 5 chars out of follow range and facing random directions.  They either need to drop chars temporarily or run around scooping them up.  Boxer hunt groups are also a thing if you want to bring friends /shrug
---
Not rly any diff to a 60 ganking lowbies- they have an advantage but it's not insurmountable, especially if you can round up some friends
---
Not a racial. Class ability. Recklessness.
---
Update it. I know the first versions I had didn't have the tracker. The updated ones I think had it enabled by default
---
Except he didnt even remember the guy so he must not have been that bad. But he feels the need to come on here and be dramatic. Continue sucking each other off please its this kind of shit that convinces me Classic was never good.

I'm an American, and I feel sick pretty often.

You can get it at 45 but the quest requires you kill princess in [Maraudon](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17705/thrash-blade)
---
I’ve dealt with so many misunderstood ganks so far, I doubt it will matter. 
---
Like damn, I’m just sheeping you when you finish combat so you can get full HP/Mana without wasting food/water! Hell I even wave and run away. But they always show up a couple minutes later to gank me and t-bag my corpse. Smh, makes my lil gnome self a little weary of helping others.
---
All of those posts clearly violate the rules about memes as well. Without low-effort copy-pasting of game logos, they have nothing to do with wow. OP is the living definition of surprised pikachu face.

The alliance FP is south of the lake and the horde FP is right next to the Timbermaw tunnel.
---
maybe it would be easier without the PROGAYMERELITE UI
---
Yes, so binding the item when you roll need has taken away the option that a significant portion of the community agrees with. Taking away options from the community is not progress
---
Beautiful, that's the balance between reading and info I was hoping for! Thanks!

I see, thank you, il get my guild to carry me -_- sad boy moments.

Trust me, the guy is a meth head who plays WoW.

Was in a MC raid on Thurs with a bear MT'ing Rag.  Warrs aren't end-all, be-all.  Bears are good if they have gear and the player knows how to play.  Pallys...trash tanks and that's about it, though apparently they can be somewhat successful in 5mans.
---
Yes, something needs to beat them in order for r14 to not be the way of obtaining the best weapons available to you.
---
fck im dont quote me on this im scared now
---
Getting all my alts up to 60 now so I don’t have to during honor phase
---
LMAO
---
There are a number of lore books in game that have a random chance to spawn in any number of places. If you're interested in that sort of stuff, take the time to at least hover over books you find on tables and stuff. It's pretty cool
---
The thing is, aside from the launch day / week of Classic, you'll never see that many players in a starting zone or zone in general all at once ever again.
---
Go make a new character on any server and you'll find the starting zones sparsely populated, if at all.
---
As Blizzard noted earlier this week, most realms have two layers and some of the smaller ones only have one. 
---
As more and more players reach end game dungeons and content, lower level dungeons in certain parts of the world become harder to do since no one is doing them at all. Just like in Vanilla. 
---
So I guess it is a blessing and a curse to have that kind of cancer on your server. Some players will suddenly find the influx of players useful so they can do dungeons at a faster pace.
---
Threatplates classic, got it for dungeons but it's nice in PVP too!
---
Yikes
---
It's really weird how it fluctuates for me. I see a red name in Hillsbrad or Alterac and I know I'm in for a world of shit, but in Desolace and Arathi I cross other players all the fucking time and still haven't been ganked.
---
Fuck that, I've been camped so many times at this point that literally every Horde is KoS at this point. Fucking assholes
---
i dislike streamers too. i dont get the appeal and i think the whole concept is dumb af... but man you're really mad about it. Maybe take a break from the internet for a little bit.
---
Yes. Ive been playing video games for 20 years now. I have since acquired both the ability to open the options menu and to read the captions in there.

What I am concerned with is the fact that companies feel the need to censor in such ridiculous ways out of fear that someone might get offended. They literally hide half of a completely harmless, very common word because it remotely resembles an incorrectly spelled slur...
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
I'm Horde on Razorgore and Alliance are exact like this. Factions are both the same.
---
Sorry for being obtuse. What do you mean by “being summoned inside the instance”. I thought you can’t summon in an instance.
---
Loot council is based on the idea that funnelling gear to specific members is the best for the raid's progression. If you have a problem with that, stay away from loot council guilds.
---
It's heavily open to abuse and what happens frequently is the officer team/a team of friends get funnelled all the loot with no evidence why they're the best candidate for each item.

As a prot warrior I feel obliged regardless alliance or horde when I see another in need especially other warriors.  Ik that pain of dying because you pulled 2 mobs.  And being honest when that one random saves you from certain death it feels amazing
---
As a mage, my favorite is playing switcheroo, I sheep someone who's low health, wait for them to heal full then wand them once. Wave and run along my merry way

Not for me, Those bastards knew there is 0 chance you can tag mobs before their blink+fireblast.

Honer Kill rankings are released—meaning world pvp has material rewards, and will become savage and merciless

You guys give him so much attention. Just ignore him
---
The damage a warlock deals to themself through life tap is not counted as part of their dps, no.
---
Thank you so much!
---
To be honest this was the mistake and the hunter might not have rolled at all if you had simply said this. Btw I don’t think you’re an asshole but there’s no reason for anyone to ‘expect’ that you are a tailor.
---
ok, ok my bad... just dont know how that happens on a official server so I assumed...
---
He's not personally spamming, his followers are. You can't ban him for simply existing.
---
I don't blame them though. Crescent is probably their best aggro generating weapon. Probably the only way they can keep up with pug dps splurging uncontrollably.
---
almost pre BiS is good enough
---
&gt; re-specing every other day
---
you misunderstood them. in classic you can tank everything but raids as whatever spec as long as you play like a tank. I've tanked everything to level 50 on my warrior as arms, I just go in def stance and sunder to tank; at lower levels I don't even need a shield. Druids pretty much just have to go in bear form and youre good.
---
Oh god
---
If you don’t mind me asking. When do you need to track more than 5 at a time? Not saying you don’t need to, I just never seem to have to track that many
---
Oh shit, I love world pvp. Time to get back into classic ig
---
Phase 2 is the next major classic patch release. Pvp awards come in that phase.
---
If only that worked, people watch him with or without me involved
---
you can read about the phase 2 news on Wowhead
---
Earthfury is probably 45ish% ally which is a pretty decent faction balance but it is one of the more low pop servers
---
No.... Just no.  Cleave meta is relatively new (on retail anyway ( private servers were shit for so long with mobs just being tank and spank literally that cleave would make sense).
---
That's not what you said though, you said you need to be r14 to play warrior. 99.9% of warriors will never be rank 14 and will play just fine.
---
VICTORY OR DEATH!  FOR THE HORDE!
---
Oh really? Did you even took a look at the photos dumbass
---
It's not, you're also arguing against the overwhelming majority of players on terminology so lol at "reinventing the wheel" you fucking dumbass
---
I didn’t know they allowed you Care Bears to have swords that weren’t blunted
---
I will kill you all. 
---
If you see a paladin named Granite (or anybody in the order of the silver hand) don't bother /waving, we've already got seal of command queued for a delivery of Justice.
---
Yeah, before ignite and AQ, Mage is boring as it gets in raids. :/   
---
Druid and hunter are both easy to gear and fast levelers. I'm leaning, right now, towards leveling a hunter or druid, then later funneling gear and gold to level a warrior or paladin next.
---
Frostbite causes problems when you’re trying to group everything up together while blizzarding.
---
Why was Kazakhstan unkillable?

Zoomer and proud
---
What is lacking for raids? Is it heals, or dps?
---
I settled on PVE, I think. I'd rather focus on PVE and PVP when I feel like it in BGs.
---
Well I got put on admin leave after having a panic attack because my boss has a history of targeting disabled people and driving them out of the workplace. I am her current target. 
---
So I doubt you want it. I just am able to get about 49 hours of work done in 20 through efficiency.
---
Let me ask you, what do you think is the purpose of having need and greed separated out in the first place is? Thats a rhetorical question, you dont need to answer me here. Think it through for yourself. My suggestion better implements the original intent/purpose of that design. And if you don't see how it does, you dont understand the design in the first place. (Last post for me)
---
To be fair, even if you was botting. Being active i  guild chat could just be something you did to make sure you wouldnt get banned
---
Because why would he bother committing that sort of thing to memory when he obviously has an add-on that he can refer to. 
---
Has nothing to do with “sucking each other off”, you just made an argument that didn’t make sense and also made you look like an ass. So naturally, people are calling you out on it. 
---
P.S. “Classic was never good” doesn’t hurt anybody’s feelings, it just shows how salty you are. You can go back to your cave now.
---
I'm a fisherman. I like to fish in Wow. Often times I am in Bay of Storms on a Fill your bags fishing trip.

This Human Warrior comes past and tries to kill the 55 Elite Haetera Mob but runs away after a hard hit. They come over and emote to me wanting help. We try to take her down but I get one shotted... Should have feared more.
---
We come back from GY and this time I emote that we got it. Fear that fool to death.
---
Using only emotes and someone being nice we took down an elite hardhitting foe.
---
I will never forget that man. Was so much fun.
---
Hahaha ‘finally hit 40 and got my mount!’ For the 200th post is fine. But if someone tries to make a discussion about scammers or bots then we have to make sure that’s not alllowed :)

Just turn it off

nice
---
Rend loses its efficiency pretty much right after you get it.  I rarely use it other than dueling/pvp.  In almost all cases you get more dmg per rage on any ability you use.  
---
That's not to say it doesn't have its uses.  Any stealther will have a rough time when rend is on them.  It can't be cured so it prevents bandaging (well anything past the first tick of the bandage).  
---
But you are correct, it is rarely worth the rage.
---
Even lowbies or outnumber one of them?? There is no easy win, right??

See, that always irks me. As a Warlock, I take responsibility for my health. Our toolkit is so robust that if I die in a dungeon it was probably because I got overzealous with dotting or HF. As long as it’s not a full wipe, I can survive most encounters by playing smart and keeping my eyes open.
---
But someone that just Life Taps and doesn’t bother using Siphon/Drain Life or a cookie? That’s just a bad player. They make the rest of us look bad.
---
I love priest healers. Toss a PW:Shield and a renew my way and I can do almost anything. If I dot up SL and unleash HF with Shield on I’m nearly untouchable! Especially if a Frost Mage can lay down some freezes. Oh baby!
---
Twitch vs. Classic war has begun
---
I think it might get tracked under resource gained in details and recount, or potentially friendly fire is what I think they are asking.
---
In retail I agree, but I usually would do AWD, out of habit. But in vanilla backpedal actually has some uses as dungeskips and amount of movement shenanigans are more frequent and nuanced.
---
(i often play with a nostromo, so I move with a D-pad anyways) so I get to bind all my wasd
---
Robe of the void should be a really good item. Anything with lots of stamina is nice. Spellpower is nice too, but if you go SL tank prioritize stam more.
---
Hey he's gotta make a living somehow

Gz

Does it work with hulu?
---
I am really struggling to get passed the level 35 hump. I now have a druid, priest, shaman, and warrior all sitting around that level. I know that SM spamming is the fastest, but sometimes I don't want to do that and would rather just quest. /rant
---
this!! grobbulus is such a nice server, really glad i'm on it.
---
There's tons of content on youtube.  Go watch there on how to play your class.  1 caveat though, look for something that's been made in the last 6 months and that'll insulate you from watching a private server video - which may or may not have some wonky mechanics.
---
That’s encouraging. I am starting to get worried that I’ll have to raid as a warlock in order to stand a chance in BGs. As a casual player, I can’t commit to a raid schedule.
---
Hello there, sorry for being late to the party. I was wondering if there is a good tutorial or guide for tanking as a warrior in classic. For someone who is enthusiastic to help in dungeons but has almost no clue. Simple things Like how to hold threat and what to do if someone is getting aggro. Hope that’s not too embarrassing.
---
No one tanked as fury unless they were OT and the MT died.  Also Shield Slam was 1.6, not 1.12, what are you about 1.12 for?
---
I am here telling you that 2h/fury is just 'dps zerging', and literally nothing to do with 'tanking'.  And I have also done it as well...
---
You are here literally trying to claim shit like 'world first Rag was killed by a fury tank'.
---
Obviously you didn't directly say it, but you are implying it, and it was not the case.  Full stop.
---
Also check out all these prot buffs:  
---
    1.6:  Heroic Strike/Sunder Armor/Revenge/Mocking Blow - Tooltips updated to indicate the additional threat caused by these abilities. There have been no changes to the amount of threat caused  
---
    1.7:  Shield Slam - Threat caused increased.   
---
    1.8:   Mortal Strike - Now uses normalized attack power.  
---
             Overpower - Now uses normalized attack power.  
---
             Whirlwind - Now uses normalized attack power.   
---
    1.10:  Shield Slam: This ability has received a redesign. It now costs 20 rage to use and the damage it does is modified by your shield block value. However, the base damage has been reduced. It generates more threat per rage and more damage per rage than it did previously.    
---
    1.12:  Shield Slam: This ability will sometimes no longer remove more than one beneficial effect from the target.   
---
Shield slam was and still is optional and not the reason to go prot.
---
[Or are you going to sit here and try to tell me that the 1.5 fury tree was 'hot n sexy' with the 31 pt being '100% dmg on the next hit if you kill a mob'...](https://web.archive.org/web/20041223222402/http://www.thottbot.com/?ti=Warrior)
---
Your move.
---
It's a nice sound, but every 6 seconds for hours on end is a bit much.
---
https://discord.gg/nWy6Fx6
---
Join the Discord and try to join a guild would be my reccomendation
---
People leveling want to go SM/Ruin and have a shitty spec from 40-59 instead of putting points in DP or Demo.
---
So they could finally tank! Or give them something to compensate.
---
Mainly people wanting to take the staff or the axe, the 5 times it happened to me it was mainly warriors/paladins putting it on ML for the axe, but it did happen once with a warlock for the staff.
---
Seeing all these HOJ's on reddit is triggering
---
Sadly alliance is extremely under represented compared to horde on skeram :(
---
The map is called sexymap :) That sounds like a real nice idea you have, I have also been wondering about some way to have the action bars feeling less intrusive but I also like being able to see my spells.
---
Usually a mage is with so I have the bread , and yeah I first aid. I find the best thing a healer can do is a HoT on me and just leave me to it
---
I'm not sure what quin did with them, but yeah he got them in the end
---
You little shit.

I just wanted a little some Tin some Tin

I just turned in the warlock quest "Shard of a Felhound". Wowhead states that I should get a choice of a shadow two-hand or off-hand but it only gave me experience. Did I do something wrong?
---
Here's the Wowhead link:  [https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4962/shard-of-a-felhound](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=4962/shard-of-a-felhound)
---
dude i feel you. whenever i went over my mom and stepdads house i couldn't play games, and the one time i was actually allowed to bring some my stepdad was hella condescending about "did ya get enough points yet" even though whatever i was playing wasn't even something like that.
---
Yea you can. Blizzard has banned people for organizing stuff that crashes servers
---
As an alliance mage first time player, I'm not really sure what you guys do except lay down a totem and die 😉. From what I've seen you guys are better in groups. Is it rough solo leveling?
---
Really that sounds awesome! Can you post the link or PM it to me? Thanks!
---
Of all the classes to complain about not buffing because of mana costs, it’s the one with free water???
---
Me and my guild moved over about 2 weeks ago, and so far the community seems pretty great and the population is definitely going up. Faction balance seems a lot better as well coming over from Herod.
---
From my experience dps feels a lot more replaceable than heals
---
99% lol. I play Horde and I’ve only met 4 so far from 1-60 and 1-47 and in all my dungeons. Smorc tends to just keep silence which is fine with me
---
Selling enchanting mats.  In retail I had a DE alt from classic up to when I quit that I sent all greens and crappy blues to for DEing and just sold the mats.  Doing the same thing now.  Mats are always in demand, and thanks to them not having a listing price, you can keep relisting them forever until they sell and suffer no loss in profit.
---
Thank you for pointing out that it is a sql database
---
Yeah, I started on launch with a shaman went a day and a half and saw soooo many “lf tank...” now I have a 60 tank and get whispers non stop for dungeons it’s almost exhausting
---
As a healer sitting at level 51 atm, I can tell you  that I can tell the difference between a druid tank spec'd heavy into feral and properly geared for tank, and a druid tank that is not heavily spec'd into feral with or without the proper tank gear.
---
Can a druid tank, not spec'd properly, tank dungeons? they sure can, but you certainly aren't making friends with your healer!  when I tank, i want my healer to be saying, "Wow, you're easy to heal!"
---
I've never seen a mage give an excuse that buffing costs too much mana...
---
You can literally create new mana out of thin air!
---
The hysteria over Asmongold is fucking ridiculous
---
Yes I should have turned off addons...
---
Nice try trolling through my posts. Actually my tank is a warrior my shaman is pure resto spec. 
---
If you are really trying to tell me prot is better than arms in RFK / SM then clearly you don't play the class.
---
Also, on this logic, I'm an enchanter, and enchanting materials aren't bind on pickup, so I should roll need on everything, then? Its money after all.
---
Warriors never used sweeping strikes before nExT lEvEl sTrEAmeRs, true story.
---
i thought i tried everything to get hand of justice. kiss emotes, growl, thanks, you name it. I begged blizz in yells before anyone else entered the instance if it would just drop one time. now, thanks to you, i know what i really need to do.
---
Yeah because you can’t ninja in a group full of ninjas. Ninjas only work alone.
---
What level growl does your pet have?
---
Growl only gets upgraded every 10 levels. If you're level 20 but your pet is 19, or even 20 and you haven't upgraded growl, then you'll be doing the DPS of a level 20 while your pet is trying to hold aggro with a level 10 growl. Also auto cast the growl, good QOL thing to do. 
---
I ran a cat up until 50 and the main issues I ran into with threat were what I just explained, and if I got "unlucky" critical hits. Get a threat meter so you can know if you're approaching a point where you'll take over aggro. 
---
Apologies if you're already doing this but it's useful if you're not. I believe if you want to take threat from a pet, you need to exceed your pets threat by 10%. And then once you've got threat, cat needs to to the same to you to take over. So it's kinda important to let your pet attack first - and if your DPS is at a point where it's out leveled the pets growl by a bit and you can't upgrade growl yet, then no harm in letting your pet get two growls in before you start attacking. 
---
If you're attacking stuff that's higher level, keep an eye on whether the growl actually lands. This is something I underestimated, because my threat meter would still record the threat even if it didn't land. Had me confused because I didn't think about whether it had missed until I realised I unexpectedly pulled aggro, so couldn't retroactively see if it had actually landed.
---
You can summon in an instance from inside the same instance. For example if you recruit a new tank for the last boss of gnomer and they were waiting at the entrance for a group, they can walk into the instance and get summoned to where the whole group is without making the entire group go through the trouble of clearing respawned trash all the way back to the entrance to pick up the new member.
---
I’d recommend tier 2 over the pvp set. By phase 3, you will already have 2 pieces of tier 2. I personally would go with pvp blues over tier 1 though. Mixing pvp blues with tier 2 also isn’t a bad idea until you get full pvp epics (if that’s your end goal), but up to you. Mix and matching is good because some pieces are better from other sets (even tier 1). It really depends on your play style/spec and what set bonuses are the most useful.
---
snapshotting was removed in mists though
---
and thats true, it was LUA. But they gave us the retail macro API. Which included things not in classic (as none of the targeting functions were in classic like @player, @self, etc.). In classic you could give them custom ID's. Thats how raid frames addons were made.
---
They kept all of those EXCEPT focus. Which is weird since they also kept new raid frames to make up for the lack of being able to create them with an add-on. Focus was effectively in vanilla the same way raid frames, and @target / conditionals were in vanilla, but we don't have focus.
---
He has an AoE shadowbolt ability that ignores LoS and he heals for 70,000 hp when someone around him dies. With the amount of people in a major city to kill, he regenerates his health faster than you can realistically DPS.
---
Not lost, spam.
---
It definitely does. I don't even use the timer cause I've been too lazy but I've played rogues for years and know about when I need to open with CS (60 energy cost) so that I shoot right up to 60 almost immediately hops from 40 to 60.
---
Seems pretty good. Always see folks when I’m out questing. Started a month late and unknowingly started on a a “Streamer Server”. 
---
Second night signing on to 45 min queues, I gladly transferred to Earthfury.
---
I'll look into that one specifically, thanks
---
Arugal?
---
Look closer
---
Oh fuck off you idiot.  You know that's not the argument.
---
I agree, a balance in server faction would help immensely for the next phase. Please blizzard
---
It sounds like you're thinking of rogues long before the 1.12 patch that we are currently on in terms of abilities.
---
Except 5 minutes later allys are skullfucking the shit out of Kargath on  Gehennas-Eu
---
Going full prot is fine, but you absolutely can tank and tank efficiently as a fury prot hybrid.  I can't personally attest to tanking as arms, but I do know some warriors have no issues in dungeons as arms.  Keep in mind this may be because they have a well oiled group.
---
As for me, I have done just about every high end dungeon including UBRS as fury/prot and found as long as you get some key talents in prot, the threat generation from fury offsets the loss of the few prot abililties.
---
From prot you def want shield spec so it leads to imp shield block, defiance, last stand, and I personally took imp revenge as I knew I wouldnt be going far enough into prot to get concussion blow. 
---
Is shield slam amazing for threat? yes.  Is imp sunder going to save you alot of rage throughout an entire dungeon run or raid? yes.   
---
However, flurry, enrage, bloodthirst (having something NOT relying on autoattack like heroic strike/cleave that you can use to dump rage and relies on AP instead of weapon dmg so is REALLY useful with quick tanking weapons) ,  Improved Battleshout (alot of extra AP for all the rogues/dps wars/ enhance shamans etc. are really nice.
---
In other words, while this is my first war, and I may find myself going full prot eventually, I found fury/prot to be exactly what I want in my character.
---
oh shut the fuck up
---
Usually I put those people on ignore, it's radical but eh...
---
The weird one disappears when I target something or when I'm out of combat, weird workaround I haven't ironed out yet. Anyway, really not the point of this post, ciao!
---
Have you tried adding a [nomod] for the drain soul part?  Although I don't use mouseovers,  I had similar issues with mine as well
---
is there a good comprehensive guide to making macros? something that guides where to start when thinking of how to get to what you need because i don't even get how to know which set of functions to start on. something with some abstract thought development skills and not just a strung out list of examples
---
cant take credit for the setup haha
---
Was watching shroud play wow and thats how his are set up so i just copied.
---
Bar addon im using is dominos btw
---
Thank you for the info! Given the rank requirements for PvP epics, is it possible for a casual player to obtain them or do you really need to be hardcore grinding?
---
Everything is puggable.
---
&gt;  is sending my friend who plays horde a message via battle net a violation, of course not.
---
unless they're not actually a "friend" but someone you met on a forum who was on your server with the specific intention of colluding.  
---
Why would your friend be on the opposite faction of the same server anyway?
---
You can communicate without collusion however, are you retarded?
---
The ToS banned communication between the factions, not collusion. If you want to argue to go back to how it was, then you need to stop all communication between factions including battle net and discord etc, not just where collusion is involved.
---
Imo he won it fair and square. If you had been farming for it you should have mentioned it or not pugged a spot.
---
He’s just an STD.

so he got exactly what he needed, some fresh drama for his stream to attract new viewers and make his toxic-ass even more money
---
cool cool cool

Grenade is 3 second stun and intercept is 3 second stun, can’t blink both.
---
I didn't do it because it was "better", I did it because it was straightforward and easily repeatable. Like dailies in TBC.
---
Also what do you mean "bad on beta" ? Dire Maul wasn't in the beta.
---
I dont understand either. Guess we just see different sides of it.
---
Genuine question, what's wrong with players doing this?
---
the korean says Party Finding Helper
---
But at what cost?
---
Lol damn so angry, I don’t try to farm there often. when I log out at night I go to un goro to check if anyone is farming the spots in the morning. There’s a diff between wpvp and faction collusion
---
In your honest opinion, is retail wow worth trying? I want to make a second character ( my main is level 38 rn) and try out pvp. Is it a good idea to make it on retail or would you recommend having them both on classic? I’m new to wow and just starting playing when classic was released.
---
Are we sure they're not using .ini files?
---
Very basic intelligence. Like my niece that just started kindergarten.
---
This is my first war (lvl 59 atm), and I have ran into 3 basic issues that make you question whether you play a good tank, which can each be resolved in their own way.  Just because you don't have threat doesn't necessarily mean you are a bad tank.  
---
1) While healers can usually underlvl a dungeon, you almost always want to, or at least to be as efficient as possible, should slightly overlvl a dungeon.  In other words, if the mobs are going to be orange to you, you will have a hard time missing taunts, sunders, etc.  This is only made worse by problem 2, which is.. 
---
2) Overzealous DPS.  Some people either think this game is still retail threat, or know and don't care.  I don't get mad or really frustrated anymore, but keep in mind, some people will just go absolutely HAM before you even can LOS mobs into the room you are pulling mobs into.  Thankfully, as I have gotten higher in lvl, people either have had that behavior corrected, or the others in the group (as well as myself) won't tolerate it.
---
3) Gear.  Warriors by far are the most gear dependent class in classic wow.  There were several pivotal moments in my leveling experience that made a dungeon that I struggled to hold threat an absolute cakewalk. If you are going sword and board, your MH should be roughly in the range of 1.8-2.1 speed.  Anything under generates rage faster, but you eat too many ripostes and your specials hit too weak.  Anything too much slower and you are rage starved early in the fight if bloodrage isn't up.   Same issue, but to a lesser degree with armor. if you are in trash gear and have no armor/hp, you will be getting obliterated by mobs.
---
Other than that, the best advice I can give, and again I stress, this is my first war, so I have ALOT to learn myself, is cycle through targets to make sure everything is on you, dont just taunt if something is off you, taunt if you have enough rage for at least 1 sunder (bc taunt will just make it on you, now its up to you to keep it on you), and I am sure there are a few other things I am forgetting.
---
We're talking using it to dungeon spam not pvp arena.  2 separate things.
---
It's also different in that you have feral/dot (and other things) that definitely were not in the dungeon "meta".
---
toxic kid... oof
---
That’s bartender. I’ve always used it and I’m happy with it.
---
“I’m gonna do what’s a called a pro gamer move”
---
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
So it is safe to say it grew faster or more in popularity because of them? Or would that be hyperbole? I know it would be impossible to accurately quantify this, but from what you are saying it seems like a strong possibility.
---
Nice track
---
Kind of interested in a TV show about a PE teacher.. how did they make that good TV?
---
Found the hunter main.
---
I don't care. I have a right to be heard.
---
Exactly this.  The point of Classic was to recreate Vanilla as closely as possible.  The problems of certain specs in Vanilla have been known for a long time.  If for some reason you didn't know those issues already, a little research would have pointed them out.
---
My guild has like 6 rag kills by now or something and no spinal bre or onslaught hehe, though the first onslaught will probably go to maintank im afraid :(
---
I just want things to be fair. Rolling need is the fairest way to maximize benefit and minimize ninjaing.
---
how? The original guy asked if it could be datamined so obviously it's not /r/iamverysmart material if people don't understand how the info would be gathered. The guy was just explaining why it's not client side in a more clear method than the guy before him. Just saying "it's stored server side in an SQL database" is nothing more than adding more to the answer to help people who wouldn't understand why it couldn't be datamined in the first place
---
sometimes I feel like people who want just want to link someone to those kinda subs is just as bad if not worse than the original commenter
---
Omg I love throwing siphon life on 5+ mobs and then running into the center of them hell fire until I'm the last one standing, it's soooo satisfying.
---
Oh my. The wannabe-programmer in me wants to make a tab on my chat window called "YouTube" and have an external program that visually checks to see if that tab is selected. Upon being selected, Picture-in-Picture would be turned on and moved directly over the chat window, simulating an in-game youtube channel that can be switched on/off by switching tabs of the chat.
---
Let's make it happen? I'll mention it to some vampires I know.
---
Ohhh you are one of those crazy people.
---
Pagle-US
---
Not even a little bit, a bare modicum of care would’ve prevented this problem.
---
Why did you not make it a Quest? reward 1 Silver or so ;P
---
None is talking about druid/bears. How id tanking with them right now? Im thinking on lvling a druid, warrior looks a bit boring for me but ill give It a chance if there Is a big difference over bears.
---
Which healer can perform best as open world dps and group healer with just one set of gear (be it healer gear or dps gear)?
---
I'm not that keen of having multiple sets but I'd like to know which one suffers the least from having just one set for most of the time until I'm rich enough or farmed enough to have two of them.
---
And if so, does a healer set have more trouble in open world than a dps set would have healing in group content?
---
You have a right to rant. You don't have a right to have people listen. Especially without any sort of reason listed.
---
Download questie addon.
---
Get quests, do them, turn in. The game isn’t super complicated.
---
It's hard to say, quite frankly. Nost was growing in popularity very fast back when Soda joined so I'd definitely say he accelerated its growth, but I couldn't say by just how much. There was already an extreme desire for a good Vanilla server before he got involved and word of mouth about Nost was spreading fast.
---
The point is that Sodapoppin didn't "make" Nost what it was, he just gave it a bit of a boost.
---
Agreed, but how can people call his guild a failure then? It's literally impossible to fail in classic if you have 2 hands and a working monitor.
---
imagine being mad at SFK loots when the item gets replaced in the next 10 levels.
---
Always the rank 11 ones
---
Hey you were right! I tried it again when Jaina wasn't there and it worked fine. Thank you! Pretty decent reward at the end of a long chain. I would have been salty to waste all that time.
---
Ah yes. The text variable for the column within the row of the SQL table that relates to the book.
---
Looking at how the minmaxing attitude of streamers has created tons of toxicity within the playerbase, I'm not sure but if theorycrafting posts would be worse for the sub and community.
---
Because they're the only race worth playing.
---
Awesome mousepads
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the stream tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is he on Herod? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Herod to be streamer free and fix this broken game. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought Asmon was playing on Faerlina???? This is so fucked.
---
Cry about it. Any customer can play on any server they like.
---
Sort of glad they do it in the open world at the moment.. means I can drag my tagged mobs into their AOE, or fear all their mobs depending on my mood :D
---
you're being intentionally obtuse, you know same server is being implied.
---
Whats wrong with you goblin?
---
It adds dmg in the sense that your glancing blows will not have its dmg reduced by as much
---
The in game raid party interface is already really nice.
---
Imo.
---
You're making stuff up. The term came from TBC, not steamers.
---
Every MMO I've played that has a tank/healer/dps setup is always short tanks. That's why I made a warrior first, I knew this would be an issue and it's really nice knowing you can basically run any dungeon any time you want.
---
Spamming dungeons, nearly got my epic mount.
---
Thanks Captain British! I will eat a Crumpet and have some English Breakfast Tea in your name!
---
I agree with most of what you’ve said, but ravager tanking under 50 is still fantastic.
---
He’s a [mafia thug](https://novvedomosti.ru/images/news/52495-62-news-image.jpg) sent to that school to watch over his boss’s daughter. It’s more of a guilty pleasure thing to watch, the humor is borderline tasteless, but still manages to make you chuckle.
---
Today a hunter stole my neck from voone , felt good. kicked him and ran again
---
Just do it!
---
I just switched from combat to sub at 39... I got so bored of the spec I was questioning myself for a reroll for another class. 
---
I still use my swords (any best weapons I have) but open with an ambush macro to switch to a dagger then go back to my sword for Hemorrhage, etc...
---
It's nice to crit those alliances lol

Looks like ya got the arcanist helm too

What is the rant about? Maybe ill listen for a laugh.

Bends over and everything, great form.

Is this on Kromcrush Horde?  Your name looks familiar and I just had a mage refusing to buff this week in SM

The first mistake was planning a social gathering

---
I was really hesitant to transfer off of Stalagg but from what I hear about it now, it's a complete shit show and I'm glad I did. Extremely unbalanced and things like this just make it even worse.
---
This is so hard for me and I hate it. My level hump is 30 I have a Warlock, Shaman, Priest and now working on a Rogue to 30. The first time in vanilla I was a really bad alt-o-holic, server hopped constantly, I've never raided once nor have I ever hit 60. 
---
2nd time around I'm on Smolderweb with like 10 of my IRL friends we run our own guild (&lt;Nagas with Attitude&gt;) and me being the leader no one knows who the leader is because I'm always leveling another toon to 30 which is where I always seem to stop. 
---
I'm super bummed out I really wanted to complete some goals, do things I've never done before, finally have a level 60 AND raid for the first time.  Do AV finally and so many other things but I started to reroll on Whitemane and realised I'm repeating the same path as last time and afraid I'll never reach end game... again.
---
I wish it were different but I just cant seem to have the self control.
---
Streamers and stream followers are just the trashcan of humanity jesus christ you people are fucking damaged
---
Howl of Terror or Death Coil?
---
Already re rolled tank on my alt
---
Yep, the biggest drawback to tanking is that playing a DPS comes with a free meth of the month club subscription. Fucking tweakers can't sit still for one second while you loot, grab a mining node, or check the healer mana.
---
They were pretty good lvl 40 mount farming on my server but I don't think it's worth it for lvl 60 (gold) farming.
---
Gandlings wand is free, has 11 damage and healing, and 4 Intel to boot. 
---
Even paying 3g was a bit steep.
---
What is it with locks? I ran with one last night who would life tap down to within an inch of their life, then start asking for heals every time. I'm not your mana battery, dude.
---
It's so stressful grouping with a lock who does this, because you never know if they're life tapping or actually being hit.
---
If literally nobody else in the group needs them then reserving them is moot.
---
Welcome to the club!!!
---
I just hit 40 about an hour ago, have leveled purely as Sub Rogue. My build is focussed on Backstab/Ambush, big crits and utility.
---
I haven't used Remorseless Attacks, might be suboptimal but I just wanted to use the build I'd be using for PvP at 60 without ever respeccing. Just to get used to the feel and all.
---
Leveling has honestly been a breeze. Solo is obviously a bit less comfortable than with, say, a Hunter friend, but it's still really effortless and quick. I have barely ever had to eat food or bandage between fights as doing so for a few seconds with Imp Gouge is enough to keep me topped up.
---
With a ranged friend it's a lot easier though, as they'll just pull from range so you don't have to stealth all the way to the monster.
---
And... Ganking is just amazing. Only trouble I ever have is with Hunters that know their class well and... Mages, who just have too many tools to deal with properly.
---
Though, just going for the cheeky Ambush + Backstab (over 50% critchance on both) 'one' shot feels so cheap yet so amazing, it's fantastic.
---
I've been planning this build and theorycrafting for a while before launch (never played Vanilla), and I've met so many people frowning upon not leveling as Combat/Swords, but I'm pleasantly surprised at how effective it is, not to mention how insanely much fun I'm having playing it, already for 40 levels.
---
It wasn't used in TBC dungeons in a meta sense.
---
Please be literate if you're going to argue.
---
Yes, if that casual player is able to play at work or take a couple/few months of vacation time haha. Basically, you’ll be looking at 12-16+ hour days of PvP until you get your epic set (getting the blue set is not this intense). Tier 2 is an amazing pvp set for warlocks and you will only need to raid once/twice a week for it. Big win!
---
Read the hunter guide on wowhead it goes over talents, dps rotation and best in slot gear. Your top damage spells are aimed shot and multishot, these benefit a lot from having a slow weapon. Ideally 3+ seconds. As a bonus you also save on ammo cost. 
---
The hunter set armor Beaststalker is more useful in PvP because of its high stamina. In pve your main focus is pure damage so you want Crown of Tyranny or Mask of the Unforgiven for your head piece, both drop from Statholme Living side.
---
It's a shame they didn't make some common sense changes like making more than one real tanking class for The Horde
---
We have literally the same keyboard.
---
No I really don't, and nor do you. I only have the original wording to base it on and legal documents tend not to imply things. They spell them out. It never mentioned same server at all, it was probably to also cover things like cross faction abuse, not simply collusion.
---
Whew, I'm glad I dodged the streamer bullet with my Medium pop server.
---
Changed to Malown to own all the nubs
---
Yes. 90% of people commenting /r/woosh  are just being a douche.
---
Why did you have a party then
---
/aap skip
---
Meanwhile in Desolace, everyone is wondering not WHERE is Rexxar, but HOW is Rexxar.
---
He showed you bro
---
lol no.  it was entirely pservers.
---
TL;DR
---
First he complains about not getting beta and all the streamers got instead of him despite him being a long time customer. Also he quite literally says "I could have prevented all these bugs by myself"
---
He complains about 10man dungeon farming(which is fair enough that sucked), and dungeon layer hopping. He doesn't know that 10man dungeons was never a thing in the beta so it could not be tested by beta testers, the added 10man dungeons right before release so obviously it wasn't tested that thoroughly . As for layerhopping in dungeons, no idea if this was possible in beta, but everyone who abused it got banned so who cares. He blames this 10man dungeons on why he's so behind, as you can see his lvl 52 now, clearly everyone else would be 50 along with him if it wasn't for this awful 10man dungeon farming. No joke he literally thinks that 10man dungeoning massively changed the game lmao, yeah it was good but it's like 10 hours of gameplay saved by the biggest abusers of it.
---
Then he talks about item balance about it buffing everything(by buffing he means using the 1.12 version) and he can't understand why blizzard did this, even though they explained it in detail in various forum posts.
---
I rly regret watching this, holy mother of cringe.
---
A streamer going to a server is not ban worthy. A streamer going to a server going "hey let's crash the server boys" is bannable.
---
Did asmon say he was going there specifically to crash it or harass people? If not, no ban.
---
That's the stupidest shit I've ever heard
---
They aren't the ones garnering the reaction he wants. You are :)
---

Of all the responses on my post this is by far the smartest!  I never really even thought about putting her near me so she doesn’t feel like we’re not hanging out
---
So emotional...but great stuff to read.
---
Yeah i started to feel the same, it wasnt exactly like your online and offline life but  your story really got me.
---
This is the fact, blizzard created an Exceptional world, and the best game. Its so good, its still alive. But imho a game could be too good, and if a game is too good and has no real ending, then its addictive..
---
Wow got me. Worst time was in vanilla, TBC, up to wotlk.
---
Its a wonderful game, and it had an awesome social side (somehow), but surely some other human skills got weakened in this time..
---
I loved that game, and will always love it as it was so special to me, but man.. I have to be the master, to have the control, even in classic, theres just a small distance to insanity with this game.
---
For real.

Dominos doesn't have the option to keep the blizzard UI, that's why I wanted to use bartender!

I thought it was a human for a second since it wasn't hunch backed and I was very confused.

I used those robes for 15+ lvls lol
---
I didn't even know you could kill level 1 players. I figured you'd have to bring in a mob to kill him
---
The origin of the comment chain was dude talking about streamers spreading the cleave meta. Sure, it wasn't a dungeon meta term at the time but that's where the term was coined, in TBC. If you want to talk about literacy how about seeing context before calling people illiterate. I'm not arguing with you. I'm telling you where the term came from. Simmer down cowboy.
---
She stares at her phone far longer that I craft war
---
Thank you. Preordered the day it was announced.  Surprised it sold out honestly.
---
They were popular, but Streamers and Youtubers definitely gave them far more publicity than they ever would have otherwise. Sodapoppin brought in tons of attention for the server whether you like him or not. JonTron's video about Nost shutdown probably gave private servers more attention than any other video before it.
---
Like it or not, care to admit it or not, a large majority of the private server community is notorious for being incredibly elitist and keeping to themselves. They constantly gatekeep and aren't particularly welcoming to new people, and don't do much to get more people invested in it. Retail Streamers and Youtubers did a hundred times more to get people into private servers than the private server community did.
---
It does pay really well, but damn you’re right I’m so sick of it.
---
Some Olympus people are involved in this
---
THIS is what you imagine he looks like without a helmet?
---
Just had a Nightblade drop for my 50 Rogue. These don’t sell for anything exciting so I’m thinking about making an alt to give it to. 
---
What would be the best class to use it on? I was thinking either Hunter or Pally. Too fast for a Warrior right? 
---
Alliance side. 
---
The Mailman delivers.
---
Why does he need to be stopped and not just ignored? I don’t know much about the guy.
---
It’s better for overall progress to use loot council, but in the end follow your own preferences.
---
Personally, I am not gonna waste my time trusting other people will make good decisions, so I always play in DKP guilds.

[As you might have heard, Razer WoW gamer Swifty, along with numerous other players, were banned due to server disruption violations during one of Swifty's live streams that crashed a server. While Swifty acknowledged that he never intended to crash the server, Bashiok responded to the bans by stating that even if no one intended to crash servers or disrupt gameplay, the emote spamming and influx of players brought down many servers.](https://www.engadget.com/2011/07/19/blizzard-responds-to-swifty-ban-incident/?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAH5TvqBSQgCtEAywg2QlGCgbmXEATPmATd8MNB0Yvvuy_DXrqeaPnQ-EXhEXsGBSz71pUqB2r8tM8ENOz1rbTN_pMphLgIuKiL82EepuiivWuhPYtJwdZcwDaxM-MtLf3WWyLPL8SDIj5wMxrT4Fng8fW6TJ1dITtBZ_bB4m_obV)
---
 Is it worth just doing the raids and dungeons once for story's sake?
---
Or the much more likely option. Bad DPS make us not want to tank anymore.
---
Arms warrior
---
Uh, if you group with a mage and they refuse water you should demand it. There is no reason a mage should not give water out to their party members at the start of a dungeon.
---
Edit: I just want to clarify that I generally support the OP, but a Mage giving water isn’t the same thing.
---
but I poop from there vol chan
---
I got shot.
---
These response....... I rest my case .
---
Dude. Get help.
---
Dont heal them
---
She's amazing
---
Hate it when I have to ask multiple times for a mage to give me water or buff me with intellect, because in the end it just sounds like me being pushy.
---
Tanked every dungeon in the game without it so I'm doing it right. Which I guess means your wrong.
---
Show a screenshot of your bank statement so we can make sure you didn't resub this new month.
---
Ahh good point. Haven’t played since BC so this is all new to me again.
---
Please tell me you are alliance on Pagle. I need this positivity in my life rn.
---
You can literally see their level is yellow to him, but you can't even be level 61 in classic.
---
This exactly.   "You dont get any leather"  is some weird flex i dont get.   On my server,  i was able to farm 10 leather in a single night over a few hours with no competition at level 55..... then i go to ah and see them for 5g a pop.   I instantly bought the 14 more i needed and moved on.   Decided the gold wasnt worth the time i was spending farming myself,  let these "mafia" nerds farm it for me and save myself a ton of time.
---
He’s just making moves that make him money. It’s childish but I don’t think anyone would think he’s above being a child lol
---
2019 science to the rescue I guess! :) thanks for the input.
---
yea mages actually have the ability to tank better than most would expect. I've seen 3 mages tank mobs by timing their threat with each others shields. Was pretty damn impressive. One wrong move and it's wipe city though
---
what is the human racial?
---
Horde kromkrosh sorry :(
---
Healer definitely has the lowest ratio of percentage of players who play the role to players who are needed, for raids. Tanks are the lowest for 5-mans, because unlike raids the tank makes up 20% of the group.
---
Moar like screams at a blizzard.
---
Am I the only one that has never checked the prices of a flight path?
---
Yeah, that's why my flair says druid. Because I play hunter :)

---
You must be fun at parties.
---
You're right. You don't need to spec resto. Just join a group that kills Rag in 1:30 4head.
---
If you actually look at those logs you'd see they're totally irrelevant to the sort of person that asks what the difference is between all the healing classes.
---
Yes, and we're all going to laugh at you.
---
I had an argument with a hunter over Hand of Justice, because he wanted the +20 AP.
---
Not a single person got banned for the layer exploit.  Sure this guy is being a bit dramatic, but mistakes were made.  Big mistakes.  
---
Your post sounds like Blizzard PR.
---
They are 2 different things.  The pve push for a cleave meta is new.  Pretending it's always been the meta since TBC is nonsense.
---
That's what I'm saying.  God damn.
---
Use an add-on that loots much quicker. There are specific add-ons for this, and leatrix plus has it as well. The default looting speed is not fast enough usually.
---
I gave myself prio on ashkandi and ashjre'thul as hunter CL on a private server. 
---
It is open to abuse, but those who manage to get into the council are usually important / top performing people.
---
In my opinion...
---
Loot Council shouldn't be used unless you require raiders to be of certain age, bring pots and world buffs for raids. The system gets easily toxic and won't work with childish and selfish people. 
---
Putting the guild ahead of your own gear progression is crucial when using LC. 
---
As an example: Hunter tier sets gain most of their value from having a complete set (8/8). Therefore the most logcal and streamlined way to improve raid dps would be to funnel 1 hunter with prio on pieces from the set he's missing and give hunter nr.2 the pieces hunter nr.1 doesn't need. Hunter nr.3 would then be given off-pieces as a consolation price while also given prio on the first leaf + sinew.
---
Wrong. It’s a war between Asmon and reddit.

To be fair, a speedo isn't generally seen as attractive on a male. Wider shoulders and stuff are hence the reason shoulders are **much** larger on male characters.

Is there a cap to how much rested xp you can store up? I'm playing with a friend and due to our real world responsibilities we sometimes go more than 3+ days without even logging in. 
---
I always log off in Thunder Bluff (best city btw) just to make sure I'm getting that sweet bonus xp.
---
In case it's relevant, I'm lv 30 and he's lv 28.
---
Yeah I'm a priest and the mana cost is fucking atrocious. Gets better at 48 with the codex though
---
Lots of people were banned for layerhopping inside dungeons mate.
---
and if I was a blizzard PR I wouldn't tell you go to fuck yourself
---
Well for the mace its understandable at least, axe is dumb though
---
Sounds like you made the right decision.  Best of luck in the future!
---
What is wrong with it?
---
Yeah if we could get classic on the switch that would be grrrrrrreat. I'd even settle for a streaming service. I think they have PSO 2 streaming in the Japanese switch.
---
being crit due to sitting doesnt proc enrage/reckoning/whatever
---
Not at all! If you did that when people are farming bis then yes you should specify you’ll be rolling on dps gear. Leveling dungeons is fair game, everyone should expect we are leveling as a dps spec even if your healing
---
I’m used to arms. I’ll have to look up 2h fury
---
Nope 😆. It’s actually: 30%. 5 base plus the 25 racial. Ya broken af. It’ll become very clear that alliance rogues will prefer to open on nonorc players.
---
Psyche yourself up. Keep trying on 60 gear in atlas loot and watching 60 pvp videos. Do whatever it takes. Leveling is still painful for me but it’s like getting hit by a car with that adrenaline rush you don’t feel it when you’re hype about your goals lol
---
Honestly, it's so infuriating.
---
Questing peacefully, /waving at the horde, chilling out, and then some sixty alliance prick shows up and starts killing the level 40's, and then in ten minutes the zone is worthless because I can't walk three feet without getting ganked again.

I feel your pain, it was age 14-19 for me so I missed out on a lot as well. I got married at 21 &amp; pretty much abandon gaming entirely as my new home only had access to satellite internet. Part of me has a deep desire to build a new PC to jump back into vanilla but I pay all the bills &amp; have 2 children so I know there is no way I could manage that. I don't have any useful advice for you but you're not alone (if that helps any)
---
Also doesnt work
---
Not in the Twitch mod manager though.
---
His name is a reference to former NBA player Karl Malone, as was the WoW NPC, I believe.
---
Ok.  Do warlocks get that around 40?  I haven't encountered it much up until now.
---
You could buy 1 Edgemasters Handguards. And have enough left over for a flightpath to Ironforge.

I stopped reading when you charged in, thunderclapped, and are complaining about threat.
---
1) I think that with every decision like this, there are always unforeseeable results affected by human behavior which are difficult to predict.   
---
2) I have zero faith that anyone at Blizz is actually sitting down and trying to formulate scenarios of how this human behavior will play out.  
---
Result: proceed with caution when trying to implement changes.
---
Boo fucking hoo! I’m not trying to be rude but there comes a point where you just avoid these types of people, ignore them, and stop spamming this subreddit with this stuff. Hope you find better group mates but the amount of complaining here is insane lately.
---
Hahahah no you don't.
---
Lol I’m on a flight ✈️ with 9k ms checking my auctions haha
---
Priest is your only choice. Druids, Shamans, and Paladins all want something besides int for damage.
---
But building two sets doesn’t really take extra time while leveling it just happens automatically if you pay attention to what you de or vendor.
---
Depends what level you are talking, but most healers can heal in their dps set AND dps spec up to like 40
---
I don't think he went on herod specifically for money... If he really wanted some extra money he'd get a sponsor of some sort. Him gaining 5k extra viewers for an hour or two isn't going to matter to him in the grand scheme of things.
---
What post did I delete? I know you don't have many brain cells left from smoking so much pot but damn. You sound mad, you mad bro?
---
Oh good. Another Horde to kill :)
---
You’ll need to create distance with the likes of Wing Clip, Intimidation/Scatter Shot, and Freezing Trap. Then you should be able to carefully Concussive Shot and Aspect of the Cheetah to escape.
---
It's a different kind of game. Retail has obvious reward structures for basically every possible activity. The world feels like it was designed to be inhabited by you, the player character, and people like you. Bosses exist to give you loot, daily quests exist to gate your progress to rewards, etc. Everything you do is contributing to some enumerated goal.
---
Classic feels more like a world not designed to be played in, that your character just happens to be there. Your character has some glaring weaknesses that will probably frustrate you a lot. The world is unfriendly, and any reward you take from it has to be wrested from its unyielding grip. You can play for hours in the most productive manner possible and gain nothing from it, or get lucky and get something big. But ultimately, you kind of have to make your own fun in a lot of ways.
---
Which is better? It's a matter of opinion. Someone who prefers Classic might say that Classic feels like a more natural world, that Retail is a more "gamey" experience and the Skinner box elements of it are too obvious and make it unenjoyable. Someone who prefers Retail might say there's a lot more content for a wider variety of playstyles, that if you don't have a schedule open enough to raid regularly or flexible enough to set aside several hours to run dungeons, you don't have a lot to do in the endgame.
---
I understand and agree with your point about mages being resented because of aoeing in dungeons and wiping people, but to quest or farm mobs? That is basically getting mad at other players for utilizing their abilities to gain an advantage over others competing for mobs.
---
“That’s no moon”
---
&gt; Tactical Mastery is a better tanking talent during leveling than ANYTHING in the prot tree.
---
you should write the blizzard loading screen tips...
---
So if that Roy dude is still in the guild none of what you said matters. He’s enabling ninja looters. Roy also sold that item on the AH and used the gold to buy his epic mount. Stop supporting hypocrites.
---
Or Morgraine
---
Edgemaster's are considered best in slot untill naxxramas if I'm not mistaken.
---
Weapon skill is a very tricky thing, I highly advice that you google it.
---
It helps to know there are people experiencing the same or similar situations. I get that itch, I’ve had it a while, I don’t think it’ll ever really go away,   If you know you have an addictive personality I wouldn’t touch classic. I’m just happy I stopped now and not in a few months time.
---
&gt;Any mage that doesn't automatically pass out at least 3 stacks of water per mana bar in a group immediately upon entering the instance without being asked is awful at their class imo
---
I'm not going to go so far as to say that, but mages certainly should expect to be asked to do so.
---
It just gets so expensive to buy water constantly, especially when trying to save for things like a mount. Click a button a few times and you've saved me 2-3 gold, that's pretty significant.
---
Autohotkey is waaaaay better at this:
---
1. Download autohotkey
---
2. Google script for "always on top"
---
3. Copy and paste script into new autohotkey script
---
4. Run script
---
Then with a combination of ctrl+space (or any other hotkey you choose) you can make any window like a web browser run on top of your game or anything else for that matter.
---
I always have a YouTube or Hulu video playing on top of my game when I'm farming. Or a calculator while checking prices on the AH. Or just a wowhead guide to whatever you're doing at the time.
---
There are also some great scripts to disable your windows key, or disable the combination of alt+tab so it doesn't mess you up in game.
---
Looking for two kinds of questing resources, do these exist?
---
1. A list of all the 'This item starts a quest' items for each zone?
---
2. A list of 'grab all these quests from outside a zone before heading to that zone' quests?
---
Just fall over and play dead...
---
The Sly Marbo approach never fails

I'm a level 60 feral druid, and I've probably tanked around 80% of my dungeons up to this point. Honestly, last few days I've just gotten to the point where I'll no longer sign up to groups as anything other than pure DPS. Tanking is fucking exhausting, as the quality of groups you get varies so wildly. Sometimes you get really good groups which know how to manage their threat, ensuring a smooth and quick run, but most of the times it is usually "average" groups where you're just flat out fighting to keep up. Occasionally you will even get groups which are a complete and utter disaster with people all focusing different targets (even ignoring marks), and with myself having to run around with zero rage trying to pull mobs off of everybody. Those ones aren't fun, but they are still more frequent than smooth runs. Playing a tank feels like a PvP experience where you're fighting against your own team instead of corporating with them.
---
I'd rather spend 30 minutes AFK in Stormwind searching for a group as a DPS than decide to instantly join any one of hundreds of groups looking for a tank to go. The tank shortage exists because no one wants to play tanks, and no one wants to play tanks because tanking is very rarely an enjoyable experience.
---
**Paladin:** has to level with only auto attacks
---
**Warrior:** levels with 99% auto attacks and no self heals.
---
For someone preaching maturity you're not doing a very good job of demonstrating it. Have fun in your mother's basement for the rest of your single lonely little life.
---
i rp'd as a ticket taker on the zepplin to and from tirisfal glades today. charged 50s each way. made almost 10 gold inside of 2 hours. was a lot of fun. 10/10 would recommend you find your own hustle and leave mine alone ;)
---
I unsubbed last week for similar reasons. All the bad habits that took me over a decade to get rid off came back within a week of playing the game. I love it, too much for my own good apparently.
---
Hunters have such a huge amount of utility. I always get owned by them. Aspect of the Cheetah is OP.
---
fishing lvls?
---
Wow look at that, more steps already covered by everyone else!
---
I went there yesterday as a lvl 45 warr with ww axe equipped and a 60 rogue asked how many charms i needed and i said 60. He traded me 60 charms and i said thanks and kept farming looool
---
Codex???
---
/u/zuhaar
---
I was with a mage last night that was like this.   I opened trade for water and he sits looking at trade for 2minutes, i then whisper him and say "water please"... he puts in one stack and ends trade.   
---
Of course 20 min later i open another trade and he delays again and gives one more stack..... like wtf dude?   These mages acting like conjuring water cost reagents or some shit!
---
Yeah, seeing as most of my pre-raid BIS is leather or mail and about the only thing I'd be rolling against a tank for is the belt off Drakk...
---
Haha exactly like my bear pet
---
Double negative? One proofread by someone could have saved your comic.
---
Basically I get the regular action bar layout without the gryphons + I can't move or lose those actions bars..
---
I do already lol. And yes they do. There's a reason why the necklace from Scholo with 20 shadow damage ranks higher than the 1% hit necklace from Strath. It's more damage overall.
---
Yes, 10 days logged out in an inn or capital city gives you the rested exp cap.
---
Says who?
---
Have always played warlock, wanted something a bit more challenging. 
---
Warrior sees to be it. I am way low-level, as in just tanked RFC for the first time. It was... not pretty. Didn't wipe or anything, but I probably only got 60 to 70% of total damage received. 
---
Biggest struggle was pulls of three or more. I'd do demoralizing shout, wait an agonizingly long time to get enough rage to sunder, and do what i could. One pull would always run to DPS&lt; and I'd run to taunt. Good guides on managing multiples? Might just go back to lock-  sitting in the back and lazily dotting everything.
---
I can't stand it, you have no awareness of what's around you like that as shown in this video, if you were zoomed out you'd see someone as they came into the 30y or so range of you, giving you much more time to react to ganks and whatnot. If you prefer it though there's no reason to say otherwise, you need to enjoy how you play too!
---
That's very helpful thanks I'll go play WoW in a cinema
---
MOAR DOTS is basically playing on a loop in my head 24/7
---
On a tank no less
---
It's nice to think that, but the way the game actually works is you can roll need on something if you want to if you're using that loot method.  If you want to enforce what you've typed out, then you use master looter and use player enforcement rather than the game's rule.
---
Suppose I'll have to try it tomorrow!
---
Well, I am not concerned whether it is BiS or not. :)
---
I forgot I couldn’t inspect opposite faction. Click... death.
---
Well... the filter was set up based on English and I can't think of any commonly word that would contain "niger" in it. Other languages just got hit with splash damage.
---
I was at work and couldn't get one. I really wanted that statue!
---
Its 1,5 or 2 levels maximum. But it takes like 10 days to get that amount, so dont worry about it.
---
roommates
---
I'm at my brother and his fiancee's baby shower kinda bummed out cuz I really wanted to work on my blacksmithing today oh well family and all that good shit.
---
Some people don't need them as much. I have friends who still need their LBRS gems, but they always group with me who has the UBRS Seal so they'd be more than happy to join a group of LBRS that has gems reserved. It doesn't really matter to them.
---
&gt;#NOCHANGE
---
Fuck applying no changes to Classic. There are many things that *do* need changing. This is one of them.
---
ok
---
As somebody who mains a mage but who also after years and years of tanking and healing takes my job seriously, I wish I could flag myself as not one of them.  #notallmages
---
Worth a shot though.
---
Thank you. =)
---
Retail mentality 101 on display.
---
You're correct that it's a hair too slow to be a great arms weapon, but I think it's a nice Pally weapon. Plus, having an epic to look forward to will make the grind along the way feel faster than it might've otherwise!
---
I found a mage guys
---
So BoE epics in a raid environment should be up for grabs? GTFO With that BS .
---
I’m in red ridge and have the same problem with a different quest.
---
Reset didn’t work nor did re installing aap
---
Dogs mainly
---
It’s ridiculous. Life tap is to prolong your resources when u run out in a single fight, or solo with life drain, not to steal money from the healer and thinking we’re mates.
---
Haha I need to watch that again it's been years
---
Here I am at lvl 42 with 18 gold.
---
You will need the rep to get mounts.
---
This is remarkably accurate and reminds me why Classic is such a masochistic delight.
---
Honestly at lvl 60 it's great, you come online and just do whatever dungeon you like, but on weekends you need a DND tag.
---
It’s funny how quickly you feel yourself slip back into that role, doesn’t matter how long it’s been.
---
It's a few extra twitch prime members. Part of the reason is he needs to keep the content fresh. Going on a new server as a level 1 and everyone else being able to log on and do the same thing is a cool experience for some people.
---
Doesnt do anything for a Hunter. Go for a pally or warrior
---
Sounds like you are speaking from experience.
---
Orbs reserved.
---
Did you end up resubbing?
---
Egh, rolling for DPS stuff as a tank is pretty scummy though. I don't think your Hunters/Rogues/Warriors are gonna appreciate the tank stealing their Mask of the Unforgiven.

That's also a good location, but I think horde successfully stopped alliance getting there today. ;)

Players who do this all the time basically control the market on a pretty widely used set of armor. Since they control the market they don’t undercut each other no matter what the supply is.
---
I am a priest.

back in the day i used wowvid i think. VLC in a resizeable window in the game itself.

---
yeah many people saw same opportunity before and posted it. but it still puts smile on my face.
---
Humans do this but much smaller, just do some bending and spreading near a mirror next time you feel a fart
---
Mind vision have range and requires LoS in Classic.
---
Imagine bitching about people bitching.
---
More like moaning and crying into a camera to make us all miserable for clicking it
---
I think it's worth it for the experience of partys in dungeons. If your interested in lore check out the books in scarlet monastery library wing.
---
Personally I go fury until 30 then respec arms, there's really not much in arms before then to make it worth it (plus no need for tac mastery until you get zerker stance)
---
people are dumb
---
If you see quest missing go to classic Wowhead and search the number, it'll bring up the quest and you can go get it. Other than that /aap skip and /aap reset are your friends. Skipping enough times will eventually get to something workable.
---
Alright, im a mage. I hand out free food and water to anyone and everyone who asks for it and ill port you at the cost of the reagent. I cant stand mages that act like a temper tantrum two year old when people ask because it makes the rest of us look bad. All I ask from the rest of you guys is dont judge the mage, until he actually does something worth judging, because there are still a lot of us out there that know whats up :)

I certainly hope you arent the MT for your guild
---
Bad Mojo Mask on a mage?
---
Jesus they should do studies on people who pick mage.
---
While it doesnt work like a priest MC it is indeed bugged with the pet bar atm. There is an addon that let's you see the pet bar that someone made.
---
Your choice, good for you.
---
You need more self control if youd like to play and not fall into the abyss again. 
---
Good luck.
---
I just put the person on ignore and never see them whisper me ever again to join my group. ez
---
Boo fucking hoo!
---
Think you misspelt hunters
---
Best for who? It doesn't increase the amount of items guild gets from raid (unless you are unable to clear whole raid because gear is not distributed optimally which isn't a case in MC or ONY) so it's not better in that sense. Sure loot council is awesome if you are highly respected player in your guild or good friend with officers, if not some kind of DKP variation would be better for you.
---
For #1, you can [check wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/items?filter=6;1;0), click the header of the "source" column to  sort em all by what zone they drop in.
