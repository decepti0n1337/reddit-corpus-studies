hax :) The top one is the 'left' text, the lower one is the 'right' text ... then you set their anchors to be 'inside center left' and 'inside top left' and apply a little x/y offset to line them up.

LOL
---
Elemental?  At least magma and fire nova totem, earthbind, lightning bolt, chain lightning, flame shock, 2 ranks of earth shock, frost shock, purge, lesser healing wave minimum
---
That was amazing.
---
There may be better options for all three of their roles but it's not like they are useless. Unless you are in a real min/max type guild you'll be fine and against the average pug group (or average casual type guild) if you learn how to play well and use consumes and the like you will be fine doing any role. Vanilla raids in general being 40 mans too means even if you don't learn how to play but are just a nice person you'll still find spots in a lot of guilds.
---
DM E is the best you can do (by far) if you have all professions needed (herb/enchanting/mining)
---
I was a druid in vanilla and loved It. Got to raid as resto and got all my gear before anyone else. Then went feral resto for pvp and can pretty much kill anyone one v one.
---
You don't need a macro to cancel IB. Just hit the button it's set to again and it'll automatically cancel.
---
Man that's crazy, i literally havent gotten a single one since launch, and i play a fair amount on a high pop server (EU-Mograine)
---
Just curious, but why would you want to do this?
---
3 things... 1) they are very good at being annoying in pvp , most pvp premades will have a druid or druids.  They are PITAs to deal with.  2) They are not *that* un-optimal.  Some steamers said they were and off to the races people went.  3)  Druid gear drops and no druids (most pugs on my server want druids)...tie that in with #2.
---
Or just high af

Yeah I’ll take that to heart, guy who’s end game is Dire Maul.

I'll take 2 of whatever this guy had, please.

Their fault for not tagging it before starting the tame, and for not getting the tame on their first try.

Just go for it.

You’re an idiot.

Nice! ... I also have bars on the right like that ... they're just set to hide until mouse-over.

---
Retail makes most (way more too) money by microtransactions. Each toy/mount gives them like 3m+ sales on average
---
So if you are seeing tanks reserve the first orb... generally the etiquette is that you need roll it, everyone else passes or maybe greed rolls it.
---
Then you pass on further orbs. Anyone that wins a subsequent orb will pass on orbs later on that drops.
---
So basically you are guaranteed an orb drop which 'pays' for your tanking. 
---
At least that's the etiquette on my server... no need to master loot, people will behave, if they don't they'll get ostracized for sure.
---
Saw an undead female that reminded me of my ex... Cold, emotionless,  dead inside and out
---
Omg thank you
---
I moved my raid frames to the bottom left of my screen to remove screen clutter in 40mans and every time im raiding i have to move the chat up manually. Its nothing too big but making this automated would be neat
---
That's a dumb argument.
---
it insane.  theres no internal cooldown.  I've had 200 stats + crusader + 25% haste all active at once on more than one occasion.
---
To each their own. I wanted to start playing my raid spec to get used to the rotation and to avoid the cost of the respec later on and found no difficulty tanking as fury/arms.
---
Nothing bad about it.  People play differently.
---
If you're not comfortable with 9+ keybinds, you don't have to use them, but objectively, you're handicapping yourself.
---
I tell new players just force yourself to do it and it will become easier than clicking before you know it.
---
That undead mage was awful.
---

---
You take one to raids so he can buff everyone. Druids are decent as Offtanks, but pretty bad Healers or DPS.
---
I'm a Fury/Prot Warrior and my friend is a Resto Shaman, we smoke DM E drop runs, and it's insane gold and super easy. We're mostly raid geared, it might be a little tight duoing it at your gear level but it should be doable. You have the right comp for it, if you have the professions to match it's by far your best option.

You are a angry sad person my friend, dont get yourself a heart attack

eh there's nothing comfortable with the void walker(which is a damn shame). Even with improved void talent I have to let the pet get at least 2 torments off before i dot up the mob, and even then the mob will peel off around 40% hp
---
There should only be Mages, Warriors, and Priests in dungeons and raids. /s

i'm mathing this out as i raid mc :-D.  it'l be interesting to have some numbers to confirm or deny this

Druids can do everything, just not as well as other classes. That being said, a good bear has better threat generation than a warrior and more sustainable threat than a paladin. With innervate, brez, quick hots, and solid buffs, it's good to have them in anything you're doing.

No kidding??? 3% that’s absolutely nuts then!

Well done. Loved that bit at the end where you are spamming the blink bottom as it cools Down
---
Ohhh ok. I just thought they were the same. In the manner everything is bought with in game gold and that there was an option to buy gold with irl money
---
Considering you can get another leatherworker to make anything you want to wear, yes.
---
There's a reason (well many reasons) 40 man raiding only lasted until TBC. And the majority of people at the time certanly didn't mind the change to 25. In that big a raid there's always gonna be cliques forming. Add in a loot council system and drama is all but guaranteed.  Guilds are fine with getting people now cause the game is still in the shiny new stage and MC is faceroll. By the time Naxx rolls around its gonna end up like vanilla where very few guilds will be still be raiding.
---
&gt; I'm just the guy tossing strength/windfury totems for ya'll and having fun crushing my mace in someone's face :(
---
I just started healing on my shaman.  I respec'd to elemental at 40.  But this is basically my healing experience so far in 5 mans.  Drop strength and windfury, smash my staff into a mob's face, sometimes stop to toss out a heal.  I feel like I came full circle.

I was able to no-life this game when I was a janky kid in highschool. At this point in my life, I don't want to block off a four hour period to play videogames. If I want to stop playing, I'm going to stop playing. I don't want 39 people getting upset when I want to leave raid because I'm not having a good time anymore. 
---
I hit 60, did some BIS gearing then cancelled my subscription. I've never found the raid experience to be appealing and at this point there isn't much else for me to work towards.
---
Been awhile but try /hb
---
i dont know, its kinda of the beauty of having a hybrid spec
---
big rip needed more patience was losing it after a couple hours lol

Why are you ignoring the second thread ?

Well that's part of the reason he couldn't afford the projects and now they're bankrupt, they clearly have no idea how to budget.

It’s not that retail is completely worthless, but the inflation rate on gold is much, much higher. 3 gold on classic will net me about the same as 10k on retail.

You can spend X amount of money to buy a token and sell it for gold. The buyer of the token can redeem it for game time or X/4 Blizzard balance

Probably BRD arena runs
---
Short answer: depends on your server economy
---
Learning from Dire Maul, all the obvious stuff actually won't increase when phase 2 releases, because everyone knows about it and will be sitting on enormous stockpiles that they'll be looking to unload. On my server, everything which was 'supposed' to go up when DM came out actually went down on patch day. 
---
From that experience the time to sell would be the period between the phase 2 announcement and the actual phase 2 release, when speculation is driving up prices and people are trying to build stockpiles under the bad assumption prices will continue to rise at release.
---
Yeah- it's always the way we exited. Back down the tower and off the wall.
---

---
What more is there to say?
---
90% of the tanks I’ve grouped with have been fury/arms wars that are just tanking to find a group to get their pre raid bis. Prot just isn’t necessary if you halfway know what you’re doing as a tank (except 40 man). If the guy wants to be fury long term, no point in adding an unnecessary respec.
---
Dude... That was nice! big props!
---
1st 2nd and 3rd which sucks because you cant even loot it after the first.
---
Are you using a Hard Drive or Solid State?
---
Protip for anyone struggling finding a spot.  Get DMT and Songflower before raid invites, log, then when raid invites start going out whisper your officer you have world buffs and want to go.
---
Well? Why don't you?
---
My guild has an enhance shaman in our raid team and does pretty well. Anyone trying to force you into one roll like vanilla sucks
---
try your guild and server discords.
---
Actually tried doing it once and realized i threw my key away thinking I don't need it being rogue and all &gt;.&gt; I heard coffers are really rng so could be something exciting to add to this boring grind. If you do it let me know how it goes!
---
Priest.
---
Open world: wand spec talent makes most of your damage come from sanding and a DOT (shadow word pain). Power word shield and inner fire make it easy to take little to no damage fighting a mob 1v1. At level 41 you can spec into shadowform and MELT anything.
---
5 man: the best healer in the game or a serviceable dps. No matter what talents you pick priest is capable of healing 5 man content better than any other class. Generally you will use at most 5 different spells (heal, greater heal, Power word shield, renew, fade) with only heal and renew being used 90%of the time. For DPS a shadow priest isn’t great but it’s an option, only single target and die to mana and threat issues wand and shadow word pain will be most of the damage. (Healing is a great way to improve because you stand back and watch other people make mistakes and can see exactly what they did wrong compared to everyone else)
---
RAIDS: super overwhelming. BUT, horde side priests are in high demand and it will be easy to get a raid spot. No one is going to yell at an underperforming priest if they are actually trying they will likely just assign them a specific job (focus on dispelling, keep renew on tanks and locks). Spriest are useful in raids but mostly as an off healer who buffs the warlocks. Not a simple raid class but it can be simple if the RL is proactive and accommodating.
---
TLDR: priests are good and simple in the open world, great and simple in dungeons, and overwhelming in Raids but an easy raid spot.
---
If you say so :)
---
I ran it once when Mara was at level.. after I hit 60 and got some gear figured I’d go back to get the ring finally. Got all assed up with some guildies to farm... dropped first run at 60.. so two runs total =)
---
Edit:typo
---
Its probably the most useless thing people say. classes have 1 good spell for a reason.
---
So I did originally participate in the HWL grind in OG and got to rank 11.  Factually speaking if you want to be as competitive as possible and get ranked then Hillsbrad is the place.  It has the closest spawn graveyards, the most people, and is easily accessible to the highest population.  The trick to farming honor is time investment, and kill involvement.  Healers get Honor for killing targets that are involved with x amount of players in pvp.  While many people think raid grouping is the best, and it is okay, actually having small groups picking off high level targets is the best.  Having a 5 man group who is killing a decent amount and doing a lot of damage is often better than being in a 40 man raid.  
---
I did participate in 40 man raids in TM vs SS all the way to rank 8 before I went with smaller groups.  In a raid group you will get something like 5-15 Honor per kill, and solo you can get upwards to 200-500 for low ranks and Rank 14s for a pure solo kill give about 850, with diminishing returns.  I would not worry about dishonorable kills, they are few and far between and generally your raid will never push that far into the town to get them.
---
Not bad at all little one. :)
---
Agi, int, Stam, SPI.. STR is completely useless. Leveling you will be most likely be BM and your pet will be doing most of the DMG. 
---
I'm leveling one now, I open with concussive shot and send my pet in (macro together), this keeps them offa me longer and gives time for the pet to build aggro. Keep up your poison and toss in an arcane shot occasionally... Then just autoshot.
---
I mean it kinda depends on what Server you are playing on. On gehennas basically everything you Farm in the open world ist insanley expensive essence of water is 30g essence of air 25g elemental fire 6g earth 2,5g and so on. Just check your auctionhouse and see whats happening
---
Rude.

Says the guy who's probably making 30k usd/y and watching TV when he comes home LMAO

now ill level them 2 levels each at a time untill 60 yes!

Oh yeah big time

Yup, just as I expected, "u mayad bro" lame ass comebacks when you get called out. Pretty typical for kiddies that cant back up BS.
---
Sold mine to a guildie for 100g karma has been nice gotten three flask recipes robes of winter night recipe and robes of the void as well
---
But that still warrants leaving 3 other members stranded when they didnt do anything wrong? Pretty shitty to punish an entire group of bystanders when 1 guy was being an asshole. Coulda just dealt with him and moved on. Again, hard to gauge the situation. Anyways cheers
---
You might feel that way because you remember details from that time, its just not something I’ve thought about for almost half of my life.  I don’t remember my best arena rank in tbc, my highest kill streak in modern warfare 2, or my highest completed legendary mission in halo 2.  It very well could have been r11.
---

Sadly we are really stuck with using the discord. Which I highly detest. I wish the forums like elitistjerks were still around, so were stuck with the discord. While the information on discord isnt *bad*, its just not as good as those forums were you know? But you get accurate information and its *miles* better than following the shitty icy veins guide. Using icy veins is like that meme "an attempt was made".
---
we're all altoholics.
---
This is why I will never understand the choice to join a loot council guild.
---
Obviously loot priority is helpful to an extent, but beyond gearing up tanks and few other reasonably niche cases (hunter tranq shot for example) it really only serves as a countdown to guild drama.  Having a dice roll, or dkp or whatever is a very useful scapegoat to avoid these kinds of situations that doesn't end up with someone getting blamed for being bias.
---
Knew what was coming the moment I saw burning steppes. Someone needs to park him by BRM entrance.
---
This happened to me in BRD and the cape was still on the boss and I just went and looted it. It was pretty strange as my bags were not full.
---
Why do some people feel the need to rant their way out of something as trivial as a game?  Just fucking leave already.  No need to whine at anyone about it, because nobody gives a shit that you're butthurt.
---
Ha! I know right?? I was like “there is no way I should be alive right now get the me hell out of here”.
---
Pretty sure that is gonna be best dungeon you can do for XP/hr right now. I’m not 100% positive tho
---
I'm priest and wondering if I'll feel the same but I planned to do an alt anyways just can't decide to do tank or rogue or lock or druid. I want a night elf though that's certain.
---
Level as ret. You can heal or dps just fine as ret. Once you reach around lvl 33-35 you can switch to a prot/holy build and do well. Protection paladins need consecration (11 points into holy) in order to tank well.
---
It would be better if you go ret until your late 50s though. Ret just makes things so much easier when leveling and you won't notice the difference in roles until the 50s anyways. Just get healing or tanking gear to wear when fulfilling those roles.
---
ARCANE EXPLOSION, I SEEN THE STEAMERS DO IT
---
No
---
That face.
---
I've heard that Affliction is the consensus for leveling, but I personally tend towards Destruction. What are the main strengths of each one?
---
I'd say agi &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; spirit &gt; int anything else. 
---
Depends on playstyle, if you know what you are doing and have a good mainhand you can use autos as well, and in that case agi&gt;str&gt;&gt;spirit&gt;int. I think spirit is better than int, I don't really drink as a hunter and if I do I never drink to max anyway, so having a higher mana bar is only useful if you somehow regen to full mana, which shouldn't happen much if you grind mobs while moving and stuff.
---
about that yeah, swapped over from questing to mainly grinding mobs, i dont really like the 30-40 bracket really, and the quest guide i was following wanted me to head to STV so i said frick it grinding mobs while watching netflix it is!
---
I've seen bots that dont actually inject into the game but they like scan pixels. So all blizz can see is basically nothing. Looks like a player is doing all the inputs. Basically an AI is playing the game
---
I'm holding out for Del Boca Vista, PHASE THREE JERRY!!
---
And you are a guy prov9dong false information. Go back to your private servers mate.
---
I don't care if you're mad or not, I just don't have time for this juvenile whiny BS.
---
I killed a 60 warrior who popped recklessness when I was 54. And the warlocks in the tournament dueling tourney were running circles around the warriors.
---
You might be giddy because most warlocks are in some kind of raidspecc and don't have void out. But as long as they can press 1 - 2 - death coil - 3 you should be dead anyway.
---
If you were a mage since vanilla you should know that the crit was from shatter and more probable than not
---
Downvoted for asking a question? Bravo.
---
from the thread on WoWhead, one of the commentaries: 
---
&gt;RF has always been like that. It's why Prot Paladins can tank bosses like Ony with ease, because they can spam Blessing of Kings on themselves and hold threat without a problem. They can be a decent tank for any raid boss that doesn't hit too hard or have a taunt mechanic. They are also the best dungeon tank in the game as well, but that's old news.
---
any thoughts on this? Does Blessing of Kings create threat? Blessing of Might didn't for my low level paladin.
---
SHOW DBM PULL COUNTER FOR PROOF!!!
---
Focus will be added in a future phase, it didn't exist in 1.12
---
I quit once they nerfed the dungeons in early cata. Those were some of my favorite dungeon experiences and was pretty sad they nerfed it so heavily. To stay on topic a little, tanking in general is just not fun and I don’t like to force myself to do something I really don’t enjoy at all. I’ll heal all day, but people just want you to tank as Druid in dungeons most the time.
---
22 runs seen it drop 11 times iv lost it 11 times
---
Never question the reddit vote masters
---
Uncheck the 'other' box under chat channel settings.
---
You seem mad, maybe its time for a break?
---
FYI for others: If you're a hunter looking for a ring, you're wasting your time in mara now that DM is out. Solo DM:N trib runs for the elven ring are significantly easier than Princess and you can equip two of them
---
Probably herb/alch. Healing pots and buffs help a lot while leveling and it will make money with pots and transmutes later.
---
Otherwise any gathering Prof is gonna be money so you could double up

I thought the fireguard shoulders were better or something.  More armor?  They're not an MC drop...?
---
I played a prot warrior in retail and enjoyed the experience, though things are pretty autopilot when it comes to running mythics. I thought it'd be neat to see where the role came from. Only level 10 right now, but it should be a fun journey. 
---
I've never been really into RP either - I mean I DM a D&amp;D game but roleplay with strangers is pretty new. If anything I'm more content to be a silent observer.
---
If you're an alt there isn't much that will help your leveling speed that your main can't just send to it more efficiently. If you want some gold as a by-product maybe do mining / skinning? At this point skinning for vendoring gold might actually lower your leveling speed too much though. Not sure if you plan on PvPing but the mining could translate to engineering later, if you store some of the mats.
---
Death Coil into dot into fear. Ezpz

Well to be fair warriors need about 20 levels advantage to beat a mage 2v1.

‘I AM A LYRICAL GENIUS!’  No Kanye. You are a gay fish.

Lol guy warlocks are the easiest class for a warrior to defeat. I’ve been playing this game for 15 years. 
---
It’s Rock Paper Scissors. Warrior is paper, Warlock is rock.
---
End of story.
---
[deleted]
---
Druids, hunters, and warlocks are considered the best levelers and you can kind of make a game out of how fast you can handle things. Mage is fast too but aoe farming is tricky and kind of specific.
---
I don’t disagree by any means, warlocks smell.... But yes this is likely pug goon competition behavior. Though still very odd as the whole intent is to down bosses to get lewts and if this one war went all out on world buffs just to get fucked by a meme lord, it’s just dumb lol
---
A taunt is a spell that grants the caster matched threat on the mob plus an additional XX%,I forget the proper value.
---
Righteous Fury grants everything you do additional threat.
---
None of the spells you were casting grant the taunt mechanic but all the spells you saw generate threat are now generating values increased by Righteous Fury.
---
Dude you rekt him. I bet he feels real silly.
---
Makes sense - retails players are busy playing the game, meanwhile Classic players sit on reddit while afking at their city and waiting for something intresting to happen ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Is there such a thing?
---
Classic doesn’t really have a Halloween event per day.. it’s just masks, Wands and a chance at a bag of your high enough level.
---
you've either never done mara or trib runs or you're trolling... dm runs are much much harder than princess runs
---
No I understand that, just pointing out your not gonna find one mentality. You will have the guy who tags you once, the guy who just waves, and the guy who can’t stop touching himself to your dead body (I know extreme, sorry). 
---
Would truly love to get the point of view of a guy similar to the one I posted about above, but something tells me I wouldn’t get it.
---
Ha ha. Ha ha ha ha. Ha...
---
😭
---
Oh, interesting.
---
You're summing up why I don't like having an Enhancement shaman - they tend to want to ignore their utility and just DPS.
---
The recent posts that are stories from NPCs have been hilarious.
---
unless you're alliance where a dwarf priest is above all
---
I’m popping out of bear anyway to pop back in and get instant rage to pull the next mob, and my mana regenerates while in bear form, so why wouldn’t I throw a hot on anyone who needs it?
---
I'm glad my guild is too busy shitposting to really care about all of this
---
Hoo boy i had a couple of guilds like that in retail though, and i was the shitter being benched. Still a bit salty.
---
Dead server
---
It's mostly because we don't use our mana and have nothing else to do between pulls, it saves mana to the actual healers if we do this, speeding up the whole dungeon
---
SSD, deleting Cache folder worked!
---
WORKED! Thank you.
---
I see, i'm kinda new to classic, i saw a lot of people posting images with masks and some kind of decorated places. I thought they were doing an event.
---
you're a true hero.  Thank you!!!
---
Ah, forgot about those, but it's pretty close if you discount fire res since the armor from ST shoulders is pretty nuts.
---
Threat =/= taunt. Which is what paladins need.
---
Human DPS is better but unless you are seriously min maxing it doesn't really matter. Gnome racial will be more noticeable in pvp. Human perception is good for rogue v rogue, but if that's the angle you take I personally like dwarf stone form more.
---
Compared to retail, it’s nothing really.
---
This. It looks like it could be a bot... or someone who's ripped out of their mind. Or a child playing on their parent's account.

I’m a rogue who has been grinding angerforge for a few weeks (currently at 135 kills) and I have seen the war strife leggings drop 8-10 times. I have seen the Hand of Justice drop twice and I lost both rolls. The HoJ supposedly has a 3.5-4% drop rate but I’m experiencing a 1.5% drop rate. The gold I have farmed while trying to get the HoJ I have used to buy a Warden Staff for my druid alt. This game is ridiculous
---
My Tremor Totem makes short work of Locks
---
Second Wind, Omnicast Boots, Ban'thok Sash, Cyclopean Band are all good and bis or close to it items for priests and shamans. Granted the last 3 are not for healing but for dpsing, but priests still need to farm.
---
Mages prolly like “why level wand I had blizzard”
---
&gt; When I was involved in a ring of sorts
---
Wow, what a garbage human being you are.
---
I'd add that Horde has easier access to the most popular endgame farming locations. Azshara, Winterspring, Plaguelands, Dire Maul, and Maraudon are all more easily accessible from Org or UC than from SW or IF.
---
It’s worth it to get SHotM is you ever feel like pvping I’d say. Very useful vs. melee
---
Its not instant. It reduces the next attack swing timer by 40% of its max for 1 attack. So in 40% of cases its instant, and 60% of cases its near instant.

Is that the Tauren cat face? That's hideous.
---
J has been character pane for me for a decade+.
---
No idea why I did it but I can’t go back now
---
ok so which abilities should i rank up and spend money on with my warrior trainer?
---
Oh, i'm not working. I'm at school atm (Homeschool, so i have plenty of time :D). My last month was a gift from my uncle. I will be asking support. Thanks for answering.
---
The demon: anyway I started blasting
---
I think a retribution paladin might be a good idea actually. It's certainly the most simple DPS spec in the game.
---
Just gonna level them all to 60, as i dont mind leveling and find it quiet relaxing esp when you can just logon when you feel like it.
---
Yea has one item for one class, and they could just work to get it while being around that similar level and doing the quests of that dungeon while getting good xp. this expectation that 60's should run you through when there are dozens of other things a 60 could be doing is asinine.
---
You can do it, it's pretty easy up till late 40s where gear mail tank gear kinda disappears and you end up having to wear Hunter gear.
---
At least get conc so you can tank dungeons it will make it much easier if you want to do those.
---
the rest of it is WF procs off hamstring?
---
He will have to wait untill im done leveling and maybe gearing the Glorious Alliance Charaters first :P
---
It’s really easy! Google “export Elvis” profile and you should get some simple guides! Thanks for being willing to share!
---
Shh that's a secret.  I also use it when I am at 5 combo points but not quite low enough to finish them off so I can work them with white dmg and get a stronger fb.
---
&gt;pre-nerf cata heroics
---
Probably some of my favourite times in wow tbh, even more than TBC heroics and Kara
---
Depends if ur 2h fury or not.
---
Wow that’s gonna take a long time
---
The decorations purely cosmetics. The masks have like 7 days duration so sadly nothing collective (I think?). The biggest use is free bags/candy which doesn’t expire I think and somewhat nice since it’s % based.
---
Never got a chance to experience an event on retail, only the one with the gnomes (Or was it another tiny race?) Selling beer and some other stuff. There used to be tables with food at goldshire. It was a while ago.
---
As an Enhancement shaman (with matching mana efficiency) who regularly gets roped into healing, I thank you with all my heart!
---
I have opposite problem.
---
Golden rule - you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. If you don't like the way the group is going, leave and find another one. It'll be much easier for you than it would a DPS. 
---
If you like the group, kick the DPS and find another one. Shouldn't be too hard.
---
I'm pretty sure my binds are terrible but work for me. I use 1-9 but also have them bound to the number pad, just started using Shift + 1-9 for extras. I also have like 4 Priest bubble binds all over the place so I can panic hit it not matter where my hands are.
---
So start a new Forum or guide
---
Grats! And...  u had that damn bird on you too !
---
And what can you get from those bags?
---
no one cares about your sub or your 46 gold. delete the game or dont. See? No one cares
---
Use it to buy people time perhaps :)
---
"well we did it this way so you're wrong!"
---
Okay. Have fun intentionally slowing yourself down.
---
You can do it for a while but corpse camping the same player at the same place will likely lead to either they giving up and playing an alt or reinforcements targeting you knowing you are at the graveyard. Might be fun but not sure of it's the most efficient.
---
That guy may have been a rogue but he has the spirit of a warrior.
---
Maybe do longer BRD runs, instead of just arena runs?
---
Oh then you just seduce them and kite. But theres not too many undead prot warriors with this specific trinkets roaming around ganking people
---
Sounds like brewfest to me, Halloween doesn’t have anything close to that in classic/vanilla anyways.
---
ran it once well every wing once on my priest when my friends wanted to do it and well it was alright, but oh man it was interesting only getting whispers on certain classes if i wanted to tank heal, or spellcleave :P
---
I hated those nerfs too; it wasn't even that the dungeons were hard, coming from TBC heroics they were about on par or easier. But they came immediately after Wrath introduced LFG during the 'every heroic is a faceroll' endgame stage and so people were completely thrown by the difficulty curve.
---
From a more dickish perspective - when I used to tank in retail, I chose to view tanking and healing as a service. You and the healer are offering a service to this DPS group. If they don't like it, they can find another tank or be replaced.
---
Go find someone who’s 40+ without a mount and make their day.
---
From 20-30 - I focused on buying Charms / Liferoot for Whirlwind Axe. Was roughly a 10g investment.
---
From 30-40 - I only bought very few skills. I think 2-3 tops. Whirlwind comes to mind. I also 2h tanked with Whirlwind Axe / Ravager.
---
Post 40 - you should have your mount. I personally had enough money to buy all my skills. I've been good ever since. A lot of people recommend only buying skills you use.
---
You have not said which realm or server you are on.
---
Buy bags and hand them out in your favorite starting zone. Maybe 1g per person as well
---
That's not just because of Classic though, it's also because the mods ran that sub into the ground.
---
This is the quickest and simplest way to do it. I used this option to avoid waiting for queue by remote logging in from my phone an hour before getting home.
---
Took me about 35, thankfully the hunter that was doing it for me was patient
---
nope
---
Go to STV, find an almost 40 and donate the gold to help them get a mount when they ding.
---
To clarify, I tried to message him. I followed him for about an hour collecting my rested xp, made sure I didn’t loot so he didn’t get any skins or xp.
---
Cat- 1 agi = 1ap. 1 str = 2ap+20% from talents
---
Bear- 1 str = 2ap. 1 agi = 0ap
---
20 agi = 1% crit
---
Not a paladin, or particularly learned on the mechanics of tanking, so take this with a grain of salt. 
---
Threat is basically t=x(damage+damage healed/mitigated) (where x is your multiplier from talents, effects etc) every time an action is performed in combat. So BoK will grant threat because it gives you stamina effectively healing you. Then spamming it on yourself will generate threat to everything around you. 
---
So again, no authority on the game by any means, but since BoM does not provide stamina, it shouldn't generate threat at all. Someone with more knowledge should correct me if im mistaken though.
---
wrong sorry
---
I have no idea why that nested under your comment.  It was not intended.
---
Paid a hunter think it took like 3-4 runs
---
Maining as a healer and can really appreciate ferals that pop out to throw a few renews during long fights
---
I remember that, I was a disc priest and I loved it for some reason. I usually don't like to be under such pressure, but it felt so good, like you are actually improving your skill, like you're getting really good at it.
---
Tips Fedora, m'lady.
---
belive it or not though, but i Seriously don't own a single headpiece IRL though.
---
Oh, well. At least i don't feel bad for missing something anymore.
---
Because I hate when people provide false info then get on a high horse about not providing proof. Anyone with a brain knows you are wrong and wont provide proof because proof does not exist. At least you are finally admitting your own failure.
---
Also not mad, just making sure everyone sees you for what you are.
---
Yeeted is the past participle of Yeet and still works in this case.
---
How is Trib run easier than Mara? On Mara you can use Sceptre to spam by Hydras and run straight to the Boss and even have time to do Tinker/Other Bosses so you don’t get instance capped too early. Idk if DMN is that easy?
---
Because he wants to play DPS druid, simple as that.
---
I got the flameguards, but haven't seen a single cloudkeeper for sale in the last four weeks. I've never seen someone wearing them either.
---
My pal (pally) got “ganked” outside wailing caverns, by a warlock 3 levels higher than himself whilst fishing. Still fucked him up with his fishing rod. Which reminds me that I have a lot of dueling to be done before thinking p 2 will be enjoyable for me at least.
---
Haha, seen 3 in one node before so.. anything's possible!
---
That demon did the same thing to me. Galloping along “oh, hello mister demon” dead...
---
Lmao what? You don't know me dude. If I havent personally verified something I want proof. Whole lot of assumptions you made there just to try and attack me personally again. Sad.
---
Also time has already told me that I am right. 15 years these boxes have existed and the only time they ever dropped epics was on trash private servers. So go back.

You don't have zero hit in Mc bis gear you get 1% from your Helm. You're not losing as much hit as you guys are thinking lol. Look at the logs on the top mages. Crit&gt;hit in short fights
---
Mage : more PvP utility, more competition, easier to pick up and feel good with (access to strong cooldowns). Relatively gear independent. More mobile. 
---
Warlock : easier leveling, fantastic 1v1 spec, more nuanced class (curse and pet management, fear is harder to use effectively over poly), scales incredibly well with gear but consequently struggles a bit early on (needs Stam otherwise warriors and rogues will fuck you up). Less competition.
---
Fair enough mate.
---
Yes. Or you can type /afk and it happens.
---
Don't feel bad. It's a worthless item. The only reason people buy it off the AH is to disenchant it. It's only worth like 5-8g.
---
I disagree. You just ledge hop by the ghosts over and over. Lots of room for error, where one boulder from the princess can kill your run.
---
Not to mention the time lost dying in mara vs dm
---
Honestly.. I dont even mind not getting World boss loot if the trade-off is amazing wpvp. Ive been waiting over a decade for wpvp to come back.
---
But youre right, that wont be everyones stance on it.
---
You suck
---
Some peoples don't have choice and have to pug. Like me i can only play during daytime and there is no guild raiding during this time on my server.
---
Still worth going to STV and finding the most camped/ganked person there and lifting their spirits a bit ;)
---
You do not need any stats really...otherwise just stick to agility. A hunter does not need to cast anything but mend pet and the dot. If you cast a lot, then prior would be agil and spirit.
---
Just have to be carefull when spamming your ice block key, as it can cancel early. I normally have /cancelaura ice block with my frost bolt macro
---
Oh nonono, retail is super bad, it is downright aweful. I'm just stating the sad fact how inferior stuff make more money because they are designed so and that the game industry is collapsing quality wise because of it.
---
Per the OP,
---
&gt; I am starting to get far behind my guildies gear wise.
---
So I assumed that wasn't the case for him.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Twinks are lower level chars that are kept at low level and equipped with best possible gear on low level and enchants .Not to be confused with gay term
---
Thanks :) I didn't know that they reset that's good to note! From what I saw the vendor from the two bosses can be between 3-8g each time and its a 16ish minute run when done clean. The Gold I saw from Pickpocketing alone was around 5g around
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
hmm with that math I guess it's actually really close in comparison and would be more consistent without dealing with the death...that will have to be someone else's video though. I got a hand of edward odd to drop in ubrs and won so I think I'm retired for now

My leather is only for the strongest and you are clearly the weakest

Ill actually reply to one of these, check out the thread and you'll find many people who live in the same area and saw the same thing. Can't even comprehend how people who are interested in fantasy don't believe there can be a colored sky irl.
---
They already have, and once they see the sub numbers down the road they will try to stick some micros like server transfers and such
---
Level 55 apparently aggro'd some mob near the entrance when jumping down, and the mob walked all the way around gathering everything on its path (it's a very long way from entrance to hydrospawn without jumping).
---
It's allowed since it doesn't technically break any rules.
---
I feel like buying a mount for someone at 40 would be something they would remember about their personal wow experience. It's a big deal, but I'd make sure its someone who has worked towards it and is saving for it, instead of someone who is like eh spend all my gold
---
You know classic is not exactly the same as vanilla right ?? Is so much things thats diffrent so why you compare everything like it was back in the Days? Hahaha why would i go back ? Makes no sense at all, you still Mad af and its very funny, go back to retail moron
---
Starting Classic sometime next week. In Vanilla, what is the best profession combo for selling on the AH/gold-making (going to be playing on Mankrik-Horde)? Is there any add-on that tracks multiple farming nodes if I decide to go Herbalism/Mining?
---
You can press your ice block hotkey again to remove ice block
---
Warrior fear immunity is only 10 seconds long on a 30 second cooldown.  After it's over (or before it starts) you can have your way with them.
---
I mean, whatever works for you is fine. But how is the number pad convenient? you either take you hand off movement keys or off your mouse which means you can't look around or turn. I still think the most effective method (if you use WASD) is 1-6, e,r,f,g,q,z,x,c,v,scroll up/down, scroll click, and (if you have them) both side mouse buttons. Then you can set up shift modifiers for any of these, i typically shift modify two spells with a similar purpose onto the same button e.g. Fear and howl of terror for my Warlock. This would give you at least 40 binds while still being able to bind further buttons and alt modifiers for less frequent items/spells.
---
[The masks are always unsettling](https://i.imgur.com/tig7LD2.png).
---
Generally I think that's still the case but every raid still has the problem of not having enough healers.  You are going to get asked to heal even if you are *the* designated Enh shaman or Cat on certain fights, it's just that right now everyone needs healers.
---
I don't think it'll necessarily stay that way, and as healers get geared and guilds get established the demand for numbers drops.  But yeah, guilds need healers and they always will to some extent.
---
Someo e recently posted about a streamer who tested this and confirmed? It was on reddit maybe two days ago? I’m not gonna look for it but u can. It was def a post on reddit recently. Sorry I couldn’t be more help than that
---
It's really easy. Just los Cho and ledge jump by the ghosts.
---
Mara is easier in the sense that you can sneak by everything to get to princess, but the fight is much more annoying
---
I have spammed and fucked up a few times, what does a shift modifier do? You need to press shift and the button again to cancel?
---
&gt;seduce 
---
Lol dude the succy will get off one seduce and WotF breaks it, then he'll kill your succubus first. She'll never cast it again b/c Prot has 3 interrupts, one of which is spammable.
---
If I engage a lock with succy out, the succy dies in 10 seconds. If she gets one seduce off, that's what the WotF is used for. The trinket/Rage is used for fears. If blueberry comes out, I save shield slam for the bubble.
---
That was super painful to watch
---
Priests are using Flash Heal for 2 reasons:
---
1) The bosses die very fast and there is no need for mana efficiency in which case HPS becomes king.
---
2) There is not much damage in encounters so Priests have to compete with Paladins for healing. Paladins are way more efficient in this regard but given mana doesn't matter currently for Priests they try to compete with Paladins in sniping anyway.
---
&gt; My thought process has been such: I can't afford rank 4 Flash Heal spam since it OOMs me in 36s, and our guild's fights last anywhere from 70s to 210s
---
This is your issue. You're looking at the top parses which will be 15-60 seconds, if that, and comparing your raid with that. Your guild probably kills bosses much slower so it would be better to find logs that are of similar fight length and compare yourself with that.
---
The way you are playing is correct in situations where you need to actually manage your mana, but that is not the only healing situation that exists. Players in top guilds are adapting to the way they kill bosses, they're focusing on pure sniping and HPS because they don't need to manage their mana but it won't always be like this. Priests are versatile and good Priests will adapt to the situation, as long as you know when to swap from Flash Healing to being mana efficient you're good.
---
Maybe try to explain how and why dozens of random people are confirming with my "lie" before trying to explain wether this is scientifically possible?
---
Nope.  Mages only succeed because the huge ball of mobs don’t get to hit them. Paladins need to be in range to do damage.
---
Mine does it in passive
---
FOR THE HORDE!!!
---
If anything the fact that it's on paper gives me an unfair advantage over the digital artists because I'm definitely lower effort than some of the amazing digital art that gets posted here.
---
Those mobs really didn't want you to win.. ps. Please get a cancelaura macro for block :D for instance he could have messed up your evocation so hard but he clearly wasted like 3 seconds trying to click off the buff ;p kinda huge
---
Just like 90% of horde
---
I honestly would've thrown 200g+ at briarwood if it were a BoE considering how many runs it took me to get that shit. And it's really good as well.
---
Reminder to mage v mage situations: use bandage whenever you poly your opponent to either force iceblock  or get fully healed and resheep if they go iceblock / fireblast.
---
There is always need for more tanks than healers and dps. It has been that way and will almost always be that way.
---
Consider 0/31/20 or some close variation.  Before you are extremely well geared elemental devastation isn't competitive with the 3% hit in the resto tree.  Then you can heal in a pinch while saving significant mana on totems even while dpsing.

Tbf I try to heal as my druid. Nobody wants or needs a healer, at least at my current level. I even had a last minute shaman in our group try to take my job as healer away.
---
Oh i figured that was a falsehood. Good on him then.
---
&gt; Does that mean that you can’t do any quests in ennemy territories ?
---
There usually aren't any quests that take you to the opposite faction's zones, no.
---
&gt; Will the horde npc try to kill me ?
---
Yes
---
&gt; realm so does that mean that every horde player will try to kill me ?
---
&gt; I met an undead and tried to kill him but that didn’t work. 
---
You can't attack the opposite faction in their own zone unless they are PVP flagged, but they can always attack you.
---
I do have a shitty personality based on my username indeed. But in relation to your question asked, I’d spread the wealth.
---
Yes, you'll be able to spam block without cancelling, and if you press it again with shift held then it will remove. Just saves the risk of instantly removing, incase you have problems with that
---
Silent auction dkp is the worst loot system that exists. If you use dkp, there should be a correlation between time invested and the loot you're able to buy.

My hearthstone is in Tanaris so ZF graveyard is substantially faster for me.

Candy that restores your health and mana. It's food.

How many fucking blinks do you guys have. Looks like some old school DragonBallZ teleporting midair shit
---
Enjoy shadow priests and moonkins getting neltharions tear. Enjoy Hunters, ferals, enhancement shams getting DFT.  Hunters will grab BiS mele weapons. Technically BiS for them, but basically wasted mega contested items. You see it every time with DKP.
---
Depends on how many mobs you are killing per day taking into consideration that different mobs have different chance to drop
---
thanks
---
Mage clearly. Only downside is having to be a gnome....
---
The guild list says who is the guild master. As for taking it over probably not, start your own and invite the active people
---
That's what my friend's average day of farming DM:E looks like (in total).
---
What's with the "frens" stuff?
---
Its allowed*
---
*It can't be used specifically to gain an advantage in a world pvp situation afaik. Blizzard generally doesn't mind. It's just more subs for them.
---
I got a 2 week ban here for 1 insult lmao, mods really need to chill
---
In 2007scape sub pretty much anything goes and everyone has a good time
---
Its not hard to keep up with what gear people have. Solution is as simple as making a sheet on google docs and having people update that themselves. If they don't or lie on it, gkick or demote. Takes a bit of effort to create it but once you have it up, it takes literally seconds to check it before each raid and you have a understanding of who would get the biggest upgrade from whichever item. Making sure people don't lie is as easy as skimming through their gear whenever in raid (which you're doing anyways since you wanna check people are using proper consumables and not cheap shit as warcraftlogs is pretty buggy on consumables atm) and comparing to what you saw in the list, its basically impossible to cheat on such lists.
---
I don’t know what game you are playing. Warriors don’t kill anyone 1v1.
---
This is great! I could give the gold to my level 5 alt and ask around for help on that character. 
---
It's not super much, got bored when I started gold farming, and I just crafted the archmage robe (sigh). So around 200 gold and some valuables like an epic BoE staff and some mooncloth etc)
---
Honestly if 2AM-8AM are the main hours you play at I think you'd be better off switching to a US server. No EU server is ever going to be populated during those hours.
---
Did you already have a retail character? I tried to make a character from level 1 on retail and it’s crazy empty and felt super pointless
---
If they needed it that much, why did they not buy it?
---
could u elaborate pls?
---
Definitely get another set. 
---
Raid set blizzard ticks for 171 and i got 2,7k hp and around 5,4k mana.
---
Farnset blizzard ticks for 166 and i got 3,4k hp and 6,3k mana.
---
Losing over 200sp barely changes the damage at all
---
If a scam works only once, it was worth the $0 investment. 
---
Thank you for this! Everyone needs to know, especially the ignorant.
---
Yeah despite so many people screeching on here "IF YOU DONT LIKE BEING GANKED EVERY THREE SECONDS DONT PLAY PVP SERVERS!!!" and acting like people should find it fun to be camped, tons of players are forced to them due to region or all their friends declaring that PvP servers are the only real servers, or simply not wanting to be on a dead server.
---
Always nice to see such those who didn't really want that experience making the most of it.
---
do those herbs sell for a lot? I mean with everyone doing it, you would think prices arent even that good now
---
is ZF pretty easy to do? for a mage that has been aoe lvling since 40ish, it's easy right?
---
HoJ works in forms , only wapons on hit effects dont work ... HoJ is amazing for druids .. basically best threat trinket for a long time
---
But... but... what do you press to open guild?!!?!?!
---
I'm not :p
---
Second this. Just re-rolled on a new server and if someone had given me a couple bags and 1g to start with it would have been a godsend. 
---
This would be the best way to spread the wealth (literally) to as many people as possible.
---
Thus avoiding any kind of delay due to the GCD.
---
problem with this statement is this is effectively whats gotten retail to the state its in now....LFG and LFR was because the players wanted it, flying mounts, WoW tokens, buying levels, catch up gear.... all that was asked for by the majority of the player base and they gave into the majority. the flaw in that is that the majority are fare weather fans and most of these changes  left the faithful base out in the cold then both groups left because all those little changes added ontop of eachother have caused a massive difference in the game and is unfun now
---
Nice job, Jake Woods!
---
You can get the "item rack" mod and you can have it switch weapons based on stance automatically. 
---
You can have it switch to sword and shield when in Def stance and 2H when in arms or zerker. It's pretty slick
---
Isnt it 6% for skills and 9% for white? Theres a blue post referenced here but correct me if im misinterpreting things please

Sure we can do MC with enh. shamans. We can also do it just with one person less. The thing is, I'm not building the raid for MC. If it was just about MC we could just all pug. We are building the raid to have a good core team when we get to the higher raids like BWL and even more so AQ40. 
---
We have tons of Warriors and Rogues who want to be part of the raid team. We have more people than we need, so we can choose who to take. And an Enh. Shaman is just straight up worse than a warrior or rogue while needing the same gear.  
---
That said, we do have one designated Enh. Shaman. He was planned to be this about 3-6 months before the release of classic. He will also only skill Enh. once we are raiding BWL in P3 and only after we build Nightfall for him. Because with Nightfall an Enh. Shaman becomes viable. 
---
Also we need healers.
---
U should get to 60 on a toon before honor comes out and leveling becomes being farmed for honor

&gt;Engineering is pretty important in PvP and pretty soon phase 2 (the honor system) will be here and fights will be pretty unavoidable. It's pretty important to have things like grenades to fight/escape with...

Mankrik is PvE, and I intend to be entirely raid-focused. PvP never appealed to me.

Our guild has had 2 mageblades drop.

Both weeks they dropped, we had to pug a few people to fill the group.

Guess who won the mageblade each time it dropped? :)

I did try using frozen trap to freeze 1 mob in a pack of 2 but it only froze them for 15 seconds which made things tough. This does look like a better solution and I was previously unaware of it, so cheers, will try it out.

Lol blizz can see it regardless of it being injected or not. User space and driver space, learn the difference.

Please dont talk with certainty about things you dont know about.

Well why do you think so many people believe in flat earth? Because there are a lot of very stupid people that exist.
---
Nowhere on planet earth does it get that purple, this photo was filtered or edited let's get real now.
---
Because there is no "I" in frens, and don't even think about giving them the "D"!
---
Goddamn need addons much?
---
Druids are the hero class of vanilla .. druids can do everything ...
---
Thanks for the info!! I’ll check it out. Appreciate the feedback too.
---
For raid bosses and people with weapon skill 15 points lower than target's defense skill, it's 9%
---
:)
---
And people say BFA has too much RNG lol
---
This is completely false. Where did you find this 'info'? (If you didn't pull it out of your ass)
---
our enh shaman is totem twisting windfury/tranq air but for some reason theres a rogue and a hunter in his group. one of which doesnt need windfury, both of which dont need tranq air.
---
That is an even worse idea.
---
Her regen isn't as good so you'll have more downtime.
---
With the free server transfers, I’m considering moving from a PVP server to a PVE server. Without explaining my reasons, can someone verify if this is possible?
---
If that's all I can muster, than sure... But one quick look on youtube shows that end game content is possible.
---
I've had 1 since the game launched. Razorgore EU.
---
I have been doing mara and st. 
---
I tried to join a brd group at 53 and was told I was too low and then kicked. 
---
I just hit 56 so might try BRD group again. ST gives good xp/hr and is pretty easy but from what I can tell no loot for my class - I am a rogue.
---
Mara is fast if you just do princess but I still haven't managed to get the damn ring from boss and it gets boring fast.
---
I think the rest of the advice is still relevant. Alchemy is good, but you will probably find that the best gold is made grinding out mobs or bosses in dungeons at level 60 either solo or with a small group. If you're planning to take a while leveling you might just pick herbalism since it complements alchemy well. Skinning is also good and is guaranteed money because you can vendor the leather.
---
Guild spends 20k gold to get the Paladin the legendary weapon and he then bitches about spending gold to respec to an optimal build lmao
---
Yea I think I’ll just have to make an alt sad but I think it’s the only option. That’s the one thing I wish classic had is duel spec
---
What a PoS
---
Google some guides, I don't have access right now but the general gist back in the day was with the right spec and shield spike you can pull a shitload and mobs will wound themselves to death while you just self heal.
---
Does the tooltip not state that it grants extra threat to holy abilities? I though this was how it worked from the start, what is the confusion here?
---
Just to answer, a Hard Drive will be slower than a Solid State.
---
How do you propose to judge 25% raid healing with 5% overheal vs 20% raid healing and 1% overheal?
---
Which is better, which is worse?
---
Exactly
---
Does 1v1 a yellow player = ganking?
---
Classic players are busy playing the game because they have time gates he ever living fuck out of every aspect of said game. You have to log in daily or you miss out on magic points that you can never catch up on.
---
It's a shitty shitty system to force you to log in.
---
So, every healer should be a priest and every DPS and every tank should be a warrior or they aren't allowed to roll on gear?
---
Holy pala does less HPS than a holy priest - meme spec, buffs don't scale with gear, so no gear for buffbots. Rogue does less DPS than a warrior - meme class. Mage does even less DPS - meme class. Warlock does EVEN LESS DPS  than a mage - meme cass, no gear for soulshard  dispenser. Feral tank has less mitigation than a deep prot warrior - meme spec.
---
Those spots were already filled
---
It's also called a backyard, use your noggin brochacho.
---
we have a guild we're friendly with that we send them to
---
From another mage, we'll done sir.
---
I really don't think the TCP protocol is the bottleneck here. The actual packet sending/receiving is probably done on threads different from the main "game loop" anyway, and I think it's unlikely that those are the ones that are blocking.
---
I'm pretty sure it's the server's gameloop/main thread/whatever that can't keep up it's desired tickrate due to too many (unoptimized?) calculations, or maybe they are running it on really crappy VM's like others are suggesting because it's cheaper. 
---
I doubt that switching to UDP would magically improve this situation.
---
I stopped playing retail some years ago and when I came back I had lots of characters created with really weird names and the log showed some Asian IPs (can't remember).
---
People would favour the more social guy because although it might be less 'efficient', he might also make the raid *more fun*.
---
People play for pleasure and another player enhancing that experience will always be prioritised over min-maxers srs business players not talking to anyone but performing well.
---
The content for now gets cleared anyway. People will favour people who contribute to the fun more than killing bosses 7 seconds faster. And that makes total sense considering the goal of the game is to have fun in a game where people begged Blizzard to recreate notably for its social aspect.
---
What am I watching here?
---
You jumped a raid spec warlock (no pet) whilst PvP specd and wearing your engi items including a shadow reflector? 
---
All the while.... not having a herb tracked that he could be stealing? What herb? What is this video? 
---
I mean, grats on the world PvP?
---
Maybe he pretends to worry about people to make himself sound better.
---
I heard this.
---
Haha I actually said you got this when I saw you, I never /clapped :(
---
Intense man. Gg!
---
Lol what is that like 1 spell power?
---
Once I equip tailoring items such as the BIS mage chest, can I drop tailoring and still equip the item once it has been soulbound?
---
That's unsettling fren
---
this is obviously staged lol
---
My server has dreamfoil down to around 50s each, gromblood at around 30s. This is after a market crash on them though. They were significantly more pre-DM, but it’s to be expected with so much becoming available.
---
Gnomes suck.
---
I remember having to drink after pretty much every pull and people had no idea why I was sitting down
---
Ah ok thats makes sence.
---
I’ve had a lot of fun as a rogue in pve. I went 5 points in improved stealth and specced for dodge and agility. They have a lot of tools and the ability to go in and out to pick your fights for quests. Not to mention pickpocketing and lockpick for extra farming. Cheers!
---
And yet how many people have you seen that still need to learn to run to the tank?
---
Id say agi &gt; spirit &gt; the rest for general grinding.
---
You send ur pet in, hunters mark arcane shot etc, and just start autoing. This allows the spirit mp5 to start ticking as ur fighting and makes it a really great stat for hunters. 0 downtime between mobs
---
The difference, I think, is that with Let Me Cast, you have to hit the ability once, triggering the GCD, then it dismounts you, then you have to hit the ability again once the GCD finishes.  
---
Right clicking your mount buff, or using the macro doesn't have any delay, and you cast the spell (if its instant) as you're falling to the ground, not triggering the GCD.
---
Lol good
---
Or you could just have other holy paladin who would contribute more than just a buff
---
Come on, boys! Look at what the Alliance scum can do to you when you’re not prepared!
---
Well played, gnome...
---
Mage quality is lacking.
---
i mean everyone seems pretty sensitive  and lame on alliance though. The idea of being outnumbered by horde while playing alliance seems fun, but no one ever pvpd on my server, even those not leveling. I asked for help like once because i was getting camped by a bunch of horde and everyone told me to shut up. Never has that happened for me on horde side.
---
Nice vid , I regret not rerolling my Druid from vanilla every day ! ):
---
hey I sent you a message!
---
Yeah. We can drop some armor to gain 3% hit easy

Doesn’t matter if you are a pure pve guild. You give it to the guy that wants to craft it
---
*sits quietly in boomkin*
---
That literally not how it works. But sure. Back pedal. It's been confirmed as working as intended. No mob is storing charges after losing aggro. Just storing thrashes. And laying them on you. It's an anti kiting mechanic. Copied from the reference client.
---
They were the kind of thing that were great when you used them but kind of ruined the pug experience a lot.
---
It is the very same situation there too, hence why content updates in osrs are so slow compared to rs3
---
This is the future none of us wanted
---
"Get a load of this lazybones over here"
---
Those dungeons were where I really learned what healing is. Triage was important, and having a constant flow of quick, cheap heals as a form of damage mitigation. Expensive heals were *expensive* because they were to be used sparingly and for emergencies
---
That was some great advice, thanks dude. By unsatisfied, I mean like, when I switched to my horde character and started over, I was like "wow, i could be doing sunken temple or almost level 60 on my alliance character".
---
You arnt sure if you have a 50gstaff in your bags? How rich are you?
---
this usually doesn't work in classic because the mobs are linked.
---
Worst thing about maining a dps warrior everyone expects you to tank and it’s annoying
---
I really enjoy playing the AH, I had an egregious amount of gold during Wrath.  Friends all joined a hardcore guild or quit, they weren't able to get me into this guild's raids, so I pugged...
---
Stacks and stacks of flasks, thousands of gold, the best gear money could buy plus some raid gear from my pugs.
---
Where is this story going you ask?  Well after trying to get in with my friends for the 100th time and being told no more melee for Malygos was happening... I hopped in my weekly Naxx pug.
---
We get to KT, smooth enough actually.  KT does not go smoothly.  I'm hitting him with kicks as often as I can, but no other interrupts are coming out, I'm at the top of the dps chart... and getting yelled at in broken English "why you no kick rogue!".  I lose it... yell back that I'm not the only guy in the raid with an interrupt and kick does have a CD.  Post dps in raid chat, drop group and tell them to F off.  Mail all my flasks and gold to a buddy, and sell my account to some shady website ($200!).
---
Getting the phone call the next day asking why I sent him so much stuff was very satisfying.
---
Didnt play again until Classic!
---
Rp scamming: 1 silver at a time, to epic mount or bust!
---
According to YouTube the earth is flat.
---
Really? You think giving a possibly made up reason would not be complained about? This is straight up ninja behaviour. He could be doing that Every run.
---
Not my video

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RJtFTPyF4w
---
its possible to aoe farm just need gear
---
yeah my prio is mainly pvp focused, will try out spirit for pve leveling atm, seems solid and will make my mana and hp get back more quickly.
---
&gt;The real problem with feral DPS is that 
---
...you can't get +5 weapon skill, so your glancing blows are horrible. And your hit cap is 9%.
---
Not screwed. 
---
Hand of rag is a PvP weapon so I’m assuming you’re meaning PvP? 
---
You’ll be rotating CDtrinkets including class PvP trinket, BPC, shadow and frost reflectors, netomatic, pocket watch, deathray etc.
---
I did it maybe 5 hours ago with no issue, shadow priest
---
Exatly :/ and until people wake up there will be no change. Look at fallout 76 and what they are doing. And no matter the backlash it is still working :D
---
oh yeah, true. Or just \#showtooltip
---
Guys used to using a tablet and editing software can spend a lot less time than you would think making a similar image to what you did.  It takes time to get fluent, but after that the effort is pretty low for most digital fan art that end up on subs.  Digital tools increase efficiency, not reduce it.
---
I'm curious, any idea how or why the bot decided to follow you guys? This is pretty funny though.
---
ok, I literally just ran Classic sim to test your glorious evidence 'YES HUH".  I put full nightslayer, except with aged core leather gloves tarnished evlen rings, cape of he black baron, 2x tarnished evlen rings, counterattack lodestone and blackhands breadth on.  I went perds MH and Alcor OH.
---
Set it to combat daggers and standard 15/31/5 talents.
---
MH +5 dmg was 275.62 dps and MH Crusader was 275.74.
---
So please show me something which isn't you spouting nonsense.
---
clearly they came into new ownership, no business suddenly just fails after 183 years of service
---
This is what I was meant,nice  plus you can get elemental sharpening stone to mace and you can get mid max more
---
That's checking if you have something active or not which the blizz macro can do, having a macro do something automatically based on an external value is botting
---
That was a really good comeback tbh.
---
Wasn't pre-nerf cthun mathematically impossible?
---
Retail?
---
&gt;And an Enh. Shaman is just straight up worse than a warrior or rogue
---
And a rogue is straight up worse than a warrior. And a warlock is straight up worse than a mage.
---
Because there are a lot of bosses that reset threat.
---
They only need 10 seconds
---
Cataclysm really made some good things. New talents tree and instant "iconics spells" at level 10 (so you already feel you specialization) were super cool, dungeon were good, the cataclysm areas were good, and MOST (not all) of the areas revamp were quite good as well, even if they could have done them better.
---
**this is how we do action in Yojamba**
---
dreamdust went from 35-40s to 15-20s on my server within like 2 days, is that a reasonable price or are people lowballing?
---
You aren't wrong, but desperate times call for desperate measures!
---
there is no point to go min-maxing for a content that doesn't need it
---
Weapon skills will stay the same, but you’ll have to rank up mana tide each time you get it again (12 silver).
---
Roughly equivalent to your continued use of fren after I brought up that point.
---
Did you look at the video?
---
Blizzard servers =/= amazing wpvp
---
I have to agree man I’m sorta annoyed lol. But this is what I wanted. Classic.
---
Thanks for this. This is the best information someone has posted and exactly what I was hoping to see
---
None of us realized you were the authority on the subject, please forgive us oh learned scholar!
---
In burning steppes, camps of dragonkin at (some melee some casters):
---
50-53 camps (some casters some melee) NE - E
---
54-57 camps directly south of BRM
---
57-59 camps west of the bridge down to BRM
---
There are solid chest spawns at most camp, often you can kill 1 mob only to loot.
---
If you are a miner/herber and don’t want to die, don’t do it unless you see no one doing circle routes. I always kill hunters that I see mounted (lvl 60s) as they nick my nodes for profit.
---
&gt;you're not going to bring anything besides warrior tanks in raid anyway
---
Bear is actually better in some cases.
---
This is exactly why i am sticking to tanking only XD
---
Just finished farming it for the last hour, worked as intended
---
Prot currently isn't necessary in 40 mans either.
---
Those are valid reasons though!
---
I am presenting a different point of view. The "tank in DPS spec" meme is strong, but I wasn't having fun fighting for aggro against 3 better geared DPS on 3 different targets in pugs. Has nothing to do with not understanding how to tank. Just easier not to have to try to coach the DPS, let them do whatever and spam dungeons.
---
The DPS already vastly outclasses the raid content so nobody minds in my raids.
---
Don’t forget about the shitty music dubbed over it
---
Gawd this made me chuckle
---
i"ve tanked all the dungeons as 31-20 and as 31-5-15 and i was legit surprised at how much smoother the arns/prot runs went.
---
I don’t see a good response yet and without going to much into detail here is the way healing should be done by most priests. First step is to get the healbot add on. Than run your gear and stats through the downranking calculator. Keep max rank flash heal for short fights and oh shit moments when tank is taking heavy damage. Use heal of whatever rank the calculator says. I don’t really like going below heal rank 2 regardless of the calc. Don’t use renew and don’t shield tanks obviously. Only use shield on dps when absolutely needed. A lot of priests love greater heal and heal and I have seen tanks die because they try to be super efficient all the damn time. I live by flash heal max rank and rank 3 heal only. I also dispel like a beast because of healbot. This is all you need to do on current content and please heal the tanks. I’m a full tier 1 / tier 2 Bene priest best gear available and study my logs. Again flash heal max rank heal rank 2 or 3 all you need and healbot. Gear and reaction time will make up the rest. Renew is a waste of mana don’t let people tell you different it’s useless. Focus on keeping tanks alive no matter what anyone says. All the calculators and efficiency and meters and logs won’t do shit for you if your tank dies because you’re trying to me efficient. Flash heal is life.
---
What? If the fight actually requires healing, overhealing should be low
---
Sell it for real money and spend it on your education
---
There's a lot of reasons to min max. If it's easy doesn't mean people like half assing it, carrying people, loot drama and dealing with potential problems in future raids where meme specs will suddenly be benched.
---
People aren't forcing others to play non 'memespec'. But also the memespecs shouldn't be surprised that people don't want to raid with people who would do 3-4 times less DPS than their counterparts.
---
You play 1 character and join the 2 nights a week group and let somebody else handle the charge.
---
Okay well looking at the entire raids gear was actually the least important point of anything I said.
---
&gt;Clearing c'thun before nerf was deemed impossible back then, today people would do it easily
---
Not really. C'tun was impossible because he was bugged AF. People were rundumbly deleted by BS mechanics with 0 counterplay.  
---
Also, bear is a viable raid tank, actually preferrable on some bosses.
---
I'm in the same boat.  I dont get much time to level.  I get about 5 hours a week.  I played for quite a while back in the day so I know the best places to quest/grind.  I can usually get one to three levels grinded out in about 5 hours.  
---
I advise you to have fun and quest/grind as you will need a mount at 40 to help reduce time traveling.  Get to 60 at your own pace and get ready for BG's like the guy said.  BG's are the best for us filthy casuals...lol.  What server are you on?
---
Tom Haverford is proud
---
That... defeats the entire purpose dude. It's there to move people to a low pop server
---
Here is this: 
---
How does it work?
---
It's quite easy and intuitive. Start by going to the "Profiles" section of the ElvUI Config, then either click the "Export Profile" or the "Import Profile" button, depending on what you want to do. The export frame is set up by default to share your profile in text format. You then just have to click the "Export Now" button and copy the text with Ctrl+C or Cmd+C. If you want to import a profile, then you simply have to paste the text into the text field on the import frame.
---
Now you’re comparing an inn to a capital city.  I hope you smart enough to know the difference. And know which one is better. Don’t say Darnassus, cause I said the difference before - capital city to capital city comparisons. 
---
Any alts you make right now could easily get 4 10 slot bags. An new toons are likely to get 10 slot bag for cheap or free. I like to believe I’m just so lucky, to be the only one in all the servers, to get free 8 and 10 slot bags from stranger. I must carry that lucky charm. 
---
I said advantage alliance on new server fresh economy. But you can’t recognize what’s right in front of you. 
---
I am not the only one to agree with the op.  You could make argument that Orgrimmar is better city to hearth in cause most people are there, and for services that auction can’t be done, enchanting, lock picking, or people just don’t want to sell on ah. 
---
I reinforced your points because I can see where I can agree with you. But you can’t see an inn doesn’t compare to capital city, bag space advantage is gone after couple weeks. Oh I learned an “insult” from someone, “tYpIcAl HoRdE pLaYeR iN a NuTsHeLl” isn’t it so funny
---
check out tinytooltip.
---
elvui has an inbuilt option to move where the tooltip is but that is a overhaul. i think you could use it jsut for that but idk
---
the fact that its a one shot lmao
---
Welcome to Azeroth, adventurer:)
---
May your journey bring you joy and a shitload of epics!
---
P.S For the Horde!
---
Hey man, just wondering what your gear/spec looks like? There's no way I can get the hit cap without some leather so I'd be super squish.
---
Buy buy buy
---
Holy cow. I really thought you weren't gonna make it. Nice!!
---
And yet you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Not only are they not a mess, they're far easier to navigate than the horde cities, Ironforge in particular is incredible in terms of that.
---
It varies between heaps of fun to "fuck these guys, do they have nothing better to do?"
---
a good tank uses a shield sometimes unless they are furry and tank bearhanded.
---
Its like changing gears.  Tanking is straight forward, but only when against a boss, otherwise heals, but if a mob comes back to the priest, time for dps.
---
Physical damage wands supposedly do exist... but I don't think I've ever seen one.
---
i didn't buy any seeds until i was level 28
---
The hots generate aggro if the Druid puts them on you before pulling. You should encourage them to do this to boost their aoe threat.
---
how is "Increases the threat generated by Sunder Armor by 15%" mitigation?
---
Work from home.

Lmao you just had to do the retail comparison
---
It's my first time playing world of warcraft. What's up with all the hate for Gnomes? I'm really curious

the destination servers are no longer 1:1
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-character-moves-for-this-region-october-17/335159

There are options for the big servers. I moved from a full server to Earthfury and it's a normal EST english non-streamer server
---
Literally just disenchanted a Zealot blade because i couldn't sell the damn thing and was sick of seeing it show back up in my mailbox. Feelsbad
---
Haha nice song name?
---
&gt; If that’s the only argument retail has

I'm pretty sure you are well aware that retail has a lot more arguments than that, even if you don't agree with those arguments :)
---
I use my mouse to turn.
---
Time to /spit on em before they ghost
---
KVM, brother
---
I think this isn't really a recent change. There is simply more to do now a days then Vanilla days and people are always doing other things aside from hanging out on WoW, or if they are on WoW they are mindlessly grinding something while catching up on their series.  
---
I prefer small tight-knit guilds myself, but this guy wants the best of both worlds, where they over recruit and expect non-cores to act like core members when they are consistently being left out. They have a core 30man so they are more than able to down Rag without the extra 10, they should be limiting their recruiting if they are looking for dedicated guildmates.
---
TBC only because it was my hay day, I didn't have much success in Vanilla. I was too bad and got into the wrong guilds.
---
Plus I don't think there was oceanic zone servers when I started. They existed but I didn't pay to transfer right away, I had to wake up at 2am to raid, and when I did I was one of the plebs. Finding an Aussi guild was difficult too, although not impossible.
---
By the time I moved to an Oceanic listed server BC had already been announced for 2 or so months.
---
Vanilla is OK though, but there's just a lot of design flaws that screw over classes and specs.
---
Lowballing is something buyers do, so if the AH listings are for 15-20s the answer would be no.
---
Lol u suk nig
---
I do rotate my character by using the mouse.
---
I need to get more keybinds for sure. Any ideas for other keybinds? I do shift 1,2,3,4, Q T V E and then shift of those and my two mouse buttons.
---
The only other macro I'd suggest is: 
---
/cast summon   /say click the portal   /party click the portal to summon %N
---
%N fills in the name of whomever you have taegeted, letting that person know you're trying to summon them and hopefully getting the attention of your members to actually click it.
---
lol skarm dodged a bullet
---
Im playing warlock and want to cast immolate, corruption then fear then curse of agony (only lvl 6), 1 button press seems way better
---
&gt;Shaman and pally healers don’t have a spirit talent to keep regen going
---
They have green dragon set. Too bad they need gauntlet slot for the set bonus. Same with icemail jerkin.
---
Elemental build (fire/frost) instead of deep fire of you're gonna go fire mage
---
Sadly this is the nerfed to the ground version of mc. Not that the original version was super difficult, just longer fights that require more gear/effort. I'm afraid bwl will also be a cakewalk.
---
Nope, I get burned out by other things.
---
Usually bad drama makes me nope out if games for long times.
---
It’s on ah for 60 g right now on my server.
---
With Nightfall, you can run that effectively as enhance shaman in phase 3.
---
Huh
---
You really had me in the first half with your clicking
---
I'm so proud of how active this subreddit is, but then I would expect nothing less from something that came out just 2 months ago!
---
Without checking....I think O...or shift J? My binds are a mess...
---
unless its undead then they have double. and if its a fury warrior then it has 30 second fear immunity aswell. And fury is even more dangerous during leveling due to extra crit, faster rage generation and possibly even improved intercept (lower cd).
---
This is me. I’m so, so bad at anything remotely pvp. I just can’t find the same enjoyment playing on a pve server. I’ll occasionally get lucky and come across a player who’s the same skill level and I’ll get a nice kill. It doesn’t happen too often though.
---
i know i started automating it too now
---
my mouse spams k4k4k4k4k4k4k4k4 all night now.... i kept reporting them for a week and nothing happened 
---
so if u cant beat them join them......
---
Lower rank heals start becoming more effective once you get a decent amount of +healing on gear.
---
you are right there were ppl that requested it. I apologize for my hasty read
---
ofc this doesn't change my opinion on this "feature"
---
Honestly one of the best scholo runs I was ever on was with a feral dps and a lock. The feral wasn’t that great of dps but I’ll be damned if he wasn’t the best Druid I’ve ever grouped with. He was popping heals on everyone when needed and off tanking in bear form when we overpulled (which was a lot, it was a very fun group lol). It was awesome to watch and a very smooth run considering our dgaf attitude
---
That end crit was a fuckin YEET
---
Z X C R F (+ shift) 
---
Alt + 1 2 3 
---
F1 F2 F3 F4
---
Mouse wheel scroll up and down.
---
I move camera with shift + mouse wheel.
---
Using CTRL as a modifier opens up even more binds.
---
Impressive levels of mental gymnastics ya got there. The goofballs on this sub never fail to out themselves.
---
It is not. You have to transfer pvp to pvp and vice versa.
---
My eyes hurt, that was the most disgusting thing I’ve ever seen. Clicking off ice block and clicking ice barrier, this should be labeled nsfw. Why is this on trending??
---
I start as cat, more or less. I use bear or Rejuv if any problems happen. I follow a zen tanking style that’s easy to explain and if we are just having a good time farming the dungeon we all good. 
---
Everyone should just learn to off tank and kind of focus fire without a strict lead / structure. Off means peel adds Off the healer.
---
Is that a fun dip stick?
---
The dualwield penalty doesn’t discriminate and affects both MH and OH. The 9%/6% hitcap is for 2h weps/ranged weapons/abilities only, not for your main hand swings (unless your MH swing is a heroic strike obviously).
---
Those are called bows
---
Hence the bad at PVP comment :)
---
People's healing strategies are clearly something to get defensive about in this thread. Holy smokes.
---
Best part is alot of people are arguing against each other who all heal the same.
---
 Somewhere some dead dps is waiting for a rez because a debate has broken out over heal/flash heal.
---
we did LBRS with one
---
Bless you comrade
---
It is extremely viable ergo possible at 60 dungeons and even raids. However Shaman doesn't fill a niche, drinks a lot, doesn't have defensive cooldowns, and loses threat vs. Nature Res/immunity. It's also straight up 1 armour class less, with no compensation (that I can think of; I main Elemental so I've looked into it but never tried it)
---
So you can hold aggro and mitigate damage, but that's about the extent of it.

They are not esoteric. Not everyone uses their desktop or laptop for Reddit. That is far from esoteric and has nothing to do with tech literacy. Nice try though. Next.
---
Your second point: replace voice with key press, who cares honestly you are trying but failing horribly to try to bend this discussion to your will, otherwise having to interface with Siri or Cortana is added engineering, even if it is trivial. As far as faking tech talk, we are having a high level discussion without digging into the methods that would be used to achieve. This functionality, so keeping it high level makes sense, the fact that you understood me means nothing was faked.
---
I don’t feel the need to proof read on Reddit, barring it being a discussion on something of importance, like geopolitics. This is an embarrassing discussion about something incredibly inconsequential. I just enjoy making you look like an idiot.
---
Also it is within the realm of imagination to try to garner what someone was trying to say LOL!
---
I don’t click ice barrier. 
---
Also it’s because there are other peon PVP players like me that can relate to my messy PVP skills of hybrid clicks and keybinds. 
---
Can’t all be pros like you.
---
A Rogue can use tier gear that’s otherwise wasted, and can also make use of dagger drops. Same with Warlocks and their tier sets. A Shaman can’t use its tier gear for melee DPS so they will be rolling on gear that the raid’s best DPS, a Warrior, will also be rolling on. 
---
So yes, while a Rogue is worse than a Warrior and a Warlock is worse than a Mage, neither class is taking gear from a better DPS spec in the way an Enhancement Shaman (or Ret Paladin, Boomkin) would.

I'm a hunter in a raid group of 5 hunters and 1 of the 5 is our raid leader. So far I've raided for 4 weeks and has 4/8 of giants talker set, 1 bracer of the true flight and I've created the Rhok'delar as well.
---
We are using a system whereby the 1st need of the week gets top priority and if several ppl are in their first need, they roll. Very simple.
---
We are almost always happily chatting abt in game stuff and irl stuff during the raid cos the raids now are rather easy.
---
For me personally, the thing abt going into a raid is that you can't be too driven by the desire for loot, if you build a cohesive team, gear will come to you, just a matter of time. Of course, helping each other out outside of raid is a necessity.
---
One advice I can give is just to enjoy the game.
---
And their DPS is just auto attacking.
---
Priest, 2 MCs, one run to shazz, another shazz killed. Only 1 piece of prophecy, gloves. Won it with a fucking 48, out of 4 others. So hang in there I guess.
---
Edit: The facts are real. 8 pieces, week lockout. Lucky to get an item a instance. Obviously this is basic, cause you can def have a run, but hell atleast 2 months for a few pieces is realistic. 0 pieces is a pittance.
---
Also the warriors in my guild arnt going for 100 parses , I don’t think they are doing the heroic strike bug so they are under performing to an extent but all im saying is you can still top the charts with 2 hand fury. People saying it’s not viable haven’t tried it. I’m sure it wouldn’t be viable if you were going for rank 1 speed runs but most players arnt doing that. I only started playing 2 hand fury so my guild will let me roll MS on BRE but I ended up enjoying it more than duel wield
---
Why not both?
---
It's because you need a lot of +healing gear before you can start effectively down ranking.
---
I agree with your overall point that if you’re not going to do anything for the guild, you’re not entitled to loot. It may sound harsh, but with the way some goblins behave, I’d say it’s almost necessary at this point. 
---
That being said, I don’t think it’s fair to only give gear based on non-raid activity. If you’re showing up to every raid with full consumables, doing good damage/healing, and not messing up any mechanics (I know it’s vanilla but you can still kind of tell who’s doing good), it’s kind of shitty to not consider them in the loot council discussion. Especially considering we’re entering our 5th/6th/7th week of clears for most semi-hardcore guilds. 
---
WoW is a social game, that doesn’t mean everyone has to be social. I’m not doing loot council for classic because I think the point of it isn’t as prevalent as before (now you’ll have 25/40 be decent players whereas you’d be hard pressed to find 10/40 that know their class and the raid). Maybe consider after your core gets their set bonuses to do some free rolls in there.
---
Well not in this context but if you open on, and win against someone i'd say that is ganking.
---
This was moreso just me pretending to be AFK and a gnome tried to pull up on me two times after he thought i walked away from my PC
---
Does anyone know what a fair price for "plans: mithril shield spike" is?
---
Haven't seen any sell at my server yet.
---
Thanks
---
If a mob goes for the priest, it’s time to bear up and growl!
---
If it's a separate account, tag a mob, and have your 60 (not in the group) delete it. You can farm elites that way, for even more exp.
---
ok boomer.
---
It doesn't work. Tried. You have to have another account create the name.
---
By your logic, your boe epics in raid that drop should be an open roll. If you win something not of your class, you ah it to buy the boe you actually wanted. There are literally 0 guilds that do that
---
The value of hit increases if you're crit capped.  While it's not relevant for him right now it will be later.  Just mentioning this so he doesn't think these weights are static regardless of gear/stats.

Well ST dragons drop a couple of 4g weapons here and there, so it ends up being like 15g/hour, better than nothing when you are not in for the money.  Already have over 100 Princess solo kills, indeed havent seen the blade drop. Exalted with AD mostly from Scholo (took me about 50 runs before necklace from Vectus finally dropped, figured I'll run a couple more for the rep) and haven't seen neither epic drop, meanwhile in late 2006 I got Alanna's at level 58.
---
Affliction is more mana efficient and has better sustain for that reason.  You'll take few breaks to drink, etc.
---
Lol "yeeted" go back to fortnite you lying norman
---
Scum lord sat and waited for you to pull lmao
---
Weird, at the very beginning it looks like you use keys to turn, because your mouse stays on the screen and it usually disappears when you right click.
---
I used to hide somewhere in capital and send message in general who finds me gets $$ and only level 40 or lower can participate something like that.
---
Fuck.  Fucking stupid I have to lose all my earnings because my guild chose the wrong server type.
---
The stat buff stacks 5 times if you are lucky, so in essence 250 to all stats if blizzard left the proc the same as how private servers handled it.
---
yeah I'm about 4th in line for mageblade. When staff drops I'll probably take it since I know the guys above me will pass on it to stay on prio list for mageblade. I'd rather a great weapon now than wait months for it. Everyone will get it eventually anyway. MC is ran for basically the entirety of vanilla.
---
Tyr's Hand in south-east Eastern Plaguelands is full of level 54-55 elite humanoids and a good chunk of them can be pulled alone. The only annoying thing I found is that most of them heal themselves making the fights longer than usual.
---
Too bad you guys got wiped :) and we killed your king
---
unfortunately I wasn't able to test with world buffs this week as I might or might not have lost them by stupidly zoning out at the imps...

Regardless, looking at current high rank logs, it seems like you can just spam HS all the way through without losing BT and WW uptime.
---
Leastrixplus works just fine with dismounting

Both retail and classic are bad. Perfection is somewhere in the middle.

Great job!! Makes me want to play a mage but there is sooo many and their raid rotation looks boring. In pvp though they are truly something special!

I’m an orc warrior and I want to be a tank. Originally I was going to DPS while leveling then tank but I find that I like to tank dungeons as I level in order to practice seeing as I’ve never played wow before this. 
---
So right now I’m a fury DPS build and I’ve heard arms is better for tank and leveling but I can’t find a guide or anything like that anywhere. I guess my question is arms the best for tanking while leveling?
---
:o
---
Those pants last most agi wearers until level 50-60. I only replaced mine on my hunter around 56 with Devilsaur leggings.
---
What can I say, I love ambush and gouge-&gt;backstab.  If I have to I’ll bring 2 swords for more dps when I need to solo an elite. May end up changing altogether at a higher level, idk.
---
There's only one choice for US servers, Bloodsail Buccaneers, and Alliance side has the slightly higher population.
---
go back to the woods
---
Lol the classes you listed are the ones I have the easiest time with!! Rogues and warriors have been cake so far it’s the priest and mage that can be trouble.
---
That sounds just like respawns. Why do you think it's a layer thing?
---
Well I’m alliance but I don’t care who’s there if I can just quest in peace.
---
Yeah I'm pretty terrible at PvP but I hate playing on PvE servers. It just feels like half the game is missing.
---
nice
---
I've seen this exact message in trade chat on Flamelash EU. Any other servers this guy is active on?
---
Looks like I’m way out of it. 
---
I’ll need to find out what a sandstone drake is. :)
---
I’ve had this happen too lol it sucks
---
Horde scum
---
Only sunder revenge and shield block. I haven’t had any issues and I’m arms spec. You’ll find you can even just blood rage and not have to charge.
---
This is wrong.
---
Maybe not, but it's still *good* on a Paladin, and the proc from SoR/SoC also have a chance to proc the weapon so you get a bit more effectiveness than it seems.
---
I can’t break it down boss by boss. At Rev running scholo is 300-500 rep, depending on how lucky you are with stones and dragon scale drops. Bosses definitely still give rep, it’s not just turn ins.
---
GM can demote themselves.
---
So maybe a controversial pick but I would say enchanting/mining. The mining part is obvious but the enchanting would let you disenchant bops alongside trash you pick up on both characters.
---
shadow priest could be argued to be the strongest PvP class right now (they had the highest winrate in the last tournament)  
---
Im thinking of rerolling priest because its sooo good in pvp if you know what you are doing.  
---
If u dont like being healer/the class in general, i would reroll.
---
But dont think other classes are stronger. Priest is the strongest pvp class besides warlock and rogue (and a good priest can easily beat those two aswell)
---
Yeah priest sucks for solo farming/grinding.  
---
But there is alot of classes that cant even do lashes because they have no aoe at all.  
---
So be careful thinking the grass is greener on the other side, priest is actually one of the best classes in the game if u ask me (besides mage and warrior)
---
Tldr suck up to the leaders to get loot
---
holy shit this has to be the worst fight ive seen, both sides
---
This sub is just as trash though...
---
*if you are 48+ youre a target*
---
It's fear/charm/seduce/Mind-control
---
Sometimes all you need in order to win is to not give up til ur dead (unless ur a shaman)
---
This happens when he's replaced, so someone must of finished the quest chain while you were kiting him and a second Stiches spawned and the first one vanished.
---
You can do either for tanking imo but Arms has Tactical Mastery and allows you to 2h tank leveling content with sweeping strikes etc
---
you don't get flipped unless you join a group.
---
Exactly.
---
Mages can be insane if skilled.
---
Mages can be great if unskilled.
---
If an undimmed mage understand they're unskilled. They make food and water. They teleport people. They can blink out of trouble.
---
They can just cast frostbolt and 1v1 mobs or dps in a group.
---
Mage all the way
---
&gt; More hits actually translates to critting more often as well.
---
Only if you are at crit cap which you have no way of reaching in current gear.
---
Honestly this was one of my favorite thing I’ve seen since classic came out. Not sure why I enjoy it so much, maybe because I play horde and I really hate the rogue class altogether.
---
I'll always tune in to the streams at least :)
---
Have you played this game before
---
it's specifically for non-hunters who get into combat with them. It's called, like, Fool's Plight or something like that?
---
I kill them regularly. You just drop into D-Stance and tank them.
---
The pet hitting you is just free Revenge stuns. Revenge isn't locked to the target that hit you, you can Revenge anyone. When they bubble, Slam it away. If it doesn't work the first time, do it again. All of this is spammable.
---
I have never lost to even geared Warlocks as Prot, they cannot out-tank you.
---
Do this but try to target new players and not just greedy 60s leveling an alt
---
Relax guys
---
pretty sure the gap is smaller than 12 levels. Also you gain less and less honor from a person the more you kill them. I believe it goes down 10% for every kill of the same player within a 24 hour period.
---
I was responding to you and to _clever_reference_  thinking you were the same person since you both  were talking about tech literacy but you joined into the conversation later so I thought you had to be the densest person ever, now I realize it was two different users and now it makes sense where the misunderstanding on what the argument was about. 
---
We both agree that the most efficient way to share screenshots to Reddit is from the same computer you are playing WoW on. No argument there. My argument was,  there are easily imaginable SITUATIONS where it would be quicker for someone to take a picture from their phone and upload it to Reddit, than from the computer they were playing WoW on.
---
Imagination plays a huge role in ANY industry, even if you are an assembly line worker (in fact there are plenty of examples of people starting at the ground floor and working their way up, and their experience on the ground floor gave them insight that those that proceeded them at the top lacked) The onus is on you.
---
UX design can pay more handsomely than a senior engineering role and vice versa. What you are paid depends on lots of factors.
---
The world is better off now that you are not involved in user experience, because you suck at putting yourself in others shoes, and lack empathy, but I am guessing the product you worked on tanked or suffered since you were the go to guy for that.
---
Yeet 🙌🏼
---
For the Alliance!
---
How do you zoom the camera?
---
For someone who says they are bad at pvp, you're pretty good at pvp. All your judgment calls on when to and why to were spot on. Literally your iceblock at almost no mana to prevent a spell from landing into sheep for a evocation.
---
Well done alliance scum, well done.
---
Is The Hammer of Grace + Brightly Glowing Stone better than Guiding Stave of Wisdom for a holy priest?
---
That's all he can do, he will never cast a single spell once Deathcoil is blown. You tank him in D-stance and get free Revenge procs off the pet, which stun the Warlock even more. His DoTs are doing 10% less damage and you will eventually kill him.
---
They do not have more health than you without bubbles, and even at 10% reduced damage inflicted you will kill them because they are cloth.
---
LOL reminds me of the old days dragging mobs to towns in Ultima Online to reign hell on every1.
---
Last time i\`ve checked, there wasn't exactly a surplus of tanks.
---
If/when paid transfers are added, PvP to PvE should be possible.
---
Maybe if you turn with arrow keys or something. Following a player with mouse look is trivial at normal movement speed.
---
&gt; it does 75% of its damage (whereas the mainhand does 100%)
---
AFAIK (based on 14 year old information from EJ) Dual Wield Spec on Warriors increases your offhand damage by 25%, but your offhand already only deals 50% of its damage - so the end result should be 62.5%, not 75%.  How it works in this client I have no idea though - could be different.
---
How do I get to SFK on alliance side?
---
Not sure as I haven't tried in classic yet but I leveled aoe prot when tbc came out. Kind of slow but really fun and engaging imo
---
Cam you elaborate on why you think that?
---
It looks like you are just jealous that this guy has a good system setup and is using it well.
---
And have phones.
---
Buy a few Oil of immolation and downrank mate
---
No it's a tampon
---
This looks like The Thing creature.
---
Sounds like there’s a sort of catch 22 here.. new raiders have no clear path to get in, if they get in it’s just random invites, then they don’t get loot cause you don’t know if they’re loyal, but they got no way to prove it if it’s just random invites, they have no idea if they will ever get loot so they leave going back to making you think that they’re not loyal. 
---
And the only sure fire way is to suck up to officers?
---
From Ironforge head east into loch modan then north into wetlands.  Keep heading north to arathi highlands then head west to hillsbrad.  Then follow the road west from hillsbrad until you reach sfk.  Pick up the flight paths along the way.
---
You can't cast a lvl 60 buff on lvl 10 character. Spell will auto-downrank.
---
Actually I went back and read and realized it doesn’t even matter that you jumped in after two comments from the other user. You could still be technically literate enough to know how to take a screenshot from your computer and post to your Reddit account from a browser and it would still be faster for you to post from your phone if you only used the Reddit app on your smartphone to post or login to Reddit.
---
If you stretch the arguement sure...
---
If there is someone that gives honor ill jump in be it 1 honor or 100 its always worth my 20 seconds of pressing buttons.
---
Only give 600 exp :(
---
Eh, idk which Server you're on but changing servers could dramatically hurt your ability to find groups within a desireable amount time.
---
Idk if there even is a decently populated pve Server?
---
Also I don't think you can transfer from PvP to pve or the other way around.
---
Your only option is to start a new character.
---
Did you try disabling item rack to see if it still happens? 
---
Did you press escape when you set your new keybinds? That would have canceled any changes you made. Gotta hit "Okay".
---
Has there been any math done on the dps gain of grace of air vs tranquil air?
---
Where rogues wouldn't need to use feint with tranq, but the agi from grace might  be more dps even if they have to spend energy on feint.
---
Shaman gets crushed too.
---
You killed a little kid? Congrats big man.
---
Just checked all these guys out but none give more than 600-700exp :(
---
Gettin a Goldeneye 64 vibe
---
Happens almost constantly
---
DkKP is a pretty terrible system.
---
I set my character to make 10 stacks of heavy silks at a time while afk. I'll just leave it running when I leave for work. I come home to lots of bandages and pass em off to the vendor.
---
I think I started using the number pad when I was healing dungeons back in the day, using left hand for F1-F4 targetting and right hand for casting. Combat spells I typically still use left hand unless I'm cycling targets with tab for debuffs.
---
Eh I'm on Faerlina

/EndThread
---
I purchased nearly all the runcloth I needed for rep via COD and it was fine. Often 12 hours between sending and when I picked it up. Had a CPL people try to scan me by sending the wrong cloth or not full stacks but besides that it was fine
---
So in general 9% hit is the number that you want as a DPS warrior, but I read somewhere that if you have over the weapon skill (for example, using a sword as a Human) that it accounts for an extra 3% hit. Is this true? 
---
If it is true, does that mean I only need 6% hit on my equipment if I use a sword?
---
Thanks for being honest.
---
Yeah, my guild has a dagger rogue using 6 piece for it now with the best NS mixed in. He says its actually right on par with the other bis list, but I don't know if hes right or not. Hes our top rogue though for damage most of the time.
---
Go to town and /cry

The first person who comes up to you and trys to make you feel better = wins.

Ez pz
---
Who wants to buy Brightcloth cloaks tho? Sure, I guess you could DE them, but you are only going to get a fraction of your mat cost back. With bags, you can sell them near the mat cost, which allows you to level tailoring without losing all your money.
---
&gt;All the BiS hunter weapons
---
are crossbows.
---
In 1.10, all the max level dungeons got the size reduction. Blackrock Spire got reduced from 15 to 10 cap, and BRD/Scholo/Strat got reduced to 5 cap.
---
Dire Maul *launched* with a 5 cap, and the cap was made *with* Dire Maul's release! Prior to 1.3, you could bring 40 people into Deadmines!
---
Why are so many screen shots taken in the darkest environment people can find
---
They are taking the hobbits to Isengard!
---
guild raids are a little different from groups don't you think?
---
Besides, one important difference is that t1 pieces are desired for every class. The same cannot be said for profession drops or these books. A mage gets 10 silver on his own book, a priest maybe 100 or 200 gold.
---
Haha yeah, right "disaster".  Long queue times two months after the game was released sure is a "disaster"  
---
You BFA fanbabies were the ones who kept saying that the game was going to be empty after two weeks and yet here we are with a growing subreddit

Btw BFA is a joke and your taste in games is awful if you enjoy it

So basically in situations where you don't need to move around much, or at all?

Agility is the only thing that matters.

x2 level 60 hunters here.
---
32k, yikes.

The ud female /flirt. Having your character slowly whisper "i cant wait to suck the juice out of your eyeballs" always gives great reactions.

Grobbulus is my side chick and I love her! But I’m only like level 16? Lol.

The rp events are hilarious - or just walking into an inn and seeing the inn-keeper guild doing their thing while 6 naked nightelves sit on a bed

Dual boxing 2 hunters, they are 28 currently.

So fun to see this, my unitscanner popped off, you were close to 300 people in that zug zug stack. Hopefully we can get some epic battles IF the servers are improved!

&gt; My argument was still valid because you followed the thread answering for them.

Oof! For your future reference, the right move would have been to just say "opse sorry I thought you were the guy I was originally talking to". Instead you put your foot in your mouth because your ego can't stand losing any of it's delusions. Guess what? I don't talk for anyone except myself. I know that. You know that. Everyone knows that.

If you are technically literate enough then the computer will always be faster. That has been and will always be what I am arguing. Unlike you I can remember what I said. You are welcome to continue to try and come up with counter examples for an argument I never made if that makes you feel better.
---
Same here,  Noggenfogger EU
---
enough
---
I think in hairy situations I move with WASD and cast with num pad, or I can move with mixture of mouse, WASD, auto-run and cast with either hand. I also have bubble on middle mouse button for unexpected things. Whenever I come across something I have a lot trouble doing I create a new bind somewhere near where my hands are in that situation for that thing.
---
It was never really logically thought out, just added to over time and now I have 2-3 different hand positions with some better for different things. One day I might redo them all but whever I try I keep blowing cooldowns thinking im casting a renew or something lol.
---
Shoutouts to my man hughhoofner lmfao
---
This is just false. How would the layers balance out if you only ever get changed when joining a party?
---
I have to 1.) cast frostbolt while 2.) watching the threat meter, 3.) watch my health and be ready to potion, 4.) hope to catch my H.P. at optimal time to use supplemental abilities like berserking, and 5.) watching boss's health. It was also a 3h,40m completion where myself and the tank were the only two members of the original group by the time we finished, trash mobs reset by the time we replaced people who bailed and we basically cleared it twice, and I had to be up at 9 A.M. when you can see what time it was in the video.

I was burnt out, to be sure.

Loot council is dumb, your guild sounds awful and like the reason why loot council is bad. Because loot councils turn into cliquey groups of friends helping friends and giving the gear to their friends. And then there are the losers who will grovel before the loot council. Be a real guild leader and use DKP/EGPG. But you wont cause you and your clique are greedy and dont want some raider who comes and spends their time helping your raid to get gear unless you graciously gift it to them.
---
Same, on firemaw and stonespine
---
Very long lol.
---
 I am brand new and had to spend a lot of time figuring out basic stuff like how to use the zeppelin and macros.
---
If I roll another character I will also probably use a quest guide to be more efficient.
---
eu servers issue, other user can even play overwatch
---
Haha the sum 41 🤘
---
Same on Skullflame-EU
---
I could write it all out or...I could link you to the ultimate bear tanking resource. May I present Taladrils Treatise on Bear tanking in Vanilla. https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Seriously, everything you need is here. My preference at 60 and so far I have next to no complaints, is using high agi, more dps oriented gear every where there isn't a particularly fantastic defensive piece. For example some pieces of leather have much higher armor than alternatives, so I use them, any trinkets or rings that have armor, I use them, the rest, I gear as if I was about to dps as a cat. Hope this helps! Remember Agi gives you dodge, crit and a lil AP making it the best stat IMO unless something has abnormally high armor or stam because those are cumaltive with the HOTW talent. Cheers!
---
Ah thanks.
---
New xpac clearly taking inspiration from classic would get me to at least jump back and try it.
---
I have frostbolt bound to my mouse's side button, but hit 1-2-3 for the first three on the row, but I click the rest of them. I have accumulated a lot of repetitive motion injury from over-gaming, and find the most ergonomic way to play to be using the mouse cursor for many things (I'm 34 years old).
---
phew, i thought it's me. The coincidence with fooling around with Auctioneer made me think it's my fault :))
---
And yes, on EU.
---
Yes bro literally you are right, man I literally love this literally word.
---
Amazing for boosting dungeons. Loads of sustain and allows you to chainpull a lot more without needing to eat.
---
Nah you could 5 man em, but people did 10 man to blow through them for fast loot.
---
World PvE at its finest.
---
That, and the cooldown on caster fears is way OP.
---
I'm using one of the Corsairs with the red target button (no idea how to use it) and two left-side buttons I can thumb, which is how I spam frostbolt. I'm not the most savvy when it comes to keybinding.
---
Same, Gandling
---
The thing is that when you swap from 5 to 6 players, you lose a MASSIVE amount of experience. In a 5 man group, each person gets 28% mob experience. In an 8 man party, each person would get 7.5%.
---
And I thought is's me as I just changed my movement keybindings from wasd to qwe.....and hitting the wrong buttons all the time. DE server
---
they just want you to see the url. they dont use the channel
---
I feel like I recall my zoom in-out to be my mouse wheel. Not sure how/why I'd bind anything else to it.
---
A) Been banned for 24 days now. The vendor makes the game worse for others, not the people camping it. Limited supply with a somewhat limitless short term demand will always lead to this outcome.
---
B) Never tried to justify anything this is a warning post. I haven't put in a single appeal or call to customer support outside of two appeals, and have no desire to have this or any account back.
---
C) I hope you have a good day tomorrow!
---
lol again, whatever works for you or however you enjoy it is fine. But, yeah, i could imagine changing them all would be difficult, it's part of the reason that i made a serious effort going into classic to set up my binds in a logical manner (at least to me) that allowed a lot of head room.
---
All of the people who say BRD farming for Rogues is good are just downright wrong. And for only one reason, the mobs are too high level &amp; resist pickpocket too often. If you have to use Vanish more than once every 5 mins due to resists, you're either dying or have a loooot of downtime.
---
Protip from someone who farmed their rogue's epic mount on a pserver...grind RFD.
---
The mobs in there rarely resist pickpocket and you can kill the bosses for bonus vendor loots. 1-2 chests per run too. Still averaged about 33g per hour but that was more due to having to wait out the lock timer since I could run it 5 times in about 45min. If you get bored, change it up to ZF. I got 4 Gutrippers from the lockboxes in ZF across maybe a total of 10 runs. 
---
Took roughly 20 hours farming with base g of 175g (also got the pvp rank 3 discount which knocked off an extra 100g).
---
Yeah but by the time BWL comes around he will be ready
---
Because druid.
---
Wow I've never even thought of this lol.
---
I just dungeon grind...
---
Same here, stuck at 70% and then get message world server is down.
---
hunter nub here.
---
my hunters only lv. 10 but lower attack speed is better right?
---
eu servers are deasd i cant leave my dungeon evrytime i have a 5 min loading screen : instance not found so i am just farming trash
---
Came here to say this, the ole double your Isk.
---
PVP (weighted) - kill 1 of each race/class(/sex) combo from the opposing faction in the open world
---
pvp or raids.
---
you'd - at best - be an OT but they'll probably expect you to be dps.
---
Yes that's right
---
On the opposite end I'm not bad at pvp in classic and nothing is more fun than going on a 1 player rampage (obv vs 60s) in world pvp. I'll corpse camp etc, I'm just here to pvp and have fun.
---
I don't really care how others feel if I'm killing them over and over, like dude you're playing a video game which is the last place I'll show any empathy. I used to get shit on all the time and I found that putting in a little effort to learn made pvp ten times more fun than just being a wet noodle that loses every battle.
---
Dude, you know the worst joke? In TBC the heal druids tree form. You wanna know what it can't use? Barkskin. It is a fucking tree that can't use barkskin.
---
if you want to be top dps and tank youll have to go fury tank
---
"i believe i can flyyy"
---
Holy cow...I see it too! (Moo)
---
Yep, soooo much fun. Most fun I've had in this game so far.
---
So much fun...
---
Thank you!
---
What’s wrong with leveling an alt? I want to play other classes too, and at this point it’s going to be mostly people rolling alt characters in the start zone
---
General taurenobi, you are a tall one.
---
Fury then Pror at 40?
---
Or
---
Fury then Arms at 40?
---
They'll be a thing soon enough. Level 19 twinks are some of the most theorycrafted characters out there.
---
Illegal don’t do this
---
*yet*
---
Good job we don't pay a monthly subscription for this, isn't it.
---
always funny to see these
---
That's it. That dude who /waved to you when it was just you and him 5 minutes ago? That'll be the bugger that initiates a fight when two more hostiles arrive.
---
And shamans make better use of night fall, what's your point?
---
Ogres in front of dire mail, I remember some being desperate, about level 55-58 I think
---
ahh
---
I did it first try. Stacked up on some buffs, used oil of immolation, holy water and holy nova rank 3 for skellys and two mana pots and a dark rune.
---
Nahh man, it is the Underground Battle Revenge Ship. Or UBRS for short.
---
'Team player' is code-word for sucking officer dick. There's plenty of people willing to do it, but they don't know there are guilds out there where this isn't required.
---
Yeah it was an honorable death, we will remember your name and sing songs about the brave gnome with a heart of a lion
---
That is if everyone is in the zone I think.
---
I remember having a 6th member in my ZF farm group and I still got full party XP (around 200xp per kill) of 5 while the 6th guy was outside just to reset for us.
---
You earned that one friendo
---
Every 15 seconds.
---
Uhhm, UBRS is in fact a 10 man dungeon.

---
Holy shit the insecurity here is profound
---
Horde lost at the arena, successfully defended Orgrimmar, and then no-one defended Stormwind.  Kromcrush was 52% Horde before the census addon was broken (it works again now, actually).
---
Ah never thought about that! Thank you
---
F
---
But the stonemasons are just setting killer robots loose on the fields of Westfall and building a massive ship inside a cave (???). Meanwhile Reginald Windsor gets beef with a particular noble and just walks through the city to punch her in the fucking face, despite being the only one who knows she's actually a dragon.   
---
Whatever they're hoping to accomplished with their killer robots it's pretty safe to say their efforts are seriously misdirected when a single guy with a purpose can put an end to noble who ensured the masons weren't paid.
---
Same on Gandling EU
---
I didn’t know if the warlock wanted money.. or you know something more sexual..
---
Get 32 pumpers
---
The signs have been there all along with ret's crap dps and no taunt
---
You are trolling me now... what am I insecure about exactly?
---
The opposite faction just sits there in a group of 3 to 5 near all the good emissary quests if the daily is in their zone. I still play with war mode on because I’ve played a few weeks of BfA total so far and it helps with catch-up.
---
hey man, fuck the horde :)
---
Thanks for the tips!
---
VW can hold aggro on a fully dotted mob just fine if you go 3/3 Improved Voidwalker.  This lets you fear and fully dot a second mob.  You can easily chain pull in this way and only have to stop once you have life tapped to near death.
---
Affliction seems to be a popular leveling spec which causes VW to be unable to hold aggro on 3 dots (let alone 4 once you get Siphon Life).
---
Good to know, thank you!
---
Arms for levling.
---
They are 52-54 and I already tried them, only 500-600exp

His name is Hugh Hoofner, a play on Hugh Hefner, a man known for living in the playboy mansion and surrounding himself with hoes.  This male tauren is being followed by four female tauren.

---
&gt; I was responding to you and to “clever_reference “ (I put his name in quotes instead of prefacing it with u/ because I am not trying to invoke another asshole back into this thread, two is enough) thinking you were the same person since you both were talking about tech literacy but you joined into the conversation later so I thought you had to be the densest person ever, now I realize it was two different users and now it makes sense where the misunderstanding on what the argument was about.
---
Yes I do that all the time.
---
&gt; We both agree that the most efficient way to share screenshots to Reddit is from the same computer you are playing WoW on. No argument there. My argument was, there are easily imaginable SITUATIONS where it would be quicker for someone to take a picture from their phone and upload it to Reddit, than from the computer they were playing WoW on.
---
No disagreement here.
---
&gt; Imagination plays a huge role in ANY industry, even if you are an assembly line worker (in fact there are plenty of examples of people starting at the ground floor and working their way up, and their experience on the ground floor gave them insight that those that proceeded them at the top lacked) The onus is on you.
---
"Imagination" is probably not the word you're looking for here. You probably want the word "creative".
---
&gt; UX design can pay more handsomely than a senior engineering role and vice versa. What you are paid depends on lots of factors.
---
There is a lot of overlap and UX can pay respectable but Software engineer has a higher cap.
---
&gt; The world is better off now that you are not involved in user experience, because you suck at putting yourself in others shoes, and lack empathy, but I am guessing the product you worked on tanked or suffered since you were the go to guy for that.
---
You wouldn't know if I was or wasn't good at putting myself in other people's shoes because I haven't been making any empathy based arguments. The only experience that is relevant to what I've been arguing is whether or not someone is tech literate enough. Sadly even if I was doing a mediocre job as a UX developer it would still be almost ten times better than what most companies end up doing. I could improve most products by just employing text book UX concepts. 
---
&gt; but I am guessing the product you worked on tanked or suffered 
---
You guessed wrong! Good job! Add that to the huge pile of things you've been wrong about so far.
---
wraeclast is a harsh and unforgiving pla... oh wait, wrong subreddit.

It's all good, man. You aren't alone.

I hit up the guild officer and in other words told me to fuck off and he doesn’t care
---
Hello fellow Swiss army knife! I just dinged 60 a few days ago and your experience at 40 is still the same experience I get here. I primarily tank but then switch in and out of form when the situation calls for it. Also been soloing ST to get the pre-raid BiS shoulders for tank and gloves for heals. Lotsa things Druids can do solo thanks to our versatility.
---
Yeah I'd be certain on warriors that tranq would be better, but rogues get to double dip on AP and crit so I'd think it might be more even.
---
Its pretty nice to have at least one lvl 60 even if you prefer to reroll at least you can always fall back to that one when need be for gold, carry, or pvp.
---
Who would waste money on reddit gold? Such a weird concept.
---
Whenever I manage to load the game and get to the Firemaw I got dc after few minutes...
---
These names look familiar, by chance are you on Benediction-US?
---
Why is renew trash? I see people saying that all the time but never with any explanation.
---
Except the OP picture is literally hard to read because of all the camera artifacts and the angle.
---
Lvl as arms, just throw a shield on when tanking dungeons, get 60 become a tank and go prot, get your mitigation gear so you can start raiding then find a nice guild that understands the value of having a high threat producing fury tank and is willing to agreeing that you should get priority stealing dps classes most wanted items pissing half the guilds dps off, then swap over to fury/prot spec and go ham.
---
To visualize the current available gear and what you should aim this is a google doc cheat-sheet

no soulstone in burning steppes

Your literally the best healer in the game

It must be nice to Bash a melee opponent of the opposing faction without seeing RESIST.

Seriously, fuck orc racial.

Thats contrary to what another poster wrote. What kind of error text did it read? What happened?

Sweet you beat a rogue as a Druid and then swam away
---
*Assertion of dominance intenSiFiEs”

Same here dude

We need to know man. Please...
---
Looking for a class that is fun to play with a high skillcap in both PvE and PVP. Im really interested in warlocks but Im worried about a 1 button rotation. I just want stuff to do. Banishing sounds cool but idk. Can an experienced lock tell me whats fun in raiding about locks?
---
I would not start your own guild. It’s a LOT of work. Being at that lvl I would try to find a new leveling guild and make some new friends.
---
Actually the biggest reason I went horde. Having bash resisted vs rogue is a death sentence
---
I get disconnected at "logging into game server", deleted addons and cache, when it did not help, deleted and reinstalled the game too. anyone has the same problem? trying to log into EU servers using Mac.
---
Well, that is gold. Just not the spending kind.
---
Use either shift modifier to cancel or just macro the cancelaura Iceblock on any other ability (polymorph or fireblast out of IB)
---
&gt;Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the First War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps?
---
Do you know what was special about Durotan and Doomhammer, arguably the most respectable orcs of the first war? When they were offered demons blood to drink, they said no. That's all it took. 
---
Also Kil'jaeden who was influencing Gul'dan who was in charge of the Horde was **effectively missing**, and had no influence on them after they had succesfully taken Shattrath. Kil'jaedens beef was with the Draenei, he didn't give two fucks about Azeroth. Medivh (read: Sargeras) gave Gul'dan a call in a vision telling him he could just open a portal to Azeroth so the Orcs could go rampant again, which was the only way to keep them united. And so they built the portal and ran through solely on the promise of more bloodshed, the Legion only providing the means to do so. At this time there was no longer any manipulation, they knew what they were getting both when they drank Kil'jaedens gift and when they built the portal Medivh told them they could use.  
---
Once defeated and in internment camps, the vast majority of the Alliance wanted to put them all to the sword. A single influencial king, Terenas II, lobbied massively for the orcs to be spared even after it caused the Alliance to fracture and several of the Seven Kingdoms to leave it behind and lose all faith in him. The Alliance at the time of the First War, which was founded primarily by Terenas II, was the single largest unification of the Seven Kingdoms since the ancient empire of Strom that fractured 3.000 years earlier, and he threw it out the window to spare the lives of alien invaders that would willingly corrupt their entire race to enhance their bloodlust boners. Then the spirit of a vengeful orc stole the soul of the kings only son and heir, manipulating him into stabbing his father in the face and destroy his entire kingdom overnight.
---
You really think the incompetence of Garithos undoes such selflessness?
---
yeah. it's why I was able to kill this particular demon a few days ago for another hunter (who is actually on the quest) for an easy 50g.
---
You play to have fun, if u think you will have more fun on another class then go for it! Its still early on
---
reroll homie
---
Take a break .
---
Did you ever find a workaround or mod that allows this?
---
I've got a piece of gear that ugly as sin, and would like to look like something else (just on the client side).
---
There's really no way to do this?
---
You’ll be arms tanking with two hands till 50 (ravager axe trust me). Then around 55 once you start collecting hit gear fury prot (dual wield fury prot 5/31/15 talent tree go parry in arms, defense, armor and threat in defensive) will be viable for most everything till raids. Then just put on a shield and rock out. Enjoy topping dps
---
Weird. I can recall dueling at low levels and getting spammed by melee people running behind me constantly not allowing my cast to go off.
---
Conductor going absolutely ham
---
Dragonfang down cant login
---
Alliance pros: 
---
Blizzard spent way more time on their cities, aesthetic, etc. way better visual experience imo. 
---
Horde: to counterac the lack of time to develop horde side of things and the expected rush of people picking alliance, they made their leveling progression easier. Better located hubs and dungeons. 
---
At 60 though ally is better
---
&gt;you can jack off to yourself when someone ganks you and still be done in time to kill them
---
Never played a lock. This changed my mind after 10 years.
---
Not at all, how ridiculous. This is in no way gambling.
---
You cant.
---
It's not dps gear... the item is for healing and damage. I think you are severly confused.
---
Yes. Significantly so.
---
Huh, I'd been wondering why people seemed to swap to cock and AE for AoE once they get some gear. TIL.
---
You can't bump on Reddit. That isn't how it works.
---
First pvp kill?
---
step 1 - get 60
---
step 2 - get gear
---
step 3 - MEaM sPEcK
---
google icy veins arms leveling guide
---
Fucking looooooooooooooool
---
So how about resto druid / fury warrior ? 
---
I sometimes really wish i have rolled horde, I guess i will never experience that windfury joy.
---
That’s not necessarily true though. Layering was meant to prevent overcrowding in early leveling zones when the servers opened. As time goes on, some people will level faster than others causing a natural spread among players and decreasing the need for layers. Obviously people have quit since classic launched but I don’t think it’s nearly as dramatic as people make it out to be.
---
Precasting abolish poison because you know he is gonna blind you.
---
You outplayed him hard.
---
warcraft logs.
---
My guild uses it to track everything. 
---
No idea how to set it up tho.
---
I farmed those for a few days for pumpkin bags, as a hunter super easy. Viper sting to drain there mana and if you haven’t drained there mana enough and they start healing you scatter shot to interrupt. Voila no more heals and easy kills.
---
People would drag that abom into town in duskwood! What's his name, patches? Plus there were more epic leashing back in the day, I just don't remember the world boss names
---
But I thought you wanted no changes? In vanilla the servers could barely handle 40v40 in open world.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZzrikYqTM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDZzrikYqTM) 
---
Here, the server would regularly crash with a high concentration of people in one place.
---
Win an AB 2000 to 1990. Personally hold a flag in WSG for more than 30 minutes straight. Kill enemy faction leaders. Collect all BoE epics.
---
Except this guy is an orc male.
---
Is it unique and you already have one? It wont show you in that case.
---
General rule for gold farm is pservers are irrelevant. Lashed farm is nowhere near as good. Pickpocket isn’t as good. There’s no real crazy money farm. Best way right now it’s dm East jump runs with 3. De everything that doesn’t sell. Sell herbs. Vendor expensive drops. Mine the thorium. What I’ve seen is the DE drops is about 8-10 gold per run. (I got 5 illusion dust, 2 large shards and 8 dream dust). Gray drops total is probably 5-6g at least if you do the lasher packs. Herbs is probably 5g. And then whatever drops on top but that’s probably 20g a run 100 hour split 3 ways 33g each without luck.
---
We're getting conflicting info, can tou give some details how how or what you did?
---
If you're on a pvp server go arms
---
dont go prot until ~58 if you want to tank
---
It might be under the group loot "need before greed. That makes it so you can only roll on items for your class. Does this happen every time or just the 1 instance?
---
Then why join a guild? Just pug if this is how you want to play the game. I play the game to have fun with old friends, and to make new ones as well as have fun killing monsters and working together. A big part of being a guild is the social aspect, if you don't want to be a part of that it's fine, but don't be surprised when someone else who helps people get attuned / farms consumes / and over all contributes more to the guild gets invited or geared first.
---
Aaand that would be an exploit, called Safespotting, so, kinda invalid.
---
I am confused, but I think we agree
---
You don’t get layered unless you join a group. You’re just unlucky with respawns.
---
“bad at pvp” 
---
Yeah, sure buddy 😉
---
If we're doing anecdotal evidence, I got one. I've played mostly solo on the most busy EU server. (golemag) And this has never happened to me.
---
Should have held onto it for when twinking is a thing.
---
Orgrimmar is literally a metropolitan refuge camp.
---
I'm perfectly fine socializing with people inside the game. That doesn't mean I want to hop on some Discord channel and talk endlessly about things that go beyond the game itself just to be a "team player". OP seems to think not using Discord for more than raid time is somehow a sin.
---
While I levelled with a Premade hybrid Melee/Heal shaman I can tell you that full arms with 2hand weapon can tank everything until at least lv50 (which is where I am at right now) while topping dps on every pull with 2-4 mobs. 
---
Get your hands on the warrior lv30 Quest weapon as fast as possible (try get some high lv help to get it early), and the whirlwind procc axe from SM armory (it's amazing for aoe).       
---
My standard rotation is (if I know I won't add additional groups): Charge in(stance+mark skull+charge macro), use sweeping strikes, switch to bersi stance, whirlwind, switch to deffstance, spam cleave and taunt strugglers.
---
The wow story tells us no, but who knows
---
The dungeons? Yes, in 1.10 BRD, Strat and Scholo were reduced to 5 cap while Blackrock Spire was reduced to 10 cap.
---
BRD, Strat, Scholo and LBRS were still meant for standard 5-man parties, even at launch, though. At launch, there simply *was* no cap on people in instances, and when they decided to add the 10 cap (15 for BRS) in 1.3, they made it 10 so people used to doing those dungeons with more weren't going to feel alienated by the change. Dire Maul launched with a 5 cap because no one would be used to running it with more since it was new, and because that's just how it (and the others) were intended to be run.
---
Strat, Scholo and LBRS weren't balanced for 10 people, they were balanced to be challenges for 5 people and people just took the opportunity to circumvent the challenges. When improved gear was added in 1.10, they reduced the cap to 5 people so the challenge couldn't be circumvented at all (not to mention the challenege had been heavily dampened by powercreep).
---
Hes the easiest one though
---
I can't log in to Golmagg.  Loading bar gets 3/4 of the way up and just freezes.
---
Ashbringer EU, same problem, many players
---
Westfall here as well. I only get an invite once a day or so. But I’m not max level yet.
---
Its best in slot main hand for 29 rogue twinks. Going to be worth a good chunk come phase 2/3
---
Fucking spammy asshole...
---
Nobody fucking cares about your fucking channel, dickhead. This sub isn't intended to promote your stupid shit.
---
Best is 2 man jump runs. You do them in 12 mins if you’re geared and don’t need to split the loot 3 ways. Just need to be herb/mining combo. Third player makes it faster but who cares if you are capping?
---
Mining and alchemy, drop skinning on your rogue. 
---
Alchemy lets you save a load of money on potions and since your rogue can gather it pairs nicely. You can also produce arcanite every 2 days which will net you 5-10g per transmute for nice, passive cash flow. 
---
Leveling mining to 225 will net you a lot of the materials needed to get engineering and save you/make you some cash if you mine quickly. 
---
Don't get enchanting as recommended by toxic_ghoul: if you don't already have a bank alt that has enchanting, get one pronto and use it to dust items. Any level item can be disenchanted at lvl 1 enchanting, so it's a waste of a lvl 35 character.  
---
If you plan on permanently leaving your character at lvl 35 then mining isn't a great option and you might want to do leatherworking up until you get the salt shaker to make refined deeprock salt, or tailoring up until you can make mooncloth for more passive cash.
---
I don’t think you can get banned for doing it in a dungeon lol.
---
Low effort shitpost.

Pyrewood Village seems to work fine.

Most mobs have leashes. But I think the trick is to find the ones that do aoe dmg so guards can get Agro and will take over and the mob won’t disappear.
---
You guys should break off into smaller groups and host mc pugs.  With any kind of a decent core group it's ez 10/10 but each group can reasonably reserve the legendaries and mats and maybe even get away with a specific item or 2.
---
If you are close enough to your opponent you can cast on them but if he backs up it won't work for some spells. I don't know about root specifically
---
Safespotting is only disallowed when used in PvP scenarios in neutral towns to avoid guards. They basically just don't want people griefing each other without possible consequence.
---
Ya sick dude. Sorry trying to help other people and make content to help people play. Ya got me :D. Have a nice day
---
Right now is best time to raid. My guild clears MC in like 45-60 mins. No other raids except super quick onyxia.
---
invalid in what sense..?
---
No offense, but it sounds like the warlocks you face are dogshit. They can put curse of exhaustion on you and kite you for days. Sure you can intercept and interrupt now and then, but you hit like a wet noodle and warlocks have crazy heals.
---
Also, many warlocks play a spec where they get instant cast shadowbolt procs.
---
9 days of in-game playtime and I’m lvl 37 with less gold than my level. Brand new to WoW. Also having a blast every step of the way. Makes me wonder if Blizz underestimated the market of folks like us, but we’re probably firmly in the minority.
---
What can be in the coffers that is worth?
---
Tbf there are already a lot of brd pick pocket guides. Does this one offer *anything* different?
---
Spoiler, it burns down in the future
---
What kind of sites do you watch that on? There’s just so many
---
Get channel views some other way, asshole. 
---
If everyone else shitted up the sub like you, how wonderful would it be, do you think? I mean, you even referred to your fucking self in the post title. For cryin' out loud...
---
😂 PvP-pads will give you your confidence back!
---
Uhh...DMT?
---
&gt; Players may be experiencing latency or disconnections. We are investigating this now. #BlizzCS
---
https://twitter.com/BlizzardCSEU_EN/status/1189763002272235520
---
&gt; Does this one offer anything different?
---
It offers a way for this dickhead to try to increase his channel views by spamming the sub.
---
Nope, you can only hide cloak and head gear in Classic I'm, afraid. But hey, at last all of us look utterly ridiculous together.
---
3/4x but yeah. Which means people who are using wow tokens to pay for their subs are providing $20 instead of $15 each month to Blizzard, which is substantial.
---
Wouldn't surprise me, see it happen a lot.
---
Great video!
---
Yes. Mines more advanced and covers a lot of options
---
Getting repeated dc's too...
---
The part where he name's himself in the title is just classic. Like he's some famous streamer.
---
What a fucking chode...
---
Holy water is huge on that quest.
---
A deathcoil can waste at least 3 of those, and I'm pretty sure warriors don't generate rage against shields. Not to mention curse of exhaustion kiting.
---
Large and powerful both work. Also if you're running it as a hunter grab the lesser invisibility potions as well as the invisibility potions. They dont share a cooldown other than the 2 minute potion cooldown. It's great if you end up messing up and the larger invisibility potion is nice if you're finding it hard to make it up the ramp without aggroing the warlock reaver pack.
---
by a long shot, yeah. dunno why it was so hard for the dude.
---
Is that one of those vibrating swords you can buy from the sex shop in Goldshire or something?
---
Our guild just got their 8th Helm of wrath if i haven't lost count yet , We raid rolled it for vendor spec.
---
Had back to back double wrath drop last week and the one before, ridiculous.
---
No warlock, Rogue helms as of yet.
---
Whats the addon called?
---
I dont know about retail, but this is exactly what is my experience in classic. I have nothing PvE to do, so I just stand around alt tabbed until a guild run needs a healer (and nobody else in the guild who needs items is available) so I can help.
---
No LULW
---
My mate Home has a buis tank set as shaman and tanks UBRS regularly.
---
I’m in a guild... we’ve been clearing ony and MC for a month? So 6-7 onyxias and MC twice a week (4 clears 8 runs). 
---
I’ve gotten one item that nobody wanted. T1 mage shoulders. But that’s life.
---
&gt;Your guild's leadership sucks - if you're a part of that leadership, go look in a mirror
---
Dude tons of guilds dont have an official roster. You meet up with people, they become friends, they get in the guild, and you remember their name and they come to raid. 
---
&gt;Your loot council sounds like they're there to gear themselves and their friends
---
To me it seems like the "friends" are the 30something raiders and solid guildies he mentioned, so the LC looking to gear up the entire raid is a good thing.
---
Yep, same here.
---
As a fellow Resto Druid, yes.
---
I don't know why Rogues think they can gank us when we have Faerie Fire and Abolish Poison. Seeing the panic Vanish fails always brings a smile to my face .
---
Keep up the good work :)
---
That's hilarious.  "It's over Anakin".
---
Mining, bosses, vaults. Min maxing cooldowns
---
Yeah, I wish there were even moderately difficult raids in the game atm.
---
RNG is RNG. Just FYI I farmed Plugger 30ish times before seeing getting Shanker, and its drop rate is about 9%...
---
When you say 44 is the halfway point is that meaning that if 0-60 is 2 Billion XP that 0-44 is 1 Billion? Because if so you get much more XP per kill/quest at the higher levels, so I don’t think that’s a fair measurement. If the gains are taken into account then it makes sense, but it doesn’t seem as bad as that.
---
I have this setting on.  I don’t really notice it because No clicking the thing.
---
Yeah no downtime yet I don't kill things the fastest. But you can just switch out of cat every three or so guys then heal then go back to cat. Super easy
---
Looks like a similar issue like they had about a week or two ago.
---
Mage, just literally 1 button... frostbolt.
---
What is the number of players retail vs classic?
---
Or holy prot so he can tank or AoE farm:)
---
I mean, I did not play vanilla wow at all (well, I did til like lvl 30 and then I got bored) and I don't really get how anybody could wipe on rag. He has like...two mechanics? As long as you have DangerousBossMods installed it seems impossible to wipe, imo. The only reason could be if you don't have enough DPS to kill him before submerge, but that's on you for inviting people with bad gear.
---
&gt; Doesn't enjoy male to male butt stuff according the the barrens chat
---
Not really sure this is a pro
---
Again good luck going against the grain sure some people may give you ago but it’s not nearly the same as having a traditional wow tanks.
---
Margin for error is tiny, but it's easy once you've got it down.
---
Amateur shit, using vanish after Loregrain is 100% unnecessary, you can jump behind the statue to evade bug and restealth.
---
Thanks man!
---
Roll a new character, your main will still be there whenever you want to play it.
---
I'm almost positive that soul siphon works if the pet gets the last hit. There have been numerous times where it's procced for me when the last hit is clearly an orange number. This doesn't apply to other players, however, so if you're in a group only go for the drain soul if you've just sent a shadow bolt that is going to kill the mob.
---
then you didn't see much
---
When you have on your +healing gear does it say in the tool tips the addition or do you have to add that yourself?
---
And is there a set math I can use to determine that?
---
I have a speadsheet for every spell to get the heals per second and heals per mana.
---
Finally wow servers are dead. :&lt;
---
We're shaming them for using them wrong. Mongoose and the Agi elixir don't stack. You can make the icon show up, by drinking the mongoose first, but paying attention to your stay screen would reveal no additional plus agi is in effect. You're still just getting +25.
---
I agree with you
---
If you were for real, and you possibly could be. You might have personally have not tried it, but others did. I remember watching a video of a shaman tank Anub’Arak in ToC during Wotlk. I’ve personally also had shamans tank for me several dungeons in classic and other expansions too.
---
Your Warlock was high on the threat meter, the reason he/she took 3 direct fireballs is because if you have another player stacked on or near enough to get by the AOE effect of the fireball, it resets the threat of the player who took the secondary damage instead of Onyxia’s primary target.
---
It’s actually another method people are using to keep their tanks from losing threat as the result of a fireball, but my guild doesn’t want to do anything differently from what we are currently doing since we have the method I mentioned above clean enough to result in consistent one-shots with no deaths.
---
This video is 12 yo and is from BC. Not classic
---
Original vidéo https://youtu.be/CwVYncsjeqg
---
Nothings wrong. It’s just that don’t need the money and bags like a new player would.
---
I would be super down for classic continuing into TBC. Actually if they releases TBC servers right now I would ditch classic instantly (or just raidlog classic anyway).
---
I agree with you too
---
Yup! It's just that a lot of PvPers spend their time preparing for Phase 2. There's just so many things to do that can get you an edge in world PvP or otherwise. And nothing to fight for, really. I still kill some people for fun, but it feels bad killing completely unprepared people.
---
The other day I tried to find discussion about the new corrupted items system but there was almost nothing but garbage like shitty birthday cakes and Sylvanas memes on like the first 5 pages (this sub is swiftly heading into that direction too).
---
*The age old question: If a legendary drops and none one is streaming, does it still get clipped?*
---
While so many streamers have ironfoe for example, they are also getting “no roll loot carried” by their fans on a lot of runs with no competition. The grass seems greener because they have the videos of their garden of gear
---
raiding wouldn't be a problem as long as you have everything you need bound to something, but PvP would be nigh impossible without binding keys around movement buttons so that you can do movement, spells, and looking around simultaneously. 
---
I don't see the problem with binding sit, although to me 'x' is a valuable button :D
---
There is a chance for "big sack of coins" inside the coffer.. I've seen them as high as 5 G.
---
Also greys inside sell quite nicely
---
....but it's a neutral transport
---
A couple nice pieces from quests are the ring Blood of the Martyr and the off hand Penelope’s Rose. The staff Argent Crusader is maybe even better depending on what the rest of your gear is like.
---
Best PVP items come from PVE. And some BIS PVE items come from PVP. So u got to find a balance. 
---
Suggest forming a squad of like-minded folks in the guild to do pvp once BGs come out.
---
Moreso Krol is MH only and Brut has higher top-end, so tossing it in the offhand is silly vs. just using a Mirah's Song offhand with Brut mainhand for bigger sinister strikes.
---
Make an alt andbpkay it then give the gold to the first higher level person that offers help on something
---
In raids, yes, in dungeons... no
---
*uses a Peashooter to knock off your tinfoil hat*
---
Riggity rekt
---
also shield spikes are generally better lol
---
The real hardcore allies play on Bigglesworth where we sometimes dont even have 4 people in any given zone
---
According to YouTube the earth is also round.  They're matters of speculation... Not visual evidence of something happening
---
That's a shame...well, thanks for the info.
---
Felt the same way for a while. Not tired of my class, but just out of things to do. I started a mage but couldn't find the motivation to play it for a while. Eventually I got around to playing it, and got it from 10-24 in a couple of days now. I think the important thing is to do things that you consider fun - not just things that you feel like you should be doing. I usually just kept on farming gold for no reason and that got me bored of the game entirely. Try to set some goals for yourself and work towards them. I never got bored until I ran out of goals.
---
What addon shows the rogues cooldowns?
---
They never said that because that's not how they set up the game. Each layer is an entire copy of Azeroth.
---
How does the whole Phase 2 even work on a PvE server? Hmm...
---
Thats not how raid lockouts work but sure thing Alex Jones.
---
I still prefer this one as it hasn't been flair astroturfed.
---
Most classes can kill 3 mobs at once. I wouldn’t call that aoe farming though
---
This goes both ways. The core players often get very comfortable keeping among themselves. It's pretty hard to get access as a new member.
---
Maybe, as an officer, it would be wise to actively invite the unknown guys to your dungeon farming runs instead of running Dire Maul with the same 5 people over and over again.
---
You know, team-building excercises.
---
Judging by the amount of people posting phone pics instead of screenshots I can confirm 100% !
---
Okay either we are misundertsanding each other or Im wrong. If you buy token for gold and trade it for blizz balance how much you get? 15 dollar right? But how much does the token cost? Isnt it like 50 or smth?
---
If you use details! damage meter you can select buffs. If you hover over a person's buffs number it'll show you a breakdown of which buffs they've used. It should show you who has buffed underwater breathing, water walking, detect invisibility, etc.  However it won't show you who they've used them on.
---
Yes and no. Yes its viable compared to Ret Leveling, no its not even close to what a Mage can pull off.
---
Leveled with a „Thorns“ AoE Build (Full Prot, no Consecration) from 40-52 (Then respec to heal) and it was, again, not much slower than Ret.
---
Biggest difference to Mages is not even the damage but that you NEED to get hit by all the mobs. So there is a sweet spot of 3-8 Mobs where &lt; 3 you generate to few procs and &lt; 8 you head gets smashed in.
---
At 40 go full Prot with Salvation and Reck and Holy Shield, Shield spike from a Blacksmith, Fiery Enchant (if you want) and in later levels get Consecrate.
---
Only pull melee mobs and then just juggle judgeing and buffing Wisdom/Light and keep Holy Shield up. Switch targets around a bit so that they all die roughly at the same time. The less mobs you got on you (&lt; 3) the slower your kill spoed gets.
---
Thats for leveling.
---
For Endgame farming (Lashers in DM:E for eg.) thats also the best Pally spec. And there are many great items in Endgame Dungeons to support this (Nagelring, Shield from Rammstein, ...). So „Ok-Good“ as Level spec from 40 onwards and „Great“ as farm-spec later on :)
---
Yes there is always variance. I'm just saying GMs can spawn certain items if they choose to. The streamers know that which is why they often call out what they want and hope maybe a GM that is watching takes pity.
---
Because I personally do not find it fair that someone can get a 400g+ item cause they were the correct class when the item dropped. 
---
I wouldn't have equipped it if I won either way. I would've sold it.
---
Dominated. Nice clip!
---
Is everyone in this thread taking the piss about Shamans like Australians do about Dropbears. I never levelled Horde in classic/vanilla so I literally have no idea but how the buggerdly fuck can they tank.
---
Blizzard!  Don't tell me how to feel!
---
Didn't know that thx for the tip.
---
I think you're correct. My bad!
---
I am pretty sure I could decimate you in any competitive game requiring strategy, fast reaction and skill. Still, as I get older I prefer to kick ass and have fun than kick ass just a little bit harder but waste much more time than it is worth and stick with dicks like you =)
---
It's just a shame that Blizzard couldn't manage to do with the gnomes what they did with the goblins. Almost everyone loves goblins. They're ridiculous as hell, yet they're still pretty cool. 
---
But gomes are pure goofy comedic relief from the ground up.
---
I, as a giant buff Tauren, am stuck with this shitty teal robe for over a year now until I can finally get it replaced...by another ugly teal robe that will last for another 6 months. 
---
I accepted to live with it and bought a giant pink shirt for full bad taste mode and just swap through roles when out of raid to get some variety. 
---
It is fucking, fucking ugly, but I prefer when you can tell peoples equip by simple item looks instead of having every single character from a class looking exactly the same way with stupid transmogs. Who wants to see every warriors shit sword suddenly look like Thunderfury.
---
And they don't need to.
---
Well if you are a healer you should know why there are healing differences on the meters, but here is my take.
---
Basically it all stems from the problem that the current content is very easy and I would say especially easy for healers.
---
So this leads to the fact that the only thing to actually do as a healer is to try to top the healing meters. There is no actual threat of losing an encounter so people play for the healing meters so they just spam fastest heals. And using consunables is entirely not needed, but when you do they boost your meters tremendously without actually doing anything. One raid I used a potion and Dark Rune at the end of Garr when we were cleaning up last add to heal a bunch of people and it looked really nice on the healing meters, but it did nothing actually.
---
I have seen all people in the raid be top or bottom healers. It sort of just depends who bothered to try to win the meters this time.
---
The current content is so easy the healing performance seems entirely impossible to judge. The only thing that would worry me if somebody is constantly dead last over multiple raids with massive overhealing then they might be just bad.
---
That would be Omnibar Classic
---
Go tactical mastery of you want tank while level, this is only requirement not for group but for quality of life. Depend what your role at end games, full prot if you are MT at 60, if not go fury/prot tank if offtank.
---
I was there! By far the most fun I've had on classic so far. And when 300+ horde immediately turned and successfully kicked down King Varian's door after defeating the ally invasion. I was cheering with my friends on discord the entire time!
---
Tried as I may, I wasn't able to do this in GSM; however, I was able to do this with simple macros.  The GSM would only process the macro one line at a time, thus why it's called "Gnome Sequence Manager".  The simple Macros will run the entire sequence with one button press.  
---
It is a total of 2 macros.  One to Stealth into and switch weapons to Dagger MH; and the other to Ambush and switch to Sword MH after the Ambush attack.  Put your weapons in the MH and OH slots.  It doesn't matter where as these macros will do the rest of the work for you.  The first macro went as follows:
---
Macro Name:  *Stealth - Dagger*
---
/equipslot 16 ***\*Weapon Name(Dagger)***
---
/equipslot 17 ***\*Weapon Name(Sword)***
---
/cast Stealth
---
Macro Name:  *Ambush - Sword*
---
/cast Ambush
---
/equipslot 16 ***\*Weapon Name(Sword)***
---
/equipslot 17 ***\*Weapon Name(Dagger)***
---
Place the ***Stealth-Dagger*** macro icon on your bar where your Stealth button is.  This will change your weapons prior to going into Stealth and putting the dagger into the mainhand.  Place the  ***Ambush-Sword*** macro icon on your bar where you want the Ambush button to be while in Stealth, and it will immediately swap your Sword to your mainhand and the dagger to your offhand after the Ambush attack.  
---
Mind you, once you go into Stealth, if you come out at any time without using the Ambush attack, it will not do the weapon swap.  What I do to correct this is to make a 3rd macro that does the weapon swap when I press the Auto-Attack icon on my bar.
---
You can of course use any attack just by changing the "/cast ***\*Name***" in the macros above.
---
I've tested this out extensively tonight and works like a charm.
---
What threat exactly? You are missing half of your attacks with a sword, not enough hit, no ony neck or threat items for some reason cos of a 1000g sword that looks cool as an orc instead of better weapons, or dualwield fury prot spec.
---
Our main tank got garr binding first week, geddon binding 3rd week, RNG is RNG.
---
Two months in and I just dinged 47.  
---
I have lots to do still.
---
PvE only lasts so long every week. (By that I mean my guild has MC down to under 2.5 hours, BWL should take around 3 once people get in there and start farming it)
---
There's MANY MANY more hours to farm PvP.
---
21 days /played, 13 at max. Nope.
---
I think it's funny that the songs are all from the vanilla period too. We sure love our nostalgia/not moving on with life here at Classic WoW.
---
I got it at 52 on my second run ;)
---
cool thanks will give it a go when i hit 60 or closer to it
---
For some reason, the warrior who brought it from 1k Needles got it to follow him after he killed its boar. Not really sure why, but that's how it happened.
---
Isn't the entire point of those Rhok'Delar bosses to kite them around?
---
Rogues are everywhere on PvP servers. One of the most played classes, along with warrior amd mage.
---
It's made and run by flying fucking racoons, dude.
---
This
---
Splat
---
I orgasmed so hard at Abolish Poison at 1:10. Good job sir!
---
This video makes me wanna abandon my rogue and re-roll druid -.-
---
if you do end up in Zandalari Tribe realm aliance, you can contact me and i can give you few tips on the game :)
---
Using your transmute cooldown on Arcanite is a waste when you can farm out furbolg rep to get Earth &gt; Water and make 10g every day. There's very little value in alchemy for making potions as typically raw herbs sell for more than the non rare potions.
---
You actually can still do that, just download iMorph
---
What about your hit chance threat-master ?
---
or warlock or priest or druid!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Look up iMorph, not technically allowed by Blizzard
---
But i've been using similar programs for like 5-6 years, without even recieving a warning
---
Last update: We got him into the Valley of Spirits, but couldn't move him further than a few yards each time. So we gave up. I'm not sure how long this kept happening, but his bot ghost would run from wherever (Crossroads I think) and rez in Org, immediately try to rez his pet, then attack the guards and die. This happened for probably an hour before we all left.
---
That to just do a roll at the first shard and whoever wins auto gets the next 39
---
Yeah, dwarves can hold liquor like a hordy.
---
Yea I’d say to go by what the game tells you and not the add on. If it’s not available yet then it’s not available yet, check the rank you’re looking for in the “unavailable” section and that will tell you what level you get next rank at. 
---
Also make sure that you’re at the right priest trainer instead of a low level one like in the starting zones.
---
Then why are you here?
---
You could always just...leave.
---
Fucking REKT
---
&gt; Pick what's fun for you, don't be the billionth brainless guide follower.
---
But this streamer said there's only 2 professions in the game! Alchemy and engineering!
---
(To echo your statement, do what is interesting. Engineering is INCREDIBLE because of the shield which REQUIRES engineering, beyond that whatever is fun)
---
Not exactly that's only two of them. What I meant was that once you activate him on his patrol route he's locked where you did it for 15 minutes before despawning. So you could never move him to BRM to fuck with people. You could kite him there, but chances are you'd die from the cleaners taking him somewhere with so many people.
---
&gt; Any high pop server got at least 30 guilds going to blackrock every wednesday.  
---
This sentence just proves that you have no idea what you are even watching, smileyface
---
They are mentioned as tanks in Blizzard's official guide, so it must be true.
---
Dont bother with immolate its a waste of mana :)
---
Depends what you need. If you have the time and interest in mining you can make a killing if you develop a good route and farm at the right times. If you want more passive gathering keep your herbalism. 
---
Alchemy transmutes can net you 10g/day, Cured Rugged hides 20g/3 days.
---
BRO THAT WAS THE MOST CLUTCH CRIT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MA LIFE
---
...no, it isnt. A low skill floor means that something is easily played by a low skill player. a high skill floor would be something that needed a high amount of skill to play proficiently.
---
Pagle is pve and has a healthy population.
---
Ive played on and off since vanilla and have not seen that once.
---
But i redeemed it for 500 rub and it costs 2k rub on bnet :(
---
Literally just cleared a full BRD run with a shaman tank....0 wipes. Easy
---
Essentially, because of too many players flooding all or certain areas at the launch of a new server, they break it into layers. It's basically multiple versions of the same world, so that all players won't run into eachother and fight for the same monsters, ore veins, herbs etc. If you are in one layer and your buddy is in another, you won't see eachother or the same monster spawns etc until you are in the same party, in which case the person who gets invited gets moved to the same layer as the other person. 
---
Now that most servers have been up for a long time, they have gradually removed layers on most servers, meaning all players can run into each other in any given area.
---
&gt; I know and I've seen those rare, super rare bamfs who tank, don't lose agro and still top DPS charts. 
---
&gt; How do I achieve this?
---
You achieve this by annoying the fuck out of your 5-man healers for personal amusement reasons.
---
If your self-esteem is higher than that of a lemming, strap on a shield and tank. Later on you can go fury/prot for the beginning and do (almost) everything.
---
ah ok, the server keeps crashing but i guess everyone has a slow morning =)
---
How do you zoom out so far on your character?
---
For anyone doing this particular demon. Some advice. 
---
To the south of this video a bit is a burnt fallen over tree. What you want to do is jump on the very point of the tree so the demon runs all the way around to the end and as he does that light him up jump off and repeat
---
Pug bad
---
If it's an engine limitation it's due to being played over a Legion client. But aye, if you're not going to chip in for the added server capacity you'd most likely have to spend money to change something fundemental in the engine.
---
F for old school vanilla city raids. Wont work in classic, aint working in retail.
---
You should have had no issue with threat before the 8 piece. Have you tried getting hit?
---
what would the rotation on the fury prot be???
---
iirc, there's like 3 abilities that just get rotated?
---
Reserve legendaries and use some sort of dkp system for the rest.  Loot council is for hardcore guilds and nothing but a trainwreck for average ones. Dkp is preferable to free roll to me because it allows raiding to feel rewarding and gives a sense of progression even if you get no loot in a specific run.
---
Seriously don't do loot council idk why people ever suggest that.  If your guild was a guild that should be doing loot council you wouldn't be asking reddit.  
---
As for how to distribute the legendaries do ehatever you want but I suggest thunderfury to your mt first.  For things like the staff you can do a pseudo loot council or literally just poll the core members of your guild and see who they think deserves it.
---
That’s correct however, it’s more the overall attitude of the guild that I’m after. Pvp has a priority over pve stuff. 
---
That’s why I’m toying with the idea of making my own guild.
---
So considering repair costs + vendoring + AH sales, what was the actual profit/hour in the end?
---
That's great to hear tbh with Truesilver being around vendor price 😀
---
The remove stun part is just outrageous
---
What's the fish rate on that 1?
---
King's honor, friend.
---
Well im saying, if you got gud, youd be killing princess, thus have profitable farms.
---
Oh I thought there was a healbot plug-in. I’m familiar with this one. Good site but I prefer my own sheets! Thanks!
---
This hurts to watch
---
It turns loot into a minigame where people compete against each other to make maximally efficient use of their DKP. Which is fun for some people, but inevitably inefficient as well.
---
This is the best one, it's the best way to test who's nice by far.
---
If you do the bag stuff, ask the people if they're twinks first tho. They usually swim in bags/gold already and I'd prefer real new players to hand bags to.
---
Shamans have rockbiter weapon which generates bonus threat on attack as well as earth shock which generates massive threat. Rockbiter is never used past getting windfury and earth shock is used in moderation, usually at rank 1 solely to interrupt casting due to its insane threat generation. 
---
It's definitely not optimal, but it is also definitely possible to tank as shaman.
---
Its purple and cool dude... This game is very old, it doesnt matter.
---
Yeah ill give it a try, i know you can get deleted things back. A buddy of mine was LANing for our raid last week and left his account logged in and came back to a naked character and his Sinew for Rok Dalar deleted and blizz restored it lol
---
So bizarre to me.... First time playing WoW, only level 26, and already thinking about 'grinding' and 'BiS' lol. Back when I first started in Vanilla, none of this was even on my mind. I was just enjoying the game :/
---
I feel like all these 'guides' etc online ruin such a big part of the experience :(
---
mt = main tank
---
Bloodfang down too
---
I actually left a raidimg guild because of the bullshit EPGP system, if none of our class wanted to spend our points on a useless t1 item it would just be DE’d instead of letting us free roll for it.
---
Don’t get fucked by EPGP, they may say it’s for the good of the guild progression but you may not see an item for a longgggg time if people just hoard points
---
Servers are being restarted.
---
MT -&gt; Main Tank

G O T O R E T A I L
---
I would rather bubble &gt; renew /and Greater heal on emergencies than to flash heal all the way. Bubble is instant cast so at least it absorbs some damage for renew / Greater heal to kick in.
---
Dispel Magic would like a word with you
---
Another greatly exaggerated "farming guide"
---
Wowhead says fishing in Thunder Bluff  has a .13% droprate, I've never seen it.
---
It almost looks like his first frostbolt is richochet off your IB into the bird.
---
simpleframes or woahframes I think
---
Damnnnnn.... What class are you?
---
People say that, but I never witnessed that inefficiency honestly. I dont think I ever saw an item get unused if it is a slight upgrade for somebody. Somebody will decide to pick those up for a low price.
---
Unfortunately, this was an issue in old wow. It wasn't till later they attempted to fix hunter pet threat issues. You can setup a macro to MD your pet whenever it's up and let loose, dumping all the additional threat to him
---
Most or full? I assume you are lock so just focus on dungeons which drops your pre raid bis gear.. And visit ah to get those greens with + SP 😂
---
Plus the pattern for Robe of the Archmage drops in lbrs if you don’t wanna pay the 50g for it.
---
No, it's the job of a guild to gear me up! It would take me ages to finish otherwise! /facetious
---
People keep bashing loot council here... while it is a shit system I always scoff at those that prefer DKP like it's incorruptible and fairer.
---
You are deluding yourself if you think that. DKP can actually be worse than loot council in this regard, a shrewd bastard of a GM can game it so DKP is awarded more to their friends. 
---
Let's apply OPs paradigm to DKP. Ok, OP wants team players right? He could make it so team players get bonus DKP for say... helping friends get pre BIS gear, a small bonus to Discord use, doing things for officers. You can even treat it like it's behind closed doors as to see foul play you gotta take your time to audit the raid leaders.
---
At the end of the day this is a result of a piss poor amount of loot dropping for 40 people. No matter the system you use, if you want loot to go where it needs to you have to be unfair about it. You have to give it to friends, people who scratch your back, people who have guarantees they will stick to your 40 man raid...
---
It's shitty that the game forces raids to be like that.
---
Same.  Except my dungeon only priest alt  is slowly  creeping up in levels.  Already 32 lol
---
I play an alliance warrior and I’ve always loved the class but it’s really never going to shine in 1v1. Even getting the drop with charge immediately into zerker’s stance (not getting caught off-guard) a Pvp specced lock is not going to be an easy kill even if they’re one of the classes I fear less vs say a mage who I should practically never win against. Squishy pve lock is another story, but at least on alliance side you gotta realize we have little means of resetting at all against a horde lock since they can either break fear or have very high stun resist and we can’t bandage with DOTs rolling and we only have the one fear break for 10s. COE is still something. I definitely have felt stronger vs locks in other expansions than vanilla 
---
And no we don’t generate rage against shields so VW sac is a pretty big advantage there. 
---
I like Pvp a lot in group settings but I’m not the best out there 1v1 by any means but that’s my opinion
---
Survival hunter here. Only way for my pet to hold aggro is to send him to target, and then wait a few seconds before i start auto. But still i will get the aggro at the end if i dont pause my auto. Guess my pet is not doing enough damage or is not scaling well enough with my agility. I dont know.
---
You need to step up your (knowledge of the ) game brother, or your guild will fall apart before Xmas....
---
We once took everyone and stood inside the corpse, just so no one would do the shame-kneel looting animation and be embarrassed.
---
Also kiting ashenvale dragons to Orgrimmar
---
Looks like they just removed most buffs, no more mow or blessings, or auras. And the pet thing, mages and dks can have permanent pets, but it was also about the npcs that start following you on some zones. Having a companion was kinda unique for hunters and locks while leveling, but if everyone has their own fan club quest giver running after them its not.
---
My bank is generally for storing items ready to sell, but won't right now because of the absurdly cheap prices currently. Got some BoE blue items in there that should be selling for like 30-50g but instead there are 'tards undercutting each other over and over again to the point where it's only 8g now. I'd rather keep it as long as it takes rather than sell it for scraps.
---
Also a bag slot for odd bits and pieces that might be useful at some point. Weird trinkets etc.
---
says attention all tanks advertising a shield enchant but druid tanks don't use shields so he's saying they aren't tanks

Main tank
---
Apparently Blind counts as a Ranged attack -.- only reason I had it was for extra stam for pvp...now it's at some vendor in UC
---
I don’t think anyone really cares
---
Yea but it's pathetic. This stuff should never see the light of day.
---
Or knives
---
Selling tank runs isnt bad, but you cant be too greedy. Some guys want all drops, even upgrades for people. Though there will still be people who say, "thats ridiculous, anyways, back to being LFG for a tank for another hour!"
---
But apart from actually selling runs, just running stuff nets pretty good gold. I just bought my epic mount and all I basically did was run dungeons. Unless you wipe a lot and/or have terrible luck with greens/blues, youll likely make like 10-20g a run. You can consider that bad if you want, but if you do something like DM N or W, those runs can often be 30 mins a piece. Its not AOE farming levels, but over time, you do make good coin.
---
His point is that you're insanely biased by being a warrior that needs to compensate for something, not even by results but solely by item color and prestige.
---
Just reroll...
---
Think of it as a test for your BF.

"Hey babe, jump on with me"

"No, too busy having fun NOT getting ganked, ill be fine on my own"

Had that happen to me in a different cave, same ore location. I had to jump on he rock and turn my camera until I wasn’t facing the ore anymore. Must be a bug with the area the ore is placed.
---
Pyrewood just went down :'(

Just figured out the reply.
---
You have Luffa keybound? Yikes..
---
It's the fucking worst. I can't stand it. No matter how many bad pieces of artwork or "I just got my mount" posts people just keep making them. It has to be all the people who shit talked classic after the announcement and finally realized the error of their ways when they felt actual in-game validation after 13 years.
---
Link this post to him lol
---
Part of is probably because you only see highlights. Ultimately its just a coincidence and there is no way Blizzard is feeding loot to streamers under the table.
---
Her regen is good enough. If you manage your resources well enough you shouldn’t have any down time anyway. 
---
Her auto attack damage is on par with about 15-20% of your own. Why would you throw that away?
---
The whole drain tanking is based on either the succ or felhunter.
---
Alright, makes sense I guess.
---
If people refuse to pay for your tanking, you can try asking for indirect payment like  first orb drop in live strat or green/blue drops that nobody wants.
---
Also you can do DM east as 2 people, if you are well geared. Otherwise you still can find extra dps by splitting loot like (tank  - ore, heal - blue items, dps - herb) or simply sharing ore with others.
---
I'm back in

On a pserver he wouldn't despawn.  It was funny to have three Stitches at the same time ravaging the town

Not following one random internet guide instead of picking your best equip combination by yourself, on the other hand, is a big deal and makes you one of only 2% of the classic playerbase.

Now for the long strive to get a full tier set so you can look awesome compared to all the clown gear people.

good guide, been doing this since I saw the video 2 hours ago and I made so much gold that I now have a wife, a house, 6 kids, and a pool. thanks for the guide!

A tip to fix the vanish problem is to save sprint for each vanish if possible and only use it with vanish. What you do when the pickpocket resists is simply activate sprint to gain some distance and then vanish, don’t have to run too far, usually just 10~15 yards away or so, doing this I reduced my death total by a landslide, almost never die doing this now. Obviously with vanish talent you won’t always have sprint for each vanish but it’s still a significant improvement in my own opinion!
---
Not Sure how anyone can enjoy world PVP its a completely boring clusterfuck with no reward past what ever novelty you can get from managing to avoid a death zone of AOE spam.
---
Then again... PvE isn't really that much more exciting, just less frustrating.
---
Go for it. I think a lot of guilds are going to lean on the pvp side, as just raid logging SUUUUUCKS. It gets really boring farming the same content over and over again, and it gets really fast. PvP at least is dynamic, and is really challenging. (also the grind is long)
---
I'm a pretty average player, so I feel like my experience would be reflective of a lot of people. This is what generally happens...
---
You first start playing. Very first time. You eventually reach your first contested zone and see the opposing faction. You're not hostile straight off the bat. You're hesitant. You're both at the same level and both just trying to do your quests so you leave each other alone. Nek minnut a ?? of the opposing faction comes along and one-shots you, /lol's and a few teabags thrown in. You're annoyed, but whatever. You pity them and move on.
---
Then it progressively keeps happening. Over and over again. Always ??, or if not, they are in groups. Never seems to be an equal one-on-one fight of equal level. Very rarely.
---
Over time it pisses you off more and more. Gives you motivation to level up higher and quicker. You then start doing the same ganking that was done to you. "happened to me, so now it's your turn b\*\*ch" mentality. Then that lowbie you just ganked gets pissed off and starts leveling to 60 quicker too.
---
And the cycle repeats itself. It's a right of passage.
---
Lbrs ubrs ony attune
---
Im in on this
---
That's actually what I am doing, I almost always want some kind of indirect payment, not pure golds.
---
Of course I am 60, even have some tanking epics from MC
---
Where do the last two points go? Imp blizzard?

Taunt is matched threat, but no additional. You gain aggro and by that everyone else has to get 110% threat to aggro the enemy again.
---
Nobody fucking cares about your fucking comment, dickhead. This post isn't intended to help you vent your anger.
---
Eu servers down?
---
Its so easy to collude with other people from your class, it made it ridiculously unfair whenever a cross-class weapon drop. Theyd be several points ahead of everyone one else.
---
Like a crackhead that picks a pipe back up not even a minute after setting it down
---
10 hours worth of food... 10 hours worth of elixirs(or like 8 wipes + 2 hours)... Yeah no. He can save a lot of space without being this unreasonable.

---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I am a tailor, and on my High pop server I thought I would never get it (multiple people were always camping it with their macros and bots), one day I woke up extra early for work, around 5:30 AM on a week day, decided to try then.
---
Logged in and flew there from Ogg, no one there, buy the recipe, just as someone logs in and comes out the inn. A bit of luck yes, but most people dont camp early hours of the morning 4-5:30 AM on weekdays.
---
This worked for me.
---
Shows what I know...warlocks consumable life is a lot simpler.
---
I wonder why mongoose doesn't erase the 25 ago elixir :S
---
Why would anyone pay for Mara tanks when 25g gets you any drop you want from a Hunter/Warlock?  Considering multiple runs and having to provide a team of dps/healers that also want to compete for drops and that tanks in level range want to run the instance anyway for the blackstone ring I don't see the economics of this working out.
---
Probably something that [kgpanels](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/kg-panels) can do.
---
the fact that you're a warlock and the mob is a demon makes this all the sweeter lmao
---
just seel everything grey or white in your inventory (not the weapon) and try to repair
---
Lmao how's your knees from jumping to that conclusion mate.
---
For casted spells it depends on base casting time (w/o talents). Formula is cast_time/3.5 * spell power. This means greater heal gets 86% of +heal and flash heal gets 46%. Your spell power benefit is basically 1/3.5=29% of sp every second you spend casting a single target spell.
---
Dots on the other hand gains gain 100% bonus every 15 seconds of duration.
---
Logged in several minutes ago on my bank alt without knowing about the issue, was suprised there was only one guy besides me at the IF bridge. Put a few auctions, tried relogging onto my main, BAM world server is down. Should have stayed on alt.
---
This. Find some mobs well below your level, beat them to death, vendor drops until you have enough to repair. It may not be quick, but it's the best (only?) option short of begging in a city.
---
Don't worry about the downvotes, it just reflects that a big majority of people refuse to use their brains because they prefer to brainlessly follow internet guides instead.
---
Props for trying to think by yourself. Do not wear Mark of the Chosen, just don't.
---
Vigilance Charm is a solid trinket, but I am wearing my Heart most of the time. That being said, I'm an enthusiastic enchanter and already had been one 14 years ago, so your main problem is different. If it'd mean that much gold and work, I'd go with the Charm. It's not that much worse at all!
---
Do your onyx attu while u there
---
Oh boy as a rogue i can feel the dps stops just by looking at this. Looks dope though no question
---
Find a healer you like and start your groups is the best advice i have really
---
wow dude, all those extra mob pulls would have been stressful af. Well done!
---
I am on a low population server and depending on time of day I get one of these every 5 minutes. Maybe the pool of names to send to is much smaller on my server than the populated servers so it repeats faster.
---
How so?
---
I don't get it
---
We usually go with this: p1 only classes Who can reset aggro dps. The offtank should avoid knockbacks and breath during this time and only make sure he is second in threat. The rest autohit/wand. 
---
P2 all casters go ham and stop a few percent before she lands. SPREAD during this phase. As a caster, be out of melee range when she lands as you will have higher threat in melee range and you already have enough to overaggro at this point. 
---
P3 wait for the tank to get aggro, use aggro resets here. If a dps gets aggro, run into tanking spot to avoid cleave and breath on grp. When the tank have it, repeat p1 but everyone can dps this phase. Melee dps stand at max melee range to avoid tailswipe when feared. Fearward rotation on MT.
---
You can also cheese it as we have started doing lately with gnomish cloaking device. Everyone go ham all the time and just before she lands, everyone just invid, dropping all aggro except the tank. Really smooth.
---
I hope this helps, sorry if I forgot something.
---
Its also ripe for the officers to arbitrarily crediting points for stuff and events. Officer sees his priest friend that's 9 points behind another looking to win the staff? Creating an event while that priest is offline to get someone their ony attunement, everyone who goes gets 10 dkp.
---

Meanwhile Im still waiting for my first crystal...
---
???
---
it's great to have because vw isn't good against every matchup, and there are also some fear immunes that some opponents will have, keeping you from using a 10 second summon cast
---
Bid DKP solves the problem, but bid DKP rewards collusion which is a different and equally serious problem.
---
How important is it to get Embrace of the Lycan as a 48 feral druid? The long dungeon, 10% chance, and pain in the ass trying to find a team without competition for Leather got me shook, and I'd rather grind exp through quests than dungeons. Should I go through with the grind and try to get it, or is there any other better headgear in the future I should look forward to that would be easier/comparable to get?
---
What I meant is that two are already benched, two were kicked after last raid and I'm still going strong being put into the core raid to attend the raid.
---
In this case I am the guy getting far ahead gearwise. I got onslaught, flameguard and now ontop OEB severely outDPSing most warriors, because I actually spend the points. I am the one getting others benchend tbh, because the raidlead sees what spending your DKP does for your damage, it's going through the roof.
---
What UI addon is that for all your spells?
---
Hahaha damn a nice win there buddy 😂✌️✌️😊
---
Too bad, you can't get thunderfury at the moment aye. 
---
You're missing the point so hard, this guy is a healer.  So the chances that they'll even have a chance at getting hand of rag for their off-spec is ludicrous.
---
All EU servers are fucked up right now. It’s not on your end.
---
&gt; No one is under any illusion that buying a +sp green will not gimp their Mana pool.
---
If so, people wouldn't freak out for that shit and buy it. 
---
&gt; it is awfully arrogant of you to say that as if you're the only one knowing better.
---
I never said I know better, but if an item is an upgrade I will gladly take it. It'll help the raid/me. The item not being on my one stupid downloaded text file will not change that.
---
&gt; This generation is not too brainless to understand and follow good guides/arguments
---
Also never said that, they're artisan in following "good" guides. They're just unable/unwilling to use their own brain cells.
---
Well at least you started with some good music
---
DKP or you will have people leaving. Calling it now.
---
Install some restrictions for items that make sense. Expect that t1 set items sell dirt cheap while other items are incredibly expensive. Example being the Magmadar bow, which is the BiS forever statstick for all melees. We excluded hunters for that bow because it's pointless. They have the Majordomo Leaf on a 50% dropchance.
---
TF goes to your best tank. Ragnaros hammer is a matter of discussion when it drops, or you let DKP decide.
---
We have some more restrictions, other then that items are ffa and dkp decides. We have an open bet system.

What I do is send my pet on one mob, then I aimed shot multi shot serpent sting on a different mob. Then I can alternate between auto melee attacking the one that I aimed shotted and regular auto shotting the one my pet has aggro on
---
I love that you're searching for this information and it shows that you really want to pull this off but I'm concerned that you're not quite ready to lead a guild. It is tough work if you want to be successful, how much experience do you have as a raider?
---
I'd suggest climbing through the ranks of other established and competent guilds first. To lead a guild you have to manage your own performance, internal guild drama, as well as choreograph the dance needed to kill each boss. You need to know the game inside and out and have eyes in the back of your head.
---
Jesus Christ, how do I have the time? Absolute madman

Just one honestly, but I knew what to expect, don't forget to bring mana pots, the fight is much longer than I remembered (3mana pots I think)

Literally none of what you're saying has even a tiny bit of truth behind it.

For one, I wouldn't take it to begin with.
---
For two, I couldn't give a shit about being on top of the dps or one shotting people.

You're projecting your insecurities.

Taunt is melee range :(
---
ok normie
---
How did you not come to that conclusion????
---
Wolfshead helm is bis for powershifting and requires lvl 40 to wear, iirc
---
Probably wouldn't work since your x item is the same as everyone else's x item, so you can't just pull people in with "these cosmetics are great, they are going to sell like hot cakes, they are way better than anyone else's cosmetics, that's why you want to try to guilt your friends into buying them from you". Looking at you fucking Avon...
---
Might also add /stopcasting ahead of those in case you're mid cast and need to panic Ice Block
---
&gt; #showtooltip Ice Block
---
&gt; /stopcasting
---
&gt; /cancelaura Ice Block
---
&gt; /cast Ice Block
---
#showtooltip will match the icon and cooldown of the spell you specify

Interesting that you see WoW as a vehicle for being on social phone call with a bunch of people whom you "prioritize" based on your enjoyment of their participation in the group call. Are you guys in your 20's? Are those of us who played vanilla WoW while we were in our 20's and now have families expected to be on these calls in order for our charm to be evaluated so that you can "help us learn and help us be social?" There I was thinking that my witty remarks in the green chat box were enough to keep me from being viewed as a pug chump who is there to steal gear from the real members who are on the phone.
---
If you can solo tyrs hand efficiently, it is 20g/h +
---
In my experience hillsbrad, Stranglethorn Vietnam, searing gorge are basically war zones. Other zones just have the usual pvp, kill and get killed, it’s the nature of pvp servers.
---
Leveling in a group in higher level zones can also help deter skulls away. In searing gorge in my 40s a skull shaman and another time a lock tried to gank us and we managed to kill them as 3 players (lock,mage,paladin) we even “camped” the shaman. Which is super fun, super scary and exciting it keeps the adrenaline pumping!
---
Being camped is not fun, yeah but it can happen and you will just have to find ways to avoid it. Be it moving to a new zone, maybe doing a dungeon, or even ask for help in general chat. I’ve had the same guy save me twice lol. Once in the badlands when a war and hunter duo 5 lvls over me kept killing me. This guy (Vinegarden my savior) got 3 60s with him and camped the war and hunter and even helped me get my quest done while keeping the war and hunter camped lol! Another time was in Tanaris when a rogue with 100% mount was chasing me so I led him into the sea so he (and I) would get dismounted but he couldn’t catch me. Asked for help in general and Vinegarden my savior appeared once more. He saw where we were and charged the unsuspecting rogue and ripped him to shreds. The rogue, embarrassed, corpse ressed and never came back. Needless to say I was also taunting the rogue with /s lol. For some reason in the water you need to jump then do the emote cause you can’t /lol in the water!
---
That was so much fun I would never switch to a pve server as this was something that would have never happened there. But if you think pve server is what will make you happy go ahead, do whatever brings you joy and good luck and enjoy the beautiful game!
---
BasicBuffs or Leatrix + has options to move around your buffs.

---
Is it even worth trying for low level dungeons xp wise on a lv 23 warlock? I have quests but nobody seems to be running dungeons at my level, plus it takes forever
---
Watch some high level Ele duels and you'll see why it's so good. 
---
A lot of the fight is just handling cooldowns, CC, and kiting. Since the enemy will be looking to kick your nature spells (which also prevents healing) you don't want to be hardcasting spells. A Hand proc into an instant Chain Lightning can win a duel for you.
---
If he needs to come on Reddit for help, do you really think LC is needed for this guild?
---
They are probably not that hardcore. And will have to replace people regularly who leaves for rolling / dkp guilds when they got shafted loot too many weeks in a row. Since they are not hardcore players it’s hard to see the bigger picture.
---
Ok some details on Pally AoE leveling. Im not an expert but i have at least some experience.
---
To answer the first part of your Question: They can not get close to mages. No one can (Not even Hunters anymore, it seems). Do not compare any leveling speed to Frost Mages unless you want to force yourself into a depression.
---
To answer the second part in more detail: What you can and should compare Prot/AoE Leveling to is the default Ret-Level-Spec, especially if you see that for what it is: Endless, boring meleeing :D Before Level 40 there is no alternative but with the option of getting your first 31 Talent Point and Holy Shield you could go full Prot (and also tank or heal Dungeons, just not DD anymore).
---
The average kill speed of a Ret-Pally is around 30 sec. per mob (personal measurement) and with full Prot and 1h it goes down to at least 40, 45 sec. But you will break even when it comes to killing \~5 mobs and even be faster when it comes to killing 6, 7, ... mobs. Seeing that the Level-Areas are not that crowded, consistent 6+ group pulls are easy and so you could definitely be faster than any Ret Pally. And its way more engaging gameplay!
---
Special Gear is not needed, except a shield spike. Although i would recommend spending \~10g at Level 40 for a blue Weapon and  Shield at the AH (No big deal cuz free mount). And there is a Quest in Badlands that rewards a Firey-Enchant ;) Apart form that keep the Stam/Str pieces from Ret and just replace any Stam/Agi with Stam/Int. All Plate, of course.
---
As for talents and rotation: Get the one with reduced BoP CD, the Block ones, Sanctuary, Reckoning (!!!) and Holy Shield. Oh and the 10% Armor one. +10 Def and 1h Damge are pretty much useless, and the Armor scales nicely during leveling. Later (50+) in the Holy tree Spiritual Focus and Consecrate. Ret Aura up all the time, Buff Sanctuary ... and pull your group of 5+ mobs. At 40 (and before Spiritual Focus) buff and judge Light. Always. Even if you get Imp. Conc. Aura 50% interrupts are still more then enough to not let you heal, with 5+ mobs on you. Heal with Seal of Light or BoP + Heal. Your "active" damage is basically just Holy Shield, but the more engaging gameplay (compared to full Ret at least) comes form constantly switching targets, re-judging/sealing, managing you Mana and bubble + heal in clutch moments.
---
As soon as you get spiritual Focus in later Levels its judge and seal Wisdom only. Simply keep the Mana up because now you also should have Consecrate and you can heal whenever you want.
---
Again with correct pulls its as fast, if not faster than full Ret but definitely more to take care of and more engaging, than that near endless auto-attack killing spree. More targets, constant need for BoPs and heals, constant target switching, health dropping, ... Try it out. Was for sure more fun for me personally.

Came across 5 female Orc Hunters a while back. All just running around with AotCheetah and Arcane Shot'ing everything.
---
Never thought about removing armor, I've just been carrying around a spare threat set and swap out one or more pieces if I take too little damage. Downside is that bags are getting crowded since I also have my pure dps set with me at all times.
---
&gt;Most of the players will not even get item improvements
---
How do you know they are item improvements? I don't agree with some of the BIS choices listed for my class, but there's a lot of mathematical work done besides many of the BIS lists to determine what's best.

I don’t know what you’re trying to say here.

Engineering/CD trinkets are a huge game changer in PvP. I constantly swap on use trinkets during battlegrounds and world PvP.. 
---
Talent is a factor, but hard work and ingenuity will beat talent if talent doesn’t work hard, especially in a game with a 400ms reaction window.
---
&gt;  I don't know if this is a retail mentality thing or not, but I don't remember much of this attitude back in the day.
---
This is nothing new, I played during vanilla as well and knowing all 50+ in the guild would have been impossible. Just because your experience was different doesn't mean it's how it was for everyone.
---
Hopefully this gets fixed by the time I’m back from work :o
---
Mograine aswell.
---
This is literally what happened at contested world bosses in Vanilla. If what's in that video had occurred in Vanilla, the continent server would have gone down.
---
It's crazy to me that people forget this.
---
How is it in any way hard?
---
Say I'm a warlock and we warlocks want to get our tier sets for cheap. We set up a warlock chat channel that we don't tell anyone else about, and we all agree to put in very low bids on tier gear "because we don't want it all that much" and to take turns winning, and then we all have lots of lovely DKP to spend bidding against the mages for the non-tier caster loot.
---
People might say "isn't it weird that none of the warlocks care that much about tier pieces?" but they can't prove anything.
---
get even more people and run multiple raids instead.
---
According to one of the comments, 2k threat at the cost of 27 silver per cast.
---
That's really not that much, and it's certainly not a taunt. Good for AoE packs I guess.
---
Blizzard should post warnings upon player starting the game; with warnings that gold buying if caught will receive a ban as well. If the demand is snuffed, so will the supply.
---
What about any of that screams pedophile to you? I'm genuinely asking because I just don't get it
---
Those might actually be worth holding onto but with limited space and no ability to use mailbox if you want to potentially capitalize on them 6 months from now probably best to just stockpile Ninja clothes. Especially if you’re playing Horde those can trip you up when you’re Alliance. It still trips me up cuz I see them on Spy meter... plus they look kinda cool.
---
I'm on Mirage too and think I could help you out
---
You'd be surprised when I first tried to attack with bow with a freshly created character. Felt like a handicapped man. I still love the old style, but in this whole retail timeline, lots of changes has been made.

Well the only thing I can told you is that I have currently only classic and no BFA installed and my WoW folder is smaller than 5gb and when you search the topic on Internet it doesn’t seem that I’m a wizard and the only one who managed that:

So maybe it’s because I hadn’t Battlenet or WoW installed for years and haven’t ‘automatic update’ or such setting but you definitely can play classic withou BFA
---
Overload is guild just for multiboxers on ZT
---
I'll take all of the 14 years ago you got mang.
---
Pets dont scale in classic. So no difference if you are geared in greens or t3 your pet does the same dmg.
---
In vanilla the difference was that the screen was updated 0.01fps too. Meaning you couldnt run around when the game was freezed.
---
My raid group has been though 8+ full clears and we’ve received x2 earth shaker , x1 oeb and x1 BRE. Plenty of vendor strikes
---
&gt;You end up having to wear Hunter gear.

Do it just to annoy hunters.

How about you stop bitching about how other people play and just have fun yourself.
---
Theres more than one way to enjoy this game.

i’ve opened plenty of keys and i’m pretty sure they rarely go over 2g

Dumbass it’s not even in the same zone

Just reroll one now man you can still do eet :)

LMAO
---
Get actual ret gear, and raid as ret. Get to 25% crit unbuffed.  Run 12/8/31 for both pvp and raiding.
---
But how is that a problem? Its the system working as intended. The same thing would happen if you didnt collude. The less contested small items go for pennies and people save for the contested non tier pieces weapons.
---
The BiS lists are compiled by people who literally spend hundreds of hours theory crafting and working out the math down to a decimal. There is a reason why it's a best in slot list. It doesn't get any better than that. Those guides have been compiled over the lifespan of the game both on retail servers and private servers. In a raid setting these items are imperative for players who want to push themselves.  
---
The only way you can get super creative and deviate from those lists without sacrificing being the best in class is in the world of PvP. That's where you truly get to explore creativity with different gear matchups. 
---
Plus there are many different items, use items, and things with professions like engineering that let you push the boundaries in a dungeon or raid setting. 
---
But no one is stopping you from doing whatever you want with your gear. You might struggle to get a good foot in the door if you're being beat out by players who gear up accordingly, but there are plenty guilds who dont mind slower progression. 
---
But to say that the majority of players aren't having fun is ridiculous. There are definitely people who are miserable on this game but cant kick the habit, but the community in classic has been full of people having an absolute blast. Why do I feel like your entire comment is just deflection?
---
&gt;Any high pop server got at least 30 guilds going to blackrock every wednesday.

That was recorded on tuesday, btw. I know because i was in that fight.

I love how this one STvietnam clash usually turns into world scale massive PvP battle
---
&gt; It's real and viable. Not optimal, sure... but it's real. They have a lot of threat generating abilities and single target when BIS can actually pull more threat than a warrior. They're extremely viable in pretty much all 5 man content, sure AOE threat isn't great but as long as you are a good leader and mark targets (and the group hit them), the group won't pull aggro off you. Not everyone wants to fit into the cookie cutter classes and spec. Not everyone wants to be a Warrior or Druid. I'm literally only considering classic for the chance to play a Shaman Tank, nothing else is drawing me to it. Also, I've seen videos of a shaman tanking bosses like Alextrasa in BWL. Videos of shamans tanking almost all 5 man dungeons up to and including endgame content. It's certainly possible... Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean anything.
---
I've tanked as a Raid Shaman Tank up t'ill Naxxramas a level 60 raid instance on pservers. Shaman Tanking is viable and has been for years. Shaman can tank raids if given the right amount of effort. I've been playing as a Shaman Tank for +8years. Shaman Tanking in Classic is more possible than ever
---
You have some real problems there, my man!
---
When people start bragging about aggro generation the of then forget, that tank role implies:
---
* multi target or even AoE threat generation. 
---
* burst threat generation if someone was hitting not tank's target and pulled aggro.
---
* burst AoE threat generation in case some patrol invaded and cathed aggro on healer.
---
* CC to stop aggroed mob when taunt is on CD and no other recources to generate threat are available.
---
* Tools to mitigate all damage while mobs are hitting to not drain healers mana that is needed to heal other group members who can be hit by mobs cleaves, AoE or special boss mechanics.
---
Shadow Priest bragging that he can generate a lot of threat implies he got healer 10+ levels above him with BiS gear.
---
Preach is the hardest rapper in Azeroth, but his bars are actually true. BFA is a mess.

Well, given your feelings towards ganking - the essence of wPvP as it now stands - you probably should reroll PvE. No point playing a game if it's not enjoyable. It's just a discussion you'll have to have with your BF, talk it out. Unless he has a huge friend pool on your current realm I don't see the problem.
---
I killed a lot of rares with my hunter and some despawned while kiting. As long as my pet lived and stuck on them, no prob... The moment the pet dies, you really have to keep the mob infight during kiting. I think if the way back is too long, they'll just blink home :)
---
Mark a skull.
---
Is personal loot similar to the loot system in GW2 (I haven't played retail since wotlk, other than about 2-3 days in Cata before stopping entirely)? In GW2, everyone can loot the same boss and get their own loot.
---
It's not a *terrible* system....but there's something about GW2 that I can't put my finger on for why I just can't get addicted to it like I can with WoW, but I can't help but feel that the loot system is at least PART of why that is.
---
Just like Vanilla.
---
Nah the "more epic" was definitely not Stitches, there was one with some insane AoE who was sometimes kited to Stormwind and killed the whole city. The ability will not work outside of that area and/or the leashing limited though.

Wait what? I think I've been playing WoW wrong...

Lol I have the same races for my alt army except the only female is the mage gnome (and mine are far from being all level 40 of course).

Why cooking on all of them ? I thought it was only useful on one character (+ maybe the rogue for thistle tea).

Stiches is easily killed inside Darkshire Town, but he is absolute terror on the southern road. If he could toss his hook, he would be ultimate monstrosity.

Whats with all the focus on xp/mob? 
---
what matters is xp/hour
---
Nice
---
is your tank dead or did you not dispell? if not, you are fine tbh.
---
I mean Flash Heal is just to push the healing meter (which nobody should really care about). Once you get a "hard" encounter mana efficiency will be king. Usually a good indicator of a good healer is looking at the overheal. 
---
so from what you are saying you are doing everything correct :-)
---
Yeah, did some short gaming session this morning, very low sever load and the servers crapped out while flying north from grom gol. At STV north border "Instance not found", dropped me off the flying mount. Had to ALT+F4 and login back in.

Yeah that's what I meant. A lot of scummy leaders yoinking items to their friends out there.

No, because he is horde. That is the entire point of this story.
---
gm, no?! Renew does not stack with other renews (like is the case with all hots) but it is really good if you are tank healing...
---
thank you, correct answer

And then they should all have been sad because they get 1 xp per mob if you run them through it.

Thats why you dont boost lowbies, unless its for a sick quest reward.

now i definitely DONT want to play retail

For me simone was the easiest. I was just kiting her away outranging her abilities, she never debuffed me or got a cast off. Killed with 1st try, was surprised. That one wasn't hard too, though.

Silithus one was the hardest for me, i was doing it without warlock and was kiting it around all those pillars, but amount of those little adds became impossible to run around them every time. I did it with a very close call finally)

Cloud has literally nothing to do with this behavior.

Let's pretend for a second that this is a hardware issue. If you're on dedicated hardware, this means you have to literally replace all of your hardware to fix the problem. This is insanely expensive. If you're using a cloud solution, you simply require your instance to allocate more resources. If you don't have boxes that can handle the new requirements, you stand a few more up in parallel and the more populated zones/servers start instancing on those boxes seamlessly. Still costs money, but you're not literally replacing all of your servers like Blizzard did back in 08.
---
&gt; make like 10-20g a run

oh ok. I must doing something bad then, because usually I'm happy on the rare times I'm not in the negative due to repairs, after dungeon running

This us exactly why i fucking love playing my du du. As long as you can escape that first opener your class has extreme durability. Slowly whittle away at people and outlast over time. Sweet clip
---
For pvp lion heart helm should be replaced with helm of wrath for stamina alone
---
If you want to make it a lot easier, respec to 5/5 Spirit Tap. You will regen quite a bit with constant +100% spirit / and 65% regen while casting.
---
Additionally take notice of the pointers of consumables. Focus on the cures, use downranked  heals and holy nova, combined with immolation oil. But the key is to know WHEN to turn back to the next pack. You should aim to be in range of the new spawns when they spawn. Meaning you need to leave the previous pack before they reach the end.
---
It's not even a +8 upgrade. Locks still deal some fire damage so it ends up being less than that overall.
---
I don't know, I think even the truly hardcore have things better to spend their time on. Maybe grinding out timbermaw hold reputation/other reputations for cool, potentially useful items. I dunno, chief. Maybe he's done all of that already, with his playtime and all.
---
&gt; if they break it with their 30 min Reck cd... well, you won because the warrior had to blow a 30 min cd
---
What do you even mean? Oh my, he had to use a cooldown to kill me, what a hard victory I achieved?
---
Google "priest spell coefficients classic", that should probably turn up some already digested coefficients for you. I know that spells with a base cast time of 3.5 sec (even when reduced to 3 sec via talents) benefits a full 100% of your +healing, my 3 sec Healing wave benefits from (3/3.5) = 0,857 \~85.7 \~86 % of my +healing, but I'm not sure about instant casts etc; hence, Google.
---
That’s nice
---
Ye, a random boe green is usually worth more than a death's repair cost for me, although I wear some cloth etc.. but still.   
---
If you wipe 2-3 times per dungeon then ye something is very wrong.
---
I immediatly heard the song in my head. Post this in "Images you can hear"
---
You have to find and tame a new pet that knows each rank.
---
Dear diary
---
Yea, I typically res first orb when I tank live-side. That dungeon in particular is bad for tanks. Its not even that the loot isnt anything a tank would want, its that the loot seems to be more caster centric, so groups are often mages who insist on blasting and running around arcane exploding--super annoying to tank.
---
Maybe someone with experience of running a guild should be running it?
---
I'm surprised the modern BFA client struggles as bad as it does with handling animations &amp; character positioning.
---
You can raid as the sm/ruin lock and play just like normal rotation or ds ruin and put up one curse and spam shadowbolt.   
---
Also press banish here and there :p
---
you have to tame a new pet and use it a bit to learn rank 1, 2, 3 etc then teach it to your new pet (so you need at least 2 stable spaces)
---
broken tooth is the best pet for pvp because of his 1 attack speed which makes him annoying for casters but good luck getting him
---
Cool thanks
---
After ea knockback rag resets threath. So the dude w8sted his time thinking he can go all in and dies.  This does only apply to melle dps tho, ranged can blast him all the time full dps.
---
Lmfao

had the exact same drops yesterday. Our main tank ended up getting the 2H sword over both dps warriors. (Humans btw) 
---
And I got the girdle
---
Most are late 20s to late 30s. 
---
You clearly didn't get the point of my post. If you want to be in a non social no BS guild that's your decision. However, every guild isn't for you. In a more socially focused guild you wouldn't fit - and that's okay for your play habits.
---
Cool, I'm not the only one that noticed they're pretty rancid.

Leveling a priest now, at lvl 56 currently. Arena runs do not give that much XPfor me either. Best are prison runs, where you clear the whole prison. Similar to an SM style spellcleave
---
You would think so. But the amount of times I faced rouges in stv  (admittedly in form) and won shows just how bad horde rouges are.
---
Once upon a time
---
You get ranks by taming a new pet and use the skills  with the new pet until you read "learned xy" in your chat. Then you have to switch to your old pet and just learn the new skill on it.
---
Boars are good for leveling, but for pvp you want a fast hitting pet. You can watch their attackspeed on  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/) 
---
If you want to level as fast and efficient as possible, skill beastmaster for open world content or marksman if you're fully leveling over instances. Survival isn't very efficient during leveling and too gear dependent in lategame to make it worth putting more than 18 points in

Well they updates us and hour ago that they want to update us again now and didnt do it :D

Brilliant
---
Im in partial epics and my worst repair is something like 5-6 deaths at 7ish gold. Most repairs are around 1-2g, with maybe 1 death. 1g is a grey weapon or two grey armor pieces. This is not including the constant 1s blips you get throughout the entire dungeon or the 5-40s greys you get. And unless youre terribly unlucky, youll win at least one greed one a green/blue, which is around 40-50s. Dungeons dont often give you giant spikes in gold, but if you check from time to time, youll see you actually get nice constant trickles.
---
APES is a pvp guild only raiding for PvP gear, seems to be working well for them
---
Is that further then the settings in the camera menu?
---
It isn't anymore? At least 90% of the time . IIRC at first feign death didn't automatically set pet on passive but now it does so you don't have to spam the macro and pray , it usually places it correctly
---
Thats what I would do. Atm a paladin doesn't need holy talents to heal. They are nice and sure spare you mana pots and dark runes but they far from necessary. Talk with your Raid/Class lead. Simplest way is to focus on dispelling and occasional heals. A paladin isn't that depending on his healing specc as a druid, shaman or priest is. This requires fairly good healing gear obviously and not just "of healing" crap from the AH. 
---
This will change with BWL and AQ but even there your still a powerfull off heal choice if you keep your gear up to date.
---
The most obvious solution hasn't been posted yet. Simply Feign Death the moment you take aggro. Your pet won't be able to hold aggro unless you spec BM and cast Intimidation.
---
Apparently spirit tap on this quest was a private server error.
---
P1 dps holds until tank has ony at back wall dps will attack in between her legs on the the left side of the room casters will cast. If someone gets tailswiped into the whelp eggs they will spawn so get mage AOE there to take them out with melee dps.
---
P2 she will fly so casters and dots galore. Make sure the whole raid is spread apart as she will shoot fireballs that can hit the people around you pretty damn hard. She may use deep breath which is an attack that shoots an insta kill fire directly across from where she is at. So if she is north then she will deep breath north to south or if she is north west then she will deep breath across to south east. You should be on the sides of where she is positioned in the air. Whelps will spawn on the left side so melee dps or caster should take them out. Stop all dots when she is at 50% hp and she will come down at around 45% hp for phase 3
---
P3 Phase 3 is like phase 1 but a little different. At the beginning of phase 3 you should let the tanks get aggro and positioned before dpsing. The main tank will need a fear ward as she casts an AOE fear that is short, but you may run into lava shooting out of the ground so be aware to not step on the cracks in the floor. I believe some more whelps may spawn, but other than that just DPS her down with the positioning from phase 1 and get that loot. 
---
I am sure there are more ways to do it than what I explained, but this is how I learned the fight.
---
And if you like both games are both is my taste then awful :/
---
Eh , no engi trainers in TB i guess that's why
---
Only get to gank warriors lol
---
rockbiter and earthshock both have increased threat. Good enough threat for 5-mans, but lacking a taunt just like paladins.
---
And here I am at work wishing I was home.playing... Guess I.might as well stay late.

---
Can you fear mobs that other people have tagged? Just asking since you can’t Polymorph them.
---
Sounds like a management issue. Why not use raid signups?
---
Of course people will get impatient if your "officers" are only figuring out who gets to raid just before scheduled raid start time. Fill your raid roster beforehand so people know who gets to go and who is on standby.
---
Also, if logging in on non-raid nights and chatting on discord is a prerequisite for raiding, then be upfront about it and let people know about this policy. You emphasize that people should communicate with guild leadership and demonstrate that they are team players. Well, **communication works both ways**, you know. Talk to your guild and don't have any hidden agendas or ulterior motives for filling raid spots. If the "inv plz" spam is annoying, let your guild know. Talk to the players directly, instead of making bitter Reddit posts.
---
And one final point, relax and have fun! Current raid content is easy and will continue to be so until the last couple of phases, if not until the very end of Classic. You don't need to run your guild like a Fortune 500 company.
---
Strategically changing out pieces is far superior, but taking off your pants will do if you don't have other pieces on you,
---
You're right I'm full of hate for worthless trash like you, go play retail scrub
---
Some will always be unhappy whatever the system. If you need to use DKP because you cant handle drama then, spoilers, drama happens anyway. If people cant understand loot for the better of the guild they can leave. I would never join DKP for that reason, to me it is a bad excuse of a loot distribution system with too many loot whores.
---
&gt; I bet they could OT with this build as well as any Druid.
---
No, they cannot. Druids are for the most part slightly worse warriors. They are absolutely capable of tanking any content in Vanilla, even though warriors are the better choice most of the time. Shamans however are not good tanks. Yes, technically speaking they can tank, but thats true for any class that can survive 1 hit and generate enough aggro. And if you are doing content that isnt supposed to be very challenging (like 5 mans) while also doing your homework, it can work quite well
---
can someone ELI5 what does that maestro do during this why the fuck she looks possessed by the devil
---
I love leveling my alt with my 60 shadowpriest parked in the same zone :D
---
Really... I tanked UBRS yesterday with a warlock as a feral druid. They also throw their dots on 5 mobs at the same time. Great times as a Feral tank...
---
I rerolled Hunter from Warrior, because I was sick of wearing some random ass bis instead of my tier set. Now T1 still isn't my bis but i don't care, I'm hit capped anyway sho who cares, i'd rather look good and be satisfied with my char than deal 10-20% more dps.

He misses her arsh, not the girl herself !

---
Hello,  
---
Fresh 60 Warrior tank, I was wondering if you had any concrete guide since I saw that we had many talents possibilities (arms/prot or fury/prot or fully prot) but not so many of these talents guides were linked to a stuffing guide. I am sure that the BiS for a fury/prot warrior tank are different than a prot one.  
---
Also none of the guides I found deeply described the intention behind these talents trees.  
---
Maybe one of these trees is recommended for new 60, one for raid, one for dungeon... Could you help me?  
---
For information, I checked icy veins, wowhead and wowisclassic.  
---
Thanks :)
---
May be Luffa or may be one of his trinket slots. I have my top trinket slot bound to a key, so I can put any use trinket in that top slot and activate it easily.
---
It's a server problem... You just have to wait.
---
Aren't the BRD mobs you're pickpocketing already several levels lower than you at 60? I would expect them to have the same 1% resist chance spells cap at no matter how low level the target is.
---
Gnomes get turned to taurens when using orb of deception.

We had an eye our second raid. We have had 4 ingots drop and sold all of them off, because we really care to craft an overpriced hammer instead of gearing up our raiders.
---
Reroll mage
---
I assume you've had some carryover week to week right? Each week, say "If you want to come back next week, I will prio you for an invite. If you bring a douse, I will give you some sort of loot priority". Given it's a pug, I assume you just freeroll most loot. Give people that bring douses a 110 or even 120 roll on the items they want, and have everyone else roll out of 100. People will climb over each to be the dousers.
---
You know i never knew that.. when i get home i might actually try it... they dont do a very good job asvwrtising it is free to play if it actually is

What if i have fun minmaxing with the rogue orc thingy? Thought about that? Huh? Thot about it??

3 more months of MC don't worry m8 you'll still get decked before BWL.

My guild had 6 armorsmiths (300 guild pop, probably sixty 60s)
---
Randomly seeing "Immune" flash up is also great :D
---
Yeah, that would be so weird having a significant other thats head-over-heals for you. No thanks, Ill take a partner that ignores and belittles me, thanks.
---
Nothing to worry about. tier 0.5 is not available till Phase 5, when most folk will be pugging MC in a couple of hours.
---
The "other thing you forget" was most likely the "secret question and answer".
---
Literally doesn’t what?
---
Good news, paladins are great AOE farmers!
---
Blessing of sanctuary, holy shield, redoubt, reckoning, consecration, a shield spike, retribution aura, all add a lot of passive damage, that makes enemies kill themselves while hitting you.
---
You keep your health/mana up using the correct seals, your white swings are mostly used for this purpose.
---
Around lvl 51 you can get all the most important talents and skills to do it succesfully.
---
I leaved r/wow cause i dont Care anymore.
---
Classic Till naxxramas
---
Cause I'm only fighting the bosses whose majority of damage come from spells you can't parry, I would rather dodge a spell than parry an auto. You can change that if you want though it's not really important, just needed to put a point there so I had 15 in tree to get dual wield spec. This is not meant for pvp just efficiently farming brd, could be a decent lvling spec though if you can get blade flurry and imp sap you can deal with 3 mobs by yourself.
---
I think this situation changes depending on if the item is a random world drop that happens to drop in a dungeon (like a krol blade) or a epic pattern that drops off a dungeon boss at a low drop rate, if the loot can be targeted it may be that players only reason to run that dungeon, and having people take it for greed (literally the meaning of need or greed, and why greed has a gold coin as its icon) would really suck.
---
Dude, noone would be shaming him if he said he was prouid of getting his full set. People are just criticizing that he said this was good for threat when it's objectively not.
---
Great, I planned on waking early to farm on off hours.
---
Nah there is literally a windows warning that says would like to pay XXXX? if you are fool enough to click accept still then its all on you

New announcement on BlizzCon:
---
We restart the server, as soon we return home!
---
&gt;Hope they can get them up today at least.
---
Me too
---
Guessing a password still fits the colloquial definition of "hacking".
---
If you were a real pedant you'd still be telling people "it's cracking not hacking".
---
I've done that already. Makes me a fortune on my server for all greens.  But a level 36 purple item will only DE to small radiant shard.
---
I'm a vanilla player and had no idea about this.
---
It is! I've had one shaman tank maraudon. He held aggro really well, but he did have to drink a lot.
---
but always the unskilled noobs gank.
---
Oh that crinkling in the background is supposed to be an electric guitar.
---
Did you find a concrete answer? I am a human warrior using dalrends (have devilsaur set as well as edgemasters unequipped) and I am wondering the same thing...
---
I am not, I am on sulfuras- a high/full single layer server
---
The key is buying low and selling high, obviously, but that translates into selling almost exclusively on tuesdays before MC resets. I can guarantee you that if you play it right you can profit regardless of what server you are on.
---
The other potions I just quickly check over at around 3pm to see prices and list 2 or 3 of them if prices are right. The gold/minute of work is probably about the same as my mage farming since I can check the AH quick but it's still fun.
---
thats a great shout. But I might just hang on to it till Phase 3 and twinks are being made. lvl 39 bracket was always good.
---
Exactly this post. Before classic dropped i was researching the fastest methods and best gear to get and most optimal routes. And i got burnt out around lvl 15.... my irl friend quit again so i logged on amd just started talking to people. I eventually found an amazing guild and the most fun ive had so far is talking to a 62 yr old over disc and the rest of the guild. Before i log on my thought arent "hope this popular area is empty so i can farm" its i hope my guildies are on so we can adventure through Azeroth!
---
&gt; I had to buy a gift card 
---
Haha, no.
---
&gt;from G2A 
---
FUCK NO.
---
Dying once on the way to a dungeon doesn't add 30-45 minutes, that's absurd. Worse case scenario is it's peak hours on a Tuesday and you have a 5x death run into BRD because the mountain entrance and Lothos are both being camped by raids getting ready for MC. And that is like 20 extra minutes tops.
---
There have been multiple occasions where there were exploits or social engineering ways account thieves have been able to get around authenticators over the years.
---
Aye I've also run Scholo with a Shaman tank. Once of the smoothest runs I've had in the place, albeit it wasn't necessarily the fastest.
---
“I’ve been playing for 15 years and I don’t know what’s good anymore”
---
So glad I didn’t get sucked into retail and left after mop released. Sounds like a nightmare.
---
sure, I get you, but by phase 3 most folk have well geared mains, have a good supply of gold or can farm gold easily. So gearing up alts to make leveling quicker is done by most folk.  
---
I might hold it till phase 3 and see how it goes, or just use it on a tank alt, if I roll one.
---
Composition is Reddit?
---
Take Maitoz’ advice at the end of the video, assuming your username checks out
---
Yeah, its possible but really slow and boring.
---
Also being able to switch pets fast is very nice in wPvP. I usually sac the void and get a succubus out to deal with all the fury warriors. They have a 30 second fear immunity, but not charm immunity. So you just let the lady keep the warrior at bay long enough so you can fear juggle him.
---
Well, from a semantic viewpoint, I guess I see what you're saying. And sure, there are substantial tragedies taking place in real life on a global scale and far too often, I don't think there is any need to dispute that.
---
But choice of words aside, I too think it's pretty touching that devs once placed easter eggs (tributes, really) such as this into the game, and I'd venture a guess that you do too (although it is just a guess). Clearly OP thought this as well, even though he worded it in a stronger way - a way that didn't sit quite right with you. This being a game forum and all, I just find it a bit odd to bring in a comparison of IRL tragedies as a comparison to an in-game easter egg over a disagreement over semantics.

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dpksa6/firemaw_eu_world_server_is_down/).

That is what I’ve been doin for the most part. It gets kinda boring but gets the job done.
---
I love shit like this, but when I see people semi afk and earn more gold in 10hrs than what I do in a few weeks I just ask myself why do I suck so much.
---
Nice video. Did you spend a lot of time editing?
---
I got the same message, then managed to get in. After 2 minutes I got disconnected from the server again
---
I've run Scholo with a Shaman tank. Went smoothly. Just saying.
---
Wow, that's high level play. I just pot when I'm low

World server is still down for Nethergarde Keep EU.

I prefer to just have a /cancelaura button myself. Put all the stuff you may need to remove on it tho thats probably just iceblock in classic
---
More damage at the expense of longer downtime isn't better.
---
Levelling already done.

stanks

And the crafting vendors/trainers/equipment are all on the main rise!

The alliance would yell back, but their mouths are usually full of dwarf dick.
---
Why are you in Durotar asshole
---
I learnt it yesterday right here
---
Girlfriend just finished it on her 3rd try. We had a druid chilling with us by the quest npc that gave her thorns and when she got towards the very end she was oom and about to fail so the druid innervated her and moments later the demon popped out and killed her... but the quest did not fail.
---
So the druid ressed her, she got back with more mana, and finished the quest and turned it in. Get a friend I guess because you can cheese the hell out of this.
---
Relatable.
---
How does anyone know which server this guy play on tho?
---
Some of these names...
---
Fanskapet : The bastard is probably a good translation.
---
Ronkboegen: Is slightly altered but it means Wankf-g
---
It’s never as efficient as questing
---
yep. can't login either
---
That's just a worse option. The bosses give between 2-6+g each, take 30 seconds to do + 3min for reset. That's literally 6g for lets say 6 minutes of work. You're not getting nearly as much g/min pure pickpocketing.
---
of course it is.  You can easily do this if thats what you wish to do. However you really dont need to spec Prot till mid 40's. 
---
Warriors with a shield can tank in DPS spec. I healed my way to 60 as an ele shaman and just had Int/Stam gear.  Just have a tanking set and you'll be fine. Even the lower instances you can tank as DPS. Most warriors are using 2handers for lower instances.  
---
But running instances over and over will totally help you learn how to tank well. I'd think about going prot from maybe ZF onwards in your 40's, and you'll easily find groups. Tanks are in short supply.
---
Sure why not
---
Actually, it's called "Feral Wave".
---
Yep. It's a good way to get back at people who've pissed you off. 
---
Source: I pissed off a Priest last week and he followed me for half an hour fearing everything I tagged. We had fun.
---
Yer got “world server down” when I tried
---
$gpriest:priestess;.
---
:b
---
Woo Gnome power \^.\^ !
---
It should be possible, but I think you're shooting yourself in the foot by speccing prot that early. You would be better off buying actual "tank gear" with high armor/sta/str/agi and leveling as arms or fury, and just using your armada of (affordable) blues to bolster your defense during the leveling phase while retaining good solo capacity outside of dungeons. You can tank perfectly fine as DPS spec when leveling up, as long as you have a shield and somewhat decent mail (or plate, after 40) gear. Decked out in some BoE blues (with decent stats), your healers will love you. Consider speccing prot/hybrid DPS around Mara or ST if you want to become beefier and mitigate more damage, when that time comes.
---
Learn to keybind all your skills slowly, as you level and learn them. Put the skills you use most to the most easily accecable keys on your keyboard (for example, numbers 1-5). The best thing i did to myself starting over again, which i didn't do when I was playing retail years ago, was to buy a mouse with 12 extra buttons on its left side (with additional 3 on top if it) to bind more keys for simple one-button keys, to avoid having to shift, ctrl or alt-click skills which dulls my reflects and consumes time. If you re a melee, I recommend only using strafe skills to move right and left. You're not a tank so you will never need to backpedal so unbind that key :). Just use strafe keys to move away from the mob faster than backpedalling.
---
I also shifted all my movement skills to the right by one key to make four additional keys that can be clicked with pinky finger. This makes shift or ctrl clicking harder but I don't use them anyway and use only alt. I also don't bind non-channeled skills (like your sinister strike) to keys I access with fingers I use for strafing (in this case index and ring fingers). I do this to be able to freely strafe while using those skills. You don't move while channeling anything anyway (like bandaging).
---
I'm not sure if the second paragraph is a little conplex for a beginner or not, but I highly recommend those. Progress slowly and take your time.
---
He patrols close to the ramp at some point doesn't he?
---
Must be a tank
---
You couldn't play for 12+ years, I'm sure you can handle a couple hours :7
---
They do this for botters, not spammers. Spammers get muted very quickly from reports.
---
If you roll Alliance on Old Blanchy hit me up!
---
Bodyguard in the area.
---
And here i am. Never seen an epic drop in open world. Been playing since tbc... Crying
---
Taunt actually doesn't do anything for threat *unless* you are taunting the mob off someone else. Meaning, if you have aggro to begin with, it does nothing.
---
Give runecloth or if feeling cheap 12 slot bags to your alt. More inventory space is saved time.   
---
When your alt gets the 2H weapon from the paladin quest, you can give it a fiery weapon enchant.  
---
I wouldn't worry about buying any gear for it, maybe a weapon for lvls 10-20 if you see a good one on the AH. Same with enchants- not really worth it except for a weapon enchant and speed on boots until past level 40.  
---
If you want to level engineering, picking up mining is a good choice since you'll be running through low level areas anyway and it does save a lot of cash. Same deal for herbalism or skinning but not to the same extent.
---
You have an 8 in the first formula that I assume is supposed to be a multiplication but other than that, yeah. Keep in mind these stats are from private servers and from what I've heard low rank spells in classic also scale a small amount as you level. 
---
There are edge cases where this can be wrong tho since a spell can only get 100% bonus from spell power even for cast over 3.5 or duration longer than 15s.
---
Additionally aoe spells have an additional multiplier of 1/3 and drain spells a multiplier of 1/2. Instant spells count as 1.5s cast time. 
---
This means formulas should look like this in excel:
---
    cast = base + Max(cast_time; 3.5) / 3.5 * sp
---
    cast_aoe = base + Max(cast_time; 3.5) / 3.5 / 3 * sp
---
    hot = base + Max(duration; 15) / 15 * sp
---
      
---
Instant + hot spells like renew are a bit more complex. First calculate what the normal coefficients for direct and hot healing like above, I'll call them cdir and chot below (ex. cdir=cast_time/3.5). Then you get total healing as:
---
    
---
    direct = base_direct + cdir*cdir/(cdir+chot) * sp
---
    hot = base_hot + chot*chot/(cdir+chot)
---
    total = direct + hot
---
Often times tank/healer is the hardest thing to get in a group so finding 3 DPS should be relatively easy if you’re friends with healers.  
---
You have to be reasonable with your price though, look for runs people might need for a pickup where they might not care about the loot if they have their eyes on something else. They might not even get it which only makes them stay around longer generating nothing while you’re making that sweet GPH. The trick is finding that target audience.
---
Hey that’s me!
---
If you fall for this sort of shit you honestly deserve it for being this stupid.
---
I'd argue it's even worth for them losing 50$ over it for the lesson.
---
You have 2 bloody ice blocks. If you can't kill a rogue with it, please move to another game.
---
" Post maintenance yesterday, the EU servers started to have problems."
---
I don't know, I logged in around 7 server time last night and played for 3-4 hours without any hiccups. 
---
Hope these problems reported during this morning get fixed though!
---
\#nochanges not even spelling rogue right after all these years.
---
Guess who is dying the next time we get in combat?
---
Battle for Azeroth UI I think
---
It's really is pathetic. It's one thing to randomly engage on people you're running past, that's fine and only gives you the small advantage of getting the opener. But engaging on people fighting mobs? It's just a display of how truly unskilled you are. I mean, just look at the dude in the OP! Three level advantage, target was fighting a mob, and he _STILL_ couldn't win the fight with the advantage of opening on him.
---
&gt; So what about the whole time I was playing shaman in vanilla? When I did the whole rank 11 grind and Mc bwl back during classic? None of that experience is relevant today because?
---
You literally wrote "outside of wailing caverns", people are just telling you that your argument was flat out wrong. If you are unhappy about that I don't know what to tell you. You presented a context, and people replied to that context.
---
I was in stonetalon on my 25 priest and got ganked by a skull hunter (he was around 38ish). Well, my second account with my 60 hunter main was in the same zone went and returned the favor. He layered out so I couldn’t camp him which was very unfortunate.
---
&gt; Hope these problems reported during this morning get fixed though!
---
i dont count on it or expect any compensation from this company in 2019, but i remember 15 years ago if this issue would occur u would be guaranteed some compensation
---
Who press alt tabbed 4 times?
---
Who was phone???
---
I leveled my shaman to 60 and tanked every dungeon on the way without any problems. I've offtanked UBRS aswell. Incase you're doubting me hit me up Garu - Zandalari Tribe and I'll prove you wrong. One day I'll tank raids... one day...
---
In one life
---
That MIGHT work
---
Still not a taunt. With a taunt you can die as an OT or whatever, get battled rez'd and be back in the fight. Or actually do mechanics which require 2 tanks to taunt back and forth without heavily micromanaging threat for your paladin tank to be able to get the boss. There is no substitute for a taunt in the situations where you actually need one.
---
I know. I was there too. I am a “wait and see” on this anyway. But also not expecting anything. 
---
The main difference now is that this is activision not blizzard.
---
Yeah its entirely doable. But prepare to spend a LONG time just sitting around getting groups together. Level 30-40 requires something like 100 Scarlet dungeons. And most groups dont want to do more than 1 or 2.
---
Spending 20-40 minutes getting a group together once an hour really isnt worth it IMO.
---
Based upon what others have contributed with in this thread, likely pretty well. Just like my experiences with them, doing several instances (Scholo prolly being the hardest) without any issues. And it's not like the Shaman was fully raid-geared or anything either.
---
It's an endless cycle.
---
Earlier this week I got ganked in Shimmering flats by 2 people. 
---
When I arrive with my main, I find a mage whos alt had the same fate already corpse camping the perpetrators. 
---
About 5 minutes later, their 2 guildies/mains arrive expecting only 1 player so naturally we corpse camp them as well. 
---
Not long after we're the ones getting camped by what appears to be half their guild.
---
You can't dodge spells.
---
Soul Stone. So sneaky.
---
Dreamweave set.
---
For your weapons, the staff of Jordan is probably the best around 35-50 but is crazy expensive. Honestly the hypnotic blade and orb that both drop in scarlet monastery are crazy good for healing and should last you to at least lvl 50 anyway.
---
Love the enraged instant-release from that gnome, knowing he would get emoted otherwise.
---
If we're being technical, MT should run a dagger spec (even Orcs). You should have 1-3 annihilator, at minimum the OT but maybe 1 or 2 fury warriors also having them to use at the start of the fight to get the debuff up faster. I don't believe Annihilator is close to being #1 in threat generation though for a MT, so its better to have daggers (with dire maul +dagger gear).
---
If I'm wrong, I'm happy to be corrected!
---
I logged in like 3 hours ago had a 10 minute restart and could get back in so no idea what youre talking about
---
I need to look into this, you could make your own bounty hunter quests! Is this available from twitch or?
---
Another wrong put right, yet still the great book remains full!
---
MUSTER THE THRONGS!
---
Nethergarde Keep (EU) as of five minutes ago is still “world server down”
---
shazz experience is just bad, transfer aborted, lags, instance not found
---
c'mon blizz, say something, take them down, do anything. It's sad that pservers with 999x less staff had more communication and faster response to problems than 9999999999999999999$ company
---
Tony Stark?🤔
---
Underrated comment!
---
Im farming dire maul and ZF on my 60 mage alt, its worth to invest in a farm alt long term.

Yup, that's me as well. I realized I just don't enjoy killing randoms, so I don't. But then 30s later a group of horde rolls around and one shots me while I'm questing.
---
I'll keep playing for now, but the imbalance is actually making me reconsider continuing playing. I have adult responsibilities, and when I finally do have free time dying multiple times just to start a dungeon is extremely unfun.
---
My brother did exactly this. From wailing caverns upto 60. 
---
He still gets pissed that he doesn’t have a lot of the flight paths 😁
---
Simple: there is a lot of them and very little of you. The Streamers who are getting legendaries are more likely to get hooked and keep streaming Classic WoW while the ones who go dry might dip out of their viewer count drops. Viewers want to see those big drops, so ones with them will be higher up the viewer chain. Also they are more likely to get them from their Guild than your average joe since they aren’t peasants like everyone else.  
---
At the end of the day you are only seeing what is shown right in front of you. There are non-streamers you haven’t heard about with far greater RNG/Loot but it’s not like everyone is living the dream plenty of dry streaks to be had.
---
Well duh
---
It very rarely does.
---
Wait, shadow bolt took half his health?
---
You arent bad at PvP.
---
Someone like me who getta way too jittery, starts miss clicking, and simply freezes in the moment is bad at PvP. Good kill.
---
Retail bad classic good
---
I am actually doing this same thing at the moment, currently lvl 19 have done most of the Darkshore quests. Would it be worth getting a normal mount to help out with the grind for the Darnassus rep in the meantime? How did you find it go to without a mount until 55?
---
When the warrior killed the hunter’s pet and walked into that little dead zone that they have, it started following him
---
I know. Was still a legitimate question, as I am curious .
---
Not all of them. Icy veins and WoWhead have some wierd ideas about what is BIS. Some items simply aren't BIS, some are a absolutely minor increase to the previous one but are much much much harder to aquire.
---
Then there is the obvious PvP and PvE difference, different encounter and different tactics make other gear options much better. 
---
Those 600 +heal don't mean shit if you spent 80% of your raid time dispelling. 
---
Also optics. Some people might decide that 2 +heal and 2 int are worth looking like a crime to fashion that you're forced to stare at 90% of your playtime.
---
Might wanna join too, ally netherguard keep
---
Yes. And you can just get a WA to apply this upon login and you don't have to bother pressing the macro every relog.
---
Your dedication is commendable.
---
So much this. I'll get on discord if we're in a group, otherwise I'll see you in guildchat .
---
Dude just go fual tanking and you will be thread god
---
1) The demand isn't to fix the problem immediately, it's to keep the community informed. First response for blizzard is 2 hours 30 minutes after the servers are burning, and "hour" means "1 hour and 30 minutes". Indeed, responses indicate that they don't really know what happened yet, but they could at the very least be timely. Very unbefitting of a large company. The way I see it they didn't even realize the servers are bugging out until 2 hours have passed.
---
2) Humor
---
Nope, kurinnaxx. It’s 40/60–35/65, and the horde seem to have nothing better to do than sit around BRM waiting to 10-man individual allies.
---
I know this is an older thread but I just wanted to add that yes, you do (at least in my case).
---
I'm a warrior, and after respecing to fury (to try it out) I recently decided to go back to Arms. I discovered that I had to re-purchase previous ranks of Mortal Strike (Arms only talent ability) because it reset it back to rank 1. However, the cost of re-purchase was cheaper.
---
So, for anyone who found this thread as I did and are wanting to respec to "try it out", you should know that there may be extra gold costs involved on top of the respec cost.
---
Thank you.
---
Not positive how it will work in the long run but from remembering in AQ40/Naxx you want people to be at least decently raid geared and not just in greens/blues.  Playing better/more knowledge/better internet might make it not as relevant as it used to be though.  For MC/BWL though ... yeah raid gear not required for the majority.
---
Oh hot damn, I didn't know TMorph was still being updated. Still, I don't know if it's worth the risk to use a third party application that is allegedly bannable. It's just a shame we can't do MPQ edits any more. That was the good shit.
---
Step aside, Rogue. Fury Warrior coming through.
---
Can a paladin actually level by autoattacking, or it's a meme?
---
No matter what to gouge or blind you'd have to switch targets and whenever you deselect your main Target you lose your combo points.
---

Collusion and taking longer due to bids are the downsides.  Every system has its ups and downs though.

I once felt for the will gift you store mount for gold on retail years ago.
---
Ya that's my problem I was asking if there was a way around it
---
Got sidetracked earlier - during slow hours when (if?) you take your time roaming the world o reading your quest log instead of going to the Questie marks on the map you can come across some really weird, humorous and even sad easter eggs, such as this. I am sure there are others, but I immediately start thinking of the Shrine of the fallen warrior found quite close to X-roads - most people have probably glanced this shrine from below at some point, but probably not all have ventured to it for a closer inspection. When you think of it, it really is nice gesture of the devs to pay tribute to some of their (gamer) friends and loved ones in this fashion, in a video game.  
---
Just barely related to this; I don't know if people have quest flavor texts / completion texts they remember - I don't, or I did not think I had until I started leveling an alt and did a quest taking me from TB to place a pendant on a grave in the Sepulcher; I think this one is written with heart, and for some reason it just brought me back almost 15 years, and it still sticks with me:
---
"You place the worthless pendant on the grave, and the gemstone within the setting seems to dull noticeably.  
---
As you stand to leave, you look down at the pendant; it lies lifelessly over the hands of the relief sculpted into the top of the coffin. Your thoughts are interrupted by a stiff, cool breeze passing over the Sepulcher. For a moment everything around you is silent. "
---
Fuck loot councils. There, I said it. Every player which contributes to raid, spends all his time on clearing it, brings his own consumables and is doing his job well should be able to be rewarded with loot. Specially if you have more than 40 people and bring other people along so they can't really show their dedication or improvement. Once someone fucks up, you won't likely bring him to next raid. I would never join guild who would have one raiding roster, didn't want to make second while having more raiders than needed. DKP won't  work here if you can't join even if you are online (unless you give players who are ready to join but can't join raid due to more people being available than slots open), loot council will always be like don't give these people shit. It won't work, there will be drama, people will quit and look for better place. Deal with it. Raiding isn't spend your free time, consumables, try your best so other people can get geared. I have fun getting geared with people I like and people I like getting geared. Raiding with people who don't even like me or think I am inferior because I am not part of these people who always get invited wouldn't be fun.

even with mouseover?
---
We have 5 paladins but only 2 priests and one went shadow. Wtb priests.
---
It's totally feasible. Theres a seal you can judge a target that will heal you 20% of the time on hit, you just pop that on a target and can comfortably alt tab out. 
---
I leveled a prot paladin to 42 before I really knew what I was doing so I had terrible dps, and would alt tab for a minute and not worry if there weren't ads nearby

My guilds mages have been having a field day including two mageblades, rogues on the other hand... 4 weeks with barely a drop.
---
This NPC can be found in Blasted Lands  (211), Stormwind City  (28), and Swamp of Sorrows  (10).
---
Sounds about right :D
---
You won't have any problem in dungeon, druids bring so many things that the lack of rez won't be a problem 99% of the time.
---
In raid, it's harder and arguably more complicated than the braindead priest/paladin heal, but it's far from needing you to be a pro player.
---
You will be fine. Druid healing is at the very worst "good enough" to do the job. I **mean, i've seen so druids in full raid gear (who are all dedicated to healing anyway) at ironforge/stormwind that it can't be that bad if they are consistently brought in raids.**
---
"IF you manage your resources correct" is just so general and vague. Even then, using a good mana battery pet is also resource management.
---
Likewise I don't know how you can be so authoritative about the class and then somehow say the pet is the basis of drain tanking rather than, you know, the *drain* part of it AKA Fel Concentration.
---
We like it rough in EU
---
Max everything in frost except winters chill, frost warding, and freeze on frost damage talents
---
Max arcane subtlety
---
3/5 arcane hit chance
---
5/5 clear casting
---
1 point into arcane explosion crit chance
---
This is the only build you will need for all of classic.
---
Going arcane isn’t really a thing right now when the content is this easy and you need talents for farming gold and survival.
---
You got zero caster gear? I always collected an off spec set from otherwise useless quest rewards and dungeon drops no one wanted. This won't get you a gear set instantly, but over a few levels and dungeons, you can get enough to do the switch. You could check on the ah, but that can get expensive.
---
It’s an ability called slam
---
So ... who is this fun guy.  Most people trying to bring up random stuff were just loud/obnoxious and needed to get muted(experience from PUGs/splits with other guilds).  People should just keep it to raid chat.  I think most of our guilds past-time during raids is gambling which I guess is our "fun" part but its kept mostly to raid chat/gambling discord channel.
---
Its allowed because blizzard has multiple times specifically said its allowed.
---
You typed "meanwhile Classic players sit on reddit while a tank appears" wrong
---
I wouldn't call anything in 76 working.
---
Two bosses? Which ones do you kill? Pyromancer is obvious, but after that? Plugger or the mage guy with his dog?
---
I liked 25 quite a bit too.  Still enough people to feel like a raid and not just a small group of guys.
---
SWEET! We should level!
---
Just get a pve raiding spec, pretty sure there are 2 options for leveling which is the aoe frost or single target frost, if you just want to press blizzard stay with aoe if you want to press frostbolt go with single target.
---
Thank you friend
---
When I was doing my first run in rfc at lvl14, a lvl 52 ran me through and showed me the ropes and let me keep all the drops and wouldn’t accept anything in return. It really stuck with me and since I hit the 30’s when ever I’m in org at a trainer or at AH, I’ll stop by and run a group of lvl 13-15 through and let them keep the drops and do their quests. I even added one who was playing wow for the first time in the same class I am so I added them and told them to feel free to message me at any time. I always try and pay it forward and think the best of people, unless you’re in the barrens. The barrens is troll city.
---
Ah ok. Wasn't sure exactly how it worked.
---
Sad life of having a healer main.
---
I switched from Arcane-Frost because, while it's fun to be top damage on some bosses, it doesn't weigh up how boring it is to play in the open world with it. I also like to do dungeons and you'll really miss those Shatter combos in there, as well as whenever you pull aggro you don't have Barrier or Ice Block to save you. So play whatever brings you the most fun man. You'll do plenty DPS either way, and not too rare that I beat the Arcane Mages if I'm lucky with crits.
---
He would have if he tried to kill him. Priests counter druids easily.
---
And also not be thanked for it.
---
Meanwhile even sucks off the Mages for their free M̶i̶l̶k̶ water.
---
Just rerolled a Druid so I would be appreciated more. Warlocks are so cool and my favorite class but it's so difficult getting into groups when I don't have Poly or free stuff to offer.
---
just tried BOTH methods mentioned above, doesnt work anymore guys
---
Loot council just means we are gonna funnel the core with everything they need/want. If you aren't part of that core I really don't see why you'd stick around.
---
The same could do Hunter with feign death or anyone else with SS. Just dont do pugs and ull be fine. Guild runs are always better.
---
Yeah, had a similar ordeal. Get double attack'd on my alt, so I swap to main that I keep nearby, gank them back a couple times. They then proceed to hire 2 friends to come down and help them, kill them anyways and try to layer hop so I can go back to leveling. Then they layer hop to kill my alt again, so then I bring my friend down to help, camp em for a bit and then they call for more backup.    
---
   
---
What should have been like 1 hour of leveling in a spot turned into 4 hours of trying to get them leave.
---
Spy. Has been my favorite addon aside from bagnon. Don’t need a book when you have Spy to track enemy faction and KOS players.
---
So you have full T1, Anathema and 100% mount already? Max profs with fishing and cooking? 
---
Did you take your monthly bath already?
---
Make the alliance proud soldier o7
---
wrong
---
molten core is easy. Feral DPS is probably the best hybrid spec DPS wise in raids when min-maxed. If your guild is fine with it, do it. /u/ljr92
---
Heaven is a halfpipe
---
Who the fun people are depends on the guild.
---
Not been my experience this "loud" or "obnoxious" part. At all. Those didn't last or left for a guild more fit for their kind of obnoxiousness.
---
As usual, depends on the guild and its about finding the right fit.
---
I went Human, because fuck Gnomes. I want a waifu in a sexy dress.
---
The 5% bonuses are all meaningless. 5% of 500INT (stacking INT with Naxx gear) is only 25, not even enough INT for .5% crit.
---
Free download from the same site that has bag on and a lot of the other popular addons
---
Isn't the T1 8 pieces bonus pretty much better than anything else? Once you're hitcapped of course. As you said, it might depend on the gear you already have.
---
Like, a dwarf with the blastershot from MC would need less hit rating on gear and may want to go deep with T1?
---
Beaststalker set feels really underneath compared to what you get in MC. And it gets tricky when you start to break it because of new stuff. So Idk honestly
---
As someone who also works in IT I can't agree more with /u/lecster. Cut them some slack, they are working on it. What did you expect, that they would start spewing technical data all over twitter? No. They say "We will have more information in the next hour", meaning that THEY will have more information in the next hour so they can fix the problem, not more information for you. Your information will consist of either "It's fixed" or "still not fixed, working on it". What difference does it make if you know why it's not fixed?
---
If people are hoarding points doesn't that mean you could just pick up everything since they wont bid against you?
---
Nobody said molten core was hard or that other hybrids do more dps.
---
Smells like... victory
---
Prot at lvl 20 is worthless. It can neither tank nor dps
---
Someone needs a friend and a hug.
---
You don’t have to abandon the characters you have but I would recommend rolling a character or two on a PVE or RP (not RP-PVP) realm. 
---
You can play those characters when life on your PVP realm gets too much or just when you feel like it. In time, maybe your bf will roll a character on your new realm too. Those characters might end up being your mains. 
---
Remember, it’s your time; spend it how you want to.
---
No I'm just not overly dramatic
---
The lesson is not "don't bring a rogue" or "don't pug". The lesson is "don't wipe" :)
---
&gt;Feral DPS is probably the best hybrid spec DPS wise
---
Are we just not acknowledging that warriors are a hybrid class?
---
+1 for Druid. You can play all three roles, you can solo content with ease, your cat form boosts your travel speed at lower levels....it’s just all round fun, versatile hybrid class.
---
Can't even being punctual just says how unprofessional this billion dollar company became.
---
Sounds like your raid has a lot of problems and giving onslaught to a tank ain't gonna solve any of them.
---
That’s a low skill floor. Skill floor is how easy it is to pick up, so a low one is something that’s easy. Think about it as steps on a ladder, the higher you are the better you are
---
No one deserves to be scammed.
---
I love how you wore the fishing pole throughout the entire combat and still won.
---
Nothing before the one you sent 2 hours ago, getting you sorted now tho!
---
Not when there are 12 casters only wanting a mageblade
---
Exactly. The only time we roll on gear is if an item drops that no one wants and we will roll for offspec to avoid letting it go to complete waste. 
---
With a guild you will get the gear eventually. I'm guaranteed a wep from golemagg this week because the casters ahead of me got theirs already. With a pug, you may roll on that wep for 4 months.
---
i used to have more back in wotlk/cataclysm
---
This is the correct reply.  All about that weapon skill (unless you have edgemasters which unfortunately has no stats besides armor and ws).
---
" I don’t like sand. It’s coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. "
---
I play NE because no sand.
---
so only people with experience in running guilds should run guilds? you stupid
---
Yes. However when ZG is released, you need tailoring to profit from the set bonus of those pieces as far as I know. Take that into account before dropping your profession.
---
If you use them to craft then you need. If you give them to a crafter you use them as payment. They're just cheap about it because they're expensive.
---
honestly, both do the job.
---
Problem with destruction is that because you do "spike" damages instead of doing consistent one, you have more risks to take aggro from your pet.
---
Leveling in afflection is more efficient, but a destruction warlock still have a much better leveling than 80% of the other classes
---
*People linking screenshots with filled bags that should normally take weeks to farm.*
---
link?
---
I hit 58 and wanted to do the same. Though I do think questing (if done efficiently) is faster than dungeons, looking for group, going to the instance, etc. Stratholme is a nice choice as it has 4-5 quests you can do while grinding that precious xp. Besides, working on your pre-bis is good anyways. No need to rush to 60 if you can't afford your epic mount anyways.
---
It's not childish because updating us on time is not related to the problem itself. If they can't update us on time then don't promise update at XY. They could have said "We will post when we fixed it, ETA could be 10 hours or more" then I wouldn't complain.
---
Hunter's mark is one of the usual "mandatory/most common" debuff slot
---
Shaman tremor, grounding and purge and earth shock.
---
I love fighting warlocks.
---
All back up now
---
Usually when something goes down people have a response within 5-10 minutes.
---
"We are aware of the issue and are working on resolving it"
---
Common procedure for many companies.
---
Skinning and sell the skins to a vendor until the economy balances out and you can make a profit in the AH. So many people are still leveling that AH is bloated with skins, herbs and ores to the point that they're being sold just a bit over vendor price.
---
Thanks fellow priest who know the struggle.
---
People used lionheart helm into TBC, it's just that good.
---
Or just #showtooltip, that way it'll always show the tooltip of the next ability to be used on button press, even if you have multiple abilities in one.
---
Also saves characters.
---
Back up now
---
VERY much doubt they will do anything. 
---
I actually did play from 5.30 to 6.30 server time, didnt see anything odd until i was about to log off, when i got booted from the flying mount at area border with "no instance found" message.
---
Maybe it was earlier or later ?
---
Rogues are the gonaherpasyphalitaids of wow
---
enh shamans are the most fun ever
---
You can blow people up in both ele and enh. 
---
You collect every peice of gear. Stacking nature dmg gear is bis. Or gear with +crit
---
Yeah you're right in that point
---
We did :C
---
&gt; Shadow priest warlock is one of the  ultimate classic combos. Tons of shadow damage and fears forever. You  play off each other insanely well.
---
Don't awaken my PTSD please
---
*but they being utility*
---
The nova that put the mob next to the player... Nice!
---
On Flamelash-EU too. It seems to me they target certain people. I got much more spam when my alt was approaching level 40 than I did playing on my main at 60. Has anyone else noticed this?
---
I've done sunken temple a lot until about lvl 54. 1/3rd of a level in 2 hours or so.
---
Back up. Just have been a bad update
---
Retail wow is for millenium kids. Real OG's bang in vanilla period.
---
Personally loving clearing MC in 2 hours on Tuesday. 
---
Much more enjoyable than 10 hours a week of wiping on progression bosses in Retail for gear that just disappoints me.
---
Wasn't he  swords combat? combat sucks for pvp
---
Yojamba horde.
---
«look I can open this chest and demand the loot since i leveled lockpicking while standing afk in IF for tips.»
---
Again, what difference does it make for you if you know the exact reason it isn't working? Isn't it objectively better to get regular information every hour about the problem? Also, they are more or less exactly saying "We are still working on it". I don't see the problem here, at all.
---
There’s a lot more people doing things on a single classic server than on one private server.
---
All 60 dungeons includng UBRS can be tanked as arms with 0 points in prot without issue
---
can you open 2 cilents at once ??
---
Okay, your guide seems amazing, but would I be able to follow it as a Warrior instead of a Rogue?
---
As a preist, all i know is that I love healing bears. They offer alot of flexibility and their health poop is nearly so large. I love it.
---
How is him having full t1 or anathema relevant? Those have to drop. 
---
Outside of raid there is nothing to do but farm gold.
---
Never need on mats unless it was discussed while forming the group
---
I think you are mixing lack of empathy with overly dramatic.
---
That's your average horde player for you
---
On my EU PVE Server the devilsaur set or devilsaur leather doesn't really sell, even when I undercut every other bid for  several days now. It's at about 40G for the hands, 100G for the legs or 4G for one leather. It's the same with cured rugged hide at about 20G. Is that normal, is there just no demand for it on other servers either? Or do I have to offer it in the trade channel because no one is willing to buy it on the AH?
---
It is a mad world, started by one douche that did the first gank. It all spiralled from there. Never ending spiral of people keeping grudges. He killed your alt, you killed him with your main, he remembers the main and calls for reinforcements.. It never ends!
---
I am a pacifist rogue and just shrug at the little children in need of showing power over low lvls. Grow up and take this to the BGs when they come 🤷‍♂️
---
Maybe you shouldn't play horde/"bad guys" in a majority of population on most servers, making it almost impossible for alliance to do something in the most populated areas like Winterspring or Blackrock Mountains without dying atleast 3 times before you reach the gold. But I guess you're one of the hordes that goes "what, why did he gank me" or "what, why did he /spit me?" when that alliance player is so fed up after being ganked 10000% percent more than he gank anyone else.
---
If they're on separate accounts, sure
---
idk what game your playing all of these points are the minority most people are min macing every single thing they can , we have people walking around in nearly full mc ony gear
---
ok boomer
---
You guys are having fun? İ am on Nethergarde Keep as a Horde and Horde side is dead :/
---
TBH most effective path is to stop questing at 55ish and only getting xp through dungeons where your pre-raid bis gear will drop. This way you work on both your levelling and your gear progression towards MC.
---
Then if gold is needed (mount is not that important before P2, quality of life improvement ofc) just go through the rest of your quests wich will reward more gold when you ding 60.
---
Not viable.
---
Just pop IT before you pull??
---
Any caster can use it. There are multiple versions for each one.
---
If you're a rogue and you get the drop on someone like this and you don't get the kill, you better stick to Pve holy shit.
---
Nice ahaha
---
Haha wait, foreal? Have you just been using normal keybinds all this time?
---
Oh, but complaining about a message being posted mere minutes late by whoever runs the twitter account is childish. They never "promised" anything. It's not a launch date planned ahead of time. If you can't understand that it takes time to fix things, send the message up to the social media guys and have that sent, and you then get upset and complain, you are indeed childish.
---
Seriously, just do something else until the servers are back up lol
---
Doesn't it do this by default? I have a lot of macros so I can't remember precisely, but I do not think I have a macro for IB, I just press it again to exit. 
---
But again, I may have a macro for it but just forgot :P
---
Yeah typical horde. All those alliance stealthy lvl 60 druids and rogues sneaking up on me and attack while I am killing mobs and am several levels lower, they are secretly horde too.
---
One thing a lot of these "PvPers" have in common though is that they use this tactic because they are not that good at actual PvP. They expect you to just sit and die, or die while trying to run. Moment you fight back, you can just see the panic in their actions, and they die often.
---
&gt; Because there's a big difference between clearing MC in an hour and clearing it in 3+ hours.
---
Four and a half hours in maraudon would agree with this sentiment.
---
And this lads is why dwarf priest and paladin is one of the most disgusting race/class combinations in the game.
---
Im not American but sure.
---
That's all up to you. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Do you know when the robes are going to drop? Do you know when you're going to win the roll for them/earn them through loot council or DKP? Are the robes from MC a bigger upgrade from Robes of Winter Night than some other item if you're getting limited loot/doing a 1+raid?
---
&gt; Time to play some retail
---
No.
---
Are you brave enough?
---
Growl only costs 15 focus so it should always cast before bite, claw etc is available
---
The main reason I love dwarf, stoneform out of blind and be immune to other poisons!
---
I think pre bis for mages is robe of archmage, and beside that robe of winter night is still great but on my server pattern for the archmage robe is 90-100g so I’d look into farming that if possible. If not no problem with an alternative but aoe spec is for farming and raid spec is def different, depending on your raid comp you run with
---
This is the reason why I bought a second account to level my alts ain’t no one gonna fuck with a lvl 34 mage with a fully geared 60 warlock following it.
---
When i go de usally go round robin unless the orbs are reserved that means if i win i cant need on the next one that drops
---
It can't handle 2 40 man raids. Where as the private servers could.
---
How concerned should I be about a quiet server? I'm on Hydraxian Waterlords EU (Horde side) and it feels very quiet and a recent TSM scan revealed only 6000 items on the auction house.
---
I never played Vanilla so I'm not sure what constitutes a 'dead realm' but I imagine the impact on finding groups etc is more of a problem than it is on retail. Am I best to cut my losses or is that still a healthy population?
---
hahahahaha
---
:D
---
new to blizzard games? :D
---
What are the normal ersparen timers?
---
I think the name is Lunar Wand of Frozen Wrath, not sure what we bonus frost damage is but that one has the highest. Its a level 59 greenie. Not seen it on the AH yet but lower level wands are already going for 200g+
---
It's already been done with Teremus the Devourer, who was kited to Stormwind then Ironforge on 29th September on Pyrewood EU
---
Level tailoring and craft robes of the archmage! You can drop it afterwards until phase 3 hits so you can get the set bonus from the blood one set.
---
thank you!!
---
Okay.  Test worked.  Shards do not disappear.  Conjured items do.  I guess I just don't keep good track of how many I have at the end of the day.
---
Same on my server
---
4-5g/leather, Gloves 45g, legs 100-110g, cured rugged 12g
---
Damn you vanish bug!
---
Finding a pocket healer and doing orb/tax runs will work most of the time. People need things out of dungeons, and a tank healer combo makes the run nearly guaranteed to be smooth
---
I’d get rid of the error speech. Gets old fast.
---
How often do they drop per run?
---
If you play for the social aspect and are not interested in clearing raids or PvP'ing than try to find your own goal which makes you happy. I saw people playing the "auctioneer" class, while their gear was bad, they had much bling to show of and roleplayed their role pretty great. I saw madmen farming the pirate fraction and going all the way down with even using swashbuckler vocabulary when interacting with other players.
---
The beauty in classic is that no matter what you do, you will get something along the way that someone elses needs and by thus creating social interaction.
---
it's basically the opposite on my server, ally camp BRM with 1000 mages and sapper charges constantly.
---
The layer cool down helped prevent it from becoming too large of an issue. This specific problem is something that kept going with each reset
---
If it was no changes we'd be comp'd a day's sub
---
There are much better investments than buying fairly cheaper lotuses my friend :)
---
I do the coffers + pyro and plug, pickpocket the whole arena + guzzler unless i get caught(I do it as combat swords, so don't have prep ) and I kill the patroling fire elementals for elemental fire.   
---
It usually gives me 16-18g per run and i manage to do close to 4 runs/hr. You can open 11 coffers per run, and if you buy the keys for 30s each you still profit roughly 50g/hr. There is a bit RNG to the coffers, but on avreage, the value of the coffers has been close to 1g for me (I've used arround 1500 keys so far)
---
So after trying it out with a 6th... RFC, everyone's mostly level 15. Started with 5, getting about 200 exp per trash kill, swapped to raid, same exp. Added the 6th, same exp until he entered the instance... About 22 per. 
---
So yeah, what several people have said... Good for gearing, fun and shenanigans... Not for leveling.
---
Whats that charging ability?
---
[Eric Andre and the White House fence](https://imgur.com/gallery/q03tGyZ)
---
That's phase 4.
---
Iv had runs with 4-6 drops and iv had 4 runs with 1 drop so its very random but often atleast one per run
---
I have done 10+ runs and most runs only 1 orb drops, however, have also seen 7 in one run.
---
Dire Maul has pretty good  gear and people are starting to get MC gear. Supply is stable while demand is decreasing.
---
It may be more intensive on the people in charge but, I think the most fair system is Master Looter set &gt; Need before Greed &gt; Main Spec over Off Spec (MS can be what the person is currently doing in raid or if you want to be more lax, what they say their MS is) &gt; Round Robin (Once a piece of gear is awarded, that person is loot locked until everyone has won something or the following week \[could be extended to following two weeks if you have a lot of one class\]) This is a non-bias way left to personal RNG. It's, in my opinion, the most fair to pugs if you're having to supplement your raid and if you wish to give your guild priority you can still reserve. An alternative to reserving would be to award guild members a bonus modifier to their rolls. So you have 30 members and 10 pugs, all theoretically rolling on one item. As long as it's stated, you could say that existing guild members get a +15 bonus to their roll, breaking any ties as well as giving the guild an edge but not negating a pugs chance to some degree. Anyway, DKP works if nothing else and might be more forgiving for whoever is in charge of it! Hope this helps
---
50%
---
You'll see these numbers in two different contexts. In guild recruitment, they're talking about how many bosses they're capable of killing, based on past performance.
---
When recruiting for a pug raid (pick-up group, i.e. a one-time group composed of whoever they can find), it will usually be a warning that that many bosses are already dead, so if you join the raid you won't be able to participate in those kills or get a chance at their loot.
---
Occasionally a pug will say something like "going 8/10," in which case it means that they expect to kill that many bosses based on the skill and gear the players already in their raid have. Sometimes this is unreasonably optimistic.
---
I done same. I opened my massive bags, had no clue what the fuck anything was and logged off. Looked nice tho
---
Hey Vsauce, Michael here !
---
WAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
---
I should start playing wow with sound. That laugh is fantastically stupid
---
Not really. I love my druid. I'm a little bored of the available content as I've cleared every dungeon 4+ times and have finished MC/Ony, just trying to fill out my Heal set and get the Ony tooth and finish Breastplate of Bloodthirst more or less
---
Leveling an alt or 2 in the meantime, with bonus xp up they progress quickly
---
A mage because they pull everything at once. If not mage then probably hunter.
---
You could do this in carbonite onceuponatime in retail. Not sure if there is a classic version but worth looking into.
---
Are you speaking negatively of the Quel’Serrar?
---
Raids have serial numbers (called Raid IDs). If you kill a boss or you enter the portal to a raid that already has a dead boss, you are locked to that specific serial number until the Raid IDs are cleared/reset. The bosses do not respawn, you just have to get to a new Raid ID.
---
40-man raids (Molten Core, Blackwing Lair, Ahn'Qiraq, Naxxramas) reset every Tuesday. Onyxia resets every 5 days; it's completely independent of whether you killed it or not, the entire server will have Onyxia reset on the same day, and then get new Onyxias in 5 days. The 20-man raids reset every 3 days in the same manner as Onyxia.
---
Idgaf about personal loot but i believe karma points and corporate interests ("oh this is the best for the guild" - i never got this freakin bullshit in average guilds) shouldn't count when people equally expend time on finishing a raid. Dkp is fantastic for that but nah let's complicate it, mimic the top guild systems! Let people with god complex decide how should i play the game! Let's involve real life personality as a factor in a cartoonish game!
---
If I'm correct, nodes respawn every 10-15 minutes, but they don't necessarily spawn in the same place, they spawn instead in *other* locations so that if you sit there after mining it, it won't respawn unless someones mines ores in other locations and it *randomly* respawns in the one you're waiting at.
---
If the server resets every 5-10 minutes however, then the node is guaranteed to appear every 5-10 minutes in THAT spot.
---
I can't speak for the actual population of the Hydraxian server, but I know a few people that switched from there to Zalandar Tribe (RP-PVP) for similar reasons. So sounds like it's not just you.
---
I saw some analysis a few weeks back that put cats at (something like) 3rd highest dps spec.  And I think this was without using mcp.  It's just legacy prejudice against them.
---
Thanks for the correction! Even more time to level and enjoy a different profession!
---
What number of items constitute a healthy population?
---
Why are you on German server if you don't speak it? Raid Times?

BRUH!
---
Yesterday me and my friend camped some ally in hillsbrad and got fucked by lvl 60 dwarf rogue later, #relatable
---
This is how my rogue pvp career started. Getting ganked and camped as a low level in STV. Then i got 60, some gear, and pretty much spent half of my wow playtime in STV and Gadget. Resulted in quite a bit guild v guild ( or two ) world pvps
---
With warriors purposely excluding other warriors, shamans, hunters, rogues, and druids from their groups so they can make sure they get all the BIS plate, mail, AND leather to min max.
---
For sleeping on the work 2 hours while the servers are burning? yes.
---
But as I can see by your "boomer" comment you are an American. 
---
You guys over there are used to this bullshit, I guess that's a difference in mentality. 
---
Over here people apologize for being late by 5 minutes.
---
Yeah, that would make sense, but it's not the case :)
---
My wolf uses howl and sprint the moment I use my /petattack macro. At the target it uses growl or bite... Now it gets a bit rng, sometimes if it did bite first, the growl gets delayed even with enough focus and everything else on cd. It seems like the pet tries to use the skills dependend on their attackspeed. Never had that issue with slower pets, just with my 1.2 worg
---
Didn't make much sense to me, so I started using growl in an own macro -&gt; works much better now
---
Get a chamy with tide totem and full t1, never run out of mana and the dps obv increases again
---
My guess would be he does speak German, just she doesnt
---
I'm totally ok with being handled, even if they out level me by 30+. But corpse camping is just not cool.
---
[RangeDisplay](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/range-display), it's the retail version but it works on classic too.
---
BRE is a 4% drop from 1 boss. OEB is a 10%, 7%, 4% and 3% drop from 4 different bosses. Further, OEB has a huge chunk of skill, which reduces the need for +Hit%.
---
BRE is probably better and I'd love to have that one, but it seems extremely unlikely. 
---
Sulfuras is a bit of a joke since the cost to craft is something like 12,000g.
---
I already notice this sub has gone to shit since classic launch wont be long tell its all gone. The mods here are just as stupid.
---
Poor pet was just taking a bite from the kill :(
---
1h15 minutes later is quite close to one hour. You had your update, they are still working on it op.
---
Warlocks specced into drain tanking. 
---
You usually just throw CoA and Siphon Life at the enemy and drain the rest of their HP. This is pretty light on mana and nets you surplus HP that you can tap into getting you mana back. It's not 100% efficient without going as far as Dark Pact, but I was farming felcloth this way and getting occasional food drop was enough to sustain me.
---
I'm only specced into SM/Ruin with Fel Concentration and Improved Drain Life, but if you go as far as Dark Pact, you will never have to spend food or water outside of dungeons since your pet's mana regenerates quite fast.
---
They drew first blood.
---
Playing rogue, had no issues with competition or spots so far.
---
And just play what you want. Otherwise you won't enjoy it anyway. So go for it
---
Hunter is your best option by far. After level 10 they are on auto pilot. It's easy to be a good Hunter, and difficult to be a great Hunter.
---
Absolutely not Mage, totally not warrior. Warrior is the hardest class to level!
---
Don't listen to anyone telling you mage is fine for noobs. Sure. They're relatively easy to play, but it's als incredibly easy to be a very bad mage, and have a bad time, and piss off your your teammates.
---
Maybe also paladin for sheer survivability.
---
It’s one hell of a horse mate
---
My prot warrior friend farmed around 1k gold by clearing SM Library over and over..
---
Yesterday we were there on our alts to lvl and his dbm said he had killed The Houndmaster 88 times haha..
---
Guess its like 30g/hr which is pretty decent if youre not any farmer class and you take in consideration that its not contested since youre in an instance
---
All that rogue had to do what shoot you with his bow lol.
---
Spell batching is absolutely horrible for casters. I hate it &amp; would disable it completely
---
I dont think anyone abused this to the extent that is being claimed either. In any case with the amount of consumes used every week it should stabilize quickly.
---
lol fr i see so many LF 3 MAGES STRAT LF 3 MAGES brd arena like what the fuck
---
i appreciate the people who atleast message me back and admit they dont want a hunter most just ignore me
---
Necrosis addon removes so much situational clutter on the screen.
---
How do you deal with the soul sucking grind for pre-BiS itemization as you near 60? Im only a 49 druid and I've already slogged through my share of Mara princess runs - I've never even see the ring drop once. I've got pretty much everything else she gives that is rollable. 
---
Also what is the etiquette on rolling offspec gear? E.g. I will only have a chance of raiding in healing gear so will need to roll for that. Does that mean I can only heal in dungeon runs? What if a group NEEDS a tank, can I say "Ok but i am rolling on healing gear?"
---
You didn't watch the video. lol
---
“Why am I toxic?  Bam your done”
---
That's a darker ending to the show than I remember.
---
I just have to comment on this. Holy SHIT dude. I was listening to the Attack on Titan opening songs when I opened this up and watched it. ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i98dJLi0mkI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i98dJLi0mkI)) FUCKING TRY IT. I truly felt the essence of intensity in your fight. Putting that as background music would be perfect. NICE AND EPIC BATTLING BRUH, GG!
---
Have you tried google
---
Seriously, 1 hour is a time span. Let them write the god damtweet at least jeez...
---
Being triggered for 15 minutes delay shows that you really can’t understand the issue they’re facing...
---
no because for the same rage you can spam more Subder Armors. you'll never be able to keep up spamming all abilities on GCD and use unlimited HS (which rage-starves you line mad), on top of having to use +daggerskill items instead of harder-hitting stuff (e.g. crit, which also gives less bonus to HS as the added threat isnt multiplicative)
---
Grats, it looks so happy!
---
“I need to not use my brain, plz halp”
---
Not possible. You can use something like gathermate though.
---
Oh nice! Gonna check this one out! Ty
---
I would agree with you, that would be enough for me. The problem is that no matter what they say and when they say it- some number of people are not going to be satisfied.  When you are talking about thousands of players you are going to have some vocal group that will complain about whatever the response happens to be.
---
You probably have one individual that is authorized to make a post about this on twitter, and that person most likely has to clear any response to an emergent situation at a very high level. 
---
So, you have them trying to get an update from someone that is in the group trying to fix the problem. Those that are trying to fix it may not know what the issue is yet, and could be talking with multiple teams working on it.  Then you have to factor in that often times they think they have it, so they say to hang on a moment while they test the solution- and that takes a few minutes which pushes past the promised update time. Then the "fix" doesn't work, and they are back to troubleshooting. They might have to call in additional support staff, which takes time as well.
---
I know, I know, "multi-billion dollar company can't give a simple update".  Part of the problem is the bigger companies get- the more people involved in deciding what they can or can not announce to the public. Company execs live in fear of the social media swarm turning into a forum shitshow turning into a news media article turning into a market response.  
---
I would pretty much guarantee that everyone on the operations side would love to just give a description of the problem, what they are doing to fix it, and an eta.  No way the business side would ever let that happen- the less said, the happier they are.
---
So not only are you an idiot for assuming that silence equals inactivity, but you've also just proven that you're a generalising, prejudiced a-hole, I'm European lol
---
Good job boomer
---
and thats why you never release spirit in instances (and dont play healer) :D
---
that's so EvE online, the Ponzi i mean
---
Unfortunately I'm alliance so we don't do that here. We have blessing of wisdom from pals though. Anyway gotta wait to be full geared to enjoy a real mana pool hehe
---
I play horde because my friend does.
---
I'm a nice horde. I'll leave you alone.
---
But if you provoke me, you. will. die.
---
black lotus respawn is 2-2.5 hours.
---
they are worth about 30g each.
---
so one herb every 10min over 5 hours means they made 900 gold.
---
so 180g/ hour
---
Ugh, hunters can do this too, even more often :)
---
I thought barrens was a friendly Horde Zone, why are you in PvP mode
---
Great song.
---
&gt; What if a group NEEDS a tank, can I say "Ok but i am rolling on healing gear?"
---
Yes, it's best to try and find a group that's ok with you rolling on healing gear.
---
Thanks, I'll see if I can find a version compatible with classic.
---
Quests like these are unfortunately ruined by the ridiculous spawn rates of magically appearing out of nowhere lvl 55 guards when you so much as look at a civilian NPC.
---
Ach, trolling the enemy faction towns used to be fun. Now it's just another item on the list of "things you used to do but can't do anymore because SOMEONE didn't enjoy it"
---
Thanks, I actually do have tomtom but never got full use out of it (it's required for another addon). I'll test it out!
---
Yes, they are called savoury deviate delight, or noggenfogger elixer, or just accept the quirky looking gear you have like 90% of the population (basically everyone who isn't lucky enough to have a full set of gear already)
---
I wouldn't buy the mount with gold you need for gearing, but on the other side:
---
Think about how you want to get gold, if a lot of moving around is involved, buy the mount
---
Que stupid WoW developer quote.
---
I think there are just lots of bad rogues about... A rogue got an opener on me while fighting a southshore guard last night and you bet I killed him
---
How do you do other moomans?
---
I’ve found groups are pretty chill if at the start you tell them you’re looking for healing gear. But when I do hunt for off-spec, I don’t need on main spec unless nobody hits need and everyone says I can need if it’s an upgrade.
---
[This is my UI atm,](https://i.imgur.com/y6vTQ3t.png) pretty clean I'd say.
---
As a rouge, can I wear spell hit equip to lower the chance of mobs to resist my pickpocketing?
---
Anecdotally the warrior who has it in our guild is pretty regularly #1 on the meters.
---
On solo target fights where there is ample time to get all the debuffs on target it really doesn't do anything special. On multitarget or short fights though (and most of the MC bosses are like 1m or less) it is pretty great.
---
Needing on high level crafting mats outright, without any reservation or discussion, is grounds to get kicked. You bet you get booted and outed in chats if you go assing yourself through dungeons and Need on all Righteous Orbs, Elemental Fires etc without asking or communicating.
---
How did you get the nice thicc borders?
---
I am leveling a tank alt so I can just... Help people. Cause I dont like this nonsense.
---
I got a +21 fire one on my 49 destro lock twink after 20ish runs!
---
Ahh okay, you actually dont need to do that do you? Since you can bind all marks in the key binding option
---
very cool of you , if i could tank as a hubter i would
---
I would do the quests and once done focus on doing instance for pre raid gear which will generate alot of gold itself u wont have time to do quests at 60 since all ur time will be spent on getting all pre raid bis
---
lol, I know, right? People asking for conveniences like addons is hilarious. Next they'll be asking for auctioneer, node gathering, quest info, enemy cast bars and boss info addons. What WON'T people do for convenience next amirite?
---
I only accept blood money made from troll child labor in South Kalimdor.
---
Thanks for the comment. I will try gathermate.
---
I got to do this one time so far and it was so damn satisfying I can’t even tell you.
---
900
---
"I'm sorry my LP isn't quite high enough to open the chest." - Me everytime I see the "locked" in gray/green.
---
far from sneaky if you've literally ever fought a decent warlock before. still amazes me that I catch people with it.
---
its actually the fastest way , especially if you can gather good players to group with the whole way
---
Just some rando who thinks he's smarter than the people who literally researched this for years and make their lives doing it.
---
Pay!? You stole trees and destroyed many elfs and whisps homes. Just to build your mudhole you call home.
---
No sane warrior uses Mortal strike in a raid. Heroic strike crits just as well.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9UycYU9328
---
 Herbalism/Mining is a bad idea. You can't activate both on your minimap at the top right corner. You can see either herbs or mines nearby, but you can't see both. Don't know about any add-ons that could enable that, though.
---
cant really win pvp fights if you're pve spec
---
It's called Gathermate2 in Classic :)
---
Ok so you're citing posts you've seen here and not something you've actually seen happen in game, what makes you think those posts your citing aren't doing same exact thing? I see those posts, and I run a ton of dungeons on all my characters and have NEVER seen it once despite Reddit telling me it happens all the time.
---
The delay is too high during the switches, it won't work that good
---
Just farm areas, after a week or two you'll know where to switch (gatherer makes that even easier)
---
It's the male orc crying sound.
---
The general loot distribution is first is reserved for a tank (because it's very difficult to get a tank for strat living there's nothing in there a Warrior tank would want), then round robin.
---
You could try and establish loot rules that favour you on orbs, but it's comparatively easy to find a healer for living so you'd just be skipped over/nobody would join.
---
I don't believe the "ethic" of "I'm a crafter I need it" when it comes to consumables - everybody needs practically every consumable, whether that's for equipment, enchants or potions. If you value their use over their price, you'd have already bought them. With your logic, an Enchanter should need on every single equipment drop
---
Honestly your guild sounds like a very toxic place.  A bunch of brown nosed raiders and officers with squeaky clean assholes.
---
I’m sucking up to the bosses on my work time because I’m getting paid. No way in hell im going home and spending my free time sucking up to some fucking nerd on the internet.
---
This is not consistent with other reports. It definitely wasn't this way for everyone. If some people got lucky and did this then good for them but I doubt we will see a significant impact.
---
you mean warlock. aint no rogue 2v1-ing any half decent pvpers. warlocks on the other hand...
---
Shaman self res, warlock soulstone, It's not just rogues that can do this. Hunter feign too maybe? Sorry I can't remember how good or bad feign is
---
Then probably not lotus spawns. I'm actually confused about the OP also mentioned arena trinkets given the arena only works every three hours.
---
You can do lbrs as well.
---
Are you on Mirage Race Way by any chance? Its the same story there. I find the AH is ridiculous with players massively underselling items i imagine due to lack of patience with selling.
---
Hopefully bringing down the cost of black lotus. Whats the downside?
---
Mh, but why didn't it show the locations of the herbs? It didn't even let me filter the herbs I was looking for. Do I need some database installed?
---
You're correct on the Sunder cycling.
---
Another thing I find useful is marking a target for the dps to nuke and then just ignoring it. Whilst they kill that mob you can build threat on the others. This is especially viable if you have another warrior in the group as they'll be able to shrug off the damage from 1 elite easily.
---
Demo Shout spam is for when you have 6+ mobs and things hectic. This generally only comes about when there's a bunch of non-elites which aren't super threatening. In such situations you're main focus is to keep them off the healer. If a dps draws aggro from a non-elite it's a non-issue.
---
Just to add to the 20 other people on this sub, I've also tanked all dungeons upto ST (i'm level 52 atm) in fury/arms specs and had no issue with it. Enrage in the fury tree is actually great for tanking. You will be getting crit often due to having no extra defense when levelling pretty much a 100% uptime for me.
---
dm me and i will grant you farm spot
---
His/her epic mount will last them their whole WoW career rather LOL.
---
I got my epic mount like 5 days ago and I'm already back up to almost 700g. I have herbalism and the epic mount helps a ton with that. Get that epic mount and you can farm Devilsaurs for the mats for those pieces much more quickly as well.
---
what are those numbers on mouse over ? 5 - 20 ?
---
Throw him in the maelstrom
---
Nothing falls off if u change stance.
---
what MU isn't void good against? 2k shield good vs literally everyone. its just that felhunter is better vs some MUs.
---
Renew is 100 percent trash. It’s decent in 5 mans if you want to be lazy. But when talking raiding its useless. By the time your renew does 2 ticks a shaman Druid and priest has already been healing the tank and most of the renew is wasted you can look at logs to see this. And dps it will be also be wasted due to chain healing. It’s a huge waste of mana. You’re example is useless I don’t give a fuck how much a max rank renew heals because of the mana cost and the fact I could throw out a heal plus flash heal for the same cost. And if you have less healing than the other priests and they try casting it it will be overridden and again completely wasted. It’s useless.
---
I agree, but it's not about efficiency. It's just this odd personal preference, farming like this for a couple of hours is relaxing and entertaining to me. Something about this flow you get into "kill a mob, another one, another one, another one" without needing to stop (drinking/eating ruins the flow).
---
How dare you ask other players for advice on a subreddit for a multiplayer game, what a shameless attempt at starting up a discussion. You should be ashamed of yourself!
---
Maybe don't make sweeping judgements about thousands of players just playing the class they love the most.
---
I do not see the connection fren
---
Oh yeah I’m just going from what I’ve read. I tank and usually only bring guildies
---
I know I'm a little late to the party, but as someone who's new to tanking I've been using this chart for the past two months now and it's been a super valuable resource, thanks so much for putting this together!
---
You've been conditioned to fight mobs that mostly fight in predictable manner.
---
You'll know what to do once BG's start and you get some experience fighting people.
---
Some will hate this story, but I find it hilarious.
---
What does the scouter say about his power level?
---
Buddy it was an attempt at humor.
---
Oh dear, the drama some people come up with....
---
Druid is trash healing from my exp in dungeons
---
They will not transfer you
---
You just have to decide if you want to stick with that ping/schedule or level to 27 again. 27 isn't much at all, I'd just do that if it means being able to play with people at peak times.
---
That guy was really really bad.... you both are...
---
No sane warrior uses Heroic strike ever unless to much rage. Hits ways less, is not instant, and make you generate way less rage on a heroic strike swing you gain no rage.
---
Oh so it's like if I went to a hospital and demanded a chance to get a dialisis machine just because I need the money I could make out of it. I'll just roll a dice with a diabetic person with renal failure. I mean if they needed it they would probably pay out of pocket for it, right?
---
Get the global ignore list addon.  Expands the limit beyond 50, and asks you for a note why you ignored the person.  I noticed my ignore list was actually full before I got it.
---
Okay, thanks!
---
What about off-hands for example?
---
Or other equipment like the engineering helmet?
---
Last night run in MC my guild got it's 4th OEB and 2nd Spinal Reaper. In about 7 MC runs. No legendary's as of yet. And almost no rogue loot. I would say it's just RNG.
---
i was agreeing with you. the 5% came from the person you quoted, i tried to provide an example as to what a bullshit number the 5% was.
---
Everyone levels as combat, both rogues and rouges.
---
My lock that was made specifically with this in mind is now lvl 32 and I can only go for about 5 to 6 mobs before I need to drink/eat. I've been going Immolation &gt; Corruption &gt; Drain Life as one video suggested this. Is my method wrong or does it get better with levels (Dark Pact obviously helps).
---
I just want to be sure before I invest days of /played into this.
---
Yeah that's bs, the chest doesn't spawn after server restarts. There was a bug on the night when winter time was activated that caused the chest to respawn repeatedly, though.
---
You're right, a guild that invited me to play WoW and then expected my WoW-playing to revolve around chatting on the phone would not be a good fit for me.
---
Maybe stop being so anal
---
You have to locate the herbs in the first place. Once you have found them they will be logged and constantly show on your mini map. There is a filter for herbs you have already found in the addon options.
---
While I find Mara very boring DM North is actually pretty challenging, with the chance of sometimes getting stuff that's worth A LOT of gold, that you can sell to other players.
---
I do you see your point, but most lucrative spots are usually completely camped by other players as of now, because of layers being reduced or removed.
---
You should still be deep frost for dungeons. The arcane power spec is really just for raids
---
I noticed you clicked off ice block buff. Make a macro with the following lines   
---
1. \#showtooltip
---
2. /dismount
---
3. /cancelaura Ice Block
---
4. /cast Frostbolt  
---
This will allow you to use one key to perform all these functions. It's a nice one-stop-shop macro to dismount, cancel ice block and cast frost bolt.
---
Paladin. Just autoattack enemies and never die. Maybe press 1 button every 30 seconds if you're feeling wild.
---
First off, you can only swap weapons mind-combat.
---
Second, all usable items go on 30 second cooldown when equipped.
---
Third, unequipping the item usually ends the effect.
---
You can say what you want questing beats dungeons especially in classic with travel times... the only times dungeons are better are when you have quests in the dungeons
---
'most' people? I think that's observation bias. If you're in a raiding crowd, that's who you will see most.
---
I'm on an RP server, I haven't seen a 'go go go' 'ty bb' player at all and I'm running BRD atm.
---
So i can do the above too? Or only LBRS
---
Around 4k.
---
Best part about being alliance - being a night elf and humiliating edgy undead pvp leetbois.
---
That being said PVP is definitely an afterthought for some alliance players, I've PM'd people and literally been told "I don't really care about PvP" whilst trying to scrounge up a defense. 
---
That reasoning is why I went alliance in the end - all the best / hungriest pvpers roll horde, so there is always someone decent wanting a scrap. Instead of just bullying a nelf ERPer over and over.
---
Classic wow is one of the biggest MMO's on the market. Unlike other MMO's you can't pay to win. Gold has REAL value. You can buy some incredible power and advantages in game using gold. Is it really a surprise that classic wow gold has so much real world value?
---
&gt; old orc's trophy rack. 
---
Which is right above a Paladin's fireplace.
---
i've had a rogue refuse to open the chest (so he could go and get it himself after the instance was done).
---
I've also had a rogue rolling need on lootboxes.
---
but 90% of rogues I've experienced unlocks chests and allow the group to roll
---
How much do streamers even make? I know the big ones can easily pull 6 figures a month (whatever I pulled that estimate out of my ass). But like... how much would be a more realistic estimate of what an average streamer makes?
---
Well done sir.
---
You can do the above, but prepare to be rejected by 60s who don't want a character with increased aggro radius slowing down their speed clears
---
27 is not that high. Just start over
---
Stormwind king is actually kind of trivial to kill if you have the people.  Our guild went after an MC 1 night.  We started in Ironforge.  But our 40 didn't accomplish much...  At one point spy was showing over 200 people.  We ran to the tram which brought us back to life.  Got killed in the tram.  This sends you to the Elwyn Forrest graveyard.  We ran back to the tram zone.  Zoned out.  Died again in the tunnel in stormwind.  From there you can res above that tunnel in the castle not far from the king, and it's an easy kill.
---
We were kind of just winging it honestly.  I was fairly confident it was a hopeless raid after seeing we were outnumbered more than 5 to 1 in Ironforge.  But we were able to salvage it at peak time and still kill the stormwind king...  So not really much of an accomplishment.  Better than darnassus I guess.
---
The 1 thing I was excited about, is after the first death in Ironforge we did a coordinated res, and managed to kill all the auctioneers.  Unfortunately they respawned about 2 minutes later...  lol  I thought FPs typically stay down for 30 minutes, so I was hoping the auctioneers would be the same.
---
thing about tanking not in Prot spec, especially in raids and maybe UBRS too, is that its all down to how well geared your healers are!  A newly dinged level 60 will struggle to heal a warrior who is not prot specced and not using a shield.
---
Sweet, cheaper stuff.
---
As a Shaman healer, having a Druid tank roll need on Verdant Footpads for his "boomy off spec" drove me nuts, because I said before the run that it was the only thing I was after :(
---
You can do that in the default settings for key bindings.
---
Good idea is LBRS and farm the first 2 bosses for attunement. For other instances, it depends on your class and role. For example, you will have a very hard time finding scholomance groups as a Rogue at 58, but priests and mages are needed in there. 
---
As a tank, people will take you at 58, no matter your gear or level. Desperate times, but people need their tanks
---
&gt; I just got super lucky but sometimes you gotta take luck!
---
Yep. This is WoW Classic. :)
---
It doesn't fall off. Sweeping Strikes + Whirlwind is amazing and requires stance switching. Your WW hits 4 targets, and with Sweeping strikes those hits will each hit an additional target.
---
You start in Battle Stance, Charge, Sweeping Strikes, Switch to Berserker Stance, Whirlwind, then switch to Defensive Stance to tank. It's just a nice opener. You'll still be in defensive stance 95% of the fight.
---
Protection in Classic is still good for tanking raid bosses. But I found it much more difficult to tank 5 mans as deep protection. Fury/Prot or Arms/prot is just a smoother 5 man tanking build from my experience.
---
Which also assumes no competition, which there would have been. OP is completely exaggerating the effect of just a couple of hours of this.
---
100% fury? Meaning don't branch into arms or prot at lvl 40+?
---
ive been using 2 full different sets when i was fresh 60. now switch ony 3 items (ring, trinket, cloak). having 3 t1 pieces and staff of dominance, rest pre-raid bis. im at 2800hp, 6400mana buffed 310sp(358 vs UD)
---
It's normal. Join a guild.
---
The great thing about guild raids is that even if you lose a roll, you're one step closer to getting the item the next time it drops. So eventually you'll get everything. With pickup groups and free-for-all loot rolls, there's no guarantee that you'll ever get any loot.
---
Fair warning though, being in a guild or not,  a full set of epic gear does not come easy in classic, for most classes anyway. There's always that elusive tier piece or weapon that only seems to drop when you are not there.
---
You sacrifice spell power for Stam.
---
Lol no where near that much gold made. Done it millions of times. Unless level 35 health pots go for a lot on your server. I highly doubt it
---
Roll an alt and play with her until she catches your main up. WoW is all about community/people to play with. She can't play with most of the server as she doesn't speak German, she can't play with you beause you're a level ahead.
---
Imagine the shoe was on the other foot and you had to play a game you didn't really understand with your Mrs who's levels ahead of you and every time you get closer to her level, her level is suddenly ahead of you again.
---
What I'd do is roll druid, tank dungeons for her until she hits close to you. Level as a duo, pop out and heal her as she'll be pulling threat from outdamaging kitty 20+. That way you play together, she experiences this new game with you instead of by herself.
---
Its a known issue.  All the nodes are shifted a little bit.
---
Lock is talking?
---
warlocks are so busted
---
I dont remember. it was a long time ago. I think maybe BGs used to flag you?
---
All i know is that people would get ganked quite a bit in barrens on my server. I know Alliance loved to go into cross roads and killing all the NPCs. If i am not mistaken, there was a time when not all NPCs were elite boss level. They would roll in and kill the flight master and start fighting all the other NPCs and i think then low levels would join the fights thinking all them plus the NPCs could win. That would get a lot of people flagged for a while.
---
Anyways, me a couple of my friends from my BG group kept mains in crossroads to restore peace as needed, when we werent in BG raid times.
---
What class are you? Healer should be OK-ish. DPS is a bit riskier. Tank, I wouldn't bother tbh.
---
I am German, I live in Germany like my friends I am playing with. My GF is living here too but she is from Sweden and is still learning the language. So she started on the same server as me.
---
I was going to say something really passive aggressive, like "never seen slow fall/noggenfogger before?"  That legit caught me off guard.
---
and your HS do less threat. it still is worse Threat/Rage than Revenge, SA, SS or BT.
---
You vs the skelehorse she tells you not to worry about
---
Not for the hordys like op
---
Ohhh well as soon as PVP Comes around just always wear your PVP trinket + one other trinket and you are fine :D
---
When someone thinks turning the servers off stopping *everybody* from playing is a solution to a handful of crafting materials, you know they have no idea of the severity of that action.
---
Hmm, odd. Perhaps something went wrong with the installation or something. Basically the nodes were way off, it was telling me herbs were inside houses, in the sea etc. Places they they certainly shouldn't be. I don't have any other map addons so can't have been a conflict. I might try it again.
---
Looks like he's having a drinking problem. Fighting for his liquor!
---
Notice me guys pls.
---
Sitting in the Same boat. Feels like I'll hit lvl60 when nobody is interested in mc anymore :|
---
I dunno man, not just once i was in situation where shield slam was on cd, revenge wasn't active and heroic strike being tied to auto attack had +-2sec before activation. In moments like this is sunder armor fastest way how to get rid of redundant rage. But I am not profi, so maybe i am just missing some detail in the rotation.
---
mine have been mostly right. a few were way off but veeeery few and far between. id say 95% correct.
---
I have 3800 on my priest before fort, and my gloves have 0 stamina so I could easily get 4k. That's mostly int/stam items, damage isn't as important until you get beefy enough.
---
Necropile set is key.
---
Was in a LBRS group with two hunters who either body pulled or pulled with their pet and wiped us 2 or 3 times. Guess who didn't have to corpse run? The ones responsible for the wipes...
---
Haha, that's a great idea!
---
Hey, orcs only have 8x the resistance that everyone else does!
---
Oh, wait, that's A LOT.
---
What's the good picture album or video of how the war between horde and alliance progressed on the map in the Warcraft universe? Something in the style of real war progress maps, with cities captured and territories effectively controlled. I'm new and starting getting curious about the lore
---
Seeing a lot of conflicting reports about shaman levelling. Some say shield + 1h with flametongue is best, others say 1h shield + wf. Some say 2H + rockbiter is king, others say 2h + wf. Bit confused.
---
I'm also hearing that rerolling to Ele at 40 is great, but then others say enhance is amazing 40-60.
---
I'm moslty concerned about fun. I like using lots of abilities, I like taking on lots of enemies and generally surviving. I like playstyles that are engaging. I like the spell-warrior nature of shaman too. Any tips?
---
Full T1 is BiS for hunters lol
---
Not 60
---
Why didn't you just write "REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE"
---
Depends man, if they're gonna take the guild + raids seriously, a healer might be a great idea to keep the ball rolling. 
---
Then again, warlocks are, in my opinion, the best all-around dps class because you can deal respectable damage throughout the phases (you only get stronger on each phase!), bring a lot of utility (soulstone for that morale boost post-wipe) and you're one of the best PvP classes...
---
It boils down to what playstyle you'd like!
---
Yep!
---
8/8 is way better than 6/8 + 2/8
---
Yeah Kazzak's mechanic was that when he killed someone he regained HP I believe, so once you kited him to a major city he was basically unkillable and had to be despawned.
---
You got it!
---
Missing, how so?
---
Me plenty of times 14 years ago so I chose warlock this time around
---
20 hours ZF for a mageblade, easy trade
---
Now you’ll know better.
---
Ahhh yes. Banning people when they already achieved what they wanted is definitely so helpful.
---
Blizzard could have reverted these players back to their pre-abuse states, but they chose not to.
---
Sure the imp has higher mana regen. I don’t deny that. But both act as an infinite mana battery because you don’t run out of mana using either pet. That is my experience from drain tanking 40-60.
---
Anyway I never saw a drain tank using a passive imp before so I am sure they are quite rare. 
---
I guess most people would agree the succ has a clear advantage, if you think otherwise so be it.
---
I just think it’s bad advice to give to a levelling player. Let’s leave the argument here because I don’t think we will come to an agreement.
---
Yeah, I can seee why dkp can be garbage on progression.
---
Check this out: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dokdmd/blizz_post_saying_righteous_fury_greater_blessing
---
Oh right, the 4th undead racial. Dispel magic
---
Yes but sometimes you have 80 rage and need to burn some so you don't cap out at 100 rage next time you get hit. This is the part about burning off excess rage with heroic strike.
---
Nah no
---
Is there any addon that can add up your /played across all characters for classic?
---
I'm not the best to help there I'm afraid as I don't use any addons.
---
I do use this macro however, which freely swaps between battle stance and defensive stance, whilst also swapping your weapons.
---
#showtooltip
---
/use [form:2]Battle Stance;Defensive Stance
---
/equipslot 16[equipped:shields]TWO-HANDED-WEAPON-NAME;
---
/equipslot 16 [noequipped:shields]ONE-HANDED-WEAPON-NAME
---
/equipslot 17 [noequipped:shields]SHIELD-NAME-GOES-HERE
---
The caveat is that if you happen to be in Def stance with a 2-hander, it'll swap you into battle stance with a 1-hander and shield. Writing this out I realise that you may be able to solve this with the following Macro, but i'm not able to test at the moment.
---
/equipslot 16[form:1]TWO-HANDED-WEAPON-NAME;
---
/equipslot 16 [form:2]ONE-HANDED-WEAPON-NAME;
---
/equipslot 17 [form:2]SHIELD-NAME-GOES-HERE
---
Also If you have any abilities that are exclusive of stance (eg. Hamstring/Disarm) that you don't want to bind to the main actionbar you can always use a macro to combine them. For example:
---
/use [form:2]Disarm;Hamstring
---
The above checks to see if the player is in defensive stance (form:2), if it's not, it tries to cast hamstring (usable in battle and beserker stance which are form:1 &amp; form:3 respectively). #showtooltip means that the icon/tooltip shown on your action bar will be the one cast.
---
I get like 10 of these patterns in a few hours of grinding winterspring furbolgs
---
No, I am on Lakeshire. 
---
Even with the low prices items don't sell. I had the only Wolfshead Helm for  sale for a while, and it took at least 5 days of relisting it until it sold for about 5G. Seems like there is just no demand, even for supposed BiS items? It's a bit confusing to me.
---
Well you can only use it one, chap.
---
You just said you'd use it on fear, if you use on seduce then get death coiled then feared
---
&gt; so bad
---
auto shot on 1
---
Bit of a straw man there... nothing prevents any other loot system from considering what class an item is best for. It's why shaman A should get the leggings over shaman B that loot systems deal with.
---
That's the thing with most private servers - the database was open source and gatherer-type addons were based on that fact.
---
In Classic, players have to figure out the node locations on their own. Addons are used to sync known node locations ingame or to upload and share them with other players.
---
One of those projects is [GatherMate2_Data](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/gathermate2_data).
---
Was this before or after they tried to raid org? I was leveling my alt and my buddy told me the alliance were attacking org but they didn't get very far
---
If druid is better geared, he will win. If priest is better geared, druid will run away. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Just hit lvl 56, and I'm wondering if there's anything I can start doing to get attuned to MC or Onyxia (or anything else?, or should I wait until lvl 60?  If so, where to start?
---
Then youre taking a spot for someone who would need gear from MC. That is not a good reason.
---
It's called a conductor, and she's the 'director' of the orchestra. She sets the tempo and tone using hand signals and body language/facial gestures.
---
Which castbar addon do you use?
---
Everything is keybound dude, you just can't see it cause I hide the second action bar.
---
With my setup I've got two full action action bars of modifier macros set up. Each macro supports a minimum of 4 spells or items, so that's 4*24 = 96 keybinds. You're seeing 12 of them.
---
Obviously I'm using a cooldown tracker addon to keep from losing my sanity.
---
Damn. I wish I had some camaraderie and friendship, my guild blows.
---
Rest in peace, Jens!
---
Owned that noob lulz
---
Internet hyperbole drama.
---
Ah yes the weekly economy is getting trashed Thread
---
Bro didn't you know?  Literally everyone on this sub is highly qualified to speak to the technical incompetence of Blizzard based solely on how much money Blizzard makes a year.  Something something price servers ran better.
---
Negative.  It was my first character, and I never really dabbled with any other, so I was straight Naive.  I just thought the grind was slow as it was for everyone else.  I will tell you that I was near un-gankable due to the amount of mana I maintained.  Got ganked by 3 horde my lvl in STV and took them out!  Most memorable WOW Experience.
---
In all my dungeon runs so far I havnt had a single group where I though "Wow, such nice people" 
---
EVERY single dungeon has consisted of someone whinging about other dps'rs being low Or the tank pulling to slow/little
---
Or people ninjalooting
---
Or people quitting halfway through Because they only wanted an item from the first boss
---
Or people being rude because someone doesnt know everything about their class or doesnt have BiS.
---
Thank you for taking the time to write this. I'm thinking about getting into AoE grinding on my Pally so reading this is a huge help.
---
I'm only level 34 at the moment so can't fully get into doing this, but even being able to take on three mobs/chain mobs together in a nice change of pace.
---
Never see Dark Hooded Cape on AH LVL 32 4 str 10agi what should I post for?
---
there have been tons of roll backs, sadly somethings get through, the ethereal trader was another one that was duped a lot, some times the damage is done and cant be easily rolled back, the traders for example were put on the AH and long sold before it was dealt with and a roll back would have effected a lot more than just rectifying the duped item
---
Neck, Back, Trinkets, Rings
---
Hating xD is so 2014
---
Dunno why you're replying to a post that's a month old lmao
---
what a humorous post
---
Appreciate it but thats not what I am looking to discuss here.
---
Argh! This post has made it worst, I'm now debating druid or warlock. Druids are rare and I've played it at Vanilla so I'm fully expecting the watered down hybrid experience I grew to love back then. Resto druids can be insanely powerful once geared, and a 21/30 hybrid spec can mean I can tank as/when needed in 5 mans.
---
The warlock would be a shout but I think the fact I've just pushed one to 52, got about 200g and robe of the winter night already makes me feel sad/apprehensive/annoyed/all sorts of emotions about levelling again.
---
I might just druid to 60 then warlock alt as/when. Although warlock to 60 first means I have better access to gold farming.
---
Damn this is a minefield.
---
As a warlock, I've been asked from several hunters to go help with the demon in Silithus. Easy money, can't complain. One time, while my guy was kiting him, a player passed by and hit him and he just despawned. 
---
The worst part? It was another hunter. 
---
Even worse? He was from our faction.
---
Switch to a pet with screech like an owl, carrion bird or bat. They can keep aggro on multiple mobs no problem. Also teach her the "oh snickerdoodles I got aggro" button, feign death
---
Ye report him
---
Man, as a fellow druid i have to say. i'm very impressed with your play, well done my dude.
---
Yes, there is no lack of empathy for her situation. That is why I am thinking about how to include her better.
---
I have actually created a druid a few days ago. I didn't think I would be able catch up to her but because she reduced her playtime quite a bit that might be the best option. It is reaffirming if you think that would be a good duo. Thanks
---
LET ME INNNNNN
---
If you need that ring just find a warlock friend/pay a warlock to join their princess farming runs. Usually about 20-30g.
---
The dude clearly knew what he was doing. He predicted a lot of the rogues moves, and was waiting for opportune times to bait the rogues CDs. I don't think he was in any danger because he still had sm on standby and he was good at form shifting.
---
I stopped using immolate pretty much entirely around level 40 unless I really needed to nuke something, and corruption is is nice when you don't care about mana for nightfall, and when you need to do damage faster, but CoA and Siphon Life seem to give me the best bang for the buck. However I would only recommend using Siphon Life only from rank 3 onwards, otherwise it is not very efficient.
---
Is gearing a mean to progressing in raids, or is progress a mean to get better gear?
---
Finaly a classic quality content.
---
I did but the comment didnt specify that he meant the server issue.. so I assumed he meant the world pvp interaction.
---
[Dominos](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/dominos) for my castbar, it's an action bar addon but it includes a cast bar as well. For the target cast bar I use [ClassicCastbars](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiccastbars) but I don't think it's pictured in the video.
---
You sir is a MVP
---
they did have items removed, problem is if they sold the item it's not easy to deal with. imagine you got the pattern off the AH not realising it was gained through the layer abuse and then used it got the mats together and made the item, thinking you just got lucky to get the pattern when suddenly you have been rolled back to before you got the pattern, how would you feel?
---
So I was running strath ud last night and a rogue was in our group. Gargoyle cloak dropped which is bis for my tank. It's in the optional slot for him on his bis list and of course I lost the roll. Is it ever ok to roll for an item if it's your 2nd or 3rd bis over someone else's 1st bis? I mean his cloak drops from baron and I felt like I got ninja'd. Should I be salty or nah?
---
Ok, that is what I suspected. Checking online ppl said they could enter alone...but they were probably referring to later expansions. Thanks.
---
well honestly im just looking for some way how to level paly, since i did 26 levels as ret at i just cant find strength to continue, i need something else, something more engaging :)
---
133 upvotes. 0 comments. Has nothing to do with Classic Wow. Low effort post.

Mods must be sleeping because something fucky is going on here.
---
&gt; thinking you just got lucky to get the pattern when suddenly you have been rolled back to before you got the pattern, how would you feel?
---
The same way people feel when police arrive telling them they've bought contraband?
---
what numbers do you use for SA vs HS Threat?
---
this is great
---
Had the same bug on gromgol-kargat fly
---
I was fall in elwyn forest near stormwind
---
Need roll = upgrade for main spec, it would be very nice of him to give it to you but no obligation.
---
sap one, kill the other. If sap timer is ending before you finish the other guy, use blind/gouge
---
Whats your point? How does this relate to you taking a spot from someone who needs it when you don't?
---
horde has higher than alliance. I myself have still trouble getting a feel of when can I HS without starving myaelf for abilities afterwards
---
If it's an upgrade for him over his current cloak, I'd say he had every right to roll for it. Only allowing people to roll on their absolute bis is bullshit, imo.
---
Whenever you get ganked you wanna release asap. Don't give them the pleasure
---
It's 2 sometimes 3 nodes per run. And not many people want to run dm:e anymore. Some people occasionally for the bow but lots of people just want West and north. So still relatively hard to find people, especially jump runs. Almost everyone who wants to run it wants a full run for the key.
---
It’s quite difficult to prioritize pvp over pve, as if you want to raid, you need to at least organise 40 people to connect for the same o eject I’ve while 10 is sufficient for a battleground.
---
Therefore, if you start to organise a raid and finish by having an epic pvp battle in BRM, lots of people are going to complain because it was not what was planned in the first place, and this even if they love pvp.
---
The point is, as long as you organise your pve session properly, having pvp being a priority could be done easily.
---
Finally, I think people focus a lot on having a pre BiS gear now because they can do it outside raid, that’s why they are focusing on this. Once you don’t have more things to do than wait for BWL, pvp will rise, in the world or bgs
---
Tbh Taurens should be the ones with that buff. Big, tanky, the single largest race lore wise, the most sturdy of bois. The tauren were really only getting beat by the centaur because the centaur reproduced EXTREMELY fast and Taurens are even slower at reproduction than the Undead. That's their biggest weakness tbh. Lorewise regular Tauren warriors body basically every other race except for few exceptions of very powerful warriors of the races, in which case Cairne would body them. They just have so few numbers that their power alone can't save them from massive armies, but small skirmishes? Nobody beats the Tauren.
---
Reminds me of a time when a chicken tender tried to come out of my nose. I can still remember how it felt going back down.
---
Bold guess : you had a pet matching your looks
---
What would you then have done in this very scenario? If I as a healer die, or we wipe, you better have a very good explanation why you are not running with the rest of us if you actually expect a res.
---
I wasn't implying they were mutually exclusive. I stated the contrast between two elements of the game and highlighted which of the two actually matters towards giving the game life. I later used "min-maxing elitists" as a category of min-maxers, not implying there is only one type of min-maxer.
---
Looks like a blemmyes
---
Isn't it pretty good in dungeons but lackluster in raids ?
---
As a hunter I've found whispering people specifically what gear you want usually works best. Usually I already have a piece from a place and want another but get completely ignored if I don't point out what I want.
---
Awesome! I want my t1 set and QS! so cool looking, grats.
---
I am bout to be 56 so a bit ahead
---
Learning to do it on purpose could have... Interesting PvP applications.
---
it's in the interface settings
---
It devalues regular farming of lotus.
---
What did you say?
---
Perhaps if this was a hard progression pushing guild LC would make sense. Those guilds don't really exist in Classic though, maybe in later phases, but who knows almost everyone over estimated the difficulty of classic in general. Getting gear is part of the fun part of WoW in lieu of other achievements, after you have a raid on farm what else are you going to do? It's not about trusting the guild to distribute loot it's a sense of control of how you receive loot. DKP system works because even if you lose on the bid you will have points for the following week and let's you evaluate what piece is more important. I feel like it's a bit too much to go into the decision making process in a post but.
---
Bias as in even if you have your set 40 man core team from the get-go cliques always form, I'm not saying the new guy get the big pieces as soon as he joins but even if it was the case, so what? It's highly dependant on your guild recruiting process and how it's set up. If you're so into this tight knit group of people who trust each other to make the best decision for the guild then every member you recruit should be part of the equal. My entire time in WoW I've only been in two such guild, they both still use DKP. If you're a tight knit crew you're not going to pull douchebagery moves to get gear with DKP anyways.
---
Yes, that's true. Also to point out: I was fully tank geared on onyxia. 400+ defense 5% hit rating for decent tps. My tanking gear is pretty good. 
---
Tank died early because of some fuckups and I managed to grab her. I was not the intended tank. It took a toll on the healers, so this would not work with just an "alright" tanking gear as arms unless you have very good healers.
---
You think the way to level LP is to sit in major cities opening boxes for other players? Lmao alright man. Make a rogue and try to level your LP that way and let me know how efficient that is.
---
Not hard for Hunters to get top 5 DPS in MC consistently
---
While the question has been answered, I'd like to add that it is recommended to do the quest chain that allows you to kill Vectus in scholo because you get two easy extra boss kills per run.
---

Use the winters chill raid spec, keeps most of your utility but is still viable in raids. See blurb and link below.
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-talents-builds-classic-wow) 
---
 "his build centered around the 📷[ Winter's Chill](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=28595/winters-chill) talent. It is a talent that increases the critical strike chance of all Frost spells by 10%, even for other Mages. This build puts out less damage than the Arcane Power Frost build, but the buff is essential to increase the damage of all Mages in the raid.
---
Going so deep into the Frost tree also adds quite a bit of survivability. Taking talents like 📷[ Ice Block](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11958/ice-block) and 📷[ Ice Barrier](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13033/ice-barrier) will get you out of many sticky situations and can help reduce strain on your healers.
---
Just remember, it is vital that one Mage in every raid runs this build to increase the damage of all the other Mages!"

When the kids are away mom and dad will play (WoW) :D

Eh I could see for gold.

Some answers can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-11334-2); basically, having to fight to obtain things will shockingly feel more rewarding than being handed it. 
---
For some quests you either have to or will want to group with people and have some actual interaction; same in some dungeon groups unless everyone knows exactly what to do. Perhaps the added danger / difficulty forces players to cooperate more, and it adds a feeling of risk - dying happens, and is a thing. You might find your class has a lot more abilities than what you're used to from future expansions; some of the more niche / less universally useful and strong abilities were pruned away along they road, but they can be really clutch in certain situations and add a lot of flavor and fun to the game IMO. 
---
Glad you are enjoying yourself, hope it continues! Step forth, adventurer - Azeroth awaits.
---
Just make a ticket and say that it dissapeared
---
I too play with my inventory open at all times
---
Dude I'm in a very similar situation with Warrior. I was wrestling with Druid and Shaman, rolled Shaman but every time I play my warrior alt it just calls to me, the melee combat and especially like you said the manaless gameplay feels so much better.
---
I also feel similarly about druid. I respect the class a lot, I love the class fantasy, I love everything about the idea of it, but in practice I just really do not like it. I think the class calls to just about everyone for one reason or another, it's probably the coolest in the game as far as lore goes and it really makes you feel special; but once the rubber meets the road there's only a small group of people that resonate with the class, truly love it, understand it well enough, and are good enough at it to be called real Druid players. There's a reason it's the least played by far; even though everybody loves Druids to death, if you're not one of those ride or die Druids you'll probably fall off at some point and revert to what your true heart's desire is. I think that's happening to you, and if I were you I'd embrace it. There's a lot you can do as a rogue to make people love you, and I think the same thing will happen to you no matter what else you try. I'm satisfied with Shaman, it's a solid second place enough that I don't mind maining it, but Warrior will always have my heart and I wish I didn't try to lie to myself about that for the sake of variety. 
---
Additionally, I already know that I couldn't give less of a shit about mages, probably not going to be the biggest priest fan ever, don't love hunter gameplay, rogues aren't my style, and I can't even make a Paladin even though I like them, so narrowing down my choices helped me analyze where my priorities really were based on what I knew I didn't want.
---
Write a ticket. Eventually they can restore it
---
Beat me to it :-)
---
Take my silver
---
Disabled addons and checked again?
---
Google up "item restoration classic" and how to do it; I believe you may use such a service once every 30 days, based on a post I saw earlier. 
---
So there might still be hope.
---
&gt; Im only a 49 druid and I've already slogged through my share of Mara princess runs - I've never even see the ring drop once.
---
You are effectively wasting your time.  
---
Continue leveling and skip this item. Ring from DM Tribute is better.  
---
People are really overvalue this "BiS" items. They are not something that "must have". First Onyxia kill was done by 58-59 levels without single BiS item. They are not needed and don't guarantee anything.  
---
Just one of the many goals that WoW have. If you are so inclined to get that ring - return at 60.
---
It also increases the chance that the people who do come get gear. Less competition.

One of my guildies now has 9 arcane crystals. Nine!!
---
Going for BIS exclusively makes only sense in a coordinated raiding tryhard environment. I personally play in such an environment and guild. However, most people do not do that.
---
Doing random dungeons is exactly the opposite of that. If an item drops that is straight up better than what you are wearing, you *need* that item. If you are a super nice you could pass for another person in your group, but I personally recommend heavily against it.
---
Try TeamViewer - I used it to bypass queues on my way home from work
---
Try relogging before you open a ticket. Ya never know.
---
I think the RNG change a lot the way you percieve the game. See it like a casino machine. 
---
Retail : You know you're gonna win, you know approximately how long it's gonna take and the outcome. So you guess at start how long it's gonna be and get bored doing it. Grind system.
---
Classic : RNG. Fuck mate, either you grind for two days an item that a newcomers looted in 5 minutes, either you're the newcomer and you're happy as hell. Both case you have no clue what's caused the result because you can't predict the outcome.
---
Psychologicaly, it's much more powerfull in creating memories not to know what's gonna happen and then be surprised (or deceived) than knowing exactly the outcome of an action and doing it brainlessly.

Met a random priest when running to badlands from Arathi for the FP.
---
We joked about ally ganking and at arrival we had a party for Ulda instantly. 
---
Now he is in the same guild and we try to run weekly instance
---
you can hit targets further away but get hit more easily.
---
and your racial is an AA reset.
---
It's because it's easier for your brain to understand what's happening in Classic so you appreciate it more and everything seems deliberate. The game is slower so it's easier to get invested in the moment, as opposed to BfA where, for example, if you're dpsing on a fury warrior you're trying to think several globals ahead.
---
They fall off hard
---
Yes, that's the fun part.  Fear has no downsides except that it doesn't work on mechanical/undead mobs. Everything else is fair game.  And it works the same as if you tagged it : it runs as far away as possible, sometimes even desummoning your pet/minion cause they are so far.
---
I have had 3 seperate occasions where the rogue looted the chest while leveling without rolling
---
Only 1 at end game. 
---
I want to say around 5 times now a rogue has needed a lock box.
---
How many times a week can one player raid? What is the raid lockout linked to, a guild or a specific player?
---
Not that rich anymore lol. Had a crazy weekend where I looted 3 epic BoEs and successfully sold 2 of them :)
---
is big
---
FYI /duel still works cross faction. Good luck stopping at the end tho
---
Hopefully when the RTX 8090 Ti is out we can get WoW 2 and it'll look like this.
---
Unfortunately it isn't worth that much since you a Leatherworker can craft an insane agi+stam headpiece for level 36. Also most items in the 30-40 range are less thought after since people at that stage save money for their mount and get a lot of gear from SM. That diminishes prices, even of great items, a lot in that niche.
---
That's also a really quick way to die in groups of 4+ elites
---
Tanks wield weapons too
---
When I hit Open A Ticket in game the site or whatever it’s trying to load doesn’t load. Waited a while for it but nothing. Can I open a ticket on the Blizz site?
---
Most leveling warriors are DPS and simply tank because nobody else is.
---
So is it about resetting hours-long timers then after a restart?
---
No. Also it's spelled 'rogue', 'rouge' triggers many rogues.
---
Dps with a shield? If they want to Dps they should use 2handers while leveling...
---
Shaman self res is such a long ass cooldown though... 
---
I would never waste it to ninja loot.
---
That is good for him. I'm not too sure this will put a dent in any economy on a long-term scale outside of a day or two of auctions, unless a fairly high % of your realm was awake and happened to sit at home playing when this occured.
---
How many other guildies are boasting similar numbers? How many players in total, mayhap? It just feels exaggerated, but that's just my subjective opinion.
---
Doesn't matter if you have stamina or not and it will continue till 50s.
---
lol wut? He is a tank, he will get any group in less than 5 or 10 minutes
---
Nightfall isn't in the game. Sulphuras is meme-tier for warriors, but actual upgrade for enh shammies. The eye will drop eventually without regards for your raid composition. Giving Eye to a warrior over a shaman/ret pally is like giving Dal'Rends to a hunter - better for another class, while their actual BiS is easier to get.
---
Do lots of BRD and try to complete all quests. There are also nice rings and extremely good gear to get from there.
---
I am content clear Dwarf Priest and farming MC and Onyxia splits each week. I am still wearing 3 items from BRD!
---
I think sapping has a higher failure chance than blind + you only need those few second to skin, not more.
---
Am I right ?
---
I would consider it very rude and I would want nothing to do with players like him. 
---
I would talk with my group about kicking him and finishing the run without him if they agree. If they dont want to kick him I would just mute him, warn my guildies about it and finish the run out of courtesy for the other three people.
---
They do, they throw on a shield to tank because it's faster to find a group.
---
think you're taking that to an extreme there, first off most people that buy contraband in real life know what they are doing where as we are talking about a **game** and not real life and also the people that got the patterns didn't realise they were gained through layer abuse
---
What do you think guild stealth runs are?
---
2 attempts.
---
In my case the rogue who did that to me gave up quite easily. He was tagging water elementals on the Feralas shore, and those bastards spam frostbolt.  He tried chasing one underwater, since I feared it. They're like god damn torpedos  and almost killed the guy when it wore off. Swimming + frostbolt slow is not fun. At least for him.
---
You want to constantly avoid pugs for the small risk of bad people?
---
If he plans to equip it and use it, whats the problem
---
You are in the wrong. Yes
---
Are you a destro lock? That shadow bolt hit pretty damn hard. Is destro any good? The talents look amazing, but I don't want to make a mistake of leveling destro and having it turn out to be shit-tier.
---
Are you trolling or serious? Tanks are not only in need of stamina.
---
Good weapons with more dmg and even dps stats are very much tank items as well.
---
Later on even in max lvl raiding there are items that seem to be dps only but benefit tanks enormously since they need to generate more and more threat when the dps players start tp build up better gear.
---
See a ring "Band of Accuria" for example.
---
That's not how you level lockpicking.  You spend useless time wandering in zones  where the leveling boxes randomly spawn hoping to see a box barely visible between 2 rocks and some tall grass.  Or under water.   I.E., murloc camps in wetlands.
---
(alternatively, play a dwarf rogue like me and know exactly where the boxes are)
---
Normal for pugging yea. Find a guild.
---
I’ve seen tons of DW warriors 20+. 
---
I didn’t say they were smart just a possible reason for rolling on them. 
---
Also a leveling tank would benefit from any 1 handler that increases their damage.
---
You\`re not on a timer. There are no dailies, no gear threadmill to worry about. Take your time and enjoy the game.
---
1 warrior 1 healer 3 mages is probably the fastest you can level from 30+ (or whenever mages get good aoe)
---
You must have absolutely no idea how dreadfully slow it is to level up in Prot spec. 
---
With the current shortage of tanks on all stages, levels and realms, it is only smart and natural that the DPS specced warriors / druids slap on a shield / whatever sta/str gear they got an shoulder the role of a tank for the dungeon, since you really do not need Prot until early-mid 50s, arguably doable without up to \~60.
---
&gt;  Taurens are even slower at reproduction than the Undead
---
Excuse me, Undead could ... reproduce?
---
Because those mobs are at the door you need to blast. They'll aggro you after FD
---
Personally I just sacrifice my pet with Eye of the Beast. Run your pet in, get aggro, jump it over the ledge so the mobs follow, blast door, then FD.
---
Invis pots do make it easier but they aren't required
---
Lmao I love how we still get the obligatory whiny alliance comment on a video where a Horde player got gangbanged by a mob of Alliance.
---
Insane. Not exactly sure when I joined but it was around 20k at the time maybe around a year ago. I love all of you.
---
"Internet hyperbole drama"
---
This boy rolling around with NINE arcane crystals my friend. There's nothing hyperbolic about that.
---
Nine!!
---
All these people saying first orb to the tank . Lol I will die before I pay a tank 30 gold to run strat live. 
---
As far as the orbs go. Your best bet just gather some friends or guildies to help you bang them out. You’ll have it done in no time. Other than that AH is your friend
---
Blood Elves
---
Shhh
---
You should be able to in phase 2 though. We don't need raid specs to clear MC unless we're doing it 20-man.
---
Here's the thing, stalking in stealth till a good opportunity is THE main advantage a rogue has. I don't get why people get angry at that but a hunter/lock opening up on a rogue from a distance is somehow a fair fight.
---
For a multitude of reasons. I mean the biggest one being you are helping a guildie who in turn will probably help you down the line if you need it. Unless you are a raid geared tank you will probably come out of it with more gold than when you went in. I go back and help guildies and friends all the time when they need it completing elite quests in their leveling zones or if they need to run a low level instance.
---
ok I laughed hard as hell. this is a good meme.
---
Does that make it where there's really no reason to spread out the raid in p2 then?  My understanding is the reason people spread is to avoid fireball hitting multiple people, but if we now know the fireball will always be on MT, the rest of the raid can just hang out over to the side and deal with whelps and dodge deep breath (if it comes) together, yeah?
---
Yea definitely. Don't know how I forgot that.
---
Thistle tea is going to be huge in phase 2.
---
Haha, this is a nice change of pace - sarcasm done right. 
---
I just think people are being overly dramatic - lots of people squeezed out outrageous XP numbers from torch runs in BRD before that was fixed too, just like some managed to get some extra loot this way. I just don't believe enough people did it to put a long term dent in the economy and thus think it's not worth freaking out over - but as mentioned, it's my subjective opinion and not based on any real numbers. I could be wrong, and if I am, I will think of this discussion and freak out for a while too. 
---
Say hi to your friend Reginald from me!
---
Nice try boomer
---
The guy didn't let the rogue know before hand that it was BiS. The cape dropped from the Baron but that's just RNG running salt in the wound.
---
Jesus Christ this is an overreaction and a half. Get a guild to blacklist somebody for rolling an item that's an upgrade for them. I genuinely hope I don't group with you.
---
If you cant get it back through item restoration the lazy GM will tell you to eat shit. Their service is not what it once was.
---
/cast cannibalize
---
/s Finally, some good fucking food!
---
5% drop rate?! that's rng heaven!!
---
You mean the cloak from rare gargoyle? It's BIS for pvp for all melee (aside from rag cloak maybe), gotta take that into consideration as well.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-1RPDqJAY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE-1RPDqJAY)
---
Lock.
---
Yeah ill just try my luck thanks bro
---
Yeah, I also don't, but someone I know got nine arcane crystals and you're telling me not to be dramatic! Nine arcane crystals! In a **video** game!
---
Shhhhh don't tell him! Let him learn it in game!
---
idk how people dont shower daily. you sweat, piss and shit everyday. You need to clean yourself.
---
great video, the WTF sealed it lol.
---
The 7/21/21 (+2) spec is devastating in pve but you lose some survivability in pvp.   Still gives quick pet swaps etc which is very useful in pvp.  
---
Sm/ruin is a nice all rounder and does decently in both pvp and pve.  
---
Soul link gives insane survivability in pvp but I do find the damage output lacking a little personally.   
---
I’ll end up going full destruction once I have a bit more gear for it and phase 2 lands.   Succubus control with soul fire and conflagration will destroy players very quickly.   
---
I fucking love warlocks.
---
This isn't helpful to anyone
---
I mean I understand what you're saying, but I personally don't join groups that say "LFM strath orbs res" and shit like that. You sound like the kind of player that wouldn't join a pug group that had items on res either.
---
With how little gear is dropped, (2-4 pieces per boss) i doubt that makes a difference at ALL. Also, he could always use a few pieces like rings and cloaks that all dps would use. So, there is a reason other then his dps and utility that he brings
---
Is not wanting a rogue to ninja items a good enough reason? Lol I agree with you I’m just saying the good reason is literally this post
---
/tickle isalwzys my goto
---
100% possible.
---
I leveled 2 hunters solely from dungeons.
---
I prefer grouping. Old school EQ Gamer, it is what it is.
---
Love Robert Deniro.
---
If it's an upgrade on his current equipment then that's perfectly reasonable. BIS is just something for people to aim towards.
---
Drop rate 8-9%. From memory I counted 33 mobs if you don't do the armory. So should be more than 2 orbs on average.
---
I speak with my group before we go and ask them if I can have them. I need nothing else from Strath. Generally accepted that everyone rolls. Sometimes players will be nice and agree that only those who need the enchant roll on it. Or only one per person. Not always though. 
---
I could earn enough gold to buy 2 orbs during the time it takes to run strath. I choose to run strath because I like the idea of farming them myself. So I find it sad that people then think everyone should be able to roll on the orbs, even though they'll put it on the AH, while I actively need them. 
---
To me, an orb is basically a BOE blue drop. On my server they are worth the same as T0 bracers for example. If the class needs the bracers, it's fine to take them and otherwise free for all. Not sure why people think it's different for the orb. I actively need it, so why should you roll on it if you are not getting the enchants from it
---
47 min late for this comment but im gonna say it
---
"undead rogue"
---
I think if that were the case flight masters would be dead most of the time. As it stands, flight masters are way too weak. While leveling in Loch Modan I saw a rogue solo kill the flight master. Shit like that shouldn't be possible.
---
Well the guy is clearly an idiot, why would i waste my time any further.
---
This is pretty normal. Don’t play locks much but it’s always been like that with hunter pets.
---
Was double digits for sure
---
Happy CAKE DAY!
---
Can confirm this to be true, have a huge repair bill but veins kept respawning with every dc, I dont have herb but people kept sayin they were farmin lotus.
---
They also started out with only enough quests to familiarize yourself with the zone, and then you were expected to grind it out from there. They found that players would do the quests then try to move on to another zone, so they had to add in a lot more quests than originally existed. I don't think most zones were planned with quest parity in mind, at least to the numberl of quests we ended up with.
---
Check out Ebbnflow's YouTube channel, it's druid focused and he has a lot of farming guides for druids in DM and other places :)
---
It's the horse I feel sorry for
---
The wowhead dungeon guides are pretty good for finding out where you get the keys from.
---
The Key to Scholomance is a long questline in the Plaguelands.
---
The Scarlet Key which you need in Stratholme Live you get from the Scarlet Monastery Library. I just solo'd this yesterday as a 55 shadow priest to get the key but it was kinda tricky. 
---
The Key to the City for the Stratholme Undead entrance you get by going through Stratholme Live and killing Magistrate Barthilas.
---
The Shadowforge Key in BRD you get from a small questline (Dark Iron Legacy) which involves tasks inside of BRD ending with killing Fineous. 
---
For UBRS you need to complete the questline Seal of Ascension which has tasks in LBRS.
---
I made a guy named goochiegoo and he runs around stormwind ticking people lol
---
That is intended.
---
If your pet engages in combat, a mob becomes flagged for you. However, you also need to deal at least a tiny bit of damage yourself in order to be eligible for loot. This entails being able to skin the mob.
---
This is probably in the game in order to prevent powerful Warlocks and Hunters to afk-farm low level areas.
---
Sell that ol nag
---
These kind of posts really bother me. You are upset that he rolled on the second best cloak in the game for him? So what if it was your best. A random person running a dungeon for upgrades has no obligation to pass GOOD gear off to you unless you specifically reserved it BEFORE starting the run.
---
Like others have said:
---
1) not everyone follows the SAME BiS list - there are many
---
2) Don't get gear just to tick off the BiS box - running dungeons for only the absolute best piece and not rolling on anything else would drastically increase the time it takes you to gear up
---
As a druid, my BiS weapon is a BoE epic that is 300-400g on my server. There is a two-hand mace in DM that is 98% as good. By this BiS logic, I shouldn't even bother running DM for that and instead should just grind out gold to buy the BoE.
---
thank you

---
Princess solo runs net 25-45g per hour depending on drops and mining/herbs. It's good if you're on a PvP server and don't want contested areas.
---
Humans should go for QS. Just about everyone else should be using daggers.
---
Orcs have axe skill, but the truth is there isn't alot of good axes out there for you to get. Pre-bis sure use the axes theres plenty of them but in the end you should be aiming for daggers with muggers belt / ACLG for upgrades from MC(You really want 305 weapon skill). Don't take Deathbringer from fury warriors.
---
The truth is there just isn't going to be a ton of dagger rogues because swords is just better and there are a ton of daggers in MC. Other weapons are much less plentiful. DB and Viskag are on incredibly low drop rates and those are the huge items your DPS needs. Perds drops at 16% from rag and there are 2 other daggers you can go for as well. 
---
Other benefits to daggers is consistency. Attacking faster means you are less likely to get a string of dodges / parries at the start of a fight that results in you getting no threat and people dieing. It also lets you manage your rage better because you can queue more heroic strikes in a shorter amount of time.
---
Thanks.  I'm horde.
---
I'll look at that BRD quest next time I'm there!
---
If the instance is close to an inn you should defenitly keep it logged out there, rested exp is no joke! :)
---
thank u dad
---
Faerlina doesn't have that problem.
---
This is intended. In order to be eligible for a kill, you have to have pressed a button that directly impacts the enemy. The reason for this is to avoid people going AFK around mobs, the pet killing mobs and you getting XP for essentially doing nothing.
---
And I just wanna get back to my body to get back in the action
---
What we did:
---
MT tanks Onyxia in P1
---
When she started walking to fly in the air, I (dps warrior) ran and hugged our main tank. She would only shoot fireballs at the main tank hitting the two of us over and over.
---
We had a paladin with FR aura assigned to us healing us since outside damage from whelps, none other than the 2 of us took damage in phase 2.
---
She landed in P3 - Main tank got instantly (no stop dots, stop dps shennanigans at all). Just to test I instantly popped recklessness, death wish and a mighty rage potion. I could not steal agro from the tank.
---
Easy kill - 0 deaths if it weren’t for a pesky lock overagroing at 5%
---
The mechanics behind this:
---
There is no threat reset at the beginning of p3 as I have seen written over and over.
---
The ability that resets threat is the fireballs as several people have figured out by now. However, it’s not that simple. Onyxia will target the player with the highest threat, however if more than one person is hit it will reset the threat of the person hit who has the lowest threat. Hence she will spam fireballs at the main tank as he/she will have his threat reset as long as you have someone stack on the tank.
---
Tldr: Have a person stack on your tank in P2. Will ensure tank never have his threat reset.
---
What are you using for your enemies castbars?
---
I'm gonna tell an IRL story.
---
Cops once showed up to my office to reclaim a printer that we rented from another company that apparently didn't pay for it. We didn't know they didn't pay for it, and we most certainly were paying for it. The cops took it, we, of course, canceled our account and then rented from different company. (and if you're like why are they renting printers, its like a package deal where service and paper is included, I don't know the particulars but its like a leasing agreement)
---
So I know the exact feeling of cops telling you we bought contraband. (they actually thought we were holding it hostage for some reason, and we were like huh? no? take it?)
---
I'm currently leveling a combat swords rogue and am at 26. I've been trying to get two cruel barbs from DM but have had no luck with either them not dropping or losing rolls, should I continue to try and get them at my level or should I move on from doing DM?
---
Rogue here, he’s spelling it the traditional way.
---
&gt;You don't have the same priorities as me in a video game and that makes you an asshole
---
wew
---
Sometimes you are lucky sometimes you aren't.
---
I solo healed an UBRS run yesterday. The group was decent except one Mage who was clearly a noob and a clicker. Drakki dropped Titans Flask recipe and you already know how this story ends: the shitty super noob clicky Mage rolled 2 higher than I did. I tried to buy the recipe from him, but he declined and also admitted that his Alchemy skill isn't at 300 to learn the skill and this is only an alt of his.
---
At first I was furious obviously but then I was like: whatever. Next time.
---
Haha Weed is tight.
---
Does anyoneone know why many people have so little gold close to lvl 60?
---
I played a rogue and leveled LW to 300 so I never sold the leather I picked up. I had 300g when I dinged 60. I had no expensive loot drop that I sold on the AH. So many people I write with have &lt;50g and also never seem to be able to come by it. I sell the Devilsaur set now that I'm 60 and constantly people write me who want to buy it but are completely broke. 
---
Is rogue especially cheap? Do other people waste their money without realizing?
---
Skip it and get a lock to farm it for you, most i've found are willing to do it for 30g or so as its just added bonus to something they're already farming. I did the same grind on my warrior and eventually burnt out without seeing it drop once after 20 or so runs.
---
I don’t need anything out of there. If I did, I could get a guild easily to assist 
---
You can say have fun waiting but I have never had problems pugging this when I did need items. Plenty of people want the leather mask from unforgiven and plenty are fine with rolling on items just like everyone else.
---
Imagine carrying a tank through a dungeon who thinks he’s owed something for simply picking a plate class. Get over yourself .
---
As a holy priest I literally have a single bar of skills. Flash heal rank 4, Flash heal rank 7, dispel, cure disease, greater heal, renew, heal, wand, will of the forsaken..that is all and I really done even need heal on there.
---
Literally my whole job centers around simming different crisis and proving to the government that my big bank won't fail.  Every quarter.
---
&gt;You don't find a group with the press of a button.
---
&gt;**You ~~have a conversation with strangers.~~  type LFM/LFG then never say a word.**
---
&gt;You don't rage at people in Ragefire Chasm who are underperforming.
---
&gt;**You ~~enlighten~~ kick them.**
---
&gt;You don't speed through the dungeon for an XP grab.
---
&gt;**You help each other finish quests.  Unless you already did that quest.**
---
&gt;You don't stop the run from a DPS randomly disconnecting.
---
&gt;**You ~~push each other to finish as a 4-man.~~ replace them.**
---
&gt;You don't abandon the group after the last boss is downed.
---
&gt;**You ~~help somebody ding by killing a few more mobs.~~ make the mage give you a free port.**
---
Spending a few gold on greater fire pots for rag really trivializes the fight. Takes so much stress off of the healers and allows Dps to push harder. If you’re not bringing pots you’re not really doing your part
---
Really nice album. Shame you didn't like the actual game as much as the world but at least you gave it a go. It certainly doesn't get any less grindy for the next 37 levels so you're not missing out on that.
---
Nic-...
---
Salty much?
---
Well, that's BiS for Warlocks in general so obviously falls into the exception category.
---
Hand of sulfaras?
---
The npc who gives that quest, Clarice Foster, had such a familiar name but I couldn't place it.  This winter I was playing on a private server to satisfy my itch and i finally realized, her name is just like Harrison Jones, a portmanteau.  Clarice Starling and Jodi Foster from Silence of the Lambs.
---
That is certainly a far more detailed response than I ever expected, but bloody well put.
---
MikScrollingBattleText I think
---
Equiped engineering items are considered acceptable. Inventory items? Hell no. Bombs are incredibly BM to use in duels.
---
Most guilds expect people to use greater fire protection potions on Ragnaros. He has an ability that deals 1,5k-2,5k fire damage to target at range, and everyone within 20 yards of the target. It also knocks the target back, which has a high chance of having people end up in the Lava, and out of range of healers.
---
Without a greater Fire protection potion you can easily die from this ability + followup lava damage. 
---
You need 1 elemental fire to create a single greater fire protection potion, and the amount of people killing ragnaros is the reason elemental fire is selling for 5g+ on most servers.
---
I guess do you pop them like candy whilst in MC? Or just when needed?
---
Not at all, rogues are objectively the best class to fight as a warrior. Retaliation is best against rogues. Rogues defensives are worst against warriors. Rogues have high passive Dodge chance and do mostly physical damage. Overpower, plate armor, bleeds to deny stealth, It's just a cake walk for warrs.
---
Whats the drop down menus for base stats and melee. Is that an addon or what?
---
Totally agree.
---
Yesterday I did a pug ZF run which was very smooth an fun (no guildies). All group where talking and joking during the run, we died a couple of times but just joke about it not blaming on anyone or whatever. Everything regarding loot was very polite, it was clear that loot was not the main reason to be there.
---
After the run everybody said goodbay and leaved group. I did some stuff and then went to Hinterlands to finish some quests, and when I arrived I saw the same mage I grouped for ZF asking for members to get the egg of one of the follow up quest.
---
So I join him again and another hunter dude, we 3man the thing, was not very difficult but also not so easy, was very fun and with some challenge. After that the other hunter leaved and the mage told me he had to do this chiken robot quest. I say I don't have the thing but I can help anyway. He offers to do some AOE grinding to see if I'm lucky enough to get the drop of the quest item. No luck, but really appreciated the gesture. Another guy posts on the General chat that needs help with that quest, and we invite him. So we start the quest of this guy and complete it, but the other mage for any reason doen't get credit, so we just go back and do it again, talking and joking during the run.
---
After that we just disbanded and followed our path, and probably I will recognize that mage whenever I group with him again.
---
Point of all of this is, now when I think about it, **I think something like that would NEVER happened in retail**. As you said, is PEOPLE and its attitude towards helping others what makes this game so good. And it helps not having layering and keep seeing people you have partied with again and again, feels really like a comunity.
---
Min maxing is not a problem, for me min/maxing should be a second goal of the game, being the main goal to enjoy the social aspect of it, and have an attitude of helping and try to make others feel good, not otherwise. It's a great oportunity to play this game "differently".
---
Love me some tasty alliance :)
---
Gehennas?
---
Weakauras
---
For fights like Rag you should bring some fire protection pots. If your guild is good and can kill him in one or two attempts then you shouldn’t need anymore than say, 5. If your guild requires more attempts than that then you should bring more.
---
Rag solely deals fire damage and has a limited timer to defeat him before having to go fight the boss before him again. So you want to be as efficient as possible.
---
That might do it. Was playing with a hunter a lot who castes aspect. 
---
Guys thanks for the response - GM restored it for me! Very odd situation.
---
From what I can tell they got Rag down to 15% first attempt....
---
Then I'm not sure they got him down at the end...
---
I was to busy grinding to really follow the chat.
---
Classic: 10 million
---
Retail: 20,000
---
Can you elaborate on Reckoning in this situation because I used it for quite a while when I first could max it, and I never could tell that it actually was doing anything.
---
I've read comments saying how it works in 1.12, which is the nerfed state it was in near the end of vanilla, is that when you get crit it just instantly resets your swing timer, which gives you an "extra" auto-attack. I guess with more mobs on you it procs more often, but that means you're getting crit more often too, so I've never figured out how just adding occasional extra white damage hits on your primary target will outweigh the beat down that you're taking to trigger them.
---
I've also seen the discussions about using it to cheese duels by some stacking shenanigans that are possible even after the 1.12 nerf with precise timing of sit / stand and then unleashing a 5x stacked Judgment or something. But I assume that is not what is going on when using Reck for open world AOE farming of regular mobs.
---
Anyway I feel like I must be missing something obvious about this talent or don't understand how it actually works, because when I've tried it I never seemed to get really anything out of it, but it is so often cited as being amazing or mandatory.
---
Also, maybe related to this point, when people talk about AOE farming with Prot is it always assumed that if you're pulling packs of 5+ mobs that they're going to be 4-5 or more levels below you? Based on my experience grinding single targets with Prot even with decent on level green gear, I don't feel like its possible to survive pulls with that many that are +0 to -1 to your level. Two or maybe three is fine. But 5+ feels like you would just melt before the reflect damage can get enough of them down.
---
In the videos I've watched they always seem to be pulling only greens that are well below level. Is the XP nerf from the mobs being green outweighed by killing more of them at a time to the point that its more XP / hr for the AOE farming vs. on-level singles or doubles?
---
Or his scam works very well and it's running on a VM that can't be traced
---
DO you pop them like candy? Or always have them on? Or just when needed?
---
Does everyone need them? Or just like ranged?
---
I dont mind flasks getting a little cheaper.
---
I mean locks have 0 mobility and blink is the best one in the game so yeah seems like a fair complaint lol.
---
By having 1 60 and 6 epics...?
---
It really is a shame. I liked every single aspect of this game except the combat. And the combat is the one aspect that's impossible to avoid.
---
Ahh ok. Well I guess if they were at Rag, and so close to downing him, you gotta look for issues. And the potions would help.
---
But raid lead could also carry extra and sell them :)
---
I mean, the number crunchers were definitely a big part of that community...but their time has passed, the numbers have been crunched (unless Classic+ becomes a thing).
---
Good thing that's not how node spawns or Gurubashi arena works.
---
&gt; Citizens of Stormwind
---
So... No one?
---
There’s a difference between those and “please tell me how to run from node 1 to node 2”
---
But, I see you like pointlessly sarcastic comebacks so I’ll try again. 
---
Use brain, 4head
---
8% afaik
---
&gt;You leave raid invites as a non-transparent RNG afterthought right before raid time.
---
That's the part that bothered me the most. I'm always posting the raid signups in Discord (we have a bot for it) every Friday and monitoring signups until Tuesday raid to see what our comp might be/who might need to sit. I'm thankful I've got a good core of about 35 folks who show up each week and have some fun. Do a bit of gambling on trash and clear MC in a night.
---
Only on Rag, maybe one on Geddon
---
Holding the fishing pole the whole time haha
---
Hey I said bows
---
Crossbow is a version of a bow XD
---
Greatest are really only “needed” on ragnaros. The lava packs after garr you can pop lessers for some extra survivability (for melee), not necessary though. And baron geddon (for melee) fire pots wouldn’t hurt if you’re not paying attention to the timer; also if you get the bong, popping one will save your life. If we don’t wipe, I’ll use maybe 3-4 greater fire pots the whole raid (1 on geddon, 1 on golemagg, 2 on rag)
---
This is the same as the "bank full of lotus" tales from a few weeks ago: absolute hyperbole bullshit. 
---
First of all the game was barely playable, world server was down constantly, people were being thrown off their wyverns/gryphons and you were booted every few minutes. Second of all, maybe a handful of people thought to abuse this stuff if at all. Lastly if you think that a few hundred black lotuses are going to trash the economy then you are stupid. You know what lower prices of black lotus means? More people buying black lotus! Then the price rises again and it's like nothing happened at all.
---
Lol... Daily showering... fckin casual
---
Just quest, it's the fastest gold at your level.  Most people get their first mount between levels 42-45.
---
Tbf it is fairly easy.  You focus the player, take his items, and gold accrued in the window from start of exploit to discovery.  You cld even roll back his char to the state it was at pre 1st exploit.  If someone bought a pattern they keep it, the exploiter looses the gold.  The buyer is ignorant of anything, the exploiter is delt with.  Not that difficult tbh.
---
If you're playing feral cat in raid, which I am as well, you HAVE to farm pummelers if you even want to think about being competitive on the meters. I'm usually top 10 on most fights if I get decent rng or if I dont have to innervate a healer and get to use it on myself. 
---
Feral can be discouraging because you're last on the totem pole for any loot that drops and you have to work harder than most classes but that's just the nature of the beast. It feels very rewarding to be top 5 when everyone else is dismissing your spec as viable though.
---
Stop putting so much emphasis on bis lists. Especially since you're misunderstanding what "optional" means on a list. It means "your #1 item in this slot hasn't dropped but this one did. Go ahead and wear this one because the difference is so negligible that you won't even notice." It doesn't mean it's a minor upgrade. It's usually almost the exact same as the 1st best.
---
Furthermore, this sounds like a PuG. In which case, no one has any right to force people to only roll on items which are bis. The cloak was an upgrade for the Rogue, he won the roll and equipped it. Tough shit. That's literally how the game is supposed to work. 
---
Personally if i found a person like YOU, who gets uppity about someone rolling on a cloak and equipping it despite it being someone else's bis, i wouldn't group with you anymore.
---

---
Yes: CharacterStatsClassic
---
My philosophical viewpoint is that the vanilla world is more aligned with how we humans are. 
---
Most ppl have since the dawn of time fiddled with their daily life. Everyday making as small efforts as possible to pass time and making sure that they get what they need for sustainability. 
---
Then, in times of need, we humans can achieve great things, using substantial effort in short stints. After that a period of rest and relaxation before building up new energy for a short stint of action again. 
---
This way of “living” fits very well with how it is in classic. 
---
Classic is a far better representation of real life than what retail wow is. 
---
In summary, as a result, we get burned out less and not as often as we do with for example retail.
---
This is bad, no question about that, but as long as new gold is not being generated more easily the economy is fine. It's "only" bad for people who have invested in such items.
---
But again, this is bad if true.
---
Yes :) another fun Easter egg left behind. Fun story, just a couple of days ago I ran DM:N for the first time in ages, and upon looting the Ogre Tannin (a few pulls before the final boss) this Ogre runs up to the party, shouting something along the lines of "It outs the tannin in the basket, or it gets the mace again!!". 
---
Made me laugh, since I'm thinking of the HIMYM episode where they use that quote, as well as Silence of the lambs. So much fun stuff hidden into the game!
---
You only need to bring 2 for MC.
---
LoL calm down kitties Warlock is about to do some low DPS but somehow the highest threat !
---
I used to res healers all the time in vanilla on my rogue with my Jumber Cables! good ol vanish + jumper cable. Saved a few runs that way when trash had respawned.
---
I so regret not taking engineering on my warlock.
---
If you tailor those robes for you, you can even invest in a big enchantment. You can then forget about one of your biggest slots for months (maybe years).
---
This will also show other people that you are serious about your char and they might overlook other gear deficits you might have and invite you still.
---
If you are serious about raiding and haven't found a raiding group yet, this is one of the best things you can do for your char.
---
They also got their items revoked so they never really archived anything with the layer abuse
---
I am really bummed about this and that the community here supports the rogue and just has no empathy for your time wasted. But fortunately this is the minority and most past bis items that are slight upgraded for them.
---
I hope you get the cloak fast.
---
I use Healbot for this
---
Yeah, he clearly didn't freak out, he kept his cool and just watched really. He did a few smart plays like rooting instead of panic healing, and letting his health sit low to bait hasty actions trying to drop his last bit of health, knowing he had 2 one clicks left on stand by. The rest was a waiting game for the rogues health to go down. That bash though, that was great. WITH the fishing pole. That rogue was severely outplayed. If it were basketball, that druid juked him out so bad he broke his ankles.
---
Just because people can do it, doesn’t mean it’s not shit and people shouldn’t do it. I don’t care if I have 30 stupid ass people in here telling me I’m wrong. I know I’m not.
---
Rogues can start handling 1v2 fights once they get Evasion at level 8, although there's a good chance they'd have to Gouge + Bandage on the 2nd mob to survive.
---
That would be an awesome feat. Is there an addon that keeps track of your "kill streak"?
---
the guild name couldn't be more accurate.
---
The standard is to have everyone prepot 1 before each attempt, and then take another one during the try after they take damage.
---
You pretty much have the questing dream team duo. Level 40-50 consists of zones like Feralas and Tanaris which have a lot of kill quests, being part of a warrior/priest duo completely trivialises it. Throw in the odd ZF run to mix things up abit but otherwise enjoy questing away with killer efficiency.

---
Do you have to specify rank in the latter part of the macro?
---
Sixtyupgrades website is pretty good.
---
Golemagg ya? Horde really need to step up
---
Queue time popping while afk.
---
If you limit your main spells for PvE and PvP to the main bar, you can always have more setups.  Just use a hotkey (default I think is shift+mouse scroll) and you have another bar which uses the same, easy hotkeys of 1-5 while allowing you to use different spells.
---
Noggenfogger is (to my knowledge) one of the smaller of the 'Layered' EU-PvP servers. Only really experience queues during weekend nights. Feels very healthy in general.
---
Only problem is that the horde population is between 60 and 70%. But that's par for course on most PvP servers. I've heard good things about Ashbringer, too. It's supposedly more even.

Did you watch the video? He has about 1000 mana left after each pull without using gems or mana pots, so it's definitely doable with less gear than what he has.

Yeah, I deliberately picked Rogue on my alt because I figured it would be the best class for avoiding fights.

It’s Warcraft, bruh. Not Hello Kitty
---
curious how much did you pay for this enchant? think it would be worth enchanting some grey boots i can pass around between alts while leveling under 40?
---
Timbermaw is pretty much the only rep you can grind outside of dungeons. If you're ally you could start Wintersaber rep at 58, or farm elementals in northwest Silithus for MC rep if you want to help out a raid with water asap. There's also undeads to farm in plaguelands with the commission trinket, you can only get exalted through dungeons though

Nomod doesn't cast anything at all now, however, Shift appears to be working correctly.

It’s high population - no queues though. You don’t need queues for a decent population.

So, instead of people having to wait 15 minutes for a thorium spawn, they just had to wait 10 minutes? Wow, the economy is so fucked. Especially if something like that happens at the ultimate primetime, 5:00 am!

---
The world in which everyone follows my rules everyone is way happier on average. And I am glad everyone I met in dungeons agreed with me.
---
And likewise I wouldnt want to play with people like you. People who think enforcing common sense, some basic politeness and respect for others people time is bad. And if you think being slightly frustrated when those very basic things are ignored is uppity I am glad to never play with you.
---
the lesson is "don't release if someone's still alive until the loot has been handled"
---
I would avoid this guild like the plague. This is the whiniest millenial bs. People have to join your discord and suck up to the class leaders and raid leaders to get a spot?  I'm an introvert. I don't like chit chat or being in discord with 50 people yelling, kids crying, random anime in the background. I also have a very busy high stress job so I can't play 40 hours a week. I am 60 with BiS. I show up before raid time every week with consumables. I join discord for raids, do my job well, and help the guild in any way I can during the raid. But all of this is just garbage to you because I don't kiss your ass in discord?  You question my commitment to the guild when I'm always early, always have consumables, and always understand every fight and how to pull my weight?  But good rather have your bootlicker asshat who is last on the meters, late to every raid, and has no idea how to play because he strokes your e-peen?  That's why you are losing good players. This mentality is so toxic.

Isn't it the opposite of freedom? You're using leather because there's no good mail/plate in those slots.
---
The census addons were never accurate to begin with. If you roll a PvP realm the Horde has a higher population unanimously.
---
No, still doesn't seem to work
---
Wouldn't the Stun screw up you snowballing mobs?
---
Also for melee. You can’t kick heals/spells even halfway through casts, even pvp to reliably get the kick you have to get it at the very beginning of the cast to avoid juking or kicking towards the end but having spell batching allow the heal to go off anyways.
---
There are some weird anomalies that I've noticed with spell batching, not sure if it's a bug but for holy paladin's Divine Favour if you start casting a spell and then que Divine Favour up immediately as it's about to finish it'll sometimes consume the divine favour and count as a crit, even though DF specifically says "
---
When activated, gives your **next** Flash of Light, Holy Light, or Holy Shock spell a 100% critical effect chance".
---
It's weird and has caused a couple of problems in raids, but now that I know it exists I can sometimes make us of it to empower a heal I've already started casting.
---
2nd attempt but only because i forgot to turn on NPC nameplates on the first try ^^
---
You want the slowest ranged weapon possible. Most of your damage is from auto shots and slower weapons have higher damage and tighter damage ranges.

I thought the arathi elementals were around 38-39.
---
So at 36 they are probably more trouble than they are worth right now.
---
Basilisks in shimmering flats are good for gold (just vendoring the Grey's). The mobs around dalaran are decent (humans and rock elementals), or things like gorillas in stv can be great, especially if you have skinning.
---
If you can get a good group I'd say just spam scarlet monastery as many times as possible until you hit 40.

Try removing the space between `Greater Heal` and `(Rank 1)`.

Dude, there or so many people In Org when I go there that my game crashes. There's easily gotta be 50 people on top of the bank alone. But, there's probably one tank for every 400 people on my server so it doesn't really matter lol. Can't wait to change to a realm with tanks!

Exactly, it can be fun for short periods to be god-like, but a challenge gives more motivation to stick around. Its what makes games like dark souls fun.

Also in classic professions feel like they matter. They can be a viable way to gear up or make money/useful items. Retail it just feels pointless.

Quantum computers, Give a call to google.

Im 58 on my hunter with around 950 gold. Most of it comes from mining / skinning.
---
Get to lvl 56, then you can solo devilsaurs. So level skinning 1-300 during these 2 levels. Then farm leather. On my server they go for 10gold a piece, and spawns every 5 minute. So in a good hour you can collect 12 leathers. Thats 120gold in 1 hour.

Most toxic farm though but it sure pays the bills.

You are right  about people dropping out. Which is very understandable. And starting every time with creating a group is also dropping the pace of playing.

And thanks, I'll try out TitanPanel!

---
Deflector is BiS pre raid
---
\&gt;  This game has gained so much traction, and it's not because of content, difficulty, or story.
---
**&gt;  It's because of** ***you***.

Difficulty and content have something to do with it. Retail content takes the same people that make up a great community when they have to depend on others and turns them into solos.

Oh sure, if Evasion's up.  Damn that 5 minute timer though.

---
So what exactly is there to do outside of farm gold and level alts? As someone with 2 60s that already clears MC every week and only 1-2 times a week I would love for you to bestow upon me this wisdom of what the fuck there is for me to do.
---
idk if that would be good advertising
---
Make the groups yourself, then you can dictate the rules. taking the first orb in live strat is fairly common. Have you done all of the quests you can do? I leveled from 57-60 mostly doing dungeons so I still had most of EPL/WPL/Burning steppes completely untouched.
---
 Arena/Anger runs actually aren't terrible money. you can pound out 5 of them in an hour, you likely still need HOJ/Savage glads so its beneficial for that. Plus you can sell any blues you get that drop, Anger drops his axe like 50% of the time and that vendors for 6-7g i'm pretty sure as well as whatever you get from arena. Plus theres the random recipe drops/essence of fire drops from the elementals.
---
Yeh, warlocks are great support players out of Combat and pretty boring in combat, but can still top dps
---
I can't help but feel that even semi-competently played druids are pretty scary in 1-on-1 PVP. 
---
Like, you feel that some specs/classes are somehow underpowered for PVE, but watch them rock in PVP.
---
They probably just annoyed you didnt read/understand what they wrote ;)
---
I’ve been noticing this too
---
I mean its a really good ring for casters, I think pre-BiS maybe. But getting it as a rogue, I turned around and sold it for 50g.
---
Thank you very much. I will look into the setup of it. This looks great.
---
i wouldnt call it 'extremely viable.'
---
you have no taunt, you take way more damage than a warrior, and you can (and will) go oom. there's really no point to doing it
---
You will be competitive and if you go full try hard may even sit near the top on melee friendly fights... for now.
---
When P3 drops and that rogue you are currently doing 90% DPS gets his BWL weapon you will still have... MCP. And again in P5 when he has an AQ weapon you will have... MCP.
---
This is what I did.
---
20$ here T-T
---
meme weapon, maybe good for human.. but not really worth the money even then, only if you get a drop you should consider if you really wanna have it.
---
If this isn't the worst UI in existence then I don't wanna see the one that is.
---
Did I read that right? You can basically just teleport to the faction leader in Stormwind? That's bullshit.
---
No, but does that mean there are a ton or Printer scam companies?
---
In this scenario: if someone is alive after the encounter have them loot the bodies for rollable loot first, \*then\* release and run back.
---
Get a second sword or a very good 2 hander and do all the 50-60 quests while leveling fishing. That's how I did it.
---
And lots of tanking, without dying of course. But I had disenchant to make a bit more money, still you'll sometimes get some money chunks with decent luck drops.
---
Must have been that space, it works now! Thank you so much!
---
And then next time the exploiters just use the AH to launder their dirty goods. Next idea?
---
Maybe you should calm down and let people play whatever the hell faction they want? You do realize us alliance players have our fair share of gankers, you're mistaken if you think we're saints for some reason.
---
And don't spout some anecdotal BS about how *you* get ganked 1000% more, because that's a lie.

Started leveling as a mage,  but felt it a little bit uncomfortable. I got oom quite fast and when I had the chance to pvp, I was ganked. I liked the utility of the mage tho. Making portals, food, CCing enemies was really helpful to all my groups  but I felt like that was all I can do. Mana management is horrible.
---
In retail,  I was playing unholy dk and had a blast of fun playing with it, same with warrior and a lil bit less with rogue. The thing is that there's no similar class to a UH DK in classic,  but the game is too fucking good to pass out. So I was thinking in playing warrior or rogue,  but warrior requires a lot of time and patience, two attributes that I currently don't have (especially time). 
---
The choices were reduced to rogue, but what scares me is the utility I can bring to groups in pvp/pve.
---
So, my question is:
---
What is the main strategy or the aim for rogues in  BGs and Raids? Are they worthy? What are thr pros and cons, in pvp mostly?
---
Priests/shamans can purge VW sac, and some mages or hunters can burst through it pretty quick.
---
Having master summoner / fel dom gives you more utility because you can start a fight with VW, sac it then Insta pull out a more favourable pet without having to waste time/resources setting it up. 
---
GCD's/time is just as valuable a resource as mana/hp in pvp
---
This works, thanks! Can you elaborate which function the second set of brackets has?
---
Mara princess grants good leggings and helm. You get a great shield from ST as well. Other than that, you can buy valor plate gear or simply green plate with stam.

Super secret guide to always have money for mount: Stop buying anything except bare necessary skills, don't buy any pointless leveling gear from the AH, take one level off from questing to pick up every quest in Shimmering Flats, grind an entire level while finishing them, and only turn in after you ding.
---
I've had ~110-150g on every char I've played on ding 40. Three naughty-servers and Classic. Wow Classic was my highest at ~150 since I took a little time to keep fishing relevant.
---
As soon as you pull two, kite back to a safe spot while hitting one of them. One will leash, but the one you are damaging will continue to follow. As long as they are not linked together (like some of the Raptors in StV for instance).
---
The world to me just feels more alive when we are just an insignificant part of the overall story as opposed to being the story in current retail.
---
I find that the people that start the most stuff die the most.
---
Holy shit 
---
I’m a a new rogue never realized I could use vanishing to survive a wipe
---
As another point though, I don't want to give you the impression that I hate gankers.  I think they serve a valuable ecological purpose.
---
An environment where there is lots of small scale violence, is an environment where truly oppressive monopolies of violence are less likely to develop.  If everyone has a gun, then anyone can get shot, so it becomes a matter of practical necessity for everyone to be very, very polite to each other.
---
The real reason why things like the devilsaur mafia exist in WoW now, is because of the aversion to in-game violence.  During the game's original release cycle, if anyone on the opposite faction had tried to start something like that up, they could expect a raid to form to both drive them out of Un'Goro, and corpse camp them for hours on end until they realised that it wasn't a good idea.
---
Millennials don't want to implement their own solutions to social problems.  They have been indoctrinated to want to go to a centralised, parental authority, (a monopoly of violence) and expect said central authority to solve the problem for them.  What they don't realise or care about, is that they are entirely surrendering their ability to decide how they want to live, as a consequence of doing that.
---
Well... now I want to roll a druid.  Love this really clean interface.
---
Warrior Shaman. Need to be well geared, warrior does like 400-600 DPS on the bosses.
---
Either get good at merchenting or just get it by leveling. Stopping to grind gold is terrible because you earn so much more the higher your level is. By the time you grind out the gold you could have gotten another level and only made slightly less gold.
---
The only other choice which is by far the worst one overall is try to get lucky with some rare drop like a whelping pet to pay for it without dumping a lot of time into it.
---
On my server the mats are less than 5g, Kromcrush - US.
---
definitely worth it, or even grab a pair of level 5 green boots or something for whatever alt you're going to use an get it enchanted since you like wont hit a mailbox until then anyway. But you can definitely just grab a pair of low level cloth boots and throw it on there to pass around if you don't want to keep spending the money.

&lt;insert meme music&gt;

Yeah cats get replaced by totem twisters on the horde side.
---
Imagine being a hunter and not putting a trap on the body of a dead lock.
---
&gt;not balanced by anything at all on the allianceside
---
What about the ports? Theramore, Menethil, and Darkshore? I realize they're less useful than zeps, but Theramore -&gt; Menethil is handy as heck and so is the tram. The equivalent for Horde is a long flight from Org to TB, which can double as a good bio or stretch break, but it's way less interesting or accessible than the tram. Level 1s can get from SW to IF (or the reverse), but it's a solid 30+ minute death run for level 1s trying to do that in reverse. If you don't have any of the FPs, it's a good 10 minutes mounted or 15 on foot. With Crossroads only you still face about 10 minutes of solid walking.
---
I like seeing every single button on my action bars instead of hiding them. Other than that I don't see what's so bad about it, there's not much else that stands out. It's functional for me, I don't care about looks.

Thank you so much!
---
5-10g from what I have seen depending on how hard people are merching small radiant shards mostly.
---
It's not like they do any real damage, with or without it. It's an auto reset every 20 seconds.
---
If you're in there as enhancement, you're there to keep the other melees and casters stronger with Windfury Totem (alternatively totem twisting, if you wanna be slick) and Nightfall. I'd personally prefer a Corruption or SW:P over Stormstrike - or even JoTC, if you're alliance and have multiple rets.
---
Yeah I don't know what game OP is playing, but there isn't some magical difference between how players play Classic vs Retail. One just has more effort into looking for someone to replace.
---
If you bind it to alt something directly, you can only press alt something, so it's still just one ability per button
---
If level 17 is the highest level you've hit on all your chars, then it sounds like you may not be giving the class enough time before moving on to the next one. I'd suggest sinking a good chunk of time into 1 character, getting it to level 35-40, before rolling a different one.
---
I feel for him.... Got mine two days ago after something like 50+ run. Only saw Gorosh 3 times
---
I’m at around 60 gold right now. Have respecced more times than i care to admit and found some goodies on the ah. It’s a bit late to start following your tips though 😁
---
Or Wetlands, a contested zone that's only accessible for Horde by running through an appropriate questing zone (Hillsbrad) and death running through a higher level zone (Arathi) to get to an area with no quests.
---
The pro move is to fight 2 mobs at once even one kill will level you up. Boom full hp full resources
---
I’m talking about the 1.12 av that we will get
---
Dont you think that if they punished people then they would be more loud about it? I check reddit, forums and discords daily and I've heard about two people getting banned.
---
Is there a particular reason you went full shadowcraft and not the regular bis outfit for ferals?
---
i think i have seen this before, i got an error like an instance couldnt load or something, i hear a repair helps
---
Some people are so afraid of someone else benefiting from something that they would rather burn the entire place down than risk the possibility.
---
I have a theory they added spell batching as an EFF YOU to the Classic crowd. People were pretty smarmy ever since the "you think you do but you don't" comment (rightfully so). So Blizzard was all ... "you get what you asked for" ... so they went out of their way to add a "feature" that is just annoying and no longer necessary to prove a point.
---
Remember, they talked about this "feature" fairly early on after the initial announcement. I don't think they thought Classic would be THIS successful and now they don't know how to walk back their dumb "stick it to ya" decision here ...
---
Also, I could be wrong. :D
---
Also seeing them driven before you and hearing the lamentations of the women
---
They should not use rank 2 heal?
---
You're also guaranteed to hold aggro of the mob while the debuff is active.
---
Well I levelled a paladin to 60 as prot and had a blast. Then I levelled one as ret and hated it. I’m now levelling another as prot. YMMV.
---
Waiting for &lt;APES&gt; to jump down with sappers...
---
Forge, bank, AH, trade vendor, reagant vendor, windrider and repair ppl are within like 20ft of each other.  And the crafters for the rarer threads and mats are all together a short run away.  
---
Plus it is always quieter, so you don't get lag issues like Org, and no annoying layout and access like UC.  
---
Main downside is no random buffs from heads being turned in, and it's a long way from BRM.
---
agreed. they're very similar. people making low effort memes that everyone upvotes.
---
world server probably
---
Favorite part of vanish haha
---
Also, if you're an engineer you can use Goblin Jumper Cables to revive the healer and save people from the run back. I've gotten invited to groups over other DPS by telling people I have them

Take into account that the more other do pvp to rank up, the more you gotta do to rank up. The playing field is different now, then 15 years ago.

Wow that sounds perfect! Will get that tonight. I'd like to be constantly marking up during the dungeons i think.

Any threat add-ons you can think of too? I use Tukui at the moment and like it's simplistic design.
---
Cat DPS is fine. Never going to top the charts, but it's still more than raid-viable. I'm usually sitting amongst the rogues on DPS, or occasionally even topping them, and this is without Manual Crowd Pummelers. Unfortunately cat DPS is entirely reliant upon powershifting, so if you don't enjoy that playstyle then maybe cat isn't for you. Your mana is important, so even just shifting out to innervate or rebirth is going to be a massive hit to your damage contribution for the fight, and that's okay. As a druid, you have the flexibility to contribute more than just pure DPS in a raid.
---
The main issue with cat is that you're never going to get your tier set. Personally, this is one of the primary reasons as to why I no longer play. There's no loot drive, and you're going to be stick with your pre-raid BiS for a long time. I really wish they would change the tier sets, but the #nO cHanGeS mentality is unfortunately a very vocal one.
---
Primarily because it is something to do and it is slightly different.  If you are used to doing a specific thing and then start something else, it's likely to b more enjoyable simply for being different.  Classic wow is also something to do.  You have a clear objective, to level, while in retail you've burned through all the easy objectives.
---
Classic Wow hits the same point, especially since BGs aren't out.  You will get to 60 and get all the gear you care to farm.  If you want to raid, then you will log on to raid and then sit in IF/Org and be kind of bored the rest of the time.
---

Two types of people go to the internet to cry about a ban: people who cant accept they screwed up, and people who were unjustly banned. 
---
People who abused layering know what they did and either accepted the loss of their account for two months or started on a new account. 
---
Most people don't come to reddit to cry about everything that happens to them. Most adults who cheat in a videogame accept the consequences of cheating in a videogame and move on.
---
Can someone explain? That feels like a lot more than just 40 people for a raid.
---
Ahhh, that's why 90% of my kicks don't work....
---
I understand. I agree, especially early on, most classes are quite repetitive. It gets better as you progress though. I haven't tried a shaman but I've heard leveling as one is atrocious.
---
PVP combat might be more to your liking when the battlegrounds open. You might want to give it another shot then. Or not, you got a lot out of the game based on this album:)
---
I considered that but I’m worried I’d be so used to my pve keys that I’d be pressing the wrong spells. I think I may get that mmo mouse.
---
the brackets [mod:alt,@player][] work like this:
---
- first one is, "if the alt-key is pressed, target the player then cast the spell"
---
- second one is, "if whatever, cast the spell at current target"
---
this is equivalent to /cast [mod:alt,@player] spell; spell
---
It literally just depends on your group setup. If you are cleave heavy(warrior,rogue,hunter) you go 2-3 mobs at the time and chainpull, if you are AOE heavy (warlocks and mages), you can do big pulls as long as it's done properly.
---
I can se my self! Mograine EU. Best server even tho the hordes are pussies

Deathcoils into fear wont  ever work as they will be immune ,berserk rage lasts 10 sec costs no rage .They even have death wish if fury..
---
Succu they can fear ,interupt if warrior is getting jump on you succu wont be on distance to avoid that. Pummel is berserk stance as well so no need for switching stances
---
Warriors in epic gear with MC  weapons hit hard 2k crits are not rare and without demonic embrace in pve gear you have what 3k-4k max?
---
Full felheart helps but you still paper without SL and demo spec.I do find that killing them is easy when you get jump bit when they get it you can melt fast and cant really peel them off to cast much

Definitely worth. Eliminates 8% of travel time on every alt until lvl 40.

No one is saying that its dead, except people who want to make memes about how its not dead for karma.
---
Yea but with the bags you have two options:
---
- buy the recipe for 25g
---
- Spam a vendor for hours on end. (I tried doing it for 30 mins and I think if I was there for 10 more mins I would've lost my sanity)
---
So in reality you have only one option: buy the recipe for 25g. (You can make more gold in the time it takes you to snipe it from the vendor, so trying to get it yourself is pointless unless you're a bot.)
---
I'm pretty sure leveling with the bags isn't going to make you 25g, so you lose either way.

&gt; Checking online
---
Always check the date of the comment aswell.
---
This game changed ALOT over the years. Most comments are of future expansions or things that are no longer in the game or straight up wrong because there are alot of stupid comments too.
---
AoE abilities aren't nearly as developed in classic, only Mage and Lock (and to a much lesser extent hunters and Arms once they get sweeping strikes, I gues)) have any meaningful AoE capabilities. You're much better off CCing and focusing targets down one or two at a time.  Healer can DPS, runs go smoothly and quickly.
---
AOE zerging dungeons wasn't really a thing until WotLK.
---
Your general attitude is a good indicator as to why you are not getting loot.
---
Yes, it's counter-intuitive, but for the benefit of having a good bit more threat and item flexibility (let hit required to cap), this can be well worth it. If you can restrict it to just one piece of non-plate, then it won't be very impactful.
---
Our guild requires 2 greaters for Rag. It's a very fire intensive fight and they just smooth the damage out. Personally I have a bunch of regulars I use for Geddon and the lava packs, mostly because they're cheap and the lava packs really suck.
---
Did you not read ops carefully calculated breakdown? Do you not know what efficient means? Do you not understand the way down ranking and bonus healing work together? Flash heal is wasteful and should be used only spareingly if needed. Stick too rank 2 heal or rank 3 if you're gear is garbo.
---
As a caster I want that 30g for the orb.
---
Both are Horde zones, while Duskwood and Wetlands are the equivalent of Hillsbrad or Stonetalon. 15-30ish zones.
---
The difference is that OP specifically shows disdain for the Pummeler, which he hasn’t been using. He’s not willing to try hard or maximize the spec. He wants to choose a sub-par dps class/spec and put no effort into reaching its potential. Sounds like a guy wanting a carry. And probably won’t bother grinding the extra sets of gear to tank/heal as needed. In MC, no big deal. In BWL plus, these guys lose their raid spot.
---
I played ret TBC-MoP and half my screenshots have camsites in them.
---
Image is more fitting for op's responses in this thread than the original target. What a nice turn of events
---
&gt;Instance spamming is good when you can be constantly killing stuff. The problem with instances is that most people are only willing to go a couple times and they'll drop out and you'll need to find a replacement. If you're able to fill out the group quickly after replacements, then you're good to go.
---
Typically this is the case but since they are a War/Priest combo they should be able to fill the group instantly.
---
Got em’!

Anddd, this is why you should not play bfa, otherwise you'll end up as this delusional individual. You're braindead to the point of having to cope with your shitty mindless dead game (can you even still call it a game) and in order to do so have to spread low-effort nonsense about classic.
---
Queues 2 months into the game, a ten times more active sub, growth that is unheard of in /r/wow, the entire wow section on multiple streaming and video services are entirely classic and so forth and so forth. Yeah classic is a colossal success.
---
Hard fail, back to retail kiddo.
---
You're gonna have to explain this because as far as I'm aware its BiS for a while.
---
Raid times are usually the same for many guilds so there is likely 2 or more groups running the same time. Or it might be one larger guild with 2 groups
---
If you want a really in depth Shaman guide Melderon on YouTube has some incredibly detailed shaman guides where he breaks down the weapon combos and weapon enhancements.
---
Tarnished Elven Ring for Dire Maul North Tribute is what he's talking about.
---
Also focus on one spec at a time. I've gotten a full resto set (except a single ring) from getting my tank prebis simply by asking nicely if people would mind if I needed for OS (provided that no one else wanted it, of course). If you want to heal, just find groups that're looking for a healer.
---
It's an insta-kill for anyone who isn't a hunter. Probably to do exactly this a punish people for going near him haha.
---
It was a bad warrior if he wasn't immune to fear , berserker rage lasts 10 sec and in that time you should be dead.
---
31/20/0 is the spec that you will be told to use by the people who view themselves as authorities in this game.  I am [31 point Prot](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/20302-0505003-50250131530221001), and I'm fairly sure that I currently have at least one downvote stalker due to the amount that I have mentioned that on this subreddit.  The Arms tyrants truly are desperate to make sure that nobody ever deviates from their decrees.
---
Arms/Fury tanking happens because the majority of DPS players in this game are self-centered and immature, and care exclusively about their own place on the damage meter, rather than preventing wipes.  The fact that we have streamers constantly making videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2GjjkOR27c) also doesn't help.
---
Spec how you like; and realise that anyone who abuses you for not adhering to their expectations, is not worth your time.  Raid scum might respond by saying that doing so will mean that you will never be in the proverbial 1%, or see the inside of Naxx; but the funny thing is that the ethical nature of the 1% in WoW, is roughly the same as that of the 1% in offline reality as well.
---
Do you really want to be one of them?
---
I do understand his point but that is completely irrelevant. Once you try raiding molten core yourself you will understand. The raid doesn't need to stop for healer mana even if healers use flash of light and greater heal. Efficiency is not a relevant concept in this tier of raiding when it comes to them. Caster dps is way more limited by downtime than healers.
---
In a raid, the tank usually has infinite rage. It’s all about putting out as much threat as possible. Heroic every swing, sunder or revenge every global
---
Adding this link for some context. Turbofresh is pulling 700 DPS on Ragnaros with only 1 raid item (Ony neck).

Problem is that 97% of decisions a loot council makes really aren't helping progression.  Truth is there is really only one role (maybe two) that matters enough to funnel loot to them and that is a main tank.  Deciding what order the casters get the mageblade isn't really going to help you progress as a guild.
---
I'm H4RDK0R3 and have my mom sponge bath me while I destroy all those window-lickers on meters with my bear tank.
---
It's pretty normal for guilds to have trial periods and for new players to get no loot at all unless no one needs it. I would never join a guild where you're giving away BiS items to players who are in their first raid with guild.
---
50 DKP **MINUS**
---
Your points are very much in the minority.
---
Especially when you consider all the people that came from private servers that have been min-maxing for years.
---
In Classic, the community is secondary to people looking out for themselves.
---
I was trying to give you an excuse for your display of stupidity (I was also hoping for your sake that it was because you were intoxicated or lacked sleep). Considering I am often in different countries due to travel, I don’t have to imagine anything anyway. You also very inefficient in the way you communicate and often phrase things in a redundant way.

Last night I had a very rough Scholo run.  Healer was a bit low, tani kept way over pulling so we wiped several times.  I still needed one feed though so after the final boss, everyone but one dps worked to clear to the deed for me and the healer. Had a few more wipes and I managed to grab it just before the tank and other dps left group. But the healer didn't and one mob was on top of it. I figured the group was done, so I left. Then, the healer rezzed me and I had to run out so I wasn't ported to Org because I had already left group. I whispered the healer to invite me back if he was going to try to get the deed. He did and we pulled a few mobs very carefully and then he got his quest item.  It was my favorite part of the whole run.
---
Traditional where? As far as I know, "rouge" has only ever meant a reddish color, usually referring to makeup. It is a common misspelling of rogue.

Question, since you seem quite knowledgeable with macros; how would you write up a macro for casting Dispel Magic on mouseover on a friendly target or Shadow Word: Pain on a mouseover enemy target? With or without mods, that's not too important to me. Thanks in advance!

The guild I am in has 60 lvl 60s right now. we do one guild raid with LC and a second one which we fill with pugs, where all loot (except bindings, eye and leaf) are rolled. There is a signup 5 days prior to the raid. People that just joined will be forced to join the pug raid till they have proven themselfs. So far it works really well.
---
TLDR: WE KICKED BUTT 
---
Me too! I was lvling an alt then all of a sudden UC empties and I see in trade chat that org is under attack and people are offering free portal to org to defend and free portals out for people that want to escape. So I switched to my main and ported to org to join in the fight. There was a sea of green in the main gateway and that hallway leading in to org, I had to turn my graphics down to min and I was still at 15 FPS in the thick of it. Then I see the call out that ally at west gate and seeing as any ally trying to get through the main gate is going to get FPS lock I hoped on my mount and ran to the west gate. When I arrive I see the sight op posted and jump in. I get taken down after about a minute and have to run from barens back to org lucky at about halfway I get a revive and see we’ve beaten them back and people are calling for an attack on stormwind. I join in and wait for the zeppelin to stv there were so many people it was incredible, when the zep finally arrived it was like liquid watching us all move onto the boat like a unit and eventually off the boat and running to sw. we had our staging area in goldshire and when a good amount of people were there we busted down the doors bum rushed the keep and killed bolvar and then some went on to IF but idk how that went down. Feeling my duty to thrall was done I hearthed home and logged back on to my alt. 
---
Sorry for the long read
---
You can keep spamming Cath up to 43-44, then go over to spam ZF for 5 or so levels. ZF graveyard runs are by far the best XP/hour. After that it's tough to say, 49-53 you're probably better off questing.
---
You can start BRD at 52ish, that dungeon has a ton of quests so if you get those done it can be a decent dungeon to run for XP a couple times. After that though all the popular BRD runs give crap XP but may give you some gear upgrades.
---
Around 55 you can start tanking LBRS and the XP will start to pick up again.
---
you cant resist grenades as orc, was some pserver sheningans

Interesting idea, I'll bring this up in the next onyxia id. Btw. does this mean attacks during p2 generate no aggro? Because otherwise, I don't see how dds like warlocks/mages won't overtake the MT in aggro during p2 if they don't have a way of resetting aggro (ony's fireballs)?

---
It’s a 52 dps stick basically. The proc is pretty much useless. As an orc you probably want an annihilator until you get a deathbringer unless you go the dagger route and pick up core leather gloves or the dagger belt from DM and then pick up a perditions. Tauren should usually just go the dagger route.
---
Paladins have always been strong tanks and arguably the best AoE tanks in game even in Vanilla.  The lack of a taunt was a mechanical issue that throws wrenches at some boss mechanics but over all it's not a game breaker at all.  You just need to understand when a pally is a valid tank and when it is not.
---
Unfortunately though the class comes with a stigma like druids have.  People read articles tailored to make others think it's just downright inferior, and it's untrue.  The class is just different, for that matter any class can be made to look amazing in the right hands.
---
Be a tank all you want, just understand that some people don't understand you can.
---
Have you played retail? You progress through zones faster and combat is far more responsive - might be more to your liking.

and makes healers cry when we try to cancel last second in a raid.
---
Where at the safespots?
---
You still land just can’t fly back out.
---
Don't read guides, don't watch streamers, don't pay any attention to any of that shit...and especially don't listen to anyone who tries to tell you that raiding is the sole measure of your overall worth as a human being.
---
Play the game as you like, for your own reasons.  I know someone whose exclusive goals are five mans, cooking, and fishing.
---
Ok so do things the wrong easy cus we dont need to do it the correct way on this one raid... got it.
---
You do you broo. I'm gonna heal correctly.
---
Yeah I don't get why people want to sit in discord all day the second they log into wow. I'm doing my own shit, I don't Wana sit in a voice all the whole time I'm playing wow. If we're not running dungeons or doing something together, I'm not going on discord.
---
Same here, but it's not that big of a deal.
---
says people are linking pics of full bags, doesnt provide a link to these full bags.
---
FAKE NEWS till pics.
---
Considering he doesn’t have an ony neck I kinda doubt that
---
That’s why I was asking if the 12 hour daily experience was based on private servers or their actual servers 15 years ago.  I just assume it was easier originally or depending on server population vs a static amount of time/effort for everyone.
---
At least in vanilla, every guild I was in expected people to set their hearth to Kargath. That's the closest inn to BRM.
---
Like this:
---
`#showtooltip`
---
`/cast [@mouseover,help] [help] Dispel Magic; [@mouseover,exists] [] Shadow Word: Pain`
---
Key conditions for that kind of functionality are `[help]` (unit exists and is friendly), `[harm]` (unit exists and is hostile) and `[exists]` (unit exists).
---
&gt; has a limited timer to defeat him before having to go fight the boss before him again. 
---
What does this mean?
---
Are u tank?
---
If not, why not just take another dps that want to roll for it fair and square over you?
---
Tankiest are turtles. You don't necessarily need a tanky pet though. Cats are great overall and dps wise. You can also stick to your boar, it's decent.
---
r/classicwow and scarlet monastery set screenshots.
---
Rogue. With 20 mele to compete with each other loot comes very slow. 2/5 MCs had zero tier drop, only need 1 bracer BOE. Very few tier drops in the other 3.
---
I have macrod all my spells to do a /spit just in case.
---
Yea so queuing heroic strike makes your off hand only have a 9% miss chance at 300 weapon skill. You queue heroic and cancel it if you dont want to use the rage, and your off hand never misses. Hit is near useless past 9% or 6% with 305 skill, and band of accuria is definitely trash for a fury warrior. Maybe stop getting BiS lists of wowclassicbis.com buddy.
---
Depending on the circumstances, undead could reproduce the fastest.
---
At least until the bodies ran out.
---
Normal RP server is PvE. RP-PvP is obviously a different thing.
---
Ofcourse not. Im not avoiding it. But this dude says he wont inv rogues. I just wanted to say how that can do anyone...
---
I'm honestly not sure. The reason mining is great is that the instance always spawns 2-4 Rich Thorium Veins on the way out.
---
[Here's a video on how to do it] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCkECJYevY4).
---
and I wouldn't mind one bit.
---
you aren't in the raid team, you're just some random dude that got invited via trade chat likely.
---
The core of the game is meaning through effort. Community is nice, but WoW classic could be singleplayer and people would still play it.
---
You realize that you can put systems in place before you actually need them right? 
---
Our leadership set this system in place so that when we hit BWL, AQ, Naxx, etc we will all know the score. 
---
They converse with guild members ahead of time and figureout compromises on gear so people can plan their specs in advance. It’s actually hugely beneficial for preventing drama because people know in advance.
---
Lol, there is no such thing as class design in retail. Every class is the exact same, it's boring, it's mindless and the pinnacle of bad game design. So no, if thats your only example then he is absolutely right in saying there is nothing to emulate.
---
Pussy rogue like always, get fucked kid, play a real class.
---
This quest has already claimed 2 hunters from my guild. One //gquit because 'no body would help him' despite myself following him with shadow resist aura up while he didn't have minor speed on his boots. The other deleted his character. 
---
The Leaf is a curse in our guild.
---
Where are the safe spots?
---
How can I upgrade my pet's abilies past level 2? If I get a boar, charge only goes to 2. Cat? Prowl lvl 2. Couldn't even train him to bite or scratch, cat only had prowl and growl. I'm level 41 btw.
---
Yeah,if there are no huge difference between tanky pet I might stick with the boar since I really like it.
---
Eskanders is a discount weapon you give to your very unlucky offtank or just a dps warrior who tanks adds occasionally
---
15 days
---
Couple of things though - the druid doesn't NEED to farm the boss? If he really needed the cloak he should have made it clear he was after that cloak from that boss.
---
We don't even know if the druid made it clear that it was his BiS cloak before the rogue rolled. The rogue also needs to farm Strat to get Baron cape, there's no telling how "soon" he will vendor it.
---
I'm not saying I disagree, shit I'd feel mega salty if a rogue got that cloak over me **however** I'd make sure before the run that the I'm after that specific cloak and politely ask all to avoid rolling on it.
---
What I'm getting at - we're all adults and there's things the OP should have done to avoid this situation in the first place.
---
&gt; I mean his cloak drops from baron and I felt like I got ninja'd
---
There was no guaranteeing it would drop so he feeling of being ninja'd from is a bit silly.
---
Early days that’s how I farmed my freezing bands and Archmages robe money. 
---
Farmed like 100 essence and sat on them til they hit 10-12g. I also bought 50 at 4g each early on that was my best investment ever haha.
---
You can use 2 per fight. Once before the fight starts, then another when your first one is used (if necessary). 
---
So if you have Rag on farm and the odds of wiping are low, you could bring 4. If you're progressing and trying to kill him for the 1st time, I'd stock up and bring at least 10. Stockpiling them isn't a bad idea, you can always save them for the next clear.
---
Id say its usually ok, but Stonespine is a rare spawn, so its a huge ball ache to get. Id be pretty salty.
---
Either is fine, you'll see pretty minimal differences between the two. I'd recommend Deflector though, just to save you the cost of Skullflame. You're much better off spending that money on something that's your BiS for multiple phases, like Myrmidon's Signet. 
---
When I had the money for Skullflame, I looked into buying it as well, but eventually chose not to buy it and just kept farming Deflector. 27 runs of UBRS later, it finally paid off, and I'm very happy with Deflector so far.
---
Grats!! Big milestone!!
---
I expected a twist at the end horde layer hopping and sapper charging them to the ground.
---
Would be fun dueling you
---
That fight is a joke for rogues if you spec for Imp Sap. If you Sap a guard, they’ll leave it behind. Wait for the group to be out of aggro range, then kill it. Lather, rinse, repeat until just the courier is left.
---
what if the raid team is already full with 5-6 geared people on the bench?
---
Oh also, it's gonna get even better in phase 2 and 3... there's not much to do at 60 right now so higher lvl people will genuily help others if you aren't being a pesky beggar all the time.
---
but when the honor system comes out, or BG comes out? good luck.
---
All you really need is Questie, Nugenergy, A DPS tracker, A threat tracker and atlasloot/atlas. Everything else is cosmetic and can be passed on
---
From what I've gathered, similar to what blackcud replied, Slow 2h + Rockbiter will be more reliable and overall better than WF. If you want more fun out of the RNG experience or you have a faster 2h, you can still do well with WF for sure. It's not as good with a slow weapon because you'll lose a lot of damage on overkills.  
---
Rerolling Ele at 40 will apparently net you a faster leveling experience. You stop to drink often, but your killspeed is insanely quick.  
---
However, you might be rocking the Herod set (great Enh stats) with Ravager at lvl 40, for this reason, I prefer to stay enh for a few levels. Not a fan of drinking either; it's really up to personal preference. Being ele also means you can only carry 1 set of gear and heal dungeons just fine.
---
If an ally player waves at you that means their lvl 60 druid friend is behind you in stealth waiting to gank
---
10 second Google and turns out there’s documentaries on these wow gold farm workers. 
---
The fuck are you guys talking about were you not alive during 2006-2008?
---
This same ore was in Vanilla - WotLK.
---
dont delete it you monster, save a spot in your bank for the memories
---
Wowhead, IcyVeins, and Fightclub all pretty much give you the same list at this point of the game. Wowhead is very good for a casual list with some options, but if you want more in depth explanations or multiple options based on threat vs. mitigation based on your race, then I'd recommend Fight Club.
---
What do you think the best spec is for your run?  Do you need adrenaline rush for pyro, or would prep be better for pick pocketing?
---
Currently I just do coffers and mine dark iron, thinking of adding pyro/plug/pick pocketing to my runs, but not sure what spec would be best.  Right now I'm combat daggers with perds/cht.  My best swords are Thrash Blade/Mirrahs so I don't think combat swords would be any better.
---
&gt; So it only matters that both YOU and the pet are out of mana. This should not happen as the drain tank has the capability to continue grinding with 0 downtime.
---
&gt; You choose: A minor mana regen increase for sombody who is supposed to NEVER run out of mana.
---
This is grossly misrepresenting the mana situation after a pull because 1) pet has far smaller mana pool than the lock 2) warlock spells are relatively expensive 3) drain is only 70% resistant to interruptions yet has to cover both mana and life loss 4) mob damage may be high 5) random bad luck
---
Saying both will never go OOM ever is just hyperbolic BS because this scenario can and will happen with any pet during levelling, due to the nature of the class and the myriad of situations encountered while levelling.
---
&gt; **It cost nothing extra** it is just always there as a backup.
---
We are still debating the bolded.
---
There's a good chance that if everyone in the raid used a fire protection pot that 15% wipe would have been a kill. All for the cost of about 5-10g.
---
After 2(?) hours Ragnaros Respawns, and you have to go defeat Majordomo again (for no rewards) for him to go back down to Ragnaros' arena.
---
You need two sets of gear one for pve, one for pvp.  Some warlock tier pieces are actually a good balance if you are raiding, otherwise you can buy BoEs on the AH for stats and leave your spellpower BiS gear for PvE.  It's expensive and time consuming to gear out two full sets so more likely you'll try to augment where it is most cost and grind/time efficient for you. 
---
Outside raid, tier 0 (dreadmist) and tier 0.5 (necropile) are options for getting more stam vs what the BiS PVE spellpower items provide.  No one will cry foul if you roll need on them.  They're not BiS for anyone PVE, so its always an "offspec for PvP" roll.
---
I tamed another pet to learn bite and then teach it to my boar. I think thats how it goes, check petopia to see what skills your pet can learn and then find the pet that can teach you that, same tule applies with ranks.
---
My guild is so slow between fights that i have time to make a toast
---
Hunters too? Or does Ragnaros' ranged have 41 yards range?
---
Depends too much on group level, exact composition and the specific dungeon in question.
---
But in leveling dungeons (SM/ZF/Mara/BRD XP runs), it's way faster to just use 3 mages and aoe everything. If they have actual Eagle gear, they'll have the mana pool to do 2 large aoe pulls before drinking at level appropriate encounters.
---
I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*. Someone has linked to this thread from another place on reddit:

---
You are wrong though. This is a new mentality.
---
On my server there are endless requests for tanks. There are far fewer tanks than anything else and tanks have their pick of groups.
---
It’s an xp waste
---
To avoid overlooking panic install ItemRack and go to your bank.
---
When going over the slot that should have the item you'll see every single piece of stuff that you have in your bag.
---
Really helps on not forgetting/"losing" gear. Also saves time searching.
---
1. Stable your "main" pet
---
2. Tame a new pet with the rank of the ability you want, use this to help:  [https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php](https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php) 
---
3. Use that new pet in combat for a few minutes until you see a message saying "you learned X"
---
4. Swap back to "main" pet
---
5. You can now use beast training to spend points teaching the new ranked ability to that pet
---
Because the fight is so easy it is just a waste of gold for everyone? Healers kinda fall asleep during Rag anyway. Like 3 of your healers need to disconnect at once or something catastrophic like that for the dps to start dying from raid fire damage.
---
In a pug I could understand it maybe. I dont really know from OPs comment is his guild taking 5 or 15 pugs, but if its just a couple I would care about them using fire pots.
---
You didn't obviously. You spent nothing but your time. Gold sellers are trying to sell gold at 10g per dollar on our server, but you obviously wouldn't get nearly as much, and you'd probably get banned in the process.
---
Since everyone is shitting on the guy for his set up, is it reasonable to still wear the entire set and get hit capped provided you have an axe?
---
Because it dropped in the dungeon group. You might as well roll need on all items that drop so you can sell for vendor price if you want to use this mentality.
---
If youre standing in front of an MC mob to get parried, you are stupid and probably dead to spell damage or cleave
---
Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros
---
Awesome, I will give this a spin when I get home! Thank you :)
---
Pots are 3g each, and I'm expected to bring multiple stacks of these, as well as my regular pots, and pay 8g a night for repairs? 
---
No thanks. I'll use them for Baron Geddon and Onyxia and that's it.
---
It was a thing in TBC.
---
Because paladins got a high threat ST pull ability, and already had the best aoe TPS in the game. They were noticeably squishier, but the norm was to aoe grind dungeons with them.
---
Yeah, I didnt write it myself, I just have it saved. I agree it can be written better. I just post it like a copypasta because there is an alliance variation that is a retort to it somewhere.
---
Yea don't listen to that guy. If everyone greed's the orbs and you click need you'll be kicked from the group and your reputation will be smeared through the mud. If you want to need the orbs communicate this to the group before the run, but there is literally zero incentive for any pug to agree with you.
---
That would be sharding, which people didn't want.
---
Is defense a good stat for pvp? Doing some theorycrafting with a prot paladin pvp build, considering swapping the pve deathbone set for the lightforge set and am wondering if keeping the prot tank bis for neck, back, trinkets, rings is still worth it for the defense in a pvp scenario

cause it's new, as opposed to the decade you've spent on retail.

when you hit 60 you'll feel the same wya after your 25th strat run.
---
Which race is best for a druid tank?
---
Played a druid for 3 years now, mage is probably our easiest matchup so it's not a big deal if you're losing to us. With that said there is still ways to win for you. Your best bet is to try making him go oom, play it as if you're trying to run away from him. Keep r1 frostbolt up, make sure CoC hits everytime and save novas for AFTER hes shifted, that way he has to shapeshift again. Dampen magic is a must.
---
shh don't give them ideas
---
Have an upvote lol
---
&gt; In most cases it simply is not worth it in raids.
---
Your words.
---
Early on boars are the only pets with a charge mechanic so yeah go with it. Once you're able to tame cats with dash (lvl30 iirc), you might want to switch to it. Or just keep the boar, they're pretty cool
---
If you're after Gold, then you looking in the wrong place...
---
Neutral Cruise\*
---
Correct :D I was the first to reply, now that the correct answer is there it seems rather silly
---
The fight isn't easy for everyone. You're assuming that all guilds and raids  have the experience and skill that yours does. 
---
I mean I totally agree, it's trivial at this point for experienced players. But if you're running in a raid where there are questions about the the chances of getting a kill, get fire protection pots.
---
My rule for hunters and rogues is if the group dies, especially if it’s the hunters fault, then they better drop dead with the rest of us and run back too
---
A question regarding priests wanding. I'm pretty sure almost none of the priests I have been in a dungeon with was constantly wanding even when there is not much to heal.
---
Are they lazy/bad or has it something to to with aggro?
---
I use all my playtime farming it , killed about 1000+ dragons atm. But thanks for the encouragement!
---
I have heard that retail would fit my playstyle better, but none of my friends play retail :(
---
I use burst of knowledge on my pally and feel like it's better situationally than the briarwood reed. Its essentially 10 seconds of free rank four Flashes which can be HUGE in a tough fight. Don't ever feel bad about rolling on loot that is an obvious upgrade for what your providing in the dungeon at the time.
---
In the RP guilds lol
---
I remember solo'ing rank 11 pretty easily just doing AV.  So if i can easily solo rank 11, then getting into raids of coordinated pvp to farm honor together on a consistent regular basis should get me to at least rank 12 or 13.
---
You should stick it out for pvp/bgs. Game is spontaneous and there is no set “rotation” for every situation. Go engineering and the game opens up
---
The people who do it get banned.
---
Is the dmg difference between boars and cat that big to justify a switch?
---
There's only one option, so it comes down to what faction you want to play.
---
never seen one ask for anything  for food/water or summons lol
---
That's no tauren, that's a pack mule! Guild bank on hooves!
---
But they are immune to magic dust??
---
Holy fuck, that explains a few things.
---
I need to vendor this POS asap.
---
they can go fuck themselves too
---
To be honest I have no proof of it existing or not existing back then. Nothing I read suggested it being a thing tho, if the old wowhead comments are anything to go by.
---
Same time
---
&gt;  :----p
---
Are you a horse?
---
Druid weapons are just stat sticks, nothing crucial on them
---
Does it work on unlooted corpse?
---
Which faction is best for a druid tank?
---
Even if I were a carry(and I’m not) I don’t stamp my foot and demand items because I recognize my time isn’t worth more or less than anyone else’s.
---
If you're trying to wpvp in your pve gear you're asking for trouble.
---
Hi yes I realize aoe is faster by far but this is just a question about an average pug composition with no real aoe
---
Nobody is saying you need to.  
---
If you wanna ruin your reputation over \~20g, go right ahead, no one is stopping you.

Thanks for that although I am aware of it, I was just asking for tips from hands on experience.
---
Thats why u hit 60 during first 3 weeks.
---
I ways assume that when people wave at me they are scared I'll gank them
---
Interrupts were processed differently. It’s either a bug With classic or you are just late.
---
Frak .....shit.  
---
*Blows whistle*
---
Of the two allegiances, I’d have to guess alliance.  AFAIK, bears don’t profit from wind fury, but do benefit from paladin buffs.
---
I've never made it to "endgame" raiding on classic.
---
I'm assuming that you get a couple gold per raid by loot/trash? Or am I assuming wrong?
---
Jesus christ this dude is a tank.  He is the one who is supposed to be standing in front of a MC mob.  So he will get parried.
---
Vanilla, the simplest but best flavor.
---
I think you mean 
---
Vanilla flight path + Peggle
---
Kited mobs will teleport back to where combat started as opposed to just go into evade if they are sufficiently far from where they started. Most likely you just dropped threat, or he has a hard leash which you hit. I believe they put hard leashes on certain mobs like Kazzak to prevent city slaughters.
---
It's not terrible especially AR
---
I meant mostly escape artist.
---
And it's all because of this false expectation of this experience we do it
---
Also, just from regularly eyeballing the number of active users, I've noticed that we have about 50% more active users than r/wow.
---
Yeah I just slaughter any horde in my path, I'm a bit dumb about it too because my bloodlust takes over even when it's clear they're gonna be a tough nut to crack.
---
But as a paladin , if I've bit off more then i can chew, thats when the death ray comes out. Kills everyone except geared 60s.
---
It's even worse when my buddy is on. Hes a rogue. Whenever we're out in the world questing we depopulate entire zones.
---
Red is dead
---
Let’s not talk about Retaliation’s timer lol
---
What's the best 2h for orcs? Should i save up mats for an arcanite reaper for my alt (48 currently)?
---
Is that a big deal? Or just takes a long time to farm the items?
---

This was how I got my cloud serpent in a day on retail.
---
Reset, get all the eggs, reset, get all the eggs.
---
Over and over, luckiest day ever.
---
Don't forget your poop sock.
---
*spit*
---
The problem is that "tanky" pets aren't good at "tanking" because they lack the damage to hold aggro and any pet is more than durable enough for levelling, so it's preferable to gravitate towards the beasts that keep enemies off you effectively.
---
That said, the Boar does that, but that's just because Charge is very good making the Boar good *despite* it being a high-armor-low-damage pet. Gorillas can have an honorable mention for Thunderstomp, but because they only eat fungus it can be a pain.
---
I will always just default to Cat for levelling, if I'm honest. The hold aggro so well with Growl/Bite with manual casts of Claw if needed. Prowl is also seriously useful, especially while levelling and your pet is often a level below you so has a larger aggro range.
---
12g is a lot for someone saving for a mount for gear they will replace in 1-2 days of play time though
---
Deflector for mitigation, skullflame for threat.
---
Literally no one?
---
This is what I do as fury, each run is a little over 9g after you vendor everything/turn silk into bandages. Three runs an hour is very doable solo.
---
Okay, so we'll def. try this one on Sunday. :-D Thanks a lot
---
ty ty
---
Idk...I don't have an issue farming things for the most part.  Sure, we're not hunters or mages, but we've got a damn good toolset to handle up to 57-58 elites solo and at least 2 of anything non-elite. 
---
And we're a hell of a lot better than our prot warrior friends.
---
Why is this?
---
According to what data?
---
I don’t see any real negativity in his post. For you, it might be important to have a friendly atmosphere. For some raiders they want a friendly environment but they may have a strong desire to clear the hardest content in the game efficiently. 
---
When talking about optimal raid play there’s an outsized concern for the health of the entire raid. A raid should be likeminded in its goals, and for a lot of raids that means putting in work outside of raid to progress your character. 
---
The degree of this expectation depends on the raid. In some raids getting benched isn’t a personal attack or negativity. There’s 39 other people to consider in a raid group. If somebody isn’t contributing in the same way as 39 other people it’s not negative to tell them they have expectations they’re not meeting.
---
You dont seem to know much about mage gear. If my mage drops 150 spell damage and puts on every item in my inventory that has the most stamina, I still wont crack 3500 hp.
---
I played tank in vanilla through wrath. 
---
I know what I am in for.
---
Proof?
---
Wow I thought this was only something I did. Like seriously hahaha
---
Buffing for arenas in TBC and Wrath....
---
Can mages just use fire ward/IB?
---
while i agree with most of what you said, i disagree with this part:
---
&gt; This game has gained so much traction, and it's not because of content, difficulty, or story.
---
&gt; It's because of you.
---
it's massive success lies in the pureness and relatively "hardcore" style of play. mobs hit like trucks, you can easily die, travelling the world takes a lot of time, the level-up progress is slow, respeccing costs a lot of money, and so on..
---
i play exclusively with friends and a guild, and can count on one hand how many "random" groups is joined. i also do not think it would be a net-positive for the game if i had to... :-)
---
Your  heart is in the right place alright, out of your body! :D
---
Here’s my favorite.
---
Add:
---
/cancelaura Ice Block
---
/cast Frost Nova
---
That way frost nova also works as your cancel ice block button, very hard to misclick, and you can spam it to freeze creeps when aoe farming and you’re surrounded by mobs in ice block.
---
Just replace your normal frost nova hotbar slot with this macro
---
Spell batching and leeway are both horrendous.
---
love my cables
---
It already sells pretty well tbh, because of the above :P (no one knows about or they forget that it is a thing, it's also a side herb so most people don't even know how to get it efficiently)
---
No holy nova?
---
Is called routes, works on classic with modification, is not that hard.
---
Right, I'd certainly give priority to anyone who shows his dedication to the guild and helps others progress faster outside raids and/or who contributes materials for potions and other craftables/consumables, but then again, not everyone has the time to do that... If someone has perfect raid attendance, but can't afford to dedicate more time to the game because he has a life, is it less desirable for a guild to help him progress because he can't contribute as much to the guild as someone who has less real life obligations?
---
Nobody does. I'm also not going to waste my time doing something I don't need for no benefit to people I don't know. And since no tanks need strat live for anything, you're going to be waiting a long time to find someone willing to carry you for free (and yes, you are being carried).
---
Nope.
---
Excellent Mage play!!
---
Yeah, that’s the problem with Cat druids. They’re viable if they’re willing to put up with it, but you risk getting burned out. 
---
Now, you don’t need 15 MCPs for MC + Ony since most bosses die fast enough that you can get away with only using 2 charges. I’d say 8 are the minimum for MC + Ony. My example above gives on average 16 MCPs, so you could do half of that and still do fine. For a 60 Druid, running Gnomeregan 5 times takes about half an hour and it’s close to IF (OP is Alliance, so it’s not far for him / her). That’s 30 min of work, 5 days a week. It’s manageable.
---
Currently stuck between Dwarf Warrior or Hunter and can't decide. Got a Dwarf Warrior to 60 on Nost and it was FUN. Definitely very enjoyable for PVE and seems like one the classes with them most interesting rotations, but very annoying to have to constantly switch specs for PVP.
---
Got a hunter to the 50's on one of the post-nost servers (can't remember which) and it was also very fun, had macros for completely everything and dominated in wpvp, but never got round to seeing what the end game PVE was like.
---
Currently leaning more towards hunter but need help deciding so had some general questions.
---
Is the PVE side enjoyable at higher levels? I know their damage isn't the best but is it fun?
---
Do I keep the same spec for PVE &amp; PVP?
---
Do they stay strong in PVP or do they fall off the more geared everyone gets?
---
Should I just stick with Warrior because I know I'll enjoy it at higher levels?
---
The problem isn’t his mechanics the problem is other people fucking with you. The tree method you can kill him fast just weaving shots.
---
Lol. This post is so dumb. DKs were imbalanced as fuck on release, they were ridiculous. Any class would feel awesome if they were outright stronger than the rest and DKs didnt fall in line for *years*.
---
in what order did you run the dungeons ? a list would be nice  :) (ie DM 17-22 SFK 22-25 ect)
---
Thank you
---
For some people who don't have as much time to piss away as you, paying a fee to expedite the process is pretty rational.   
---
Some groups don't want to spend all night looking for a tank, so they sweeten the deal.  
---
Some groups don't have shit else to do with their time, so sitting waiting to form a group for an hour is equally as rational.   
---
It's not entitlement if it's something that's agreed upon beforehand.
---
Sure, mages don't aim for 4k+ like warlocks and priests, but 3500 should still be very doable.
---
They shouldn’t in dungeon groups. Random person asking for water? Fuck yea give me that money.
---
I'm not going to say you're wrong or right, because I wasn't there, but I will say in a group the person who needs to be waited on the most is the mage typically. 
---
They are usually blowing through mana from pull to pull on DPS and the groups overall downtime usually comes down to how long it takes the mage to recover. Healers seem to usually go through less mana than the mages. 
---
If the mage is recovering that fast between pulls to the point where it feels like they are waiting on you, you may want to look into pulling a little faster. The flip-side of the coin you presented is that it's really boring to be in a group where the tank isn't pulling fast enough and you are getting bored between every pull.
---
Means 3k hp unbuffed.Pretty standard for pve gear before raids atm
---
Defense can very slightly decrease your chances to be hit (like 0.04% per skill). 
---
Use stamina instead. Stamina is king in PVP.
---
Hi, /u/saskatoondude

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dpo5bl/fury_tanking/). 
---
Holy fucking UI Batman... yuck
---
yeah because raiding, something you can only maximum do once a week = the entire game, ofc
---
The more sunders you have up the more threat you cause with over abilities because they do more damage. Get the applied asap.
---
You also have to think this is for high end competitive raiding. For the average player, doing much of this and figuring it out (which requires a crazy amount of simming) isn’t too big.
---
...Though they still often mimic how high end players do things, so it kind of is an issue.
---
It was tested during beta and confirmed in release.
---
Hahaha! Make me think of that video of the man slapping everyone.
---
I see.
---
retail players and fury tanking
---
Probably Tauren for the Stamina boost, but I think it's pretty marginal at best. I have a Night Elf Druid as my alt and he does just fine as a tank.
---
I said shamans have ways to cheese threat. 
---
I didnt directly say shamans do more threat than warriors. 
---
We can just wear our mail gear and still get the tanking done while warriors are too busy thinking they need all their "high threat" leather dps gear on while they take massive damage in dungeons. 
---
Its a giant joke, honestly. People say shamans cant tank because they cant mitigate... But if you are geared right they sure can. 
---
I'm just pointing out the double standard of this strange "meta" we are in.
---
Doesn't that seem pointless with Blink doing the same thing, **and** moving you **and** freeing you from stuns, all on a 15s CD?
---
So based on this spreadsheet, it seems that
---
1) at less than 225 healing power, it's pointless to down rank. Just spam the highest greater heal you have mana for.
---
2) beyond 225 healing power, heal2 is the clear winner
---
That makes sense, I guess.
---
Water elementals in EPL. And yes, there will be competition, but half the time people will rather go about their business than fight
---
/u/DewRat mentioned the addon puggle above and it seems to do exactly what you want.
---
I mean the area between the bank and AH in IF is also always packed. And you don't walk past duels, no but you get to fly right over them so you're still very aware that it's happening, not to mention, you get the x defeated y in a duel while in the AH.
---
A shame :P
---
I use middle mouse button for skull, shift middle mouse button for x, and ctrl middle mouse button for moon
---
I'm too cheap to die
---
You can download it without a sub but you won't be able to login.
---
Better than Holy Fire for pvp though, it’s a full second faster.
---
The bird ability is probably Screech. 
---
&gt;	Blasts a single enemy for damage and lowers the melee attack power of all enemies in melee range. Effect lasts 4 sec.
---
&gt;	Can be learned by: Bats, Carrion Birds, Owls
---
So it seems a Bat, Carrion Bird, or Owl could work.
---
Anyone can access it, but can you create a character and play with it?
---
He's the "hunter who is needing Dal-Rend's swords". Or similar piece of self-entitled shit.     
---
At least in vanilla/classic his reputation will give him a reality check sooner or later :)
---
But classic is dying /s
---
So I noticed that the RP servers are way more chill than the rest... 
---
Maybe Blizzard should mark some servers as "casual" and enforce some rule that elitist behavior is banable.
---
"Sounds like somebody wanting a carry"... implying that they are selfish for being feral and expect their raid to gift them gear and raid spots.
---
This may come as a suprise but most guilds arent going to attempt to clear end game content. A lot of casual friendly guilds will be content to clear mc with their friends every week. 
---
You could make the assumption that OP is in a friendly guild based on the fact that they bring a feral druid. So ultimately your comment is pointless. It's not like they are in an ultra hardcore raiding guild that just didnt know that feral wasnt min/maxing and you graciously let them know she was wasting a spot and getting carried
---
Hunters too. There’s periodic fire damage and the knockbacks. 
---
This isn’t like Luci/Garr//Baron where you can outrange the mechanics.
---
I don't wanna judge but those seem like pretty bad binds. Have defensive/battle on E now and it's amazing for tanking.
---
That rogue at 45 seconds in needed to try out his [gun move!](https://youtu.be/GinDjIDTvHk?t=431)
---
As a rogue, ganking people while wearing a robe really confuses the enemy.
---
But whats the logic of #nochanging this, but then using the gear and the talents from later patches.
---
lol why wouldn't you just claim to not have the skill for it?
---
Chuck Norris
---
You are not correct here. A tank in proper plate gear wont die in battle stance vs defensive stance. It's not a huge reduction
---
The trash drops some money but overall you'd be losing money considering the cost of repairs and consumables. 
---
Raiding certainly isn't profitable, it costs you money to do it.
---
You've wasted your time with 2 responses so far, clearly you don't have much else going on in your sad little world.
---
I'm gonna have to try this out! 38 now but was thinking of trying ele at 40, but may try ele/enh first. What weapon do you use?
---
Taking a flight path and loading a bowl.
---
Is the game playable again?
---
fucking kangaroos!
---
Wrong answer keep wasting mana on renews when all your other newb priests will be trying to override your renew and all your other healers will be using real heal spells and your renew might get 1 or 2 ticks off of non over healing but you just spent the same as a flash heal in terms of mana. People need to do some research and actually raid before posting stupid shit. People all butt hurt because renew is trash and they use it and have no clue how to read logs.
---
what about feign death
---
I was levelling at release with classicwow.live and whilst it was great, I know that I can make it even more brain dead by having an addon do it all for me.
---
Can somebody please help me out with a list/link to an addon that uses TomTom to send me to each and every quest giver? If not, I'll just use classicwow.live
---
If you can't find shit to do in game then concrete gear progress is all you value from this game. That doesn't mean that is all there is to do. I've collected my dungeon sets on both characters for when the upgrade quest like comes out. I participate in pvp and rp events. You can power level guildies. There is literally an infinite number of things you can do in this game.
---
You mean to say "that's all the gear I can get".
---
Ive done a lot of orb farming as a tank to make my gold. 
---
Most times we do round robin— resets every instance so in an instance, every1 needs on the orb- if you won one, pass on all the orbs in the instance until every1 got it (5 orbs) then u can roll need. 
---
After the instance resets, ur RR resets as well. I think thats the most fair. 
---
However, some runs we dont do RR. i’ve won 3/3 orbs in a run once. 
---
If you’re running w a guild then all orbs are yours man. But in pug group, most likely every1 will roll need on it, but dont stop urself from asking the group— you’d be surprised. At least ask before starting the dungeon,  not when it drops. 
---
And to answer your question about averages.... id say my average orbs a run is 2-3. Always do cannon. If you dont, average is 0-1 :)
---
GL! If you play on sulfuras realm, pm me Malfeance. Bear God of the realm ;)
---
"and it makes no difference if you decline" LMAO
---
How much extra gold would you say you get from having herbalism and enchanting ? I just snagged myself an eye if sulfuras and need the gold something fierce, if I'm serious about putting in some time in DME as a shaman, would the profession pick up be worth it?
---
Its possible to level from 1-60 never leaving the barrens and stv, of course its possible.
---
What you're asking is it a viable option for the sheer time required? And that answwler is "it depends". If you have a very strong 5 man crew who can plow through instances then yes.
---
I know there is one ele shaman multi boxer who went from 40 to 60 incredibly fast by straight up deleting mob packs in instances with chain lightning fire nova totem and magma totem. Due to all the ele shamans being able to heal and tank quite well with shields he just nuked his way through instances stupid fast.
---
The biggest real issue with ONLY running dungeons is the downtime of forming groups and traveling. Otherwise yeah you can absolutely level from just dungeon running.
---
If you want the guild to have a chance at being successful then yes. If you want to mess around in a noob guild, by all means, go for it. Just know that it will ultimately go nowhere and the road will be rough.
---
You can dislike it all you want, most tanks will just say "no thanks" when you tell them they can't have first orb and will near-instantly find a different group where they can have the orb.
---
Tanks are by far the most in-demand role for dungeons and it's particularly true for Strat Living because even fresh-60 tanks don't have much of a reason to go there more than once.
---
Actually you want to, this is why FD exists. Autoshot &gt; Aim &gt; Multishot &gt; Autoshot &gt; FD. No more aggro issue
---
I'm gonna get there first!
---
Sure, but unless the raid wipes because I went OOM from healing myself because I didn't pre-pot Fire Protection, what difference does it make, except wasting 4-5g every attempt?
---
Love it. Need some marylin Manson with the beat synced over huge holy fire crits
---
Dont’t forget undead plz
---
The mages will just drop the warrior for another mage. You dont need a warrior for mage aoe spam
---
Wow and its players can be so adorable goofy. Love it
---
It’s funny how people think that creating a bunch of threat or that somehow over threating someone could count as a taunt.
---
&gt; I was trying to give you an excuse for your display of stupidity
---
I haven't forgotten what the argument was like you have. I haven't contradicted myself (multiple times and within the same comment) like you have. Your very first counter example had nothing to do with speed. Your second example only worked if the user wasn't tech literate enough. The word "enough" is pretty important there and I suggest you read it and make sure you know what that word means. Additionally if you have a computer then you're setup for it. All you need is a basic computer setup but you probably don't know that because you aren't exactly knowledgeable. Then you made more irrelevant comments about preference as if that fucking matters in an argument about speed. Then you incorrectly restated the argument at me. Then you talked about preference again like an idiot. Then you incorrectly describe me as having two problems with words that mean virtually the same thing (talk about redundant lmao). Then you said that your over engineered solution isn't over engineered in an extremely unrealistic situation which still makes it over engineered for the situation that everyone on this thread has been talking about. Then you pretended like you knew what grammar was but then got that wrong too. Then you made some baseless accusation about my ability to empathize even though I haven't been talking about that at all this entire time so theres no way for you to know anything about my ability to empathize. Then you made another ill informed guess that wouldn't have even made sense even if I was hypothetically bad at UX. A lot of this is because you thought I was someone else even though I stated the argument I was using multiple times so it shouldn't have mattered if I was the other person. You've been embarrassing yourself in nearly every reply you've made to me and yet you you're still trying to pretend I'm being stupid. My guess is that your example of my stupidity is going to be because you don't know what "enough" means. 
---
&gt; You also are very inefficient in the way you communicate and often phrase things in a redundant way.
---
It probably feels redundant because you write at a 6th grade level. I can assure you nothing I've written to you is redundant. You can take my word for it since I don't forget things I've said as easily as you do.
---
I had to think for a while, then remembered we just barely managed a triple pull last time I was there
---
how?
---
Druids are better for 5 man dungeons IMO, not so much as main tanks in raids.
---
This was great, reminded me of when I first played Vanilla back in High School, so unconcerned about leveling and instead enthralled by exploring the areas in full 3D I knew from Orcs and Humans through The Frozen Throne. 
---
Reminds me to slow down and take in this beast of a game instead of fly through the experience.
---
The salt is real... lmao.
---
Cry us a river you big whiny baby.
---
Just because something can be done doesn’t mean it should. A rogue can’t tank. Man rogues can tank, rogue are so good at tanking I’ve done a DM west with a rogue tank. When I was lvling a rogue tanked ST didn’t even die I mean the rest of us did but he just vanished. Just because rogue isn’t meant to be a tank doesn’t mean rogue tank spec isn’t viable.  My warlock pet tanked tanked live strat. What warlock pet tank is best tank in game. Warlocks are best tank they have health stone. Have you even done a full Mara with hunter tank? Amazing right?
---
See, and shit up you bird.
---
No I don't, I never played WoW beside the free trial
---
Can I ? Because even yesterday I wasn't able to see the "classic" version on Battle net launcher, and now I can
---
I'm going to test it
---
and at the end “thanks guys!” wait for others to use Hs / portal and go back.
---
Killing mobs in azshara. Running dungeons and hoping to win to good loot to vendor.
---
This is cute because I was on, y’all tried to raid IF first. Then proceeded to go to SW because we all defended at the hill infront of the IF’s gate.
---
No one cares about SW lmao
---
As someone who mains a warrior and loves world pvp, I always run around with my paly SO. 1v1 I suck, but with my healbot in tow I feel unstoppable.
---
I’m planning on having a guildie help me with some Princess runs to get the ring. 
---
If we set to master loot, can I wait at the entrance and still receive the loot after Princess or down, or do I actually need to be in the room?
---
Conjured water isn't a drop.  
---
Priests mana isn't a drop.
---
Locks ss isn't a drop... see where I'm going with this?
---
An mutually beneficial agreement is not the same as charging someone for something that your class does for free, at any time, anywhere. 
---
If you want to try again with better examples, I'm all ears.
---
Correct, bear doesn't benefit from windfury or flametongue
---
Its a whole lot of work to be near the top vs warrior and rogues who are ez mode.
---
If you really want to be the very best dps, not sure why youd pick feral. If you like being druid, then why worry about where you stand on the meters? Sounds like your guild will bring you no matter what so just play your position.
---
WoW players naturally have an obsession with "peak performance" but the content is so piss easy who tf cares... Its like trying to optimize taking a 5th grade math test with a feather and some ink against people using number 2 pencils.
---
don't ask me, i did not ask for it.
---
But there were some thing where people wanted nochanges, despite nochanges were impossible to begin with.
---
There's even the merit to what is actually "no changes" and in merit to what. they surely won't be repeating patch releases, and surely people did not want that.
---
as you can see - it's a mess, and i consider the "nochanges" dialectic a fallacy.
---
but hey, it sells and it's cheap.
---
I never said anything about can't play faction and I said "I guess" which you called a lie. Lol
---
Yesterday i was turning in a quest and didnt even notice the 3 ally around me until i saw a wave emote in my chat. Im 59, i turn around and see 3 lvl 53s gnomes looking at me, so i start blasting. Kill 2 and 1 escapes. All they had to do was walk past me and not wave i wouldnt have even know they were there.
---
I mean if one of them is strong then two of them is even stronger. Compared to perception which is pretty meh. Means you can save blink for stuns or when you need the movement and use escape artist instead.
---
It's funny because /r/classicwow consistently has like 40% more viewership compared to the retail sub. And the retail sub has 3x the subscribers.
---
But we’re always good natured!
---
Frost is probably the worst spec vs. warlocks, FYI. If the warlock is SL with a felhunter out, the only real chance any mage has is a pom pyro spec with perfect play and some lucky crits. I'd argue it's the 2nd most imbalanced matchup after mage/warrior.
---
&gt; Are they lazy/bad or has it something to do with aggro?
---
Wanding doesn't work like auto attack, you can't just immediately heal. You have to stop wanding, wait for the gcd, then start casting your heal. To me, wanding feels... annoying. It doesn't "feel right".
---
The problem is people like yourself (I assume) who are used to BfA and don't understand how classic mechanics work.
---
If you want to speed run dungeons, either play a tank or a healer. Sick of idiots with that mentality. If your warrior tank has no rage and a douche bag keeps pulling, then your tank has no chance of tanking effectively and it will take a long time to run the dungeon.
---
Chill out, let your tank charge and get aggro then start dpsing. Any dungeon takes considerably less time to finish if everyone understands how aggro and rage work.
---
I dunno really. 
---
I guess it’s partly luck and partly how good you inherently are at finding “the right ppl”
---
Some ppl are just good at it. And I think it’s sort of an ability that’s part of their personality. 
---
The most successful guild I was in was a guild that one of my very social and friendly real life mates found. This mate of mine has a history of bringing in nice ppl to real life friends group too. And I have a history of not! Lol. 
---
So for me personally. If I want to join a “solid” group, I will tend to look were my mate is and join “his” group. But if I want real life close and deep friends I will mostly look myself as I tend to have few, but very close personal mates. 
---
At the end of the day you will have to know yourself. And you will have to be good at knowing who to contact to “help” you find someone more like you. 
---
To elaborate a little bit. My mate has a tendency to bring ppl together. Mostly always a friendly group. Very casual and easy going bunch of ppl. And I have a tendency to join that group at my leisure, but never feeling as part of the group as my mate does. But I follow their lead unthil I don’t want to anymore:)
---
Worst type of people.
---
You have to advance a certain ways into the initial cavern to be eligible for the loot, not sure exactly where it is.
---
It's useless, do not go out of your way trying to get it.
---
You know. I have Level to 60 twice in WOW.
---
A hunter took me 11 days (my first 60) then a mage which took me 9 days played. Which is not too much. But defenitely not even Close to good as a mage that wants to Level quick.
---
This time (druid) I had 17!! days of /played. I took my time and was AFK a lot. But it takes some time to Level just in perspective
---
15 stam vs 28ap
---
For PvP or open world, I'll take the stam
---
Mining is the way to do it. It isnt impossible, its just hard.
---
“dont lecture others” he lectured.
---
I’m new! And leveling holy, and have no idea how to weight stats. For eg should I prefer grimlok’s tribal vestments (5int/10stam/20spirit) vs dreamweave vest (9int/14sp/increase damage and heals by up to 18). 5+10+20=35 &lt; 9+14+18=41, but I read somewhere that I should prioritize spirit? And that the equip isn’t as advertised?
---
It was a mechanic built into the game since the beginning and was never changed and honestly I'm very okay with it not changing because it adds a more in dept feeling to what rogue life is really like.
---
Take those class mechanics away and we get the same class different flavor. I know a game that is like that, its called Rift.
---
Nice 😁👍
---
I went with Skinning and Herbalism for some extra cash. How does engineering work?
---
Don't forget to grab an iPad on your way out!
---
I love how there is a wave of guards that just peace the hell out
---
I don't think anyone runs SL now tbh, doesn't it require a fair bit of spellpower since you're sacrificing so much damage by going deep demo?
---
Most are pve sm+ruin, maybe some tryhards with conflag.
---
good chance to just walk into a third one!
---
Right, I'm sure that people who are part of the Council love the system, I never argued against that. I'm merely trying to understand how people at the bottom of a guild's priority list can rise through the ranks and establish themselves as someone the LC wants to gear up...
---
ie.: How can LC not feel unfair to people who, as OP put it, can't even be trusted to stay in the guild, but also why would they stay in the guild if they can't expect to receive loot to begin with?
---
Thanks for the info, hopefully someone can expand on this. 
---
We were gonna run through with invis pots but that may end up being sort of expensive so I’m trying to avoid that if possible
---
If this guy was truly free he’d be wearing the sickest transmog available, fuck the stats.
---
I pick pocketed all the mobs I see, and if I relied on the lockboxes I've picked to level lockpicking, I'd still be in the low 100s.  Your method only works if you level very slowly, otherwise you'll outpace your lockpicking skill very quickly.  Picking a 175 box doesn't help if you still have 150 skill.
---
You’re making a lot of assumption I don’t know why. I’m in a hardcore guild and I want a feral druid in my raid. It’s not a wasted spot. The point the other person was making is that if you’re going to play a hybrid class as an “off role” you might have a fairly disproportionate amount of work to prepare your character for raid. In this example if a feral Druid isn’t farming MCP for raid they may not meet expectations. 
---
If you’re talking about casual play comments about optimized raid play clearly don’t apply.
---
Fuck that, I wont ninja loot but God damn I'm not taking a run when I could just sit and play peggle for 10 mins instead.
---
It’s good place to learn just cus you can click does not mean you should
---
TLDR - the more effort you put into your search, the more likely your choice will work out. 
---
Sounds like your approach in finding guilds isnt ideal. You jump quickly without researching. Also, you joined all tryhard people at the front of progression. I find these people have a high chance to be snobs, extremely selfish with loot, impatient. 
---
I was 60 about 15 days after release but stayed guildless for weeks after until I found the right guild. Was monitoring the server discord recruitment posts and wow forum recruit posts. Found a guild that first made it clear they were not tolerant to any hate speech, LGBT friendly. Second that they had detailed documentation about their raid structure, rules for attendance, and loot. All of which I found reasonable.
---
Then I monitored for people from their guild for a few days in LFG and general chat. Even ran a pug dungeon with a few members. Then talked with the guild leader off and on for a few hours asking questions and offering to answer questions. ... Only then did I feel I found a good match and applied to join. 
---
I've played since vanilla, this is only my 4th guild (ignoring mergers). Had a vanilla guild, switched for BC to a less casual group. Still have some toons in that guild and hang on their discord occassuonally to this day, even though none play wow anymore. New guild for Legion and BFA since the previous was inactive. New guild for Classic because my retail guild wasn't interested in classic. Have never regretted a guild choice. I'm sure that is somewhat lucky, but also comes down to putting in the effort.
---
Rogues and feral druids must love grouping with your ninja ass lol
---
They could sell essential blackmouth oils!
---
Was just about to say this.
---
*murloc noises intensify*

Elemental shamans
---
Just dualwield instead :)
---
then you got incredibly lucky, by the time I started playing a week after launch the flight path in red ridge was frequently camped by higher level horde fucking with alliance trying to level.
---
Who stays in berserker stance? You use ww and switch back. Also, where are you getting this info from. I am a warrior and I have all plate armor...I've never bought a single piece
---
Sounds like a 2 shot....
---
DKs were one-man raid groups. They completely ruined the first couple arena seasons in Wrath.
---
Fetch me my brown trousers!
---
As someone who's ran a guild on pservers and now in classic I'm finding lots of retail babies who don't understand how loot works in vanilla raiding. Can't wait for BWL and AQ when the raids are no longer PUG-able and people begin to realize they actually need a guild to progress.
---
It was just an example of some DPS they could do, they could also toss DOTs onto mobs, if they are at full mana or nearly.  I tank dungeons on my prot warrior and have had plenty of healers open up on mobs because I wasn't taking much damage. I've also healed as mostly enhance spec on my shammy and would auto-attack and use shocks if my mana was full.
---
Yeaaaa nope, i feel good and ive done 40 :p
---
Sure, but that doesn’t make it BiS
---
For 1v1 eventually yes, but you'd be hurting a lot on damage if you do that in current gear and that kinda sucks in group pvp.
---
&gt; Be visible and useful outside of raids.
---
So someone with a wife and kids, who can't play all the time is basically fucked even if they have perfect raid attendance...?
---
&gt; people who are on the cusp of a sweet set bonus will be given higher priority than your 2/8.
---
So as soon as someone gets his first Tier piece, it can be expected that they'll get the next 2 pieces, since they're already closer to 3/8 than everyone else? That's the part I have a problem with. Instead of having everyone progress together, a few select members progress much faster, "for the good of the guild", while others are left trying to prove their worth despite not having access to gear upgrades.
---
So not posting on twitter = they dont work?
---
Are you fucking dense? Jesus Christ. Just because they didnt tweet until two hours later doesnt mean they didnt notice something is wrong. They most likely started working on the issue, and only informed CS to tweet about it when they noticed it will take longer.
---
What a crybaby you are. "Waaaaaah Mommy come halp, they aint tweeting!"
---
This sounds like a reasonable approach.
---
Had I been through the same ordeal as OP I'd be pretty forlorn, though. I found some good friends (strangers to begin with) to run dungeons with, ended up getting invited as last spot healer to a number of dungeon runs. Had the occasional mention that if I at some point would be interested in joining for some raids, I would be welcome to join. One night they told me to pop on discord, and I ended up having a chat with the current dungeon group and an officer. They seemed very chill, had a similar mentality as me and didn't try to poach me, but rather told me about the guild structure, raid times and progression. Decided to part ways with my leveling guild and join them, and most people seem very nice thus far. DKP based, except that MT/OT seem to have had tier priority the first runs and Legendaries (TF) will go to MT first - in order to improve mitigation and threat generation to make the healers' and DPS' job a bit easier. I too went on the player basis in decision making (as well as checking their guild/loot rules etc) - hopefully it'll work out better for you next time, OP.
---
As a fellow Rogue, that Rogue is fucked up. As a fellow combat Rogue currently leveling, even I know ganking as combat is just asking to get dunked on.
---
Thorium point and Karghat will be fucking Verdun in Phase 2...
---
It will be GLORIOUS!
---
Poor drood

There's a copy pasta.

That's awesome lol
---
Alliance have op av advantage
---
Underrated comment
---
I've met a lot of nice people. But I've never had an amazing group. There's always been atleast 1 bad egg.
---
Not sure what to tell you, i followed a buddy of mine who i played with in TBC, he was playing with some buddies of his then we merged with another guild and started recruiting, i took care of some recruiting and emphasized ''Fun, no stress atmosphere'' in the recruit message and the guild is looking mighty fine now
---
We just had our 2nd week of raid we went in with 34 people and we cleared Ony + 8/10 MC in less than 3 hours
---
I'm a bear tank with a really good fire res set so i usually just MT fights like Magmadar, Geddon, Rag and either add tank or not tank at all for the other fights since i do more damage in cat as a full prot warrior would, theres no tank drama
---
The officers are 2 pairs of buddies, one from each guild that merged and i'm like an unofficial 5th officer
---
We freeroll most of the loot although the first Ony head was mine cause the neck is BiS i'm a 315 skinner and a LWer so it just made sense that i start making BWL cloaks right away but the last head we got was just freeroll
---
The Black sinew dropped, free roll and now we'll just default the leaf to the hunter who won the black sinew
---
People are just nice and they'll pass on gear if it's a bigger upgrade for someone or if it completes their set bonus
---
So i guess, just find people that aren't complete dick humans and understand that the content is easy as fuck and will be running for a long time so everyone's gonna get geared eventually
---
I never downloaded Spy since I felt it was so anti-Classic that I expected Blizzard to remove it...
---
Every bit helps until you cap. It's not like a breakpoint thing where it's only useful at cap. You will hit 1% more often for every 1% hit you have.
---
Mobs will easily hit you a minimum for 3-5% hp, 4 mobs will hit you twice in that time, and if you take longer in beserker stance
---
Weird, I had the dropdown menu even without a sub. When I tried to login it said I need active game time. So it didn't work until I had a sub.
---
its pretty easy you as a mage should get the sword lost Warlocks/Pala´s and then mages but since your guild has no idea about the game its fine.
---
Take the contra position. Is it fair to the guild to give loot to someone that A. doesn't take the time to get to know their guild mates B. Doesn't help out their guild mates C. Only logs on for raids expecting loot?
---
If you don't want to feel like the low man on the totem poll, then I don't know be fucking social with other people, help out other people, learn your class, and don't only show up to raids expecting loot. 
---
Generally, the people in a loot council that cry about loot council are the people that don't do the things listed above. Now that isn't to day that ALL loot council's are perfect. If you are involved in a corrupt loot council that gives Thunderfury to the GM rogue, then you should leave. 
---
However, if you are in a loot council that gears up tanks, limits meme spec access to powerful items, spreads out loot while rewarding though who out in the effort, then you should stay.
---
You are able to fill groups quickly, but then you wait for people to get there to the instance.  XP/hr is mainly contingent on 3 factors kill speed, regen time, and travel time.  An SM run can be 15-30 minutes, but if you're spending 5-10 minutes filling out the dropped party members and waiting for them to come to the instance your XP/hr has dropped significantly compared to just duo questing/grinding.  You're also filling out the dps roles so your kill speed is heavily reliant on the pugs which typically aren't all that great.
---
My current alt (39) is in the same boat as him and I'm in a much better situation as we are a trio of warrior, druid, and warlock.  I can tank, druid heals and supplements a lot of dps in downtime, and warlock can dps as well as summon people to instances and even then the XP/hr can be outpaced by some of better quest hubs.
---
Yup. Feels like so many people feel entitled to stuff now, wonder where that is coming from.
---
Meanwhile our healer left after reaching enchanter in Uldaman.
---
I don't know shit about warlock gearing but I feel pretty confident that hit is top priority.
---
wow, this is some good info, thank you
---
Yea I get that. But I can just say no thanx to their runs as well, and I do. You see I have been 60 for nearly 2 months now and I've never joined a reserve run for anything. I'm geared, and experienced in the game, and the only reason that I would do strat live is for a chance at an orb. Other people like me will also say no thanx, so a pug tank that reserves an orb can have fun wiping in there with fresh inexperienced 60s in greens and blues. I'll just join one of the other 3 groups that will be formed and start the instance before the group with partial or full reserves will find people desperate enough to join.
---
When people are greedy, they end up playing on hard mode.
---
I sell portals saying Im saving for my epic mount. When someone gives me 2g instead of the usual 1g I  thank him. Mount up on my epic mount and run away.
---
Nah it will be like this:
---
Good players&gt;bad players and premade&gt;no premade
---
It's the single strongest dueling spec sure, but you won't kill anybody as SL if they simply run away. SL is hot garbage for organized pvp.
---
I need some advice for resto druid healing...this week will be my second time in MC (assuming i get into a pug).
---
Last week was a heck of a learning experience.  On one boss I was second on the healing charts, then on another I was near the bottom.  On that first fight I was getting so many heals out that I was OOM.  On the other one, I had mana to spare because other healers kept sniping my heals.  And on trash pulls, I'm consistently lower on the charts, presumably because my casting is slower than the priests.
---
I'm taking the time this week to get a raid frames upgrade that I think will help me see incoming heals...but what else should I do to be more effective?
---
It gets you so much utility which can be used in numerous situations (pve and pvp). I mean so many cool trinkets. Helmets that give you a charge to stun enemies, mind control caps, spell reflectors (shadow, frost, fire. Watch a warlock or mage blow themselves up), grenades that stun, bombs, craftable epics and weapons, trinkets that deal ranged damage or give you a damage shield. So many cool things, I have engineering on every character.
---
So the guy running their Twitter account is now the face of the whole company? Are you actually serious about that? If so, then what the fuck are you smoking?
---
Alliance have OP racials, paladins and big AV advantage and overall better players than horde. Lmao at " usually only attack in the wild when they have the numbers advantage ".........
---
I kited all 4
---
Azeroth autopilot let you put your brain away IIRC
---
As a rogue, I encourage it. Makes my ambush more better.
---
No where near as efficient as mages. But you can kill 4 to 5 things at a time then drink and do it again. It's like 20% faster than ret. Anyone who tells you different is probably thinking about twinked paladins at level 50 with private server bias.
---
I've been maining a tank and I've been tanking an absurd amount of dungeons. I have never gotten a complaint that I am being to slow because I am constantly paying attention to peoples mana and I learn very quickly after the first few pulls of the dungeon how much these guys are going to be able to handle. 
---
If you aren't adjusting your play to how skilled your group is you're tanking incorrectly. You should be moving at a pace that suits your party not forcing slow people to catch up with you or forcing fast people to wait on you. 
---
You're there to enable your party.
---
Wana know what the top 5s team was?
---
5 death knights with death and decay glyph.
---
wana know the top 2s team? 2 deathknights with death and decay glyph
---
....
---
Wana know the best 3s comp? Pmr because some shit doesnt change.
---
lol what is his problem
---
You get 100 points for free from the quest.  It's trivial to go from 100 to 275 on lockboxes, and I have done it on every rogue.  You get *way* more then enough lockboxes every level to pick up 5 points of lock picking skill.
---
And I level at a typical pace.  9-10 days /played at 60.
---
The only way I can imagine not getting enough is if you were only doing quests for killing beasts, maybe in like STV.  All the dungeons are loaded with humanoids to pick.
---
Its running on a newer client, but you can put the settings at “classic” to see what it used to look like.
---
all horde say this but both factions can be equally bad, lol, on Gandling, lone horde rarely attacks me, groups on the other hand are very brave suddenly :D, one time I was ganked by a shaman and warlock. I hunted them down 1v1 and they both tried to run, the cowards.
---
I think premade will be alliance favored as holy paly are king in PvP and the gnome racial is pretty op for warrior.
---
Random group should be pretty equal, retardin might not heal you as you're dying next to him but neither will the shaman trying to record a WF proc video
---
This was so cute
---
I’m large group PvP Paladins are much much stronger than shamans (BoP and Freedom) so on paper you’ve actually got it opposite, horde is going to have a hard time.
---
And that’s not even mentioning Alterac Valley, which has a massive Alliance bias
---
I would take dreamweave vest. The spellpower is just the best stat because it actually increases the speed you kill mobs. Spirit is valuable (especially if you have spirit tap), but spellpower is just far superior imho.
---
there is a program you can run that will mimic your key presses and send to all WoW programs running. So it's still 1 click from the player but it's performing 5 actions in total. 
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Multiboxing\_software](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Multiboxing_software)
---
You definitely can. But they aren't intended to be.
---
I believe it. Pretty random ass thing to say either way though lol
---
Healthy population, nice community
---
hence '1 shot' since he died instantly anyway you dope
---
Nothing better than making someone insta-release their corpse in pvp. Honestly, just wait 5 seconds if you want to hide your rage.
---
No you didn't. That isn't comparable when they're not doing the same role. Raid heal isn't important.
---
Lol these people just don't know how casuals play. My wife can barely manage her 1 button frost bolt rotation, accidentally novas at the wrong time, forgets to buff, doesn't precast food/water till she needs it. And they wanna suggest people like her should heal a group? Oof.
---
On my server, they are even less popular than priests or druids.
---
1% Hit is better than about 40 Spellpower. 
---
You want to stack as much of it as possible until your able to hit cap.
---
For The Gourd!
---
Spooky
---
The best PvPers choose Alliance because they crave the challenge of an uphill battle beating down Horde with their racial crutches and will be able to find PvP more often to practice their skills.
---
Those are the premades you should be afraid of.
---
What? You can cancel your wanding at any time and start to channel a heal? I've seen some priests litterally just afk half of the time when no healing was needed.
---
Sorry, guess that was a really poor use of slang term. Cheesing just means using mechanics to your advantage. A shaman with rockbiter legit doesnt need fancy gear or special weapons to hold aggro.
---
 You just tab or click and you have aggro. Thats it. If it looks sketchy you can use earth shock in cooldown, but you can probably just save that for interrupts if you really want. 
---
Its the easiest thing in the world. 
---
But you have warriors going out of their way making things harder on themselves and their healer wearing dps gear when they really just need to be using sunder and yelling at mobs. I blame min maxing.
---
Congrats on the trinket, Second Wind.  I just got this yesterday and can't wait to be able to use it.  I have been getting very lucky with +healing drops, as I AM a holy Paladin.  Having a blast.
---
You can defend them all you want, there is no excuse for a billion dollar company employing a twitter guy who can't keep deadlines.
---
This is not a bug just how the batch windows work. It's the same with other spells and abilities. Actually kind of useful if you're almost finished casting a spell and suddenly your target takes a big chunk of damage you can proactively make your heal crit without having to cancel and recast.
---
/spit is only allowed if you turn a gank around on someone. If you're attacking someone 5v1 and then throw a /spit at them, you're a bit of a douche.
---
You pop it on pull right before an energy tick
---
For sure. Min grinding 1 or 3 at a time is great, but things like lashers being immune to nature soured me because that was my big plan to slowly make an epic mount haha.
---
Enemy variety will be much different in pvp
---
I think you’re over estimating the difficulty, those raids will absolutely be puggable.
---
You were the one using absolutes bro. So I pointed out why I disagree. Calm down. 
---
The DPS increase from Ret isn’t that much either unless you are being fed blue weapons every 4 levels or so. I’d take consistent DPS and survival that holy gives to a newer slower player over Rets DPS casino any day. Cause the OP was about what would be easiest for a older slower new player... Holy paladin is totally an option. 
---
Instant dungeon groups as a healer. Illumination/Spiritual Focus both really do make a difference even at lower levels. Steady consistent pulls solo especially after they get seal of wisdom. And consecrate is super nice for tapping multiple mobs for tap power leveling. If they stick with Holy they only have to worry about caring 1 set of gear. You really want a newby hauling 2 sets around clogging up their bags?
---
You came in on my reply being all high and mighty”Never! Ever!” 
---
I disagree. It can work. There are multiple reasons why someone who is slow to react could enjoy holy leveling.
---
well, you also need to be well geared and have to be able to play your class well.
---
or you can do what i do and 3man it wich makes it not so gear dependent.
---
I think I had a bug: Yes I was able to go on a realm; I restarted my game because of a freez on the character creator; and now I am unable to play because I don't have active game time
---
(strange that I had been able to join a realm the 1st time and now I can't, again I guess it was just a bug)
---
You sweat every day?  Turn on your A/C man, sweating is for the poors.  
---
As for shitting, i like to use a wet wash cloth at the end of each day to just make sure its super clean back there before i get into bed.  Yea i could use a wet wipe, but this is cheaper and i don't have to worry about it clogging up the toilet.
---
I've had idiots in my guild complain about the same thing yet we had just fought Garr so they were dumb and arrogant.
---
Pyromancer and Plugger.
---
Just don’t have time to play everyday. Sometimes I just login and farm Copper for an hour or so because it’s better use of my time than trying to get half a bar of Experience.
---
Nice screenshot!
---
Shamans in general are garbage.
---
kite &amp; auto attack weave when you pull aggro.  You take 0 damage and your pet takes 0 damage.  way less down time bc you dont need to deal with bandaging/mending your pet (mana, time, etc).
---
Guess we shouldn't kill Arthas in wotlk now
---
I think you might be underestimating DoT damage. Even with zero spellpower immo/corruption/coa totals 3k damage with only 2 seconds of actual casting.
---
That's cool and all, but can you beat a level 17 hunter?
---
No Windfury totem for you.
---
Congrats mate. Now go strut around a capital city and show it off :D
---
If you have a tank why leave it in the garage?
---
The hobbits, the hobbits, the hobbits , the hobbits to Isengard! To Isengard!! They're taking the hobbits to Isengard!
---
So what your saying is you can nearly match an unbuffed warrior who doesn't farm anything if you farm 10 hours a week?
---
Same experience on PVE.  Been at 60 for several weeks, still find very friendly groups, no toxicity, just good wholesome fun.
---
its all a matter of what works for you. If you like to afk shoot when leveling, then bear, boar, turtle, gorilla are the best tanking pets. High armor and ok DPS. 
---
But if your opening up with all, then you want a high DPS pet, go for a Cat.
---
I enjoyed alchemy, so I’m really leaning towards that. Solo levelling a warrior has been way easier thanks to some potions that random people gave me, lol
---
I'm not saying it has to be a race. You're asking for how to get gold by the time you're 40, and I'm telling you.
---
Part of the reason you don't have gold is that you're blowing it on stuff you don't *really* need. You can't both have your cake and eat it.
---
The comment you responded to is exactly what you asked for, a way to come up with 30 gold in ~4 levels. 
---
&gt;You completely missed the mark on this one!
---
You've told others who gave you helpful advice the exact same thing. You refuse any sort of advice and act superior about it for absolutely no reason. You're the one in trouble for blowing your gold.
---
You realize how fucking dumb that sounds?
---
Would healing LBRS be too difficult as a 57 holy priest in quest greens/dungeon blues? Guild run this weekend needs a healer and I’m thinking about making the switch to holy for endgame now but don’t wanna be too weak for the dungeon.
---
What if it's the horse icon next to the blacksmith hammer? We'll never know...
---
My key, my chest. 
---
\- Blacksmith
---
Killing undead in the plaguelands for argent Dawn rep, you can only farm them for a certain amount of rep before you have to use turn instead and quest so it's best to grind them first then turn instead then quest.
---
I was kinda hoping this post would be a cell phone pic of the /r/wowclassic homepage.
---
Mmmm peanut butter and gumballs, my favorite!
---
You can wear the set if you like the aesthetics or flavour of the bonuses but at the end of the day it's still going to be pretty suboptimal considering there are much better gear options in most of these slots besides maybe 3 pieces that are actual BiS for this phase of the game.
---
You can however be hit capped with an axe in this setup if this is what you are after. Ony neck + Gloves + Accuria + Tarnished Ring + Satyr's Bow will get you 6% hit.
---
Its basically the same thing for level 60...
---
Except bigger packs you might pull with chain lightning and need to be more active about your retargeting. 
---
And some bosses want you to earth shock them once or twice because your dps are starting to get nice crits. But you'll know when you have to.
---
I make it a point to now write "DO NOT LIGHT ALL THE CANDLES AT ONCE" the moment we enter the room. Yes, in caps. Just playing it safe.
---
I play on OCE and we had a similar thing happen to use a few weeks ago. Blizz rolled back the servers and an elite quest that took me 3 hours to complete (most of that was looking for a party but we also were competing for spawns from others) got rolled back. It was just me that had it rolled back, my party members and I all handed in the quest at the same time but for some reason mine was rolled back. Still salty about it to this very day. I never went back to complete it.
---
Warriors don't 'have' to wear leather to hold aggro, either. 
---
Also it feels like we're talking about completely different things. Im talking about raids and you seem to be talking about lowbie dungeons.
---
yeah, anything can tank a lowbie dungeon with no problem, it doesn't matter. 
---
Not that molten core is especially hard, but warriors that are dual wield tanking probably aren't wearing a lot of leather because they're already taking way more damage without using shield block so they want to reclaim every bit of armor possible. basically they only need enough threat to stay ahead of the top dps. ultimately the 'right' amount of threat vs mitigation is the highest amount needed to be ahead of dps, while having the minimum amount of mitigation needed to stay alive. 
---
can a shaman hit that perfect ratio? maybe he could, but even if he could, he would be doing it without last stand, without shield wall, without taunt, without challenging shout, without mocking blow, and with a mana bar. 
---
also, the shout-threat strategy was fixed, shouts dont do hardly any threat at all now.
---
Paladins can have fireplaces? I figured the dresses would be a fire-hazard.
---
What I'm saying is, it's not a "Horde cruise"..... Unless they became pirates and took over the vessel
---
Lfg naxxramas
---
I own 2 copies of this game. One with everything opened, sorted, etc, and both expansions. The other is base game and the 1st xpac, the base game opened and xpac still fully sealed up inside, though the box's shrink isn't on anymore.
---
It's a wonderful game, but I only play it "one sided" these days. We just play one faction, and with a few fan conversions, don't have the other act at all. Much more fun and doesn't take 6 hours.
---
Exploiting a poorly implemented system does not equate to skill.
---
haven't tried DI, but it is quite easy to have two paladins give BOP to the same person, causing two debuff of 1 min as well.
---
I don't know, there are a *lot* better games for single player RPG if that's what a person wants. The catalogue is just far too extensive to name here for RPG games that are single player, have a great story, the grind, the chase for gear, the open-world concept.
---
WoW is meant to be multi-player and designed around that.
---
Does dead reddit accounts count. Wow must have so many dead ones
---
I remember when Quixel made photoshop plugins.  They're pretty huge now!
---
I took a break from here since the release and am quite shocked at the numbers. Glad for the indisputable success and that so many prefer this over official forums because I prefer the format and attitude here.
---
I suspect a big portion is thanks to the big streamers simply playing the game and looking at threads on here from time to time while streaming.
---
Is Mass of McGowan a good weapon for tanking? I like the dps and stats on it but the attack speed looks pretty low, so not sure about getting it
---
Gz
---
Back in the day, I dropped skinning, got Ench high enough, made SHotM, then dropped ench and releveled skinning.
---
Reroll while you still can. Currently a west coaster on one of the big EST servers. I was really hoping getting on a bigger server would mean I’d find some late night guilds fairly easily. Not the case. Have yet to find one. I also figured long term it’d be fine because I’ll be back East within a year and I’m in classic for the long haul. But at this point, I’m waiting on paid server transfers that aren’t coming any time soon.
---
You’ll be fine. I’ve had healers that were 55
---
Ehhh, I agree with your overall point, but 80% is not my experience.  I'll drop to 50% on a bunch of pulls and require a big heal after the opener.  Which is fine, because I just hit everything like a truck.
---
This is why I am subspec =) I can try to vanish and cheapshot to save the healer but then still be able to prep and vanish again if I can't stop the wipe! Sub spec is the real rogue spec and all other specs are inferior!
---
The absolute fastest Joana did was 3 days 22 hours. Jokerd wasn't that much faster.
---
Remember, these are speedrunners who have optimized and practiced for over a decade on pservers for this.
---
I've found that 1-40 is harder than 40-60. It isn't because of mounts. They simply make travel faster. The thing is that you don't have all your abilities yet.
---
Many classes start coming online at around 20. Druids get Cat Form. Mages get Blizzard. etc.
---
Which is why he comment was negative. OP was clearly content to be in the middle of the dps pack and did want to do the extra farming for pummeler. Nothing he said was needed to be said and he should just not invite feral druid to his raid instead of trying to let everyone else know they should invite feral druids to their raid
---
Lmao
---
I'm sorry the World server is down. Try again later.
---
The 3 pieces I can think of are the necklace from live strat that gives +1 hit - my necklace sucks so no big loss here.
---
2nd is the felheart robes that give +1 hit and 13sp - currently I have void robes which are 46 SP
---
3rd is the belt from BRD gives 1 hit and 13 SP - I have sash of secrets which gives 33 SP.
---
So it would be worth trying to snag +2 hit on robes / belt and lose around 53 spell power?  If so thanks mate, guess I'll start rolling on the robes
---
The macro bypasses the global cool down.
---
That sounds right up my alley, thank you. Going to use netflix picture in picture and rewatch some bojack whilst levelling.
---
Thanks!
---
If we are wiping in raid, I go stand on the hunter FDing in the corner. We’re all in this together, after all.
---
Lol I love seeing warriors decked out in leather as a rogue. 
---
Phase 2 will be fun running into these guys on the battle field. I don't think a lot of them realize that the leather (in theory) works well in PvE but are going to be vastly upset when I two shot them in PvP due to their extremely low armor rating
---
Why are you meating people like this in the first place? I only meat people I really care about, lest I be stuck meating someone for the rest of my life who I don't enjoy being around.
---
It worked on private servers guess they weren’t as accurate to vanilla as we thought then. Rip
---
That's called ninja looting and its a shitty thing to do but gratz on being awful
---
I'm starting a shaman, level 12 now but am also curious on this
---
Not only the potions, but an absolute shitton of nature res gear for AQ. 
---
Yea no way people can pug C’thun or even twin emperors for that matter. BWL is extremely easy. (Basing all this on my vanilla guild which sucked ass and managed to clear nef after like 4 months of being stuck on vael). 
---
After BWL the gear requirements are the real killer and I highly doubt people are going to want to deal with PUG’s wasting their consumes for multiple wipes anyways.
---
Dont you just love getting a big heal off, wasted mana and regen, and target still died because it didn't go through?
---
Heroic strike generates bonus threat, similar to sunder armor. This bonus threat is a static amount. The actual damage your heroic strike is dealing is almost inconsequential. The real benefit to a fast weapon is if your attack is parried your next auto swing is coming out much faster. White hit gets parried with a slow wep? Rage starved for over 2 seconds. Heroic strike gets parried? Another 2 seconds with no threat coming out. On a boss pull this could cause you to lose aggro and allow the boss to run over your raid. About the rage gen- in higher end guilds the tanks are using rage pots and goblin sappers on the pull to instantly fill their rage bar and dish out large amounts of burst threat. Faster weapon = quicker rage dump.
---
Yeha but warriors are absolutely insane in vanilla, easily beating out all others in realistic scenarios, and even more when they pop cooldowns. The top warrior parse on lucifron is 2700 dps right now (which, to be fair, is a cleave fight) and no other class even comes close to those numbers in an ideal situation.
---
You're still keeping the various ranks of the spells on your bars...aren't you.
---
Because 'fuck you', that's why.
---
The true purpose of his request was to find a friendly tailor :)
---
did he stand on you where you were skipping mobs due to stealth? I tought you were in that together
---
no, brokentooth is good for multiple things: spell pushback, frenzy upkeep/max profit, holding aggro better, dmg insurance etc. But that wasn't my question, the question is really simple 'what abilties do you learn him?'. Not really that hard if you know basic english.
---
I’m pvp specced with pvp gear in p1. If I didn’t have pvp gear I would just die like the mage in this video but almost 4K hp as a priest is pretty valuable.
---
You get the full time on Polymorph, as if it were the first time it was cast. The only difference is that in PVP, Diminishing Returns applies.
---
I know a tank who did just that, he got 17 for deadmines then tank specced and spammed dungeons, he got to 60 in like 2 1/2 weeks after launch. That being said, best advice is to find a dedicated group to spam with so you decrease the downtime of LFG
---
No, its perfectly fine.
---
You ever gonna acknowledge barbarous blade? That is what you should get, especially as a hunter you can solo farm it.
---
What type of shaman are you playing?
---
As Elemental you have Lightning Bolt, Chain Lightning, Earth/Fire/Frost Shock. Those you could place at 1-5. Then you have totems, which can be found as Shift+1-5. That's 10 abilities within your WASD placement.
---
You have even fewer as Enhancement and Restoration is similar.
---
I am unsure what you mean by "I can't even put them all on my bars". I can fit all classes abilities on the bars, unless you haven't enabled them in your interface options?
---
I am a holy roller Paladin and NO that is NOT a dress, it's a very long kilt....
---
Right? World of Casualcraft, no wonder they didn't enjoy BFA or legion, they didn't fucking do anything.
---
Flight path + bong break
---
Won't ever happen. Between alts and pug runs, MC will be run regularly throughout the whole expansion
---
Nah. I definitely feel like content, story and difficulty have something to do with it. I think the content hits a sweet spot for casual players to where the game's content is just hard enough to be satisfying to accomplish but also not insurmountable. 
---
The socialization required to get a group to do anything hasn't changed behavior in my experience. I seem to pug with the same rate of douchebags and personable people. It feels like pulling teeth to get people to kill extra mobs, do extra content that they personally don't need. Seeing the same group looking for healers to spam arena/anger in world chat for over an hour, when they could add golem to the runs and actually run it at the cost of 2 minutes per run. I spent 4 days looking for a DM West group because I guess tanks pretty much don't need anything in there so they don't want to run it.
---
I never initiate pvp on my hunter because honestly, I'm trying to get shit done. I feel like half of the time I do that, all I'm doing is letting alliance get the jump on me instead of me on them. So I'm gonna start initiating on every one I see because historically it's me or them.
---
Yea I realize the math thing probably won't happen idk how to remove from title, but you never know if someone has already done the expirimentation on here
---
Every mage wants to aoe. It depends on the group and what the tank wants. Sometimes I just frostbolt the skull and sometimes I let the tank get threat then burst. But some tanks only focus skull so even a non frostbite coc or any aoe will pull agro. I just find it's best to play off how the tank wants to play.
---
This is not true in this phase. There isn't enough damage to be rage capped.
---
Correct
---
3 months of farming consumables is the amount of time it takes to level a good class.
---
Macros are your friend. I macro similar totems together and set them with shift and alt modifiers. For example, Searing, Magma, and Fire Nova totem are one key, Strength of Earth and Stoneskin are one key, Healing Stream and Mana Spring are on key, you get the idea.
---
Here’s an example of what one looks like:
---
#showtooltip [mod:shift] Healing Stream Totem, Mana Spring Totem
---
/cast [mod:shift] Healing Stream Totem, Mana Spring Totem
---
With that macro, by default it will cast mana Spring. If you hold the shift key and press the button Healing Stream will come out. The icon and tooltip will also change as you press the shift key.
---
Hit capping is like the most important thing right? Sorry I am a noob and just getting to the point where I am thinking about pre BiS and raiding soon (level 54)
---
Like I said, the ticket site wasn’t working. I managed to contact them anyway. Thanks for your help.
---
Talk to me about improved revenge. Does the stun (45%, 3/3) work on raid mobs/bosses? dungeon mobs/bosses? I know that with skills like these it seems an awful lot of things in the game just are straight out immune to these effects. Is it worth picking up?
---
Get to 60 and start doing Maraudon farms, then you can go for Tribute runs, but that's a bit tougher and requires some precision.
---
The scam IS working and people keep giving them money
---
Less QQ, more pew pew!
---
Quests give on average right now 900 Experience? Hardly half a level for 1800 Experience. I'm in no rush to level, clearly.
---
That is not true at all...
---
What's PVP gear right now?
---
Xp/hr?
---
The addons you can see are Battle For Azeroth UI, SexyMap, Bagnon, Details and Plater
---
It's funny how many haven't had that type of exp before. I finished WC last night on an alt and a war still needed 8 deviate hides. I helped him finish and I couldn't believe how thankful he was. To me, it was just part of being a good grp mate, because many have done the same for me in the past. Who we decide to be in the game has a cascading effect on everyone around us.
---
No it wasn’t in my bags. See my updated comment.
---
Or not, some people do age a lot faster.....  I have seen may a bald young people out there.  Just saying.
---
I wouldnt call level 60 dungeons lowbie dungeons, and there are shamans that can still off tank in mc if they are defensively specced. I would still prefer a well geared defensive specced shaman or feral druid over a random fury arms warrior that doesnt have the gear if you need an extra tank for an encounter. 
---
Nobody was every arguing a shaman could main tank a raid. 
---
But "tank" doesnt exclusively mean raid main tanking.
---
I was using item rack and it dissapeared.
---
Wearing Valor for the extra armor so you can take a hit is okay. But the 6 piece bonus shouldn't factor into your decision. Warriors have probably the worst set bonus out of all the dungeon sets.
---
spit is also acceptable if someone from your own faction steals your devilsaur leather, followed by an ignore and a blast in trade chat ofc.
---
Never be the first one that dies. You should always let the dps die if a pull is particularly deadly. Obviously try and let no body die...but your priority is definitely tank/healer &gt; dps. The dps knows this, if they're low they can run out of range and bandage or pop defensive's. That's a bad habit that a lot of healers get into is trying to save everyone and dying in the process. If I realize a pull is getting bad I always fully focus on the tank. If the tank dies you wipe, if you die you wipe, if a rogue and warlock die, you'll probably survive the pull and res them.
---
MC sure. It's already happening. But BWL though? Isn't there some kind of gear resist check partway through?
---
I foresee a widening gap between those who can raid and those who can't, and also gear checks. If you didn't run MC to get at least some prerequisite gear, I'm doubtful they'll let you into BWL in greens.
---
No one deserves it for that reason alone.
---
What he said. Especially naxx is hard to do without a progress oriented guild and consumables, not to mention  greater protection in bwl aq and naxx.
---
I'll stick to mining lol.
---
Lol lecturing someone on basic English then using the sentence “what abilities do you learn him” 
---
Ironic....
---
So, basically your position is that you don't want to interact with other people, help out others, and not contribute due to RL life, but then be handed loot? 
---
Again take the contra point. Is it fair to the people that do play this game to socialize, help others out, and still contribute dispite RL playtime limitation to then hand loot to those that do none of the above. You don't need to know life it to still make a meaningful impact on your guild mates. 
---
It feels to me that you just want to be handed loot, while not engaging in any of the activies for which people enjoy playing MMOs. Why are you playing an MMO if you don't enjoy any of the activities that make MMOs enjoyable? I think maybe Diablo or PoE is the game you should be playing.
---
Our guild just "/roll 40" and give it to whoever is that number. Its Vendorstrike afterall.
---
This truly is the endless debate on what people prefer in classic wow. Basically the only solution to satisfy everyone is to not have a hard rule or expectation for pugs. We need to discuss everyone's preferences when the group is first formed.
---
For cloth, mostly necropile set with stamina/hp enchants.
---
Clearly
---
&gt;I mean without him you guys couldn't open it
---
That\`s why I always carried a couple golden skeleton keys in Scarlet Monastery.
---
Last night I was in the Venture Co. Mine in Mulgore just farming copper and copper veins and another warrior a level lower than me showed up, and just kept dying. Lvl 10 warrior is rough in there, 11 isn't much better, but he just wasn't managing rage, was constantly body-pulling extra mobs, wasn't using Rend or even Hamstring to kite away from adds. 
---
I realized that he's probably a new player, probably hasn't played vanilla like I did, and even if he played BFA these are things that BFA doesn't teach you. And it felt meaningful to see someone right there, struggling, and asking in /s "Could you help me out with Fritzsprocket?", and joining that group. A little thing, but holy cow, it's not something I've had happen in years in retail.
---
I'm definitely a Classic Convert. I didn't think I'd give up the achievements, the mounts, the QOL improvements, etc of retail, but I'm so happy to be playing Classic again, for the very reasons found in this thread!
---
Use the AH to sell things and farm dungeons for greens. What I did back in the day.
---
Then after you realized that, you were able to go out to some bars, find a nice lady, get married, have a few kids, send them off to college, contract stage 2 colon cancer and get back to the computer just in time for your first rounds of treatment before you landed in Darkshore.
---
no tribute buffs? smh
---
Okay thanks a lot!
---
Sp trinkets over actual trinkets
---
Most warriors have dps set, tank set, pvp set. Bag space is a premium ha.
---
i tried doing this while leveling up, i just go OOM lmao. Shapeshift mana cost is insane,
---
Gromsblood is used in Flask of the Titans FYI. Better to save for those.
---
I hope you replied: 'don't lecture me, I know what i'm doing'.
---
I’m a lock gunning for it. If a healer is more casual, not worried about raiding, doesn’t know what BiS is, and benefits from it, I’m accepting that they can roll. It’s still gonna suck if it happens, but being excited for other people to gear up is part of this game. 
---
My thought is that we wouldn’t be in there without a healer. It feels wrong to tell that healer they can’t have upgrades because they are better upgrades for me and there are even better ones for them if they just keep trying.
---
exactly. if there is gonna be a hybrid tax fine, but then they should have nerfed warriors
---
Might depend on the tank, but largely it's not a problem.
---
Had a 55 shaman in quest greens/blues healing me last night.  Helps that I'm at 60 and not taking much damage relative to what a 55 would take, but...you get the point.
---
what gear would you recommend?
---
and any tips for pvp gear ?
---
That's so lazy and slows the group down. It also means healers will pull aggro on the 3rd mob by the 2nd heal, or even 1 crit heal.Shout + 30% threat threshold is only enough room for around 300 hp of healing on a threat-reduction specced healer.
---
That means hunters pull aggro with multi-shot.  
---
Rogues can't blade flurry (the 2nd hit is RNG)  
---
Warriors can't SS/WW. 
---
That isn't even a chain pull vs aoe thing. That's just basic tank and threat management.
---
As a prot warrior, they're my fave class to fight out in wpvp. 
---
* Charge them or Bloodrage+Intercept (if they catch you with a dot)
---
* Beserker Rage
---
* Shield Bash or Pummel their casts
---
* Execute their asses
---
I’m stealth skipping mobs in raid?
---
I see so if you join a PUG thats a disaster, you are screwed for the week.
---
I think it is totally moronic.
---
Thats like alliance raiding thunderbluff lol Raid IF then come back to us.
---
Hey ,
---
I tried the castsequence Makro with the dots, but didn't like it. The reason is because if a mob withstands or is immune you have now way of getting deeper into your rotation.
---
I work just with some macros with modificators [mod:shift] ; [mod:alt] to have less buttons.
---
For example  1:
---
/Cast drain life
---
/Cast [mod:shift] drain soul
---
/Cast [mod:alt] drain mana
---
For example 2:
---
/Cast Immolate
---
/Cast [mod:shift] corruption
---
/Cast [mod:alt] curse of agony
---
(Don't copy- paste didn't watch for spelling)
---
Still need 6% for yellow attacks (shield slam) in raids if 305 weapon skill, 9% if less than 305 weapon skill.
---
If you read some of the comments on this sub, your head will explode. Far too many people (i.e. more than zero) don't see the value of either good vendor trash or trade materials. Also, there are a number of BoE greens that are worth at least 1g that one can pick up from dungeons, so long as they have a good suffix. Finally, rogues that don't pickpocket or lockpick just completely befuddle me. It's free money!
---
You'd be fine. Tanks can go in at 57 and do alright, healers can realistically heal that a few levels earlier so you shouldn't have any problems.
---
Just put them on ignore.
---
Had a Gnome Mage about two levels above (it's always a gnome mage) off me just as I was about to solo the boss turtle at the Hinterlands beach, and teabag me. Rezzed, combed the beach, and found the same asshole attacking another druid. 
---
Popped a Free Action Potion, whooped his ass, teabagged him for good measure (which is something I never do unprovoked, but you're definitely getting a face full of furry tauren ass if you do), and ended up camping his body with the other Druid and chasing him halfway across the plains. Would recommend.
---
What I do is just take all the random crap and roll off any greens that are in the locked chest. If someone asks for something else that was in the chest I will trade but generally nobody cares.
---
As a MM hunter, what is the difference between agility and AP. I know 1 agil = 2 AP but
---
Loved the people on the forums crying for changes to their classes. If you want your class to be like every other class that's what retail is for.
---
There are 5 other names showing in the chat. I'm sure someone can figure it out with a few minutes or work.
---
You made me remember my favorite shadow priest video from vanilla. I had to look it up and it was actually on YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sn4Yl28DPFM
---
Put to Killswitch Engage's End of Heartache.
---
I use the castsequence macro. Works ok. There was another macro/thingy that would do it automatically, but it is considered botting. So... The only way is to use the castsequence macro :)
---
Drops??
---
Agreed. The #arresteddevelopment freaks have had their fun, 2004 has NOT actually rolled around again. Can we get a  working game now, please?
---
Spending hours in front of BRM gate ganking hordies.
---
There is a non stop flow of 5-10 man horde groups passing in and a full 40 man raid coming through every 5-10 minutes. 
---
Alliance trickle in but not many.
---
Bro, warriors wear plate. Period. If you want to roll for leather gear and play melee start a rogue. Simple.
---
By the logic of rolling on things because it "improves my character" with no regard to what the class wears, I may as well need everything so I can afford enchants and upgrades because I technically "need" it.
---
A warrior needed on my boots at the beginning of ZF once, by the final boss his Big Bad Pauldrons dropped. Oh, did I say "his"? I meant mine. It's great because it gave me enough gold to buy my "best in slot" gloves. 
---
For some reason he was still mad when I linked him my upgrade to justify me needing the plate shoulders? Weird.
---
There are only 2 crafted pieces you'll actually use, and the market is no doubt flooded with them. The only thing you'll get out of it is being gouged to buy the recipes.
---
Sure can, I only wear plate and have a comfortable home in northern Winterspring.
---
Can't same the same for you leather-wearing, BiS-caring Warriors.
---
If you can get jed trinket from ubrs or empherian power o e from mc they rule. As for pvp this gear lacks stamina so necrophil3 set from scholomance is good for loads of stamina and int plus resists
---
Can't wait to tear them a new asshole in PvP.
---
How much gold are we talking about?
---
Exactly... you think you have freedom but you're actually being funneled into the BiS list.
---
So glad I no longer live in Toronto. I had a job near Exhibition last summer, so I had to deal with Ex traffic each day.
---
Maybe that guy should be excited for your gear up instead of rolling for some crap he will replace in a couple of dungeons.
---
Damn yeah, that was at least 3 full raids.
---
Bring a druid! We stealth, kinda backstab,  and also can buff!
---
No, it isn't. Even if you get the MC bosses to 0 armor, which you do in most cases, Heroic Strike does not beat out Sunder + the white attack eaten by HS for threat. Tanks looking to maximize threat need to be filling every single global cooldown with Shield Slam &gt; Revenge &gt; Sunder armor in that order and sprinkling in HS when their rage allows, which won't be often yet because the incoming damage + white damage isn't high enough to rage cap.
---
I dont know? but propably during leveling you did? because its part of the toolkit of your class?
---
Happened to me a couple weeks ago north of Ironforge. Had to rez in the gy because my body was inaccessible.
---
Go back to retail. Vanilla being poorly implemented is the entire point. The only issue here is that the recreation of a poor implementation is in itself done poorly.
---
This is the result of shitty leadership tbh.
---
ok ok i get it :&gt;
---
\-meeting  
---
\-meating  
---
now is the question if meating is a real word .. 
---
not gonna edit it for the lulz but thanks ! :P
---
I'm not. I think it's just the various amounts of totems and things mostly.
---
yeah i know. didnt had luck in ubrs and i dont had luck in raids.
---
this is my 2nd gear also so bid on everything^^
---
so wahts the deal with this one? If anyone else hits him he just despawns?
---
I did nothing but mage pvp for 2 years of Vanilla, I'm not just making shit up.
---
Question for other level 58+ priests.  Have you guys bought max level Resurrection?  If not do you catch flak when raiding?
---
&gt;  I didn't really mind waiting abit for my loot. Well, last week we invited 2 new rogues from another guild who fell apart and I was told I would be on the bench for abit due to lack of raid gear ... 
---
Easily the best part of the thing. "sorry, we can't bring you to raids because you don't have enough raid gear" is the "you need experience to get a job to get experience" of gaming.
---
White mane.
---
On the lvl20 rogue tower quest I had an issue with another lvl28 rogue. He was claiming the boss dragging it over to bystanders and vanishing , we died twice before we understood what was he doing to us 
---
So vanishing is cool but it can also be used to troll
---
Those things have crap for heat dissipation. That's just the crappy way they build them to make em look nice and the fans suck to keep em quiet. That's just the way it is.
---
All the scarlet mobs in living can drop them so kill all humanoids
---
I want to unlocked Vulpera but I cant go back when I realized "why am I grinding just to unlock something?" When classic is already fun
---
Lulz
---
Shaman keybinds are some of the toughest but a few skills really have no need to be bound as they would never be used in the flow of combat.  You can just go into your spellbook if you need to use them- a little inconvenient but shaman DO run out of action bar space (even though you have like.. 50 spots!) 
---
A few examples:
---
Far sight
---
Astral Recall
---
Additionally, unless you are tanking you will never have much use for rockbiter once you get other weapon enchants.  Flametongue or windfury will always be a suitable choice in PVE depending on your gear or the monsters you're fighting. 
---
Macros are definitely possible as well.  But it should be very possible to get all your relevant combat abilities keybound using only common keys like 1-2-3-4-5, Q E R F T G Z X C and shift / control modifiers such that you never have to click any ability within the flow of combat.
---
Yes and you have to wait 10 minutes for him to spawn again and then circle around his patrol route to find him.
---
Pretty cool, but when seen like this, it makes you go “who the fuck would want to live there?” 
---
Even orcs used to live in green(er) pastures. 
---
When you see it in-game it’s much less desolate and cruel looking for a race of beings to call home.
---
I'm specced as Enhancement for leveling but I have an inclination to have all my spells available for when I need them. I guess I could just start ignoring them.
---
There just seem to be so many totems and things, for example I can't put resistance totems and things like that on my bar (which I don't think I really need at this stage anyway...)
---
It seems like I have more than 5 totems that I might want to use depending on the situation, but maybe I just need to ignore some of the less useful totems for now.
---
Found the BFA baby
---
Or there might still be more than one attempt despite everyone using one. What's your point?
---
ie.: Everyone pre-potting Fire Protection won't save an Onyxia attempt where the P2 -&gt; P3 transition didn't go well. Might as well use Limited Invulnerability Potions...
---
"Nobody was ever arguing a shaman could main tank a raid."
---
and I quote the person to whom i initially replied:
---
"It is extremely viable ergo possible at 60 dungeons and even raids."
---
So, yes, I argued against this person who said Shamans could tank raids, and you jumped in in defense of shamans, indicating to me that you think they should be tanking raids.
---
Now you're moving the goalposts and saying oh, I didn't mean **main** tanking a raid, of course! That's fine. Sure. Proves my point. Shamans aren't as good as warriors--there's no reason to use them to tank.
---
It just costs more mana then it's worth. I wouldn't say NEVER use it. In 5 mans for instance when you know the dungeon, there are certain bosses that just do a shit ton of damage, the fight isn't long and I always throw a max rank renew on the tank to assist in the burst damage. Also use a midrank renew on your warlocks in your group to assist with lifetap. No priest should be speccing into improved renew in a normal situation. Usually guilds in progression will have one priest specced into it and they're the tank renew priests. Outside of that don't just be throwing renew on a dps, it's more efficient to top them off with Heal Rank 2 and if you're in a raid someone else will just top them off and you'll just be overhealing and your mana will go to waste.
---
It's quite good if you're a human.
---
I never ran into that problem while I was leveling, but as soon as I got near 60 all the priests I vs'ed suddenly had big brains and it become a really tough matchup.  
---
They can fear ward your first fear, purge your vw sac, dispel your dots and bubble the curse, alleviating all your pressure, and then slowly outsustain you through their bubbles and mana drains. In this matchup Felhunter is absolutely KEY to purging their bubbles so you can apply your own pressure, along with downranking dots to not waste your own mana too much.  
---
Hunters I find are pretty rough as well and sometimes a vw sac + fear isn't enough because either the hunter itself or their pet can rip through your vw sac pretty easily. In those instances the fel dom becomes useful because you can either get a THIRD vw sac bubble, or a succubus. I often VW sac, fear the pet, fel dom summon a succubus, seduce the hunter and chunk them with sbolts.  
---
It's little things like these that make Fel Domination INCREDIBLY useful. You can deal with pressure a bit better, and alter the conditions of a battle into your favour without as much effort invested.
---
Even in PVE when shit hits the fan you can insta summon a vw, shield yourself to stay in the fight that little bit longer to either finish that boss, clean up the adds, or even offtank for your heals with hellfire/searingpain to stop him getting pushbacked
---
God bless you’ve been handed a shit deal. I mean I’ve given away 5-6 pieces of tank gear because we had to joint run with another guild. It’s not fun running MC MT raid leading while donating gear to shit players. If your on netherwind we would love a dedicated good raider.
---
Did you remember to wash your hands?
---
Agility also increases crit and dodge chance
---
I mean correctly geared furyprot tanks should still be wearing a high amount of armor. The thread difference is pretty huge, especially the initial threat ramp-up. When the fight lasts between 20-40 seconds you need to generate threat quickly.
---
The gauntlets, Striker's Mark, Onyxia Tooth Pendant, Accuria, Blackstone/Tarnished, Rune of the Guard Captain, orc racial, and I guess Tooth of Eranikus (slow 2.4 speed mainhand) make it possible to get +8 hit and 5 axe skill which should be capped.
---
I'm not saying anything good or bad about it, but it's physically possible.
---
LOL that's actually amazing. I would've 100% done the same
---
Skeletons
---
This is very helpful, thank you.
---
But not around community.
---
Maybe depends on the mob, but I've been doing this a lot while leveling my druid
---
Ring if you lucky get from mc the ring of spell power I belive was name
---
If youre on NA servers, come over to Bloodsail, our guild is looking to fill our ranks, and are currently working on building a solid raid team
---
how do you bind shift to a number? it just selects a new action bar.
---
Seeing the rogue's cooldowns seems scummy, and especially the addon that shows nearby players/stealthed rogues.
---
After seeing Snutz wreck in the dueling tournament without these though, I am confident I won't need them.
---
Few more items for my warrior and its time for the undead rogue!!!!
---
I'm responding to you saying that guy wasnt negative. Hi implied that op was lazy and looking for a carry and will be replaced later on. That is unwarranted and unnecessarily negative. I dont know why you would defend him. No one disagrees that feral isnt the best dps. But we do disagree when people say that they are a waste of a spot in raids. Cause raiding is so much more than just clearing content for gear. For the majority it's about playing with friends
---
This doesn't happen on horde side.  Our city's are too far to fly, so everyone just sets hearth to Kargath, then runs from Kargath to BRM.
---
Can’t hear you over all this money I’m making from selling plate to npcs lol
---
Wgaf
---
55 Holy Paladin here. Been grinding dungeons to get here, now grinding Blackrock Depths.
---
At what level do you recommend I try going into LBRS, UBRS, Scholomance and Stratholme?
---
I'll never do this, I feel like I'll lose every roll in MC in the future if I do this kind of shit.
---
In the other hand, accidently looting bodies after the wipe, yea I probably wouldn't say anything about getting two righteous orbs.
---
no, brokentooth is good for multiple things: spell pushback, frenzy upkeep/max profit, holding aggro better, dmg insurance etc. But that wasn't my question, the question is really simple 'what abilties do you teach him?'. Not really that hard if you have any reading skills.
---
Nice try :P
---
how did this get so many upvotes lol. ony neck isnt bis for mitigation wars.
---
Is not that you are good feral dps is that all your other guild members suck harder at playing that your class sucks at being reliable dps
---
Same way you bind shift to anything. Hold it down and press another button while setting a keybind.
---
WHY didnt i think of that!! but no seriously, it lasts only 15 seconds, no exactly gonna be much useful on 99% of bosses.
---
I like how once DKs released every class slowly started getting modified to a combo point system. Thats when I quit. Mana was dynamic combo points are brainless
---
What games meet these criteria?
---
This is so true.  Yet, I log in and want to do UBRS, BRD, etc for pre-raid BiS, and to do hydraxian stuff for aqual quintessence.
---
I'm on a treadmill, but it's *by choice*, and for some reason that makes a huge difference.
---
I do only leveling theu dungeon tanking
---
I personally do not take that talent for the concerns that you raised.  There are better things to spend points on.
---
That dont make much sense either
---
There's a trinket that has a similar effect as a chance to proc. I had it back in vanilla and would equip it when going to instances and ganking was likely. Had it proc a few times to rather surprised gankers whose brains would seemingly explode and would just stand there while I dotted them up and melted their face.
---
There's plenty of RPGs to play at your own speed, at least! I love WoW but when I feel like I didn't get enough out of it, I would then go back and see what video games I missed and pick one up for cheap on discount or sale. Looking to go through Witcher 3 if I have time, but Death Stranding next week and Cyberpunk 2077 next spring might take up more of my time...
---
if someone happens to see the chat "oh sorry let's roll for them"
---
If you play on Lucifron HORDE i would join you. Zug Zug!
---
Lol fuck that guy, he got what he deserved
---
I did catch flak. You might as well if you have the gold it costs the same Mana at any rank
---
My warlock macros are few and far between.  And get rid of cast sequence macros, those are trash, you should put your DoTs on targets that make the best use of your time/mana/resources, not in a specific order due to a single button.   
---
Here's my favorite warlock macros:  
---
1) Make a macro to put your pet on defensive and attack. Bind this macro to your mouse wheel.  Spinning your wheel forward changes your pet to defensive stance and sends it to attack your target.   
---
2)   Make a macro to put your pet on Follow and change its stance to Passive.  Bind this macro to your mouse wheel. Spinning your wheel backward, puts your minion in passive and recalls it your position.
---
I read on a comment here this was changed so you cant do what you are trying to do anymore. Could be wrong.
---
Doesn't work on bosses no, ultimately it's useless in raids.
---
That being said I still use it in my build because I still run dungeons fairly often, and the stun is very useful in there.
---
Alright Debbie Downer. I asked mid-run and they said the XP was solid bc we cleared it much faster. They got quests done and I gave them free portals to turn them in.
---
You would be amazed how many people buy things off AH that are sold by vendors
---
What is the math on that rule?  If say a corruption is adding something around 30 dps (ignoring the 1-4 nightfall procs at the talent's 4% rate) to the raid dps, how much raid dps is a hunter's mark adding for two hunters?
---
Very easy, track herbalism and you fill find only nodes, track mining and you will only find herbs. At least I only find herbs even tho im a minor.
---
I’m going glass cannon build, not getting threat reduction till like 57-58 lol I yoink mobs below 50% health with an 1100 mind blast. I usually hit fade right before or right after a mind blast so the tank can keep Aggro
---
I see a lot of people without cooking and that can cost you a lot of money buying food all the time, I save a lot of money with cooking.
---
I also make quite decent money with cooking and fishing, 2 professions that a lot of people overlook.
---
Also I've noticed a lot of people not looting grey items, which is weird unless your bags are full
---
What about AOE  threat ? its kinda worrying me, cause what i've seen so far, ppl enjoying pull  wast amount of mobs and its kinda frightening me, not to be able to do my tank job     (36 lvl  furry/arms  warr)
---
I was moments away from actually posting that...
---
You can even do better with big heal-&gt;instant heal like renew, holy shock, rejuv -&gt; drink.
---
“Hard” is subjective, as I don’t think managing energy to wait for ideal times to powershift is hard, but that differs from player to player. 
---
Also, you use tigers fury once when you open up and then never again.
---
Disenchanting is better for some items, worse for others. If you have an addon that shows vendor price, and maybe one that shows what the item DEs to (not really needed for blues, they're always a shard), it's an easy way to make money in dungeons.
---
The mods at /r/wow are absolute trash. "we decided on this (shitty) way of doing things based on feedback on /r/wowmeta (aka 1-2 people complaining about shit nobody cares about), to employ shitty rules that they planned to follow anyways.  
---
It is absurd looking at how many mods at reddit let modding go to their head
---
Hypocrite
---
There is nothing "correct" about your way. I will outheal you in every single molten core with 1.5 second casts if you only slow heal with 3 second casts. Enjoy people dying to double fire blossoms because you won't get a single heal between them.
---
There is no “tbf” here. You join a dungeon group, you complete a dungeon.
---
I didn’t mean that Horde should have to run from Arathi to do Gnomer. Just that there should be an equivalent to running to SM for horde. Some dungeon that they should have to experience what we experience with SM because it is awful. There are players that literally sit and prey upon the low levels running there and camp their corpses. And not just one or two, sometimes 5-10 people who aren’t doing SM but just ganking lowbies relentlessly.
---
100%.  Long as you don't sweat, and you just wash your butt every night, you can go at least a week without a shower.
---
I know, it has its uses, its just that the spell would be so good for druid tanks it makes it all the more frustrating why a BEAR cant initiate a dmg reduction ability like that.
---
Yeah at the end of the day it just boils down to the difference between an okay healer and a good one. Good priests know their spell book and know when something is necessary. Know when a dispell is necessary vs a waste of mana, know when burst damage is coming for a greater heal, constantly cast Heal rank 2-3 and cancel if unnecessary, and flash heal if you're afraid the tank might die in the next 2 seconds or if the fight won't be that long and you know you can get more HPS and not run out of mana before the boss dies.
---
Ive been duoing as a holy priest (myself) and a dps warrior. Grab the thornling seeds and save em for a second pack of imps, if they spawn. Dynamite's also your friend for imp packs.
---
Shaman should be able to almost entirely dps on hydrospawn, that saved a lot of time for us.
---
Half dps/half heals on the satyr sacrifice guy, barov peasent calller/battle chicken also speeds it up a lot.
---
On the last boss, the wall always crumbles at 50%. Myself, I toss out holy fire/ shadow word pain right before, then again after the imps are down. Prio is the boss, the imps do next to no damage. Again, grab the thornlings from the warpwood pods for it, and alternate which of you uses it (it has something like a 24 min cd).
---
I never once said that anyone has asked me to speed up. On the journey to 60 there was only ever one group that I left and I've never received any negative criticism for my tanking.
---
I honestly am unsure why you commented on my comment to be fair.
---
I agree with what you are saying, but I was replying to what OP said specifically. A lot of players come from BfA and don't realise that dungeons work a little different in regards to how many mobs you can pull in one go. Too many players are eager to pull more, when the dps is too low and the healer hasn't got enough mana. Not to mention the rage amount the tank has is very important in larger pulls.
---
Bliz recently made a change to pulling chained mobs, i.e.  a named quest mob and his escorts. While you used to be able to make the two escorts leash, they now stay with the named mob indefinitely.
---
Im not the kinda guy to initiate pvp, but I sure as hell will stop everything I am doing to make your life difficult if you're an asshat, and it's honestly a lot of fun because I feel like they 'deserve' it.
---
Looks much better than troll/tauren. Looks epic actually.
---
Damn super unfortunate. Ya sometimes I just can’t stand the ring nature but I digress. I did 20 runs last night and finally got my pants off angerforge. 
---
I did anger arena golem and the guzzler for the chance at the bag. 
---
Anger dropped 
---
Royal decorated armor 11 times
---
Battle axe 8 times 
---
Some sword one handed 1 time
---
Warstrife leggings 1 time
---
Arena gorosh spawned 2/20
---
Dropped gladiator helm
---
Dropped gladiator chest piece epic. 
---
Golem lord 
---
Luminary kilt 9 times
---
Omnicast boots 8 times 
---
Second wind 2 times
---
And I may have missed a drop off him as I only had 19 drops written down. However nagelsring has not dropped sadly. 
---
Guzzler portion 
---
Hurley 
---
Mostly dropped nothing. I was after the eyepatch but never did see it. Nothing to really write home about. 
---
Ripply goblin guy
---
2 16 slot bags 
---
Dark iron schematics basically every time. 
---
Nothing to really write home about
---
Plugger 15/20
---
Out of the 20 times last night I saw
---
5 barman shankers 
---
4 mixologists tunic
---
Phalanx 5/20
---
3 golem skull helms 
---
1 hand pc I forget the name but it’s like 29 strength 10 stam or something. 
---
I may be slightly off as some of the runs took place at 5am
---
The counter argument would be that rogues can also get herbs/mining/skinning. Their lockpicking is a reason to invite them into the group, a benefit for the group in group content and a benefit for the rogue in solo content
---
Yup. I played WoW for 12 years. My pile of games I want to play should keep me busy for some time. I do miss exploring Azeroth though.
---
Just buy all your spells once you are 60.  It's not that much gold and you want to have a full tool box.  
---
I used rank 1 resurrection until I was 60 though.  Who cares what pugs say and if your guild is so serious that they do something more than make a joke then you might be in the wrong guild.
---
Yes.
---
Lmao! Exactly brudda
---
Depending how much gold you have - do a /who 39 and give them each enough gold to get their mount.
---
a lot of y'all don't pve tank and it shows
---
I could never get that second global off before being put in combat.
---
that's definitely a system
---
Yeah halfway through reading the guy above you I thought "this is just exploiting a broke engine, there's no skill or clever mechanics here."
---
But dkp is just the exact same. Except people will 100% have more dkp than you on BiS. If youre new in a dkp guild, it could take months for you to get a good piece of loot. A good loot council would give you gear much sooner.
---
Thanks for the album; hope you had a nice vacation.
---
“I had cables, but the fucking Druid murdered me.”
---
Ah the ol’ Pornadin
---
It's called paraphrasing; making a question shorter than it needs to be but still understandable for anyone with the most basic engish skills. I.e. it has nothing to do with completely irrelevant topics like 'what are the benefits of brokentooth?', seeing as everyone else in this thread got it, it's definitely his problem.
---
Ironic, sorry you're on the spectrum.
---
Oh damn, I read the title as BRD and was thinking of the room where the adds constantly spawn. But yeah with the way this game scales, NO ONES SAFE when the mobs.. mob.
---
Frost is the superior *survivability* spec. For big boom, you go arcane fire. 
---
Sheep -&gt; AP -&gt; Pyro -&gt; PoM Pyro = GG
---
Yeah at the end of the day it just boils down to the difference between an okay healer and a good one. Good priests know their spell book and know when something is necessary. Know when a dispell is necessary vs a waste of mana, know when burst damage is coming for a greater heal, constantly cast Heal rank 2-3 (depending on your spell power) and cancel if unnecessary, and flash heal if you're afraid the tank might die in the next 2 seconds or if the fight won't be that long and you know you can get more HPS and not run out of mana before the boss dies.
---
a fucking shadow priest lmao
---
You definitely don't always need one... generally yes but not daily always
---
Classic double bounce
---
UBRS Rookery + Chicken?
---
Got 4 from 2 nodes before :)
---
1700 was my kc when it dropped.
---
My second macro is just boiler plate in party/raid chat - "Healer DO NOT heal me, I am Life Tapping to consolidate my mana.  I will bandage myself."  
---
Because i hate Life Tapping out of combat so that I can either bandage, use my warlock orb, or eat and all of a sudden the healers stop drinking, stand up and start tossing heals on me.  I am not one of those warlocks who LT out of combat and expect healers to top me off.
---
Basically the idea is that overhealing is bad and thats sort of it imo. I use multiple ranks of heals and then just use the appropriate sized one that will heal to max. In raids I just use differently sized Flash Heals until the end of the fight. Then when I am getting near oom I use slow heals to be more mana efficent.
---
Also, I don't even know the bis lists for each class, if gear drops for me that's an upgrade I'm usually going to roll on it, sometimes I'll passover if its a bigger upgrade for someone else, but generally I don't know or care what's bis
---
He doesn't want advice on how to farm gold. He wants someone to see his post and give him free gold.
---
I would not reroll just for undead racials.
---
If your guild just wants shadow weaving there's a build that is holy/shadow so you just go far enough to get shadow weaving and just keep that debuff on the boss but you are mostly healing.
---
Unless you have a few locks that are regular raiders though there isn't even a need for a shadow priest.
---
Loads of people did. On this podcast from 36:56 onwards: 
---
https://youtu.be/EK4c8mj569k
---
And in plenty of reddit threads. Just google reddit wow classic needs spell batching and set the date before June.
---
Also the announcement thread has 2k upvotes and the top comments are all celebrating the addition of spl batching.
---
Definitely fucked up. Then again if my wife played I might do the same shit lmao.
---
TIL  Tauren  have a little fishing animation. I'm jealous.
---
If you're using siphon life, you're generating healing threat on the other mobs each time it ticks.  I know it works at least sometimes because this is how I completed the badlands quests where you have to kill the wandering ogre guy that's in a group with 4 or 5 other ogres.
---
Aww, thx!
---
Ye dude, I am buying all the faps/mars for them in the ah, bought a few stacks for 40s
---
Aye, I posted some symbol of Kings by mistake when mass posting. They sold for 31s a piece.
---
"Just switch server" is lame if you've already invested time though. 
---
I don't really mind being outnumbered personally cos I'm a rogue though.
---
How are your other slots?  So much of warrior tank pre raid BIS is BOE.  I'd rather put those resources towards Lionheart or Cloudkeeper personally.
---
OP said he is on a high pop server. A tank on a high pop server shouldn’t ever have any issues making a group.
---
So, if you make the point that none of the aboves get invited to raids, then why are you arguing for the none of the aboves to get loot in a raid? 
---
People that make arguments for "others" on the internet are, generally, making arguments for themselves but using the anonymity of the internet as cover.
---
That's my main gripe with retail.  That and despite being a mage I can't cast frostbolt.    I'm a fire mage which means I don't know how to use those fancy frost or arcane spells, nope only fire.
---
A week is a little much m8. You May not smell yourself but everyone else does..but I was referring to the wet wash cloth to wipe your ass.. Just buy baby wipes and throw the away.
---
does a bear health poop in the woods?
---
I dont join groups that res stuff. People can do that if they want, but personally I won't join them
---
This is nothing compared to the ingame store in retail.
---
Wait so you mean my soon to be 60 rogue ass only has to spend \[does quick math\] 36 hours in the slave mines to afford my epic mount?  whooopeeee!  Just kidding my gear sucks id get smoked.
---
I feel like one of the signs you're in a good raiding guild is coordinated runs to the instance.
---
Paladin + Pornhub
---
Lol what a depressing outlook. I have tons of friends from WoW that I have played other ganes with after quitting WoW. Maybe they just didnt like you cause your kind of a shitty ass hole?
---
people don't understand this isnt retail. spriest doesn't do shit that he needs that trinket for. he's there to buff our warlocks lol
---
Leader of the Pack is trash IMO. You might as well just play a Fury Warrior if you want to flex from tank to DPS.
---
I'm running 30 Feral / 21 Resto and off-tanking in raids. When I'm not actively tanking, I heal, innervate, maintain Insect Swarm + Faerie Fire, and do anything else that might be needed.
---
i.e. After the first few weeks, we no longer get adds on Rag anymore. I tend to stay back and maintain Insect Swarm + Faerie Fire on the boss, Innervate healers when they need it, and throw spot heals. I'm always ready to charge in just in case our tank gets punted, but it happens so rarely that I end up not even tanking on this fight. (The first few weeks, my tanking was 100% necessary because we had Sons of Ragnaros spawn.)
---
Compared to our 2nd Prot Warrior - who does basically nothing on Rag - I think I add a lot of value.
---
Noggenfogger and Savory Deviate
---
As an Alliance player, I fucking am so sick of this from other Alliance and I see it ALL THE TIME. So much bitching. The stereotype is real. Nut up and git gud, don't be such baby. Both sides gank, get use to it.
---
Yeah, I'm downranking HT to rank 4 since it's way more mana efficient, I hadn't thought of downranking rejuv, so I'll do the math and look at options there.
---
I'm probably being more sensitive than I should be because it's a pug raid I've been in and I don't want to get booted just because my contributions are less clear.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
First it’s a paraphrase now it’s a metonymy?
---
How about neither, it’s just incorrect use of a verb.
---
Get deleted pleb mount
---
Except again you just make rules saying you cant use dkp on the fucking item. Currently my guild reserves ony head for melee and tanks because the ring is so op for them.
---
Not to discredit you Brabbleh, but that rogue was absolute trash. 
---
To start, the guy literally blew his two combo points from cheap shot on slice n dice. He then vanishes late when you net him (Note: whenever he kidney shots you if he wouldn't have used slice and dice he would have 4 CP or 5 CP KS). Finally, not saying that this is common at all, but if he equipped throwing knives when you had a sliver of HP he could have easily finished you. 
---
The guy could have done so much more. Popped adrenaline as soon as he cheap shotted, used tea to keep you stunlocked, or blinded you as part of his stunlock. 
---
I guess bad rogues are going to be bad rogues. Shame all those epics are wasted on him.
---
Rng.
---
P-orc cheek! delish
---
You only play a Spriest for pvp. It's garbage everywhere else. Can see why he'd quit if he was told getting gear to buff people. I don't think it even scales with SP so you'd literally never give him anything.
---
Don't get too hyped. IIRC a lot of the early videos circulating in relation to this were due to a "feature" of early Vanilla where negative resistances existed and would amplify spell-damage as a result.
---
I’m no expert but I don’t think name changes desist in classic you can delete the mage make a new warlock with that name. But  honestly is a name worth deleting 150+ hours of time investment. What about the warlock
---
if ya felt generous you could sub a rogue in for one of the warriors.
---
But yeah as shaman that would be my ideal group.
---
I don't think that's the case considering he's suggesting you farm an item that lasts 90 seconds and "always" use it
---
How relevant are the paladin buffs for a druid tank? my natural inclination is towards wanting to play tauren but I'm worried that it would never be as good as a night elf could be, having significantly less armor.
---
Not in classic, but back in Vanilla when my friends and I were leveling nelfs, we had no idea what the mechanic was.  We even discussed what we should do, and decided to just go ahead and click.  The tank clicked all the braziers and we had a great 'Oh lawd! Here they come!' moment.  Wiped once, ran back, and finished.
---
&gt; Spell batching is so stupid that I just want to stab myself. 
---
lmao, hear hear!
---
Close, but not quite. Crit cap isnt increased because your whites hit more. Crit cap is increased because hit can push dodge off the table

Definitely wouldn't say miles.
---
1% crit, 50 AP and 30 agi is technically better than 1% crit, 60 AP and 25 agi for a hunter.

If you are mad people are rolling on their bis items you should just reserve those things in your runs :)

A SMSG_MONSTER_MOVE gets sent in HandleForceSpeedChangeAckOpcodes which is what causes the bug.
---
Awesome advice, thank you!!!  I've been using consumables, but I could probably go further on that front.  And yeah, i feel like maybe I should dial back the early boss fight healing, focus on rejuv and a few downranked Healing Touch casts, then go for the bigger heals as the other healers slow it down.
---
Can anyone give me the rough cost to powerlevel tailoring 1-300?

Good luck chasing aquatic form druid, though. If he tries to levitate you can just moonfire and he's run out of feathers real quick.

I’ve had lay on hands go on CD and my target die anyway quite a number of times.

Plz get rid of it.
---
I healed as newly dinged 60 as shadow spec and shadow gear. Just had to drink alot during pulls
---
Modern? The UI looks like something out of a 00's single player ARPG, not '19 :p
---
It's both. Those aren't mutually exclusive.
---
Yes. Every time.

Thanks for bringing up memories from 2007(?)

[The internet is for porn!](https://youtu.be/F1hL_9jiWWY)
---
At 60 do all quests that would give experience give gold instead? So if a quest is green it'll give gold? With that in mind is it better to avoid all these quests (bar dungeon quests) so I can make a lot more gold later? Thanks
---
By the way you don't need a program to change your gold. Just type /script SILVER_PER_GOLD = .0001
---
Yea man loot councils never ever pick core raiders over new comers. Never happens once even though i just linked how the op wont give loot to new comers preferring to give it to the established core
---
Oh wait thats exactly what he wrote fool.
---
I'm in 80% pre-raid BIS, almost 400 +healing.  I've learned to downrank, although I probably need to broaden on that, as I was only downranking HT and only using one downrank (rank 4).  I definitely need to look at downranking rejuv.

Yeah since T1 is bound to drop in two weeks while the other hunters happily pass it to me since I was such a good pal passing it to a random. The warrior butthurt is strong.

---
You go slow/ fast dude. So you get lots of off hand hits per cancel.
---
Playstyle and itemization definitely changed. Top parsers are only using enough hit to not be crit capped and no more.
---
Maybe HS cancelling is too hard for you, but others are 100% taking advantage.
---
your saying it froze when there were 100 ppl in these same area and yet there would frequently be 300+ ppl in ironforge on nost and it wouldnt freeze, hundreds fighting over world bosses no freeze. not really sure why you remember it differently but i think you are wrong.
---
This is no longer possible because they removed negative resistances. Before with Curse of Shadow (reduce targets shadow/arcane resistance by X) would make it so the target had a chance of taking 25%, 50%, 75% or 100% extra damage. This meant a critical strike already doing 100% damage could do 200% damage + 20% extra damage from another shadow bolt crit.
---
Now, Curse of Shadow gives a flat 10% extra shadow damage.
---
The difference between mage and shaman is that the shaman uses their 30ish keybinds very frequently. Mage rotations tend to be simpler, even if they have more abilities.
---
Just makes keybinding a little bit more important since you need a lot of spells within comfortable/accessible reach.
---
Just get some add-ons. They're super easy to add and incredibly useful. Even for PVE there are some that drastically improve the game.
---
Or you could go to an RP server. Do they still have those lol
---
Fellow Rogues, what have you been doing for gold? My GM recently had me switch from Ass/Sub to Combat, so I can't stand Pickpocket runs anymore. I've been picking herbs in WPL, but that's only netting about 20g/hour.
---
So excited but cautiously optimistic for this year.
---
Please. These are not priests pre-casting down-ranked heals for maximum mana efficiency.
---
95% of priests sit there afk and heal as necessary, or waste mana on shields and un-talented renews and flash heals while throwing mind blasts.
---
My favourite part is that things are slower. Combat is slower. Everything is just more relaxed. There isn't massive focus on movement skills and other bullshit like that. Seriously... Since cataclysm I have actually disliked raids a lot, I still did them because they were fun to do with a guild. But there was so much focus on moving to places, or moving to deal with debuffs. Like in Antorus, I absolutely hated the Coven. I was a shadow priest, getting insanity rolling before I had to move to not die was so hard. I absolutely hated it. It wasn't fun.
---
Not now with everyone justifying their ninjaing because the just jerk it too addons and damage counters. 
---
Warrior &amp; Paladins = Plate 
---
Rogues &amp; Druids = Leather
---
It's not difficult to understand. If you want to do damage and wear leather start a different class you jabroni. 
---
In any case, I can't stop you from ninjaing my leather, and I'll always return the favor because we all need upgrades, pal.
---
Look at this recent [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/doucwp/how_to_prot_paladin_aoe_dungeon_leveling_series/) from u/BoochieSmash. 
---
Lots of nice videos on how to AoE farm dungeons.
---
The rogue not using his ranged attack against a 1 HP druid however, was really bad.
---
There is....its called dkp aka getting currency to spend on items based on the boss kills youve contributed.......lol are you serious?
---
I need to get better at precasting and predicting damage...that's probably half my battle.
---
I'm in a guild, but they're about 2 weeks away from raiding, so I'm getting experience now while they're gearing up.  I love my guild, so I don't want to jump, just getting ahead of them on content. :)

If you're not gonna do Devilsaur I think you might as well swap it out, yeah.
---
Google " crit cap vanilla " right now.
---
Less spell power, more stamina/intellect. At this point a mage battle is more about surviving burst than trying to one shot someone.
---
Also playing on Stalaag, after the two alliance guilds transferred, it left the alliance side just decimated. Just did 30-42 through STV. Encountered one alliance
---
My money is on us getting a phase 2 date. Not much else, maybe some tidbits of info, but no announcements otherwise. Don't think we'll get the 'what's next' until next year.
---
Even if its a throwing a bone to expand on Phasing Schedule I’d be pleased.
---
You can probably do DM West.
---
This is not the same bug. In this video the target paths correctly on the boat at first, but then falls off. This is not what is happening in the other video - the target flies away immediately in a random direction, because the client does not take the transport into account when handling that wrongly used movement packet.
---
Asked this too late yesterday and only got one response, so asking again for good measure and more opinions.
---
How important is it to get Embrace of the Lycan as a 48 feral druid? The long dungeon, 10% chance, and pain in the ass trying to find a team without competition for Leather got me shook, and I'd rather grind exp through quests than dungeons. Should I go through with the grind and try to get it, or is there any other better headgear in the future I should look forward to that would be easier/comparable to get? Should I just buy a Wolfshead and be done with it?

There is still a point you replave lionheart.
---
I'm not sure. I never checked my /played. But I'm sure following some leveling guides with optimal questing schedules would be faster.
---
I just personally don't like solo questing on a warrior so I just tanked dungeons instead.
---
Our buisness failed so naturally we had to pay our ceo a small sum of 10,000 gold while we lay off all employees with no severance package.

Oof. I just insta-release to get back asap and try again. I never rage over games.

---
Self-importance? I don't detect any of that in his post. Someone asked him to expand upon his guild's vetting system and he elaborated in detail. You expressing negativity towards his post that was made in good faith to a request implies to me that the self-important one is in fact you and not him.
---
At the end something hits him for 790 - was that freaking shadowburn? Didn't know it could hit that hard.
---
Use the highest level weapon enhance you have at the moment unless there's resistences involved. For leveling I disliked WF because bad luck on a tough mob could get you killed while rock/flame enhance would reliably leave me with X% hp after a fight.
---
I'm sorry sir, you must not have read anything posted here at all. This is an instance with NO AOE. If we're agree to single/ double targets and if I only pull 2 and mark 2 what more can I do lmao.  When I pull 3 I mark 3 and threat on 3 I'm not sure what you are talking about.And for the comment about the mage aoe , if someone wants to aoe then yea I'll grab more targets and keep threat on all of them obviously lmao
---
"You can cat dps if you are willing to try hard like shedo.." this post is also pointless and gatekeeping. You can cat dps however you want as along as your guild is happy to have you there. 
---
OP is clearly in a friendly guild that would be happy to have people show up. You say I'm making assumptions but really I'm just reading context and understanding the situation op is in. 
---
OP states that they are happy with there guild and position in the raid. Know that they do sub optimal dps and is happy to bring other things to the table. People in the thread say that op isnt doing enough and has to do more to be optimal. Then the person I replied to insulted op by claiming they were selfish for not wanting to mindlessly farm MCP. Stop defending assholes and I wont downvote you
---
They’d have to add literally nothing, because there’d be people opposed to every idea.
---
so i'm a rank 1 vanilla player and rank 1 arena player in retail and im kinda struggling in the same way as you are.  My guilds def a pve guild but they seem to have some interest.  I'm slowly working on changing the culture
---
\- I've already convinced the GM of the guild to all meet at thorium point pre raid and travel as a group and wipe any horde on the way (unless way out of the way).  We all get there faster and its a team builder.  we also kill any horde that land in TP for about 15 mins pre raid while eveyrone groups up.  The first week no one wanted to kill anything. 
---
\- we spam /moo at the horde we kill to hopefully create a guild brand 
---
\- Convinced a few palas/warlocks to take "non bis gear" as offspec loot so they have gear with stamina come p2
---
It feels like an uphill battle and I'm sure ill do bg's with other hardcore pvpers but it feels good to slowly turn some pve nerds closer to the middle of the pve/pvp spectrum
---
god damn man
---
Could always drop Agi for Druid tank.
---
When tanking I find that rogues can ocationally be super annoying, worse than insta charging warriors imo. They share the similar tendency to attack too soon but they have a few other things that can make them even harder to play with, here are my pet peeves:
---
* Cheap Shot first mob that reaches me which is especially bad if I pulled back. This stops me from getting the rage needed for initial threat and can snowball into the pack being impossible to tank. 
---
* instantly popping bladeflurry + adrenaline. This combo does insane amounts of damage on 2 targets and since rogues hade frontloaded damage using it instantly makes those two targets impossible to take aggro from. Popping these just a few seconds later would give make all the difference. 
---
* not ever using aggro reducing abilities. Since they don't get instantly deleted when taking aggro like cloth wearers do they seem to think it's ok for them to tank mobs without their cooldowns but they only live because healer burned lots of mana to keep them alive.
---
As a final note I just want to say I love a good rogue. They manage their own threat and have a fantastic toolbox for controlling an out of control fight.
---
A raid of only cat Druids for  who don’t use pummelers (except a hunter for tranq) would do plenty of DPS to clear MC easily. It’s. Not a carry at this level. If we’re talking Naxx, sure, but he’s not getting carried in MC.
---
I think if you NEED on a boe item it should become bop when you get it.
---
So your stealing more plate than just the shoulders?
---
&gt; OP states that they are happy with there guild and position in the raid. Know that they do sub optimal dps and is happy to bring other things to the table. 
---
Great! Conversation over!

WoW is a lot easier to deal with when you remember there's a good chance anyone you run into has a good chance of being a 12-year-old with zero social skills.

Lol, yoinks are fair play. Clean steal.
---
Don’t be upset when it comes back around!
---
Ditto with being a shadow priest and not being able to pop GHeal even if it ooms me. Just give me a damn choice!
---
I'm not 100% sure but I believe Whispered Secrets is slightly better, so if you already have Whispered Secrets it might not be worth trying to farm Ban'thok.
---
Yeah I’ve used that add on . 
---
Can’t remember the name - was very unintuitive with setting keybinds/action bars
---
Maybe you should find people to play with you do enjoy. Or maybe you should play a game that doesnt require interacting with 39 other people to be successful.
---
oh so anecdotal evidence, gotcha.
---
&gt;that's going to get replaced right away
---
\*300 runs later the BiS item drops\*
---
Shoulda killed the lvl 16 and booked it!
---
I did it in vanilla and enjoyed the crap out of both classes.  Also had a 60 warrior and a shaman.  Did not enjoy the warrior as much as the others.  Priest and Lock were my faves.
---
Look into cast sequencing with macros as well.  It doesn't cast all your spells but if you have a set of 4 totems you always use, it will cycle through them as you press it repeatedly or reset after a fixed period.
---
&gt;Get at least 10 slot bags ASAP, level, loot everything, never ignore a dot on your map, even if it’s gray, never discard anything, and always sell on the AH.
---
This is what I've been doing and I'm surprised by how much gold I've managed to save up. Had around 30g by the time I hit level 30.
---
GRIZZLY literally camped the mountain for 3 hours last night preventing a single horde raid from happening.
---
As a Paladin, I want spell batching because it lets me exploit Reckoning and Seal twisting, and as a Priest I want spell batching because it lets me exploit Martyrdom + Blessed Recovery. I'm also looking forward to levelling an Elemental Shaman because I can exploit Eye of the Storm through spell batching. I'll also be able to exploit Elemental Mastery to get a free crit on 2 spells instead of just one without spell batching, just like how Priests get 2 free spells with Inner Focus and Paladins get 2 free crits with Divine Favor.
---
'I'd take double ice block over pom pyro any day against a warlock.
---
The thing is most people hit 60 and get a few PvE epics and then go “I won the game!” But also say they wanna PvP.  There is plenty of time to actually get good at your character where good =/= spamming two buttons in PvE.  Go find some world match ups and keep adjusting your play.  
---
It’s not lucrative unless you’re gathering or grinding during it, but if you just pick popular farm spots that’s fixed and surely the opposite faction is there.

If only he knew......what?  Mists is remembered for it's excellent gameplay and class design and most people look at is as a huge improvement over Cata nowadays.  Further, Legion was seen by many as one of if not the best expansion ever excluding nostalgia points.  BfA is trash, we all know it, but so is your meme.
---
people really have no idea how to play this game if they are shitting on dagger tanks which is by far the best mt build.

I love warlocks they're fun in pve and pvp. Play whatever you will find fun!

spirit gear is surprisingly good while leveling

---
You didn't even read my post and just copy pasted your yah, but my guild is different message defending them.
---
I specifically pointed out my issue with loot council isn't with leadership being unfair.  It's the fact that when someone gets upset about not getting loot they have a person to blame.  And if you think that person won't get blamed you're an idiot.
---
Claw is a focus dump so you don't generally run it auto cast - you would manually cast as you've been doing, or create a macro that binds it to an ability you would cast if you don't want to think about when to use it
---
I haven't really checked... still 1 or 2 pieces I would like to exchange and the mainhand is not what it looks like :( Having MC raid on Friday, will have a closer look there :)
---
Sir, this is harassment
---
How does batching affect it though? I might be missing something here.
---
Buy some green weapons early on every 5 levels or so. Increases leveling by a lot! While your predicament might be true for dungeons it's the opposite for raids, where healers are much more in demand. Don't expect to be able to tank in raids is all I'm saying.
---
&gt; human paladin/warrior only Stormwind guard RP guild 
---
Wouldn’t that be the only reason he needs?
---
You're welcome :)
---
Do you also ninja plate from tanks as well? Or just plate from DPS warriors? And do you really think ninjaing loot you literally can not use is the same as a warrior needing on something they ACTUALLY NEED and will use? If that is the case, I am sorry for you.
---
&gt; Maybe you shouldn't play horde/"bad guys"
---
&gt; I never said anything about can't play faction
---
You get to choose one.
---
I just kinda feel like its redundant and similar, but your comment gives me a little more motivation. I was going to go hunter but literally every other person in my guild has a hunter alt and I don't want to be 1 of a million hunters in the guild.
---
Your hatred makes you strong
---
*resist* ‘oh I guess I’m fucked’
---
Sulfuras is an East coast server with good population and great wpvp. Also single layer
---
Why is it that everyone assumes every mage has their 10 minute cooldown available at all times?
---
I feel where you’re coming from. It was a lot like that in the early levels. But now as max and even on my Alts, making groups by spamming 3 different chats for literally an hour to finally get a tank isn’t much of a conversation. Then you find out he’s hot garbage but I keep it to myself and help as best I can by playing better(I.e, bursting casters he can’t handle well, chain cc’ing mobs, kiting and pulling things off healers) I’m not entirely sure if the magic of it has just worn off, but I do thoroughly enjoy myself when I do get good players and usually have fun messing around with them and helping each other out(these moments just tend to be a lot more rare)
---
You're incorrect. T1 is bis because of the 8 piece. 15% multi DMG is huge.
---
People ask me why I spam level 1 consecration everywhere I go... this is why
---
That happened to me the other day flying over searing gourge...just mid flight the gryphon stopped, and just kicked me off, i survived the fall to realize I was in a place in the mountains that was not normally accessible, I had to slide down so I didnt die in a place that I could not get back to...ended up dying due to fall damage and ?? skull mobs and had to spirit res..
---
Was pretty shitty deal
---
I love this, people get so defensive.
---
Lol.. And what if they have more than 2k hp?
---
I remembered all the candles needed to be clicked but forgot they spawned waves.  So I hit two or three before the first wave spawned....
---
They do seem fun, but I don't want to play it if its too similar to shadow, feel like it might be kinda redundant.
---
you should look at warcraft logs and look at cpm for different abilities before you say things that are incorrect
---
What realm you thinkin?
---
Yeah I heard that! One guy claimed he had enough spirit to be comparable to eating once he was out of combat. 
---
I'm gonna bug my LW friends to make me some agi spirit gear

'lock is a ton of fun regardless of what else you play. I definitely recommend at least trying it up to level 20 or so.

I'd love to see this, there's really no way lol

I stopped playing retail at the end of wrath... Are you telling me if you spec into one tree, you're locked out of base abilities of other trees?

You can see all the world epics and their level brackets. Scroll down to the 40-49 section and you should have a chance on any of those. A *very* low chance mind you.

IMO the optimal play is to start doing BRD as early as possible farming BiS gear. You're going to be in there anyway so why not farm gear and EXP at the same time? Ignore EPL, Burning Steppes, and Winterspring except for Keys and Attunements. Then you'll have a gold pinata waiting for you at 60 to take a chunk out of your epic mount or whatever BoE BiS you need.

I think engineering is great, however I won’t be going engineering for a few months. I’m currently a level 52 warrior with mining and skinning. Been sending all my ore over to alts to hold on to and been skinning for passive income. It’s worked out amazingly. I’ll go engineering after I’m able to get epic mount, and some good cash in my pocket, and when battlegrounds drop.
---
Yeh I guess I never learned deep breath mechanics in classic I played a pally and was bad I’ll need to go do some more research.
---
*Asmond was hit with confusion*
---
I dont agree. Most people I've grouped with have been great. I think it depends what kind of group you look for. I've mostly done dungeons for quests while leveling, and a few arena spam. Havent had anyone that was a problem.
---
Maybe this is because I usually check my guild first when forming groups.
---
Reserving loot and min maxing to the extreme. Saving onyxia buffs and DM buffs to further min/max to clear content that isn’t even challenging. This is the experience at 60. A pale reflection of what it was in 2004.
---
Because as your heal goes off, your target is died already. I thought your argument was that the target died because something went horribly wrong. And that example was to show you something may not need to be horribly wrong for the spell batch mechanic to hurt gameplay.
---
I was mocking you. I think you might be the one in need of common sense.
---
I have people come stack back on me to stand in consecration, that helps a whole lot!
---
also BoP the one with most aggro
---
Wolfshead Helm (40) is gonna be your best option, period, in Classic.  
---
BoE crafted helm, shouldn't be too expensive.  
---
You take advantage of "power-shifting" once you have that.
---
go back to retail if you dont like it (:
---
Yeah it's a really good niche small scale/1v1 ele shaman mace. I spent the weekend grinding 1k to buy it, put spell power on it and then won the roll on an Aurastone Hammer on Tuesday! I'm still keeping it in my bags for certain situations, but most of the time ill use Aurastone for more spell damage.
---
During my limited time using it, the proc did save me in some duels. Extra damage from an instant lightning bolt or burst healing from instant healing wave. Plus fast weapon speed to pushback casters. I'm not that salty about spending so much on it, just more motivation to grind my gold up before phase 2.
---
Damn dude you are taking this quite personally I was just trying to have a conversation.
---
&gt;OP didnt ask how they could stay optimal for end game content in a hardcore guild. So telling them that if they dont farm MCP they will get removed from the raid is pointless and negative.
---
The guy you're mad at isn't even responding to OP! I just tried to explain this. He was responding to somebody else talking about druids in raids in more or less abstract. The person you got mad at was using OP as an example for that response. This is why I "rambled" about different raid expectations. I was trying to illustrate the difference between the expectations you call negative and OPs actual raid situation.
---
And maybe that guy is an elitist and gatekeeps, but I didn't see him call anybody an asshole, that was you. You're upset at somebody trying to justify bad behavior and you turn around and do the same thing, that seems hypocritical.
---
I mean, if you're flash heal sniping you shouldn't be overhealing that much anyway. You're just getting in before the people who are actually using proper spells for efficiency can land their heals so they cancel and do less healing. In this content it barely matters anyway, but when I see people having died from healers being oom on trash and shit, then the flash heal sniping becomes a problem.
---
Better yet put them on your friends list.
---
Having stupid people that want to over pay for things as friends is a good thing.
---
I don't stink if that is your insinuation.  I don't smell like a bottle of flowers, but i don't smell like B/O either.
---
Lol yes I’m at work and stole it from my guild discord
---
The dude who mentioned the macros is exactly right. I'm a shaman and just starting to use macros and its cutting the available spots on my action bars in half. Here is a few I saved space with. You can find them on icy veins macros for shaman. Fyi I spent days spamming my abilities in the chat windows trying to figure out why they were doing this was an F'n nightmare. Its cause I read them on mobile sight where it compressed the sentences and dropped them down a line. I copied line for line which messed them all up lol. My guild thought I went off the deep end cause I was saying "Frost Shock" in guild chat 50 times.

Is there truly plate alternatives to some of the leather BiS for warriors? Or are you just mad that someone needs on something they need instead of going with a worse alternative that you can not use?

oooh, you don't run a Totem addon :X
---
I used this one in Retail: https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/flo-totem-bar
---
It looks like it's been ported to Classic. Go to the Files tab and grab the latest one for v1.13.xxx
---
For healing spells, I'd get something like Vuhdo and use that frame to handle healing and group buffs (ie Water Walking).
---
I remember MoP it was so badass bursting down noobs with my lock i really enjoyed it
---
Thanks, I will try it out!
---
I'm not bawling in the hotel lobby, definitely not.
---
Ah, was thinking about PVE scenarios.
---
Yeah it would probably show up more in BGs, but until then wpvp is too chaotic for it to matter as much.

Didn't realize all the 60 warlocks I fought had less than 2k, good point.

Sons of Arathor went 10/10 MC last week.

I am playing with people I enjoy. And I played this game in Vanilla. No reason I should stop because some stupid zoomer thinks everyone needs to sit in discord and listen to his inane jabber.
---
I would also like to say thank you to Bankertwo on Pagle-Alliance who listed Black Lotus for 33s instead of 33g.
---
You are fighting so hard to shine a turd.
---
Seriously? I havent had a single problem group. I've even added a bunch of people after runs.
---
Actually there was the 1 time I ran Mara and the hunter was so high he couldnt function and almost killed the run. That sucked.
---
Yeash. Never had that many on my lvl 52 Shaman on Nost. :S
---
It might not be anything more than a graphical bug. I noticed this alot on my hunter, he just stands there with bow drawn, but if you look at the dmg number, he is still shooting and doing auto attack damage. Check yourself next time, if its just a graphical bug or if you're actually not doing any damage.
---
You joke, but actually outranging the Shadow Priest, healing up, then going back in to fight them again is actually the best way to beat Shadow Priests.
---
You just have to treat their mana bar as their health bar. Run them out of mana, then you can stay in for the kill.
---
I haven't done any yet but stealth tribute runs with a druid and/or another druid/rogue can be very profitable.
---
So hit only affects the few main hand swings where you actually cancel your heroic strike, and you think its the fury warrior's best stat? So like 1/3 of your damage is white hits, and maybe 1/3 of those are cancelled main hand swings. But you think hit is the best stat. Unreal.
---
Crit and AP affect ALL YOUR swings and yellow hits. Like the value of 1 crit is WAY, WAY greater than the value of 1 hit past yellow cap. You have to be very bad at math to think otherwise. 
---
Lets look at the top parsers on warcraft logs, surely they must be stacking hit then right? O look, they only use enough hit to not be crit capped, and stack crit and AP. Man, they must be stupid, you sure know better than them.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/qXF9axVpm1t3NPk6#fight=7&amp;type=summary&amp;source=12
---
Top DPS warrior, 7% hit. The extra hit is to push up his crit cap. Hes not wearing battleborn armbraces which he could easily get, because hit is trash. Hes favoring blastershot launcher over striker's mark or satyr's bow, because hit is trash. You are so dam wrong dude. Accept it.
---
Yup, all great reasons!
---
They dont have any benefit for hunters ):
---
Bad troll is bad
---
What the other guys have said! Just the fact that there is another player controlling the enemy character makes for a huge difference, everything is about your ability to adapt to different classes and to make decisions on the fly before you're, say, stunned or feared or frozen or utterly slaughtered. you need to be on your toes the entire time, it's actually quite difficult.
---
Wow this is the first time this has ever happened
---
Go arms for leveling. To keep your leveling feeling smooth and linear, you need to have a weapon progression plan &amp; always keep your first aid up to date and have ample bandages. Are you horde or alliance?
---
In vanilla we had a hunter who failed so many times she had to have one of our other hunters log onto her account and complete it for her.
---
People complain that it “killed world pvp” when the main negative impact it affected in wpvp was the prevention of camping some poor motherfucker mercilessly.  People still dive bombed out of the sky plenty to attack others and such.
---
They mention that it hurt reprisals or getting to battles, because they’d be over and people dispersed too fast. But they fail to mention that in vanilla, unless a battle went on for a *really* long time, you often could not get there in time due to how slow travel was. NG battle in EPL? Have fun with the 5minute flight then riding there. And that’s if you were in UC or were quickly ported. If you were in Org and had to take the zep, there was absolutely no way you could get there in time. The world defense channel was fairly worthless due to this.
---
3-4 alliance guilds moved to heartseeker. I left but unconnected to them
---
Look. We get it, you are a vanilla fan boy. Let others enjoy what they want. MoP was a great expansion
---
I just run with crusader but honestly if you’re going specifically for this run I could see fiery being useful
---

---
Oh, nice. I somewhat recall losing Shield Wall when I 'stance danced' into another stance. - But I didn't start one until mid-TBC.
---
Real Mob Health collects &amp; displays estimated target health, and interface options for % max health.
---
Oh I have. Nearly every time as well.
---
Okay except in classic almost all plate gear is for tanking, not DPS. An all plate DPS warrior won't do nearly as well as one in leather. (Side note, warrior does more DPS than a rogue so that's probably why you're seeing lots of warriors).
---
Or should warriors ignore two of their specs and just be prot?
---
If you want leather drops that badly, start a group and say they're reserved. There's no shame in that, most people do it and still find groups.
---
Also needing on gear you can't use at all just to sell it is a dick move if it's a BoP. BoEs are a different story because you can't trust PuGs to all greed them and such.
---
Having limited free time us not an excuse to be a dick. If it's that much of a problem, join a guild or make friends with people who don't need the same gear as you or are happy to just tank and only get tank gear. There are solutions here that don't involve being a ninja.
---
Might solve horde side tank shortage:)
---
He was talking about op and implied really negative things. In response to a comment that also wasnt really necessary. It was all bad. And you defending it was bad.
---
You can tell this is alliance because they finished the whole Onyxia attunement in 4.5 hours (and also because of the flair) on top of doing other stuff. Meanwhile I still need to run UBRS for the third time and then go find Rexxar again.

Quiz: What is your mother's maiden name?
---
I've leveled tailoring to 250, enchant to 225 at lvl 50 and I'm reluctant to drop either.
---
My hats off, that takes some dedication.
---
I thought slam was useless
---
Why create excess waste?  What is wrong with wash cloths?  You just toss it in the dirty laundry and wash it.  Also i don't like the smell of wet wipes.  
---
I have asked people that are around me.  They said they don't smell anything.  I have found that the majority of smells are from hair, so i shave my pits, and the problem just goes away.
---
This is such a cute idea. I love it. :D
---
OH HOW QUICKLY THE TIDES HAVE TURNED
---
Is this why occasionally when I gouge and immediately move behind the target to backstab, they also turn around before getting incapacitated?
---
Just upload the actual picture lol
---
As an spriest, I've talked to my loot council a ton about my gearing needs so they understand where I am at and my expectations regarding items. Mana igniting cord and I was asked how good it was for me, gave the big nope don't even think about giving that to me even if it's an upgrade its better served to someone else. That on use trinket is super nice and I can't wait to get it. 
---
  If you're a shadow priest you need to understand you aren't thought about for loot in most cases, but if you help your guild, farm elemental fire, essences, help guildies get prebis your guild is likely to think about you for pieces. Especially in MC with the fights as quick as they are you can be a top 10 dps in every single fight. BWL and beyond will be a bit different.
---
You can make good gold while leveling by crafting and vendoring things, but that's about it.  
---
I had my mount at 40 and devilsaur set at 55 with plenty of gold to spare. But it's getting dropped for herb/alch soon.
---
Not currently, low level zones are pretty populated right now due to people doing alts and now that layering is gone it's a lot of competition for mobs etc. So no, not really.
---
r/oddlyspecific
---
Also, the tigers in STV have 1.2 AS as well. No reason to go for bangladesh, really.
---
Bummer, but fair enough. Thoughts on replacement professions?
---
Most of the alliance guilds still on Stallag are private server guild who coordinate very well.
---
They also have a horde guild here and monopolize devilsaur and the elite dragons in winter spring. 
---
Teaming with them to farm and kill off other horde/alliance. Have pm’s and mad screenshots from it lo
---
Crazy elitist
---
lmao dude stay woke
---
Oh gotcha.   I was going to say it seems only more extreme when you break it down to 3 procs per hour.
---
My team is like 10 days behind our deadline every month since I joined in June, we get told off if we spend too much time on our phones or web browsing.
---
Lmaooo try combat and wait out timers - I was able to be pve spec and kill pyro with daggers a few weeks before attempting this...just requires patience when u hit vanish once as no more prep. Gl!
---
Consumables will not be needed for anything other than parsing.
---
Yeah, cat farming pummelers seems miserable. On my bear I can do it casually in between leveling an alt, you'll only need around 3 per raid most of the time, which is accomplished consistently in 2 lockouts, around 40 minutes of grind (Where you are logged into your alt for the other 80 minutes of the lockout)
---
You can easily heal LBRS at 55, ubrs/strat/scholo/all of DM at 58 no problem, just bring some big juicy mana pots/dark runes in case SHTF
---
What? Someone thinks a Shaman can tank?
---
Set it to 800x600, lower your graphics to the minimum and cap your fps at 20 for the TRUE classic experience. NO CHANGES
---
oh no a retail baby is upset
---
&gt; Easily the best part of the thing. "sorry, we can't bring you to raids because you don't have enough raid gear" is the "you need experience to get a job to get experience" of gaming.
---
This is so spot on.
---
On average it will drop. If every sticks to the rule "dont roll on upgraded for you that are bis for others" everyone would be much happier. 
---
I hope you play a mage and a healer steals your Banthok Sash.
---
I came to hear the lamentations of the Druids.
---
Happened to me last night with Angerforge's second mob.
---
Odd thing as I've vanished there before no problem.  Aggro is funny like that sometimes.
---
I hadn’t actually given fairie fire much thought this actually is going to be very useful.
---
Black Dragonscale is actually BiS for warriors as soon as they get some hit gear from raid such as onslaught girdle and onyxia neck :).  
---
You wasted money on Devilsaur :).
---
Wonderful, just wonderful
---
Grab the helm if you can. WOW is very subjective experience, and everyone has different priorities in regards to what is important. Wolfshead is amazing though since it generates free energy and rage.
---
And warriors
---
No flight path is sufficently long enough for a fapping champion such as the average Classic player.
---
Well, I'd argue that 'cleave' setups are terrible for static groups due to the loot issues. If you go with a conventional balanced group, you'll gear up much faster.
---
Currently yes. I play in NA, so I don't typically see non-english.
---
I could add support for some other languages, probably
---
Think of it like this: Raid wipes and you're SSed. You res another priest and with max rank rez, they have enough to rez someone else. Rank 1 rez, they don't. You'd prob catch flak the first time it happened , then you'd just never get SSed again.
---
Go Herb/Alchemy.
---
I've found it to be invaluable. You get to make use of your profession from start to finish and it's very easy to keep your alchemy in line with your level (I hit 275 Alch at level 46).
---
Generally what i'll do is stockpile herbs over a week's worth of play and then make a load of potions/elixirs in one batch.
---
It's easy to have a decent stock of Healing Potions at all times, which have saved me from dying countless times. I don't use Elixir's as liberally, but they're really helpful when tanking dungeons and you need the extra edge.
---
Behind the Top Elixirs like [Elixir of the Mongoose](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=17571/elixir-of-the-mongoose) you'll find a lower tier of Elixir's like [Elixir of Greater Agility](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=11467/elixir-of-greater-agility) which are really good value and the materials are very easy to come by whilst you level.
---
If you're really short of money for your mount like I was, Alterac Mountains becomes a great farming spot as you can pick up [Wintersbite](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=2044/wintersbite) whilst you kill ogres.
---
Waiting at instance for group to get there + walking dog, making dinner, eat dinner, do dishes, do landry, get coffee.

Try being a nurse m8, you have 16 hours of work in an 8 hour shift

Our IT system has &gt;99.9% uptime and issues are usually resolved within 5 mins of coming up. We have nothing to do except be on hand most of every day.

When IT is working, you don't exist.
---
I know how terrible of me to try to ward of unnecessary negativity in what was ultimately a light hearted post about someone that was having fun with their feral dps. I'm so awful for bot just letting you guys be negative, my bad
---
I didn't know I knew that, please don't lecture me.
---
Lol I just gave you a viable alternative and you say "no" because its not bEsT iN sLoT. Ty for proving my point further
---
Community concept is usa just societal construct usa society is build upon; most ppl dont give a shit about ppl in virtual world
---
It should be, shape shifting gets you out of so much trouble
---
That’s why having a switch is awesome, I post up outside of whatever I want to run dungeon wise, and macro tank lf xx instance
---
Most higher end guilds will farm Gazhranka from ZG for;  [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19947/nat-pagles-broken-reel](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19947/nat-pagles-broken-reel) to counter Taunt resists for fights where Tanks "HAVE" to be able to pick up mobs, see; Four Horsemen, Naxx
---
Until then, its something you'll have to live with since, as mentioned, Taunt is a Spell and requires Spell Hit to not resist.
---
Thanks! Will add

Ouch, i hate to be a jerk. 
---
I just turned 60, got it my 1st trip to MC, then spent about 25 min farming for the Eye of Shadow with friends and it dropped. 
---
I think my self inflected struggles were punishment for being so god dam lucky this week.
---
you realize that has nothing to do with class design right? idc about your lore
---
You played for two months and reached level 21?
---
Doing pvp? Engineering. Plan to still hang around in the world past 60? Herbalism maybe. But that won't work if you will only want to do dungeons or raid.
---
They're pretty disgusting.  I remember watching a video back in vanilla of a warlock with BiS (or damn close) gear, trinkets, and every buff he could find, one shotting people in battlegrounds with Shadowbolt crits in the 8-10k damage range.
---
Alt leveling days are a good way to do this. Hop on for 20 minutes,  lock out, go level your alt, come back rinse repeat
---
And then realise that it actually was lung cancer, and then explain to jesse that you have to pause the cooking for a while.
---
As a warrior how in the world did you find engineering useless?
---
I said look at warcraft logs and see how much top guild mts actually use sunder armor. They don't at all. They can't when they have dps pulling 800-1k because they will lose threat instantly.
---
I do like the thing you linked it gives good info, but it a world where you have good dps sunder just can't keep up with SS/Bloodthirst + Revenge + HS. If you have low dps you are probably prot and even then HS comes close to Sunder in threat but you shouldn't lose threat if you revenge ss off of cooldown.
---
🙄
---
Pretty sure some of them lost any gold made from selling the items
---
They make the hard gear checks easier.
---
Ah hunter gear, aka enhancement gear ;)
---
&gt; As it is, we’ve got the “me first”, “I only matter”, millennial crowd here
---
What makes you think that is only a millennial thing?  There have been assholes since time immemorial and there always will be.  Get out of here with this bullshit rhetoric.
---
Who said I'm not taking advantage?  Who said I don't understand?  Who said anything about warriors *not* going slow/fast?  Hint; not me on any of them
---
To bad there's not a fortress full of locked boxes in Badlands that you can get free skill from easily.
---
I'm just amazed someone had Wooden Cloth..
---
I was a mage in OG vanilla, and it felt just as OP then as it does now :P
---
You need daggers to pvp lol.
---
Dont say most people. That's overly negative. I sometimes let my guard down a bit online cause it's mostly anonymous and sometimes harmless. But overwhelmingly I'm just as caring online as in real life. In fact I would bet that the people who are way to selfish online are just as selfish in real life and it has nothing to do with the virtual world
---
Almost all bosses in MC can be killed in less than a minute, restoration potions help with your decurse and dispel problems. Stack adds AoE down. About the fear, roll horde, tremor totems.

So the fucking Healer/DPS can see I am trying to pull the mob they've just aggro'd off of their scrawny ass before they die and start complaining about my Tanking skills.  
---
I'll spam that shit so I can't even SEE your whinging :D
---
LMAO duuumb
---
not binding farsight... ouch
---
I'm an east coaster who's also on Azuresong, and I have no issues with it. I find groups easily enough, and I love those few times I can play really early as it means I can quest solo and without competition.
---
Now if your primary motivation to move is because you want open world pvp, then yes, you'll have to move. But otherwise, I don't see a problem.
---
That being said, there's a huge faction imbalance on Azuresong. Thankfully, being a PVE server, it's not really impacting. I play Horde.
---
It's not about the "crit cap".  It's about critical strike chance of your white hits being effectively increased by +hit.
---
MoP is maybe the best expansion in WoW's history.  Sounds like this poster was right on the money.
---
1. Doesn't matter for efficiency sake but with the biggest heal you risk overhealing and ruining efficiency. 
---
2. For efficiency, yes. Since all ranks get the same bonus from spell power and have around the same base efficiency so spending less mana means the bonus damage compromises a larger % of the heal. The reason rank 1 isn't best is because spells learned before level 20 receive the full spellpower bonus.
---
In the end, on paper efficiency isn't the end all be all for mana efficient healing. For example if the tank isn't taking much damage it might be worth letting him drop slightly and then use a bigger heal to get some mana reg going in between heals.
---
Your ui is horrible.
---
Right? Alot of social outcasts who are in their mid-late twenties/early 30's now and are still acting the same way they did when they were in their teens.
---
Lookin sexy! Been using the character planner to keep up with my phat lootz, really glad you guys continue to push these updates 👌
---
I would think any Damage Meter; Details or Recount, would allow you to parse out Parry % against any mobs, given a large enough sample size.
---
I love my necropile set.  Throws so many people off with how much stam I have as a mage.
---
As a fury warrior I envy classes/specs actually able to use tier sets.
---
Yea the 8 pce bonus is sadly not worth at all and you would be much better off filling out to 6% hit to increase your threat.
---
Sorry my fault :) thanks for correcting me
---
Sorry my fault thanks for correcting me
---
Well said!
---
One weird bug I (51 rogue at the time) ran into a few days ago, I was questing in un'goro and a 60 rogue ambushed me. He took me to incredibly low health and right before I died I used vanish. As soon as I vanished, the rogue just walked away as if he had killed me. So I checked my combat log and sure enough there was an attack that had:
---
"60 rogue hit you for 61 (120 overkill)"
---
Yea that's batching folks.
---
Check more Black Lotus/Dreamfoil routes. You could also try farming the demons in Felwood or Azshara. Farm Essence of Fire/Water/etc.
---
I mean we’re still friends on Facebook to this day but we live in different countries too. I moved on to LoL and they weren’t into it, it’s not that complicated lol. Not sure where that shitty asshole comment came from
---
Face is to convey intensity
---
Griffins may be the most common specie in all azeroth
---
 You sound dramatic to me with your "look at me, i'm a nihilist" schtik.
---
Earthfury feels really balanced, from an Alliance point of view. However it's medium to low pop (which is still more than original vanilla servers).
---
I have a love for my conflag spec. Too bad it's hot-garbage for raids.
---
I would recommend a white dagger instead and put fiery. Most if not all can use daggers. I would only do this if you have the gold to blow though. It does help a lot in the pre 15ish levels.
---
I don't.
---
I usually get reminded when I am out of breath.
---
It won't be wpvp either, the server will lag and likely crash on barely populated realms.
---
ElVUI is a full interface replacement addon. If you just want to move the player frame, if I'm not mistaken (I use ElvUI so I don't know for sure) I think you can just right-click it and click "unlock fame", then drag it where you want.
---
if you get feared you can also get behind instance portals and explore empty dungeons. 
---
there is also an island off the south coast of tanaris. its used for the warrior questline but its possible to go there as any class with a little trickery :).
---
and under ironforge is also a secret city. "old ironforge" 
---
i take it your subscription is already depleted but when you are still interested you could look it up on youtube if you like :)
---
Too bad you couldnt get dropped on that big lake on top of the mountain next to Ironforge above the wetlands.. That would be cool
---
Frost dks only frost or twat people.
---
Where did you learn/buy the goblin recepies after using the book?
---
Uh........ top 15 dps just means you're not in the bottom 40% of actual dps slots in your raid. That's really terrible if you legitimately have all phase 1 BIS including raid drops. Assuming you're not in a server-first type of competitive guild, half of your dps are probably mediocre/poor technical players and honestly probably pulling worse numbers than what a fresh 60 dps class can pull.
---
Logs are a lot more revealing than, "I'm top X% of my guild."
---
Yeah, uh... If the GM says they only accept certain races, don't try to butt your way in to the RP guild. It's not rocket science.
---
Find another guild of similarly-minded people and merge. If the problem is as you describe you shouldn't be the only ones experiencing it.
---
Only works with chests
---
I like it over the gamey feeling of every item being specifically made for you.
---
Rag is only a 2 minute fight if you do it right....  Don't save mana.  Focus on the tank and keep rejuv, regrowth and spam healing touch.  Innervate the other tank healer and just keep your hots refreshed.  Keep enough mana to Brez the tank in case something bad happens.  
---
step 4 profit
---
Time is money, friend!
---
I would suggest adding a cancel aura to another button. 
---
I have mine on frostbolt. 
---
You will too often block and unblock instantly if it’s on the same button
---
Some of these were even added [this expansion.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Shauna_Strattonmeier) Not sure why OP feels this is something unique to the old days of WoW.
---
As alliance, i have a favor to ask. Please, take Anduin aswell before it's too late !!
---
It's even better because I bet it's for that cloak quest in SS.
---
There's a trade vendor in SS that sells the thread. Like, right next to the quest giver.
---
Need to participate in the kill to get credit. You can sell DM Tribute gear though.
---
You go on the southern lake in EPL. You farm the water elementals. Make a macro to target and mark them to spot them easier. 
---
When I was alone on my holy priest I could kill 100 mobs/h and drop rate is 3%. You also get some trash loot and Elemental water. Dont forget to not drown if alt tabbing.
---
If there are just two people farming there are easily enough mobs. If 3 ppl it need to be 3 slow farmers. If there is a hunter/warlock standing in middle island just tagging all the mobs then its not worth farming the leftovers. Also I killed the 1-2 grubs on the lake shore there for larval acid if I wasnt alone.
---
I'm legit curious if you've tried soylent. You seem to be willing to try weird shit to minmax your IRL experience
---
Can a priest with blade of eternal darkness confirm or deny whether it procs off mind vision?
---
You're just bandwagoning for karma. Shamans are viable tanks up to late game content where plate wearers begin to take advantage with higher armor and mitigation. Shamans are equipped with the appropriate threat generating skills required to tank leveling dungeons.
---
I agree that shamans shouldn't tank in raids because they provide better utility as a dps or healer. If you have a problem with a shaman tank in your dungeon, it's probably because your party (or you) are not respecting the rule of attacking the tanks focus instead of stray mobs.
---
I've seen it done and done it myself. It's fine. Hop off your soapbox.
---
Was expecting a pvp montage of crushing horde. 
---
Oh well, grats on the wep
---
Yeah, Locks are almost unrivaled in the size of their toolkit, Druids probably come close too
---
World Server Down + PornHub
---
Negative resistances were dirty. 
---
You'd seduce + CoE + Soulfire and 1 hit many classes if you crit, lol.
---
More like you didnt read his answer but instead assumed pvp/bg-twink gear instead of twink gear in general
---
Once you make your robes from tailoring just drop it unless you're making good money. As a priest I'm dropping it after I craft my Truefaith Vestements. There are better gold making profs.
---
Incendious feels a bit horde favored, but due to the expectation that horde typically has the numbers advantage on PvP servers, it's tolerable. 
---
I can't speak to the accuracy of any population estimates though.
---
You take that back! That one button isn't going to press itself !
---
Dungeons are rarely efficient exp on their own.  There are group compositions that are exceptions, but for the most part dungeons are more for loot than fast leveling.
---
That said, most dungeon quests award a lot of exp, and many have drops that are so good you'll use them for 5-10 levels.
---
In general, it's worth doing most dungeons if you have their quests, an aoe farm group, or there's a really good upgrade for you in them.  At least from an efficiency standpoint.
---
while this is true, you'll still need to travel to Winterspring. also, i like people to have to earn the quest reward in the spirit of how it was designed ;).
---
bUT PanDaS LoL.
---
Um that is the dynamic respawn system working, more people in an area= faster respawns. No Layers = More players in an area.
---
You will most likely never be able to transfer from a pve to pvp server.

---
So they camped 3 hrs but delayed by one, makes total sense
---
I got that too, but it didn’t populate. Do i need to import?
---
Yeah this is gonna be tough if not specced into BM. Only thing I can say is to download threat meter and if your pets threat is ever lower than yours simply stop attacking until he’s 3-400 damage ahead of you again. Try not attacking yourself until your pet has gotten the mob down to ~80% health
---
What about 40 mages standing on top of the hills to the side, ready to blizzard them all as they come in
---
Edgemasters isnt worth. You could make an argument if you got cloudkeepers legs to use edgemasters and then suppliment the missing hit% elsewhere, but devilsaurs is preferrable
---
because warriors farm like garbage, let alone prot specced ones
---
Who needs anti air?
---
All of the horde guilds gave up. They prevented the raids. Not sure how you don't understand this simple concept. People not raiding=prevented raids. Seems like an absurdly pointless semantic argument but do you man
---
Just the most petty.
---
At the end of the day, you aren't going to have full BiS loot. It will come down to what gear you have when you get a Helm that might be better than LHH. Crit cap is still a factor. 
---
But, replacing LHH is pretty realistic from what I am seeing. Esp if you get DFT.
---
Nope, but it does work with chests like DM north tribute.
---
3 day CD on deeprock salt isn't the best passive income out there, but it's something from a really easy to level profession.
---
Yes. If you're fire, there is no frost bolt. It's all segmented now. Besides healing classes. You have your one heal if you're playing an enhance shaman for example.
---
Yeah get this asap. It's possible to solo it entirely except of course for the Strat part but even the last quest can be soloed by everyone.
---
Not even an exaggeration. I remember trying to some raids on my PoS computer with under 5 fps. Good times.
---
No, because of how heroic strike cancelling works. Have you been ignoring that this whole time?!
---
Working too! But can be seen/detected with spy addon!
---
The addon doesn’t do anything but track players. If that’s cheating than addons like Auctioneer are cheating*1000
---
Owls or Bats, then Carrion Birds.
---
Screech is a massive agro magnet, with the added advantage of the debuff being pointblank AoE for holding adds on the pet.
---
Yeah but do they all need to be on screen at the same time? 
---
I have everything keybound and it's just using the default action-bar UI.  Though I did need to use 2 pages on the main bar.
---
&gt; no infinite grind
---
This is, bar none, my least favorite part about Legion (I never played BfA but I hear it's the same).
---
Still don't do it.  you can heal everything in the game as shadow even if you get into a pug ony or mc at 59.  But what you can't do as holy is fill the last dps spot in a 5 man or UBRS.  It gives you more options and being flexible like that will cut down your lfg time and your leveling time to 60.
---
Skinning/mining is definitely a very real money maker. Vendor the leather and you get an easy 40 mount. Having your mining at 300 with stashed ore to level engineering at 60 is a smooth experience.
---
1. and?    
---
2. barely, if even.  at 1961 whether or not that person would be lumped in with boomers or gen x would have more to do with the person's lifestyle and subcultural choices.   
---
I get that everyone hates boomers, but maybe pointing it out when discussing the death of someone's friend isn't the best time and place to raise your pitchfork.
---
MoP was fantastic. In terms of balance, classes have been pretty all over the place, but I’ll be damned if 5.4 wasn’t the closest we came to true class balance.
---
Sure,  once you're high enough level and your skill has been worked to be high enough.
---
Always really liked the Shammy T1 set
---
I think it looks pretty neat. I'd never use it, but it looks neat.
---
A zombie dropped 29s one time. It was epic
---
It was in open world, 10v10 i think. They were raid geared mostly T2. Thats pretty much all i got.
---
Heals have no cost to canceling ???
---
Yeah, I'm just quoting him. I doubt it'd even taken an hour personally.
---
I joined my guild months before classic launched. It was a well established vanilla private server guild that I actually raided with on Kronos a few years ago. I knew a lot of the people before joining, and the kind of people they were. They're mostly veteran players from the private server community that place an emphasis on speed raiding and high parsing, and only raid 2 nights a week. That satisfied both my casual and hardcore requirements. Also I didn't want to play with people that came from retail or those new to the game. A couple of those kinds of people are fine, but I didn't want to be in a guild mainly compromised of them, it would lead to major uncertainty.
---
I pretty much knew that my guild would be both successful and a perfect fit for my play style before classic even launched. Hell, we even stopped recruiting a full month before the game launched because we had 2 full 40 man raid teams by that point. I couldn't image the shit show of going into classic blind. By lvl 10 I was in a guild, and I knew that would be the guild I would be raiding Naxx with a year from now.
---
The new itemization very highly favors AP or crit over hit past cap. That is what we are talking about. It has changed itemization for sure. Maybe not weapon speed selection, but itemization in general has indeed changed.
---
Cinema is an anagram of iceman, not an anagram by itself. 400004 by itself is not an anagram. It can be an anagram of itself... but at that point, so is every word. Moreover, a word, phrase or name doesn't include numbers. If you want to use the word technically, you're technically wrong.
---
I'll definitely check them out on YouTube. That sounds neat!
---
"Someone else got what I wanted so I'm going to throw a tantrum and take something from him I can't use" is the logic of a child.

---
Yep, you could also get the buff in Battle grounds to do another 20%/30% damage but also mad you take extra damage yourself. Wish I still had my old wow screenshots
---
Damn, that’s true. Good thinking.
---
There's a half second ish que time going from one spell or GCD to the next.
---
Start casting the heal, mouse over your drink, press the keybind for whatever HoT you have right before the spell is done (you'll see the spell icon light up when it's qued), then mash the drink icon right when you think the spell is done casting. Might take a little practice but once you get it down it's super consistent.
---
&gt; There are no dailies, no gear treadmill to worry about
---
Thanks, but i cant find any music on youtube that resembles this.
---
Have you edited the music yourself?
---
Hopefully that's not from personal experience 🤔
---
Fish are crazy expensive on kurinaxx, wish I had bought as much as possible when firefin were 20c  each.
---
You realize you're the asshole here by a mile right? I agree that warriors shouldn't just roll on any old leather item over a rogue, but there's a number of leather prebis pieces for warriors and they absolutely are entitled to roll on it.
---
&gt; Back during Burning Crusade there was a guy who tanked Illidan with a Rogue by using a combination of talents, gear and enchants to hit the 75% Dodge cap. He also tanked Mother Shiraz. The vids are still on YT.
---
He did more than just get 75% Dodge, he stacked up so much Parry and Defense that he became physically untouchable in melee, having 101.8% chance to avoid incoming melee attacks. Did basically 0 threat wearing that kind of gear but that didn't matter thanks to Hunters Misdirection ability.
---
You pick a spec (there are no hybrid specs, so you're full on a specific spec). Then, all your spells are *for that spec*, so changing specs completely\* changes all your spells/abilities.
---
Obviously there's some overlap, but not a ton.
---
They needed to do it that way, though, because they want to add new abilities in expansions, but at some point it becomes unwieldy and you have too many. Same deal with talent trees - you can't just keep making them deeper and expect to be able to balance the damn thing.
---
Yet another reason they should have just reset everything at some point.
---
Well it really depends on more variables that what you're considering. I need to ration my mana because my group runs short on healers and we're melee heavy, I can't afford to overheal much.
---
If people aren't close to dying and mana isn't an issue for healers than meters are irrelevant anyway - but wasting mana overhealing just means you aren't prepared for an unexpected pull or intake of more damage.
---
If everyone spams heals just to spam heals and goes oom, and then a dps pulls core hound breath on everyone - well look now you have to spend 5m rezzing and buffing some dead dps because for some reason all the heals decided to spam overheals.
---
This has also been working pretty well for me too,  using it conjunction with Gathermate or Gatherer add on, is basically all you need
---
Go on....
---
nothing like a rectal baptism after leaving an offering at the porcelain idol.
---
I ran scholo with a 57 rogue, it was perfectly fine.  This was last night, even.
---
55 holy would be kind of low though.
---
Yeah same, man. It was mostly pre-cloud, so I had all my cool videos and screenshots on a hard drive I lost to the ages. Wish I could go through some of them again.
---
&gt;blade of eternal darkness
---
text for this item reads 'chance on landing a damaging spell'.  mind vision is not a damaging spell, so it \*shouldn't\* proc.
---
Have you tried retail? Id imagine it's great for a player like yourself.
---
Nah that was when I noticed i forgot to dismount
---
Yup. It's like when I say they should implement dungeon finder in tradechat and suddenly everyone is RPing as crazed orcs
---
Is it ninja looting if nobody is there to hear it?
---
Whats the addon to see the duration of your debuffs on the rogue?
---
So 2 hours for one of ten consumables you need. What is your point here?
---
Once you start getting into the higher lvl dungeons, that rule should not be followed, because often aggro range is a bigger concern.
---
Really?
---
56, doubt I'll play the mage very much tbh.
---
Gl in naxx
---
Please, you're bringing back flashbacks of grinding for that black drake heart in Badlands.
---
I got like 2/3rd of a level JUST grinding those whelps. I even killed some of the bigger dragons along the way.
---
Just a little tip, most times you pull 2 mobs it's by accident and the mobs are not linked, which means you can strafe kite them both while landing swings on only one and within \~10 seconds the 2nd mob will leash and reset, allowing you to finish the first one off in peace. Just don't land any hits on the 2nd as you're kiting the first one away and it will reset.
---
I almost *always* check for a clear path behind myself if I think there's even the smallest chance that I could over-pull so I can kite away and reset any extras that may come with the pull I actually intended to make.
---
"You are already mounted."
---
Chain running dungeons as tank from 34-52 was great about a month ago. Start with SM Library and go through SM and ZF, with maybe doing Ulda once or twice.
---
Word, I also found out about the 2nd flight path at lvl 58 lol.
---
You're just a crab in a bucket, aren't ya.
---
Don’t be mad because you’re playing on EZ mode.
---
So if you have a 60 in your group your alts xp is significantly diminished. However if you fill your group with 4 people of appropriate level and a level 60 you will actually get more xp on the alt. It's like the other characters average out the level to make it more xp per kill.
---
Why is your raid lead looking at raw DPS instead of DPS by ilvl bracket to decide who to bench?
---
That's a pretty nasty bait-and-switch to let people earn a pile of DKP and then stop bringing them to raids so they can never spend it. There are other ways to solve that problem: DKP decay, or forcing people to take upgrades and pay a minimum DKP cost if no one bids.
---
Whatever policy your guild follows regarding the spending of points, I hope it's understood by everyone up front. I hope it's not just some cabal of officers benching people with a lot of DKP so they can keep more loot for themselves.
---
I had a a twink 29 alliance warrior constantly crushing my lock at lvl 21 for hours. Any time a 60 came out to camp him he would bring out his lock and be escorted by a 60 rogue or priest. It started a rage that has me going after every alliance I can see. Zero remorse for them now, camp people and your faction feels the pain.
---
On paper it would be great after MC (because fire) if searing pain didn't generate insane threat.
---
Can i ask what is that addon setup? :)
---
If your off hand has a 9% miss chance, and you have 9% hit from gear, explain how getting an extra hit will increase your crit chance. You have 0% miss on the hit table. Go.
---
Also note that the top dps warrior is only running 7% hit. I wonder why...
---
proper move would've been to iceblock the goblin rocket helm and catch him with a counterspell mid-shadowbolt channel
---
interrupt Shadow school and lock cant do shit in terms of cc
---
then mage can poly and reset, or just start blastin.  Still an uphill fight tho. Deathcoil is fucking stupid OP
---
If you have a good group, sure, dungeons are good and fast exp. You can run ZF for a few more levels. A full clear of Mara takes a while, but it's good exp too. Once you hit 50, BRD opens up and is great EXP, and once you get 56, LBRS is awesome exp.
---
Anyone have experience making a casual guild for people you enjoyed questing with? I’m considering doing that. Only inviting people that I’ve quested with and that I had a good time questing with. Could it work? What would be a challenge?
---
OP covered the "15g" username with a different color so I think the "15g" was an unrelated message by someone else.
---
Max level gold farming. 
---
What is your opinion on what a high gph would be? What's low? And what's fair?
---
I was able to pull 30 gph grinding at my spot and wanted to see where that was on the spread. Trying to decide if I should continue tweaking.
---
If only that rogue knew what a gun or bow is. He could of killed the druid when the druid was running away in cat form!
---
I did that when washing dishes.
---
PvP, man...
---
Mages are one of the classes with the least keybindings required. Even accounting for downranked spells. You have a bunch of shit that doesnt need its own keybinding tho. Like portals, teleports, conjuring stuff. If you think mages have a lot i assume you only played rogues before playing a mage
---
Ah, thanks! Will probably go and add this (and dismount) into all my spells. I have been leveling a druid a little as well though so my macro pages are quite full :(
---
or just run joint raids with another guild (or more).  Takes a lot of clear communication and coordination to be beneficial to both guilds without drama, but I distinctly remember this happening a lot back in vanilla.
---
Pandaren have been in Warcraft since 2003.
---
you need at least 15 points for a proper tank build, so there's that
---
Looks more like a mobile rpg ui IMO.
---
It’s the fence to the DNC 2016

Silithus stealth caves.
---
Open your recruiting to lower levels and gear/level them.
---
The whole point I was making is that spamming works because you won't go oom. Of course it's not efficient and if people start pulling random adds fights get more difficult. You would still need some very chaotic fights to go oom on trash. In the current content I'd rather have a spam healer that has low mana after a fight than a heal sniper that tops all meters.
---
Yeah as a person with herbalism who never saw black lotus in the hours of farming i disagree, ill take a half priced lotus over nothing at all.
---
Seems you’re having the same luck I am with Drillborer’s Disk dropping!
---
When the warlock (soulshards) tells you, that your grind is obscene....you know its a problem.
---
I got all the way to 275 spamming trade while watching Netflix.
---
I heard that you need 3 people in the group. Your alt, your main and a 3rd thats lower level than your alt. Due to how xp is handled. You want to have a low average level. Ie: a 14 and a 60 is an average of 37. Or a 12, 14 and 60 is 28/29. Hopefully someone can back me up on this. Just what I have heard.
---
Hunter question here.
---
I'm a bit confused about leveling up pet skills. I've used a boar from 10-45, and just respecced to BM and got a level 42 panther from STV. Catdog (my panther) seems to be leveling, or allowing me to level  most of his skills. Growl, prowl, and the speed up ability have been leveling up fine. His claw ability is stuck at rank 2, doing minimal damage. Will it level up passively if I give it more time? I was reading that I should turn off all his other abilities so he uses claw more frequently thus allowing it to reach a higher level. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
---
Yeah I really didn’t mean to come off as being negative. Guy has picked his spec/class, that’s fine. But once you have, you should be putting in the work to maximize its potential. If not, your spot can and probably will be filled with a class that can more easily reach the threshold. Again, in MC, the threshold is low. It’s not that big a deal. As the content becomes more difficult, it hurts the raid for not everyone to be putting in the effort.
---
As for the gear sets, druid is a class that thrives because of their versatility. If you take a hybrid class and say “No, I only want to do this one part of it” again, you’re hurting the raid as a whole...
---
Yeah, I quit halfway through wotlk because I started college and didn't have time to play. I've learned that was apparently a good time to call it quits.
---
I know everyone here is gunning for Classic+, but I think it's more likely that they re-release BC after phase 6, and I'm excited for that too. Sure, they introduced some of the annoying stuff like flying mounts and dailies, but the dailies weren't too bad (cap of 10) and I'm pretty certain I was able to pom+sheep people in midair on their mounts to cause them to die.
---
Try BRD runs for golem lords trinket, might be a good addition not sure tho
---
I get that, but if I'm stuck in a shadow or partial shadow spec then I also have to pvp in that spec. And undead is undeniably better for pvp.
---
Hey there's one mage in my guild with mageblade, mana chord, talisman trinket and spell power ring. Of which only 1 of each has dropped for us in 5 weeks of clearing rag. Was one of the first 10 60s in guild sitting here staring at my 0 raid drops wondering when things will come down the line from loot council. Just keep telling myself i have plenty of time to get loot.. right?
---
he doesn't even PvP he only does PvE.
---
These retail folks on here slobbing over DKs and Demonhunters makes me worry about the future of classic.
---
Yeah, I am 48 now and enjoying tanking ZF, I will prob do Mara next for a couple of levels
---
In this phase a tank should be using some fury gear too.
---
30gph is on the high end, from what I've seen. I've seen anything from 20 to 40.
---
Where did I say 1 hit is better than 1 crit lol?  And almost every one of them is running blackstone, and you're going to tell me that Accuria isn't a bis item?  Get real.
---
Tbh. There was more to the story. They not only didn't even try to spend anything, they also were just logging in once a week hogging all their DKP while they still sported lvl 48 rings. After 3 IDs of not getting some preBiS gear, they got cut.
---
So not only did they refuse to bid on gear, they also expected to be carried to the absolute BiS items.
---
If I stone myself and log off, as long as I log in 30 minutes later, I'm still stoned and my stone is ready. I can go to an instance, stone the healer, and still be stoned myself.
---
The fact that as a druid I recognize at least like 6 of the gear icons speaks volumes about how we actually care about the gear in classic and just don't in retail.  I've passed on 2 HoJ's, and now I could use it again, feelsbadman.  (Went from bear/resto to bear/kitty now)
---
Poopmail jerkin, also my first epic in classic. Luckily edgemaster and freezing band followed.
---
Nice! I just leveld fishing and cooking to 300 in the last day or two, didn't get ganked at all! Very happy. I'm a mage though.
---
I’m on smoko
---
Onyxia takes a deep breath.
---
is that NA drama? raided with them for awhile in SWP
---
Tanks don't do damage. Literally every other class and spec will farm faster than  a tank specced warrior.
---
Flight path+bong rip
---
You'll miss Sweeping Strikes though.
---
It's really overstated how hard and time consuming farming pummelers is. I just sit my druid at gnomer for a day or two and log in whenever I have 15-20 minutes to do 5 clears. Then I play an alt or do IRL shit. So 3 hours play time turns into 45 clears which is usually enough pummelers to get me through 2-3 weeks of MC.
---
It is confirmed to procc off fear and dispels.
---
Ok I was a c-word for no reason, please forgive me.
---
I haven't seen a single lotus so far.
---
Okay, I think we are pretty much on the same page now. Sorry I dismissed your earlier comment. On another note, I think some of these problems can be resolved by asking each other at the start of a run what items people are after and what they will need on. Usually those groups run a lot smoother since all are ready for what happens if something drops.
---
It's definitely funny, but as an honest Rogue, the only thing I can think of is the lost opportunity to make new friends and increase the respect for my name and guild tag by saying, "hey guys, I looted this stuff while you were out of the instance running back. in the spirit of fairness, let's roll for it."
---
He got away with some gold and wasn't dubbed a ninja because everyone was none the wiser, so no harm done, but you never know who you are playing with, who else they know, and what kind of benefits could come sooner or later from just being a good person to others.
---
Exactly, and I think this is one of the biggest reasons why Classic feels so much more worthe your while... !
---
&gt; It's not difficult to understand.
---
yet you are not understanding it. As a damage dealer, you want to do damage. If you are doing more damage with a leather item, even if being a warrior, then you need it. Its simple as that. Stop being butthurt.
---
This is where you need to stand and kill
---

---
Why would two entities remain separate when they are useless individually?
---
You keep replying to other replies as a "useless" you seem toxic. You have a melee weapon with 0 spell power but want to be shockadin. You want to basically play the legion holy paladin with the pvp talent avenging crisader. When they did melee attacks and spells they healed everyone. But that just doesn't exist in classic. You're either going to go ret to make use out of the weapon or just be a really gimped shockadin with decent melee damage. You're asking to do good spell damage and healing while wearing some melee dps gear. You're just going to suck in all areas.
---
Well if no one has any decent gear MC will be harder.  Skipping your pre-BIS 
---
Ony is a lot easier than MC and gear for DPS isn't that big of a deal since you're more worried about threat management.  MC bosses are aided significiantly if all your DPS has good gear.  You maybe don't need 100% BiS, but if you have 75% BiS and the rest are at least 2nd or 3rd best that's certainly good enough. 
---
Also, some pre-raid BiS remains BiS for quite a while.  Not all tier drops are actually better than pre-raid BiS until later phases.  T1 pieces are often not raid worthy and more PVP pieces.  T2 pieces are pretty rare drops, as are weapons like Mageblade and Staff of Dom, so you may be waiting a while to get one.  Having BIS peice means your raid runs faster and smoother. 
---
If your guild does loot council they may take how well you prepped on gear into consideration on who gets first crack at gear.  Those showing effort on raid prep are better investments for future gear drops, and it makes sense to reward those folks with gear over those who are just counting on others who prepped better to get carried.
---
Yeah the server I was on did not have a community at all. Pretty much every aspect was the same as retail. Except finding a group was annoying because LFG chat was scrolling a million miles an hour. There isn't a sense of community when the server has 20k active players. The only reason I ended up on that server was because its where all my friends chose and I didn't care enough about classic to make them switch.
---
Awesome ty!
---
that is correct but you should only get locked if the first boss is killed.
---
Most guilds I've been in on WoW have basically felt like IRC/Discord channels, big ones where you kind of get to know everyone, but you ultimately still have your own primary pool of friends that you stick to and do everything else with whether they're in that guild or not.
---
With the first big guild I was in, I still wound up just getting along rather well with the more social core members, but wound up actually making friends with a small handful of others who became my normal go-to for grouping up to chat/questing together/doing dungeons/etc.
---
You just kind of luck into your own little cliques and do your best to not get passed over and shat on by the guild leader's inner circle. You pretty much just have to keep trying to connect with people and groups until you finally dig out a niche for yourself.
---
I'm canadian too, I was gonna start an alt anyways. Hmu in dms for realm/name!
---
go play retail
---
Big problem that doesn't get addressed on cats (and bears) is that due to the fact we don't use a "weapon" we have no way to reduce the glancing blow penalty. So you always face that massive damage reduction on 40% Of your white hits. Cats do A L O T of auto attacking, and if there was some way to reduce the penalty to 5% like rogues can you'd see a much higher performance from kitties, this is TBH the reason why we do well on trash, but struggle on bosses many times.
---
Sometimes i dont even log in on my maind and just level an alt. Imagine soing that in retail, not doing my daily chores for one day? Impossible. Sure you dont HAVE to do them but you kind of do. But in classic the only things im "forced to do" is the raids before weekly reset. I can always catch up. I dont have to do the same thing every day for an hour. I can just not do it one day and do 2h the next say instead. Or 7h on my day off. And still have progressed the same i would have.
---
All good. I had skinning so I made a healthy sum from that alone. Got 4 traveler's backpacks and some other nice items.  I don't mind the grind :)
---
I'm on skeram, the problem is there are like 10-20 total neets who literally plan their lives around farming lotus all day everyday with timers and alts placed at spawns. I know because some are in my guild they have like 100 lotus stacked already.
---
A red flag for what? Success?
---
That UI + SteamLink + tablet = playing while on the porcelain throne.
---
This news expansion doesn't even intrigue me and I love the lich king story line.
---
I misread the title and thought it said Raid. Ended up watching 12 minutes of fucking rain.
---
Blizz doesn't care about PvE safespots. Hell, everyone knows about the wheel in Deadmines that can prevent wipes. Which is the same thing here.
---
Herod
---
Yeah have fun with all the mages in phase 2/3. Warriors are a good class right until the pick up the the flag.
---
ah, right in the feels. they always ask such innocent questions. I got this when I abandoned my first hunter pet for a new one, she asked where the old one went. I couldnt actually tell her I abandoned it
---
Full Shammy T1 is pretty optimal for tank healing.
---
Does arcane elixir boost +healing, or only spell damage? I've been told it's a decent elixir for healing priests, but the tooltip does not say healing.
---
Yep. People show up to PUG raids all the time without consumables, expect to be given consumables (fuck no), or simply not enough. A lot of players think "oh, it's just a PUG, I don't need to show up prepared"  
---
You don't \*need\* a lot of consumables for MC, but it certainly makes it easier. And in a PUG, anything that makes the run easier is pretty nice.
---
Idk if theres a quest to kill the bartender though is there? I dont think you ever really need to kill him. Theres the love potion and a quest for sprigglesprocket or w/e that goblins name is on the lower level. 
---
But once you have completed love potion you can just talk to the succubus to open the door and still have the option to do the other bosses via talking to them or clicking all the barrels in that side room. (Though im not really sure how to fight the golem guy with that method)
---
But full T1 8/8 is BiS for hunters during this phase...
---
Yes, but you simply buy them from someone else. Don't worry about getting it for "free" because you made it yourself. It isn't free just because you didn't spend any gold. It still cost you your time and farming the materials for that gear is hell. Just get gold whichever way is easiest for you and you'll spend less time.
---
Yeah, i realize that i will be expected to know alot of things and of course I will prepare as much as I can but I honestly don't care much for getting loot fast or clearing as fast as possible. I want to experience what people who raided back in vanilla did. Before everyone knew everything. Haven't watched any videos of raids for this reason. 
---
Maybe there are like-minded people or maybe it's a pipe-dream .. well well
---
Enchant boots- minor speed... best enchant for all classes leveling.
---
Spend a few gold and always carry the best health potions you can get. Also swiftness potions can save you from death very often.
---
Don't feel bad about running away and ducking combat when a pull goes wrong out in the world. Intimidating shout is your best friend here. Fear and run.
---
Powerlevel your first aid and keep your young warrior well supplied with op bandages.
---
Hit up mainly green quests, kill mainly green mobs, don't try and tank under leveled. On that note, figure out what weapons drop where and when you can get them the earliest.  A warrior feels strong as fuck with a great weapon.  Feels not so nice hitting with a wet noodle green weapon.
---
You're killing enough mobs, you should be seeing around 2 boe blue/epics per hour when farming ZF. Not that they'll necessary be worth much more than vendor price, but still.
---
So cat is only viable until it's inconvenient to continue carrying it? I see people all the time who run cat only. I can only imagine they started somewhere on Reddit reading some posts where a bunch of other cat supporters get together and say their rank 15 dps is viable in t1 because they battle rezed a warrior once who does double their dps.
---
you *literally* stopped at apex of WoW.
---
After the lich king raid, the game has perpetually declined. after LK10/25 dropped, there was NO content for a year (aside from Ruby Sanctum, entirely forgettable).
---
There's been good raids, good class design, good pvp periods... rarely simultaneously. bad story writing almost the entire time. Mists of Pandaria was probably the best post-Wrath content.
---
watch out you're gonna get downvoted for being anti-fun
---
You can just sell dungeon runs... or sell runs until the gear drops.
---
Questing and Sports
---
I spent the entire World Series in Arathi Highlands and Desolace.
---
I don't even like baseball.
---
We actually got our warlocks the Mageblade first due to the INSANE amount of spell damage it brings. That, on top of crit, boosts the damage way more than that staff would AND since there are 80 mages per warlock on the servers right now (exaggerated but you get what I'm saying) our locks got their weapons relatively quickly.
---
That's at least what I'm going with since the warlocks just rolled higher &gt;.&gt;  My first MC raid, I won the weapon with an open roll. I rolled 74 and somehow nobody got higher than that....
---
You da real MVP
---
the parry haste should be equal for both slow and fast weapons tho? if not, could you link/show the math?
---
I agree on pull the rage dump helps, but in general the weapon skill is very strong, and using daggers limits you there (as orc/human), in addition to taking daggers&amp;gloves from other players when you could already get the axe/sword/mace weapon skill for free.
---
Yeah but the current most widely used tank spec has 31 points in fury I believe
---
Are you powershifting...?
---
I wish my 40 man raid groups were this in tune.
---
Time to buy a ring.
---
Ofc
---
Running Stockades yesterday, PUG of randos, we all had the bandannas quest, and after all bosses down, and a full clear, we all still needed more bandannas. Luckily there were respawns, and we all hung out an extra 20 minutes or so killing trash until everyone had their quest items.  
---
The sense of community is indeed real, I hadn't been a regular player in a while, but I'm so glad I came back for Classic.
---
Hybrid tax was applied to warriors though, since they were originally balanced to do very bad sustained dps. However, it was also decided early on that rage generation scales linearly with damage done, and since more rage = more damage, warriors effectively got superlinear scaling. As gear got better and better, warriors just outscaled all the pure dps classes.
---
TBC did tone down the rage generation but the problem was ultimately solved in Cataclysm. Warriors just were an insanely well-scaling class by design.
---
Should use a round robin system on orbs
---
If it says spell power,  that's both damage and healing.  If it only boosts damage,  or a specific type of damage,  it will say that.
---
He’s concerned about his raid spot. Just seems contradictory to know about MCP, not use it, then wonder why they’d rather take a different class. 
---
What that said to me was: I’m not willing to go the extra mile to make a sub-par dps class/spec benefit the raid. I want to stay in cat form and get fat crits with minimal effort.
---
If you have that mentality, and there’s nothing wrong with it, so many other classes do it well. Warrior, mage, rogue, hunter, warlock.... 
---
we have a fantastic shadow priest that consistently tops meters. He also farmed over 400 spell damage before our first raid, uses engineering items, and will heal occasionally if need be. He uses all his class has to offer to benefit the raid.
---
It takes like 10m to do 5 runs. It's honestly not that bad.
---
That's the best part of Classic, even the first raid is relevant when Naxx is out. So don't worry.
---
The epics are way more rare than any blue
---
Bc people assume trolling
---
At 60 you can PvP, but WoW is not a pvp game and if you ever played a proper PvP MMO you'd realise that WoWs is very very bad. Goldfarming is just another grind, or just learn how to use the AH and you never have to grind. But grinding for gold is awful game play. Dungeons are the stepping stone to raids so they're kind of included together buddy. If this will be anything like Vanilla wow, dungeons will become deserted again. (Hence the reason they implemented tier 0.5). Guild activities? I'd guarantee you the most common guild activity is raiding... 
---
Actually no, an achievement system that awards certain grinds with cosmetic items would be a good inclusion to the game. Or the tough PvP ones created interesting BGs. Not talking about the PvE ones that you probably never got and therefore prevented you from joining PuGs. 
---
I think you're missing the point of character progression and also can't read. I said a way of character progression outside of gearing, then you tried to dismiss my point by saying gearing. Dude. Money and mats aren't progression you idiot. Neither is PvP until they release ranks. 
---
You'll be one of people that prevents Classic from achieving better things, too conservative and #nochanges. As much as people hate on retail, it is extremely successful and Classic won't be as close to it in terms of population unless they do make some changes. This is coming from soneone who has really enjoyed the experience so far but is coming to the realization that majority of the game is over once you ding 60.
---
We lost 9 minuts preparing for Golemagg fight while he was explaining
---
Hey, that's not nice. I tanked SFK on shaman.
---
Yes,  but only if you have access to endgame level recipes you won't ever see it be profitable.
---
You will annihilate an unbuffed warrior. Buffs way more than double your dps.
---
He KNEW you had SS. Bold strategy. Did not pay off.
---
And here i am happy to get a 3x mountain silversage.
---
It scales fine, but eventually you need to keep it up to date with the new formulas that come out in later Phases / Raids and tips will likely not increase with gold inflation from my experience.
---
Shit really ramps up past 30. Its incredibly easy to mass farm anything in the 1-29 range. Spawn rates on stuff like copper and silverleaf is insane and the low level instances are so easy to AoE at level cap.
---
Dude it took 15 minutes to corpse run into Mc, relax.
---
hmm... just consider it 5sp=1int. Its actually more like 3sp=1int. The problem here is how absurdly strong sp is, it really makes other stats secondary. Like you will have an easier time wearing a piece of gear with no stats but sp, than a ton of stam/int on it, thats how strong it is.
---
i often pretend i don't have a high enough lockpicking skill for a certain chest but then hang around after we complete the instance to go back and get it. i got a staff of the friar doing this that i am still holding on to until the PvP phase is released where i'm sure the price will go up.
---
also, speaking of vanish, has anyone else noticed how buggy it is in classic? i don't remember vanish having any problems in vanilla but of course, i'm not pretending to have picture perfect memory. vanish in classic sometimes keeps me in combat and the mobs come after me and kill me even though im stealthed and far away from the action. it usually doesn't happen, but happened 3 or 4 times in Ulda a few nights ago. very strange.

OP...

You are a complete, hysteria inducing piece of shit dumbass. There is absolutely no evidence or base to what you are claiming.
---
I really hate people like you. Ever heard of fake news? You should look it up. Silly little kid.
---
I know this is a month old thread, but I honestly do not get the extreme desire for this dagger.
---
Compared to the Hypnotic Blade from a **level 35 dungeon**, it only has +1 int and +5 spellpower. And you can solo farm this in less than 30 minutes.
---
Is it really worth that much damn trouble?
---
Whats worse is 3 minute cooldown being in a different batch from heal. I have natures swiftness macro to max rank heal. I have died with NS on CD. How? Its 1 key press, 1 GCD....still dead.
---
get bartender and thank me later
---
If you aren't using pummelers as a cat druid you are a drain on your raid and literally a meme.
---
i got a whisper earlier from someone informing me i was being put on their ignore list. what's your actual goal, at that point? lol just ignore me
---
I play a mage, not a lock. If you pick UD over Orc for help against locks and priests, you're not only throwing away threat in PVE, but you're also throwing away the stun resists that make orcs the best pvp race, and you're worse off in every other matchup.
---
Hi all! Leveling a Druid alt and i love it (its like having training wheels compared to leveling my war). Anyways im looking for a macro which allows me to switch between all the forms easily but ALSO cancels those forms when im already in them. So like if im in cat and switch to bear i can press the bear macro, but if im already in bear and press the macro it puts me back into human form. 
---
Does that make sense? 
---
With the macro i have now i can switch between the stances but if im already in the stance it just recasts that stance instead of cancelling the form. 
---
Idk if i explained that very well but id really love some druid macro guidance! Ty!
---
I hate the idea of reserved loot so I've so far refused to go in groups with reserves (even if I don't need the items). But I've spent enough hours in groups for strath live missing just a tank that I will probably give in and do at least the first orb thing eventually.
---
I hate that shit.  Retail looks like such a cash grab now.
---
Nah fuck it. I'd rather rez more people quicker and just let them bandage and drink.
---
Get nae naed.
---
Toasted.  Poetic justice is fantastic.
---
&gt;TLDR: Your guild's leadership sucks - if you're a part of that leadership, go look in a mirror or if you're a raider, swap guilds because the guild you're in atm is gonna fall apart quickly unless there's drastic changes (which don't tend to happen because shitty leaders have lots of ego and they're not the problem, its always the raiders).
---
Yeah, constructive.

What is the macro
---
Until you get to your BiS gear at about 52+, nothing is essential.  If you get it,  great,  if not,  no big deal.
---
Of course. I just mean you should see 2 boe (non-green quality) per hour roughly.
---
Also; your guild should have given you Ony Head first so you could get the neck, shame them.
---
That's because you cant wear plate till level 40...I feel like you are trolling man. No one can be this misinformed
---
The fuck in min-maxing?
---
/cheer for Nevermore
---
Are the azshara swirling pools w essences of water in game yet? I know they were implemented later than 1.12 in vanilla.
---
I've been feral, but mainly as Bear.  I started 60 as bear kitty so 14/31/5 and when I had to go kitty I could easily top on dungeon bosses or be top 5-7 in MC bosses early on.  This was with no one really having pre-raid bis at all though.  Then I went bear/resto 0/30/21 for about 2 weeks since the guild was short on heals a bit but still needed me to tank a few bosses plus dungeons.  The versatility of this spec was amazing.  Can fully tank or heal dungeons and raids.  My only concern was being a MT on a threat sensitive fight (haven't used any pummelers yet) since I lost the balance talents but it was never an issue.  I am now back to the first build with a slight tweak, I don't have any points in crits giving extra combo points since I tank 90% of the time.  If I get crits and omen of clarity procs I seem to do fine but haven't used it in MC again.  But i'm loving the bear life.  My guild likes to run with me since I seem to hold better aoe threat than our warriors.  I'm now #2 tank in raids and have a solid 180 FR unbuffed for rag in my FR set.  I just love the versatility.  Innervate, heals, shapeshifting, brez, and being able to do 2 roles with 1 spec.
---
My biggest frustration is sometimes it feels like these mobs have a 80% chance to dodge my mauls and swipes lol.  I'm at 8% hit but that doesn't effect dodges and parries sadly.  Even in kitty i'll have back to back ferocious bites dodge.  WTB expertise lol.
---
Also even with no points in healing, I have a full heal set which is actually better than my feral set (feral gear just doesn't want to drop, looking at your truestrike and hit bracers from ubrs) so I could still off heal a raid boss if needed.  Gotta love that versatility.
---
Brother. Memorials are often put in games because the people who designed them want to memorialize someone who put a lot of effort into something, like this situation. It’s warm and nice that they wanted players to understand that some people put a lot of time into creating this experience for you and they passed away, didn’t get to see you enjoy it, etc.
---
Custom elvui. Topbar is titan panel.
---
Damn, why you Bitchin so much man.
---
Yeah, sorry to say, it's a pipe dream. It's not 2004 any more. The chance of you finding 39 people who aren't 60 yet and also want to go into raids blind is microscopic. Not to mention everything's nerfed to hell anyway since we're on 1.12. It's just impossible.
---
Apart from dme jump run, you can do mara tinker+princess for a decent 30-35gph or more with mining/herb.
---
Xaryu didn’t duel Snutz.  No way for an equally skilled mage to beat an SL lock.  The duel tourney also handicapped Warlocks just to make it competitive.
---
Yea Legion is my favorite expansion by a longshot. It had systemside issues, Legendaries and AP were pretty shit early on, but I think the raids, the class design, the dungeons, the zones, and the quests were all really, really good. 
---
Nighthold is one of my favorite raids of all time. Mythic Guldan is the most badass fight I've ever killed, and I truely felt like a titan when Illidan finally died and the cutscene rolled.
---
Yeah much of better-than-pre-BIS is a ways off, then you also have to raid for a while to get it, and there are going to be other mages in the guild, too.  It's not like a full tier set drops for your class in the first month of a new raid and you're the one in your guild that gets it all since you have the shittiest gear.

I'm looking at +10 spell power on my wand/off hand while I'm leveling and I was just curious if getting int on a piece since it's more readily available would be good. I'm pretty sure mages have a quest for a wand that gives + to spell power later on, but those numbers you gave me answered my question. thank you!

8 year orc warrior here:
---
Fury warriors are the best melee burst damage at 60 with the right gear. Even without the best gear you can burst down clothes fast. Take skills  like imp intercept and charge as pvp side talents and you will be able to stay in your targets face. Not having MS is a pain against classes like druids with good hots but against cloth wearing healers in a battleground  environment you can burst them down with one interrupt without much trouble. 
---
If your arms you can hit the others on the enemy team and count on MS to nerf the healing on your target and power them down. 
---
The biggest disadvantage fury has is staying on target. If you go two handed fury for pvp this is less of an issue just by the sheer damage you can lay down with a single strike. DW struggles a bit more without top gear in pvp in my opinion. 
---
I do not think you have to have WF to make a 2hander viable for fury. My dwarf is doing fine so far without that shamany goodness. 
---
That's my opinion.
---
&gt; If you're a shadow priest you need to understand you aren't thought about for loot in most cases
---
In MC yes, but it seems that turns around pretty big in BWL. I saw a fair few gear pieces with spriest highest priority.
---
It’s a Dire Maul item. The game had been out for months by day one of Dire Maul.
---
Yeah that's the thing about warriors. Solo they're rough. With a paladin they're probably the strongest class in the game.
---
Keep in mind that this game is 15 years old, and has been all but "solved" for a long time. Unless you created or joined a guild that very specifically is for new players, you're going to be playing with people who already did everything, or at least everything available. Even still, everyone is just following guides, there is very little learning left to do. 
---
You still have a long time before Blackwing Lair comes out though, and that is going to be a great experience for even veteran players. It's tough and requires a lot of gearing up. I think you'll have a great time, but you might need to adjust your expectations to meet the reality of the game.

Good way to make the tank leave group leaving you stranded looking for that "rogue" gear

Or shield?
---
you should be there an hour in advance ... pathetic
---
You’re so right. You reach a certain point on that fight, where everyone makes it out of the second time bubble alive, the banishes go out smoothly and the parasites are getting handled...and our raid leader couldn’t even make sentences anymore. He was stuttering...everyone knew the kill was coming and it was like a rising tide of excitement, best nerd scream we ever recorded I think.
---
They didnt prevent it but made it annoying to get in, not a big deal.  
---
The problem is that by doing that you make it worse for all the other alliance as those people having a hard time getting in, will remember it and want blood. They can do what they want, but I just feel like youre only making it worse.

Brackets are conditions and they evaluate in blocks from left to right.  In the first one, mod:alt will force the spell to target @player and because mod:alt is true, it will skip all subsequent brackets.  Conversely, if you are not holding alt, the first bracket evaluates false and the macro moves on to the second empty bracket which evaluates true, so it casts the spell regularly because the 2nd bracket is empty (which is the same as just clicking the spell from your spellbook or without a macro... it's a character efficient way of forcing a spell to behave like normal).
---
The long form would be 
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@player] Spell; Spell
---
Or this if you really wanted to break down what was happening:
---
    /cast [mod:alt,@player] Spell; [nomod] Spell
---
Just an fyi you don't even need the rest of the first line past '#showtooltip', it'll adjust accordingly to whichever spell will be cast
---
I think he is speaking figuratively, can't just flame wildly either.  But interestingly locks are one of the few classes you can really get some great variety in how they are specced at max level and raiding.  Maybe it's SM/Ruin I did that for a bit.   I swapped to another spec when we hit twin emps.  Was fun for ZG though.  Of course then the pre patch was rumored and I swapped when it dropped to Felguard, and never switch away until I quit in Cata.
---
Yeah, you're ok then.
---
It's not against the TOS, it's to prevent people giving you dodgy scripts.

Those runs are script commands, it should be fine. If you want to feel extra safe, go look up what These commands do. (Google 'cleartarget wow' or something Like that)

I don't know the exact numbers but from what others are saying the MCP doent make enough of a difference to warrant the hours it takes to farm them. OP already got Bis before raids so that already more than some people. Mixing in some consumables will be enough to keep OP in the middle of the pack on favorable fights. If that's not enough for their guild then MCP probably wont make the difference. There will be more casual guilds that wont questions a feral dps and be happy to down rag/ony every week
---
Does the BiS Tracker addon have good lists? Specifically for Druid. If not can anyone suggest a good BiS list that has all specs? I know wowclassicbis.com has some issues with items not being correct. Thanks!
---
One of the things I talk about in the coverage of gear is that Briarwood Reed is pretty much the only trinket that matters, and you can just have fun with the other trinket slot. I just picked a random trinket 2nd that I knew was good. Mark of the Chosen is also good, high up time and all that; plus if you like it's sound effect that that makes it all the better for sure.
---
The main advantage of running holy shield early on is to compensate for the fact that you are wearing leveling gear. Once you have that full prebis list, or even better full T1, you can pretty much do whatever you want because you'll be crushing 5mans no problem. I consider your spec to be more of a class fantasy, or play style, choice really. Do you want to rely on your shield, and be that tanky reflection type? Or do you want to rely on your raw holy power and be more offensive, in a sense, with holy shock?  
---
You can go out of your way to pick ideal times if you want. For instance, you could say holy shock really starts to get better when you have full tier 2 + lok'amir + zg trinket, or something, but it's not worth min/maxing that hard if it means waiting to a run a build you are interested in playing now. You can even tank out of ret specs, but I just don't cover that in this guide since I don't main ret builds and prefer to keep it within my realm of expertise. 
---
As far as spell power weapons go I'd only bother with mage blade if I was holy shock spec, and aurastone is kinda meh with low stats, and slow speed, so I just stick to proc based weapons and alternate between them depending on the situation.
---
Thanks for the feedback too. This is stuff that I've been talking about so long with people that I sort of take certain things as axiomatic and bulldoze right past important things with acronyms and stuff. I'll definitely be working on being more thorough for future videos.
---
Same reason your dad left your family, because you are stupid.
---
Southshore.
---
You seem to just be saying that in situations where there's not much healing to do that healer's shouldn't worry about overhealing.
---
Well, yeah. Kinda goes without saying. If you have 12 healers in the raid group then overhealing won't really matter because mana doesn't really matter.
---
But I happen to be in a group that is low on healers, and slots in general. I already end up being oom on trash packs and boss pulls, doing tank heals and overhealing maybe 10-20% with healing touch. 
---
If I just overheal more I'd end up oom and shifting the burden to other healers who are already stressed healing our melee-heavy dps.
---
Hit and crit as both your go-to stats for threat as a tank, hit being usually prefered for the sake of consistency. Snap threat on pull can already be pretty volatile because of the increased parry chances in Classic so it's good to at least take the misses out of the equation.
---
You’re pretty lacking troll my man lmao.
---
No, cats can do DPS on par with warriors and rogues right now. The problem is that they don’t scale as well with gear as rogues and warriors (and mages / warlocks) do. That’s why they fall behind in Naxx - same problem as hunters have. 
---
If I were the raid leader of my guild and we had a cat applying, I would take them on the condition that he / she actually does what is necessary to make them keep up with warriors and rogues - bringing both melee consumables and mana consumables, bringing MCPs and of course playing correctly. Cause if they do, that cat is gonna provide more value to the raid than fury warrior #8 or rogue #6, who would otherwise have gotten that raid spot. In other words, the cat isn’t carried, they’re taken over yet another warrior / rogue because they provide at least as much DPS to the raid as the warrior or rogue would have. And Naxx is so far away that their poor scaling in Naxx doesn’t matter right now, chances are that half the raid team will have been replaced by then. But even if they stick around until Naxx - as long as they’re good at what they’re doing, dependable and a nice person to play with, being 150 DPS below the rogues in Naxx wouldn’t be enough for me to take them off the raid team. A more hard core min-maxing guild may disagree, but that’s not the kind of guild I play in or would ever want to play in.
---
I thought as long as everyone was in combat with the mobs they would get loot whether or not they ended up dead/released from mobs killed during.  So I call BS like the guy saying he rolled undead to eat his party members corpses when you can not cannibalize friendly targets.
---
The stat weight as far as straight DPS is concerned is about 8 intellect = 1 spellpower.
---
The addon we are talking about is Spy, which is an addon that shows all enemy players withing hundreds of yards. I feel that kinda ruin the spirit of Classic, since then I would already knew a rogue would be around and prepared for his assault.
---
I've already gotten 1600 shadow burn crits in half pve half pvp gear. It's no joke.
---
It's about 8 intellect = 1 spellpower as far as dps goes.
---
Shit yeah you are right, he could have gotten out of the rocket helm stun. That would have made a huge difference. At least he would have been able to get away easily.
---
That'll be nice, luckily i don't play this game for loot as much as I do of having fun with people and the pvp.
---
Then that makes you a fury warrior fulfilling the tank role, not a prot/tank warrior.
---
Check if this works. You can't use CastSpellByName in scripts any more.
---
Try this: (Haven't tested, not a rogue, but should work)
---
    /cleartarget
---
    /targetenemyplayer
---
    /cast Pick Pocket
---
    /stopcasting

Looks like Combat Sword spec is having me put 2 points into improved sprint at around lvl 30ish - is it really that necessary?  If I chose not to do that, where else would you reccomend those 2 points go?
---
If the server is on fire it's not even a Customer Support issue.  At that point CSRs just get to take abuse from players while being kept in the dark by sysadmins.
---
I feel like this is an RP Realm and he’s just trying to get real into it or something
---
dont lecture others
---
Haha ok fair enough.
---
Red flag for big egos but no skill.
---
A lot of pserver/retail raiding guilds were premade before classic even came out. Most of these should be fairly closed, and invites should be uncommon simply because they don’t really need new members.
---
Also most guilds advertise x/10 mc x/1 ony first as a basis for competence. If they aren’t, that likely means that can’t clear them.
---
I completed this quest last week.
---
I kited all 4 of them. 
---
I tried the other methods but I ended up just saying fuck it I’ll kite them all. Just ended up using a lot of mana potions and demonic runes but otherwise was easier for me to do than the other methods. 
---
The Ungoro one was especially fun because you had to kite 2 mobs and they run different speeds. Lots of people are doing gimmicks to separate the felhunter and demon (by resetting right) but that was just wrong in my eyes.
---
Yeah and I liked that when levelling it was almost always a benefit to group up because different classes could help do the quests in different ways than you could yourself, where in bfa all the classes can do a lot of different stuff by themselves, such as res, aoe, healing etc
---
Me: How is Classic doing?
---
Blizzard: Remember when we said you didn't want it? We lied, but not of malice, but from stupidity. 
---
Exactly as planned.
---
Skeram? Sorry, easy market to control lol.
---
you should just scrap the idea of caring about MC progression at all. the raid sucks and there are few mechanics. MC is a raid to hang out with friends and/or wave your dicks around trying to get big numbers on warcraftlogs. it isn't a progression raid, because it is instead a victory lap for hitting 60
---
if you want to experience the progression side of vanilla, just join a more casual guild before BWL is out and you're good to go. As long as you are 60 by the end of this year you will be by default progressing the raids that actually matter. The more casual your guild is, the less of them will know what the mechanics are going into the raid
---
Been DS/Ruin for like 6 weeks now and I can mess some people up with it. Plus I feel like I have better survivability since I can double sac so quickly.
---
What unit frame addon are you using? I like that layout a lot.
---
As a raid leader asking someone to put in 800% the time is a pretty shitty thing to do. I'd tell them to level an alt because it's not worth the effort.
---
I usually use an AoE farm with high stamina snd intellect. 
---
My BiS set doesn’t seems to give me that much benefit to blizzard or arcane explosion plus extra mana health is always better
---
You don’t contract cancer my guy

it's definitely a bug lol. seems to act up especially in Ulda.

Also unless you got other druids that will buff you need to go improved motw.

Someone put me out of my misery.
---
You have to be actually braindead if you think that things like classic PvE rotations, classic dungeons or classic raids (so &gt;80% of endgame content) are better than retail.   
---
I mean MC is comparable to LFR bosses in terms of complexity/difficulty, and half of your raid will literally press one button as their dps rotation.
---
And why wouldn't you include Wotlk and Cata in retail? Those two expacs are way closer to retail in terms of gameplay than they are to classic.
---
Also retails isn't dying, no matter how much you want it to. Come the next expac and we'll be back at pre-Legion sub counts.
---
PvE "bis" lists are often total glass cannon gear builds with next to zero stamina.  Mages currently are lucky to have over 2.5k HP which puts them in "insta-kill" range for a lot of pvp builds like Warlocks, Spreists, or Ele shamans.
---
Recruiting a bit lower lvls (55+) is what my guild. You can test how dedicated they are from lvling and finding bis gear. You often cant doublecheck their claims about past raiding experiences, but by just talking to them you can learn a lot if they are a good fit.
---
That's partly why I'm confused what the group was trying to do. I just know the 6 mugs of ale method, which doesn't involve fighting anything other than the golem.
---
Who doesn’t? And get impatient at its slow progress, that’s only natural.
---
Maybe your DPS is bad?
---
No no no. I watch them to see if I'm going to spend the next couple hours hunting them down and farting on them.
---
Why can’t you use cast spell by name anymore
---
And i asked guy why he was fine with using whatever it is that tells player their cooldowns n shit but he doesnt use the addon that would tell him hes got a invis player near by. Its like im ok with this overpowered addon but not *this* one. Again to each their own i guess..

pretend to be AFK after the last boss.
---
etc.
---
damn it i love this class.

I think you already hit the nail on the head: it's more immersive. Retail is all about high-powered endgame content where you're a demigod constantly trying to save the world. In classic, not everything is so...relentlessly epic. You can just kind of relax and enjoy doing mundane tasks that are immersive because they fit the world. There are no timers, no gear treadmills, no repetitive dallies. That type of stuff burns you out fast and while classic can repetitive too, it does offer the ability to explore a world rather than rush to the new level cap.
---
Youre comin up on some great solo questing zones but honestly at around 52 you should switch focus to farming your pre-raid BiS anyways. 
---
Past like 55 exp is just a byproduct. Youre basically spam farming BRD for your BiS at that point
---
Is the Imp Shadow Bolt buff allowed in raids? I don't know it would work with the debuff limit
---
Health scat. Ew
---
I'll join you. Firing up my 2007 dell laptop with integrated graphics and setting wow visuals to minimum for 10 fps gameplay
---
Ty mate
---
It's really not that big of a difference.  The only major plus with undead is will of the forsaken and you will get a trinket for that.  
---
Devouring Plague sucks honestly the damage is minimal, so is the healing, the cooldown is too long and it costs too much mana.  
---
If you already have tier gear and rings rerolling will put you behind by the 5-6 days /played to get to 60 plus 4 extra weeks of raiding...  
---
Makes no sense to reroll if you are just trying to respec...
---
That's not the entire onyxia chain, we still need to kill an elite dragon in winterspring and do a full UBRS run (which requires key). But yeah, hordes is a bit slower.
---
It is now.
---
I'm the opposite, not sure where the regular one is and haven't taken the time to run around trying to find it yet.  :/
---
Of course there is a gear check for BWL, I think their argument is that mechanically and for specific item requirements the instance is easier than AQ or Naxx
---
I really doubt that in Classic wow 12-year-olds form any signigicant portion of the audience.
---
Well gentlemen, found a unicorn.
---
"LFM need ranged dps!"
---
Hunter I'll dps.
---
"LFM need caster dps!"
---
"LFM need dps no clothies!"
---
"LFM need melee dps!"
---
Not really. Its considered optimal way to tank afaik.
---
On my warrior I did a LBRS 56-60 in like 15 hours. I started a Exp farm group with a priest and 3 other mages and would just pull trash packs up to the ogres then reset. I was hitting 200k exp a hour at like a 175k average.
---
If you do the "cooking/alchemy/first help" combo as a warrior, it gives you tons of buff and reduced down time. Alchemy increase survivability (health potion) and general stats, cooking increase general stats and reduce down time as well, and first help is not that helpfull in solo combat, but can help you a lot chaining fight (use the enrage + bandage combo between fight to keep your rage up while healing yourself).
---
Yes exactly?
---
Combat is fine for WPvP with all your CD's up.  It sucks in BG's because you are shit when you don't have AR, but with AR it is extremely strong.  Combat is very strong for 15 seconds every 5 minutes, fine for ganking someone, shit for consistent fights.
---
Who said anything about mana costs? If you cancel MF you still do damage. If you keep canceling heals you'll eventually die.
---
Cured rugged hide and mooncloth are needee up to T3 token turn in so LW and tailoring do retain some value.
---
\*Forsaken
---
100%
---
I don't have this issue.
---
Keep in mind that 60s who are going going to want to wpvp need engi for a lot of the useful items come phase 2. Guess what you need to level up engi at lower skill level? 
---
Copper bars.
---
I had forgotten about it since original release. I vaguely remembered lighting the candles to open the door.
---
I was that guy.
---
Oh my god I didn't know this. Game changer as a dwarf.
---
Lol you're making horde look bad. Learn how to save an image you simpleton.
---
let's get this out onto a tray
---
I feel like some people exaggerate the MCP grind.  I certainly haven't experienced needing to go as much as this guy mentions.  It's certainly not exciting, but the experience also isn't miserable.
---
I personally can get locked out of the instance well before an hour of farming.   If you have an alt you like playing farming MCPs in between doing stuff on an alt isn't bad.  
---
As a bonus I also am able to supply our guild with all the fused wiring we need for repair bots.  So I also feel like I'm providing more value than just my MCPs when farming.  
---
I honestly am pretty happy with the MCP grind.   Really easy and hugely affects my DPS.
---
I feel the starting zones are all very good, and distinct in their own way. It's just a shame that some zones later are "unfinished" or really light on things to do. A particularly notable example for me is Azshara. It was a place I incidentally visited in my brief time with Vanilla, and I got excited to see it proper in Classic. Except other than demon farming and fishing it feels like there's almost nothing to do there.
---
Aha I see, I've never noticed this on my hunter.
---
Same for Shamans, people always forget about it.
---
No relentless strikes, 12% less damage on SS/Evisc, no ruthlessness?
---
Seems like a huge drop if you're raiding on long fights.
---
The perfect girlfriend doesn’t exi...
---
Cannot confirm the 2 blue/epic per hour at all
---
They can't remove it without basically removing the combat log.  Really rough addon to tryto get rid of.
---
+1 for guidelime
---
Nah you return the money on small amounts to build trust then you keep the gold when they send you a bigger sum.
---
Combat rogues can barely stunlock.
---
Your cheap shot costs 60 energy and grants you 2 combo points. You have to spend 40 energy to sinister strike leaving you at 0 energy. Even with perfect timing on your energy regeneration, you need to save 25 energy for kidney, leaving you with a 3 combo point kidney shot.
---
That's dope, this is the sort of thing I was hoping to learn, thanks for the post. I'm sure if that's possible then it may also be possible with  myself and 4 mages?
---
Gquit and join literally any other guild on your server. 
---
Every server has 1-2 guild with 500 members that are pointless alts, with barely a chance at doing MC. Those are perfect to level
---
The evidence is that Devilsaur Leather prices are dropping every hour.  
---
It's less than 6g on some realms, including mine.
---
You can buy all the beer he has then give it to the dwarf next to wall. He gets completely smashed and will try to use the big keg next to doors - you get phalanx and after that door open with no aggro from patreons.
---
If anything you’re in a good position, by the time you’re ready for MC the others playing your class should have quite a lot of gear so especially tier sets will just funnel to you
---
The catch here is that you can kill about 4 an hour with the rate these are camped.
---
human is the best ally dps warrior race but play what makes you happy.
---
Don't lecture others
---
At what point did i berate him *dawg*, literally can tell from the video hes not using it and its a "hot topic" in a lot of threads. So i was curious why he "most likely" doesnt like spy, hence why hes not using it. Dont really see the difference of the game tracking anothers spells n shit giving you an advantage IN the fight, vs just knowing they are there. AGAIN TO EACH THEIR OWN I GUESS.
---
Are you using  [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150231](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/005323105-3210052020050150231)
---
All the other combat options beisde imp sprint to get us to the next tier of talents just add backstab crit or defensives
---
Extra parry or riposte just aren't usually as useful since rogues should rarely have threat. Might be worth for leveling?
---
compare against Riposte/Deflection/Imp Backstab and they just aren't too thrilling for us
---
Plot-twist, people did it for the xp as there aren't good quests from 25-27 while you save Duskwood quests to carry you over to 30 for SM-GY.
---
FP from, Org ------&gt; Gadgetzan = fap. 
---
Serious. I've proven this too many times to count.
---
If you're 60 and have tons of gold and want to wpvp with engineering come phase 2, you're probably not going to go around mining copper to level up your engi. Deceiver gon' have stacks ready for those lazy engis
---
Stormstrike
---
I don't know about other classes but priest rez is the same mana regardless of rank.  I have rank 4, max is 5.  People need to eat and drink after a rez regardless of the rank so I just haven't bought it yet.
---
cheap shot into ss gives you 3. after the 4 second cheap shot you should have at least 40 energy which is just shy of gouge. After gouge you have 4 cp and you wait the full 5.5 seconds giving you enough time to kidney. Then repeat.
---
Human is the best warrior race by far. Weapon skill helps with tanking and damage and Diplomacy helps massively. A very large portion of the endgame is rep grinds. Perception is even quite handy in PvP.
---
If you aren't sold on human then its really just going to come down to what you like personally and nobody here can tell you what you'd prefer.
---
viper sting
---
Yeah they were probably just being dumb or didnt know what they were doing. I had multiple rogues try and pickpocket as im mid typing “okay no one mess with the bartender theres an easier way to.....” okay nvm i guess were gonna tack another hour onto this run......
---
Sounds like you picked a dormant Horde server so you can always have something to blame, other than yourself.
---
You're completely right. I didn't think of that.
---
Lvl 21 Shaman.
---
Do I ever need to use a higher level earth shock than 1?  It feels like it's just for spell interrupt, and I could just as easily use flame or frost for damage instead.
---
Clearly, you didnt farm it or you've been very lucky :D I've made 5k gold in ZF and only seen 7 rare boe's and not 1 epic
---
I would surely recommend the warrior, they can survive the hits and I died a couple times pulling big packs. Look up LBRS exp farm and I did the one with the Tauren warrior POV
---
"Im under no delusions this time that any of these people are my friends and I know they view me as a disposable nobody who can add some dps just as much as I view them as simply a way to get gear."
---
You kept your friends to this day, but this is how you view the people you play with?
---
17 isn't too late to reroll and having a character you connect with is more important than min maxing. It's a journey getting to max level and if you hate your character it will feel longer.
---
If you're a gnome, you already have a way to break CC, so it's not as important.
---
Human warrior is by far the best option out there. Hit chance makes a big difference in dps since most of your damage scales off your weapons. They don't look the best and feel bland, but human is by far the best option for warriors unless you plan on heavily PvPing in which case you can justify going gnome.
---
as a spriest i pray for good black out procs.
---
Yeah, to each their own.
---
Me, not the asshole, you, the asshole.
---
Wow Alliance get real salty when you raid one of their cities. 
---
Go back to ganking people 10 levels below you. Gotta keep that self esteem up some how!
---
Yeah, that sucks if they remove that, still can just put up another though.
---
Human warrior at 60 requires less hit gear so more damage. Gnomes are amazing for pvp. Dwarfs are a fun race with stone form. Just play whatever you feel like, i personally love dwarfs.
---
Arrow keys up/down
---
Transport aborted : instance not found. Fuck this bug. It’s a network thing and it almost made my game unplayable
---
I do this, too. I bake Claw into Arcane Shot. Sometimes I get the 'not enough focus' message but I'm not too fussed about that. Bite has a 6sec cooldown so they don't interfere too often, especially in dungeons. Growl starts falling off in terms of effectiveness at the end of each level bracket (late 20s, 30s, 40s) so I just try to be a little more careful with threat until the next rank can be changed.
---
That's some piss poor luck. Are you only mining small thorium or something? I've sold at least 50 crystals and I can only think of once where I got more than 100 thorium without getting a crystal.
---
This has a lot to do with hindsight and years of theorycrafting. People are forgetting that in the first half of vanilla, Warriors were considered one of the worst classes except that they were practically the only viable tank at that time.
---
What I'm saying is that in vanilla, warriors did have a hybrid tax. We just understand them a lot better now and we know that they were secretly really strong.
---
I think they could have easily carried talent trees forward. There are minmax builds and utility options, and sometimes "floating" points to spend within a minmax build to still get strong abilities while losing some lesser bonuses. The simplest solution would be to make new strong abilities or new ranks of previous strong abilities just cost more points, up to 5 if need be. That way the trees wouldn't end up like 30/30/30 or something, but maybe require 61 points in some tree to only end up a bit deeper than 31.
---
Improved MOTW is absolutely never happening unless I go deep resto. Furor is far too important a talent to get as a Feral druid. Even pure feral specs invest 5 points into that talent. But yeah, I was also leaning towards Tranquil Spirit, so thanks for that.
---
Dagger rogues want the bartender because it has a low chance to drop a very nice dagger.
---
No, bc presumably you are power leveling the level 30 and taking all the drops as payment.
---
Important to point out that OP was not apart of this SW raid, and that is not how our 4 raid teams entered SW. We walked right thru the front gate, killed everyone in sight, and walked right into boss room. Proceeded to kill any and all Ally that failed miserably to enter Org, and then killed SW. This was just a retaliation attack we launched after they thought they could touch Thrall, and couldn't even get 1 person past the front gate. There was 0 organization or planning ahead of this server event on Kromcrush yesterday from the horde.
---
If you actually like gnome warriors then go for it. Hard to target and Escape Artist is absolutely insane for warriors.
---
It's just for leveling, relentless is good for extended fights
---
Getting 25 energy on an Evis doesn't really matter while leveling since mobs die so quickly and you just move on to the next mob
---
I shall do so, thanks for opening my eyes :)
---
Guess you are quiet cause you realise how wrong you been this whole time. Hilarious when you said furys would stop wearing accuria when they got 28% hit btw.
---
they've been 5s for 2 months. It's not changing anytime soon lol
---
This and food?
---
I'm going to guess you're young so I won't give you a hard time about your comprehension skills. I also won't comment on anything that blizzard could do better because you're clearly to blinded to think anything could be better. 
---
Simple fact is, raiding is a huge part of the end game and right now it is piss easy. The game has no challenges in it right now and it'll need to change for longevity. 
---
There is no proof classic is more popular right now however the fact over half the servers are dead is not a great sign for things to come. I'll happily play both though. And do be serious, Classic will likely never hit the highs of MoP or Legion.
---
Correct! Dire Maul is indeed called DM. =)
---
I wasnt going to say anything
---
Because of the quote, "If you have nothing nice to say dont say anything at all"
---
But yea man you're setting yourself up for fake empty praise and compliments followed by genuine mockery and insults.
---
You might want to keep displays of affection between you and her. And share and talk about her with family and real friends.
---
Because the only genuine good thing that will come from sharing it with the internet....is this lesson I'm sharing with you right now.
---
Everything else will either be fake or mean.
---
The patch notes from 2004-6 are available online. If you want a list, I'd start at 1.3 and go from there.
---
K dawg, Keep being the internet warrior we all need.
---
Imagine a comment thread where youre not allowed to ask someone their opinion lol, where am i?
---
If you allow them even a millisecond of time between cheap shot and gouge, as you have stated, then it is not a stunlock.
---
I know what I’m doing.
---
especially now that most layers are gone and all quest mobs are over crowded.
---
Then who cares. Don't go or go with a group of suckers who will pay a tank because they're dumb. I never had a strat live group that needed to pay a tank to come and it never took long to find one, they all just want to do the ghost boss.
---
i know what im doing
---
Shit show
---
Ally is actually end of UBRS for Ony
---
That’s good! I’m just trying to think of how much it would benefit you to switch to tailoring at 55 as opposed to waiting until 60. It will probably net you more monetary gains from the random skinnable mobs in dungeons then what tailoring can offer... without investing a ton of time. Unless you just craft bags... not really sure.
---
If your Pet has plenty of health, it should always be in combat while you drink! And making it faster with serpent sting is not a bad thing in my opinion.
---
Time is money friend.
---
They don’t think lag matters for 99% of players? Then you and they deserve each other m8. You have one asinine existence, defending the worst corporate shit holes with logic you couldn’t find in a haystack.
---
Yeah, you are probably right. I need to calibrate my expectations a bit. I'll try to find a more casual guild maybe if I want the slightly less cookie-cut raid experience. I'm sure it will be fun even if I'll have to give up on the dream of having the "true" vanilla experience of nobody having a clue.
---
It's a bit annoying, too. Sometimes moving to cancel the auto and re-starting your auto attack fixes it, and other times you just have to accept that you don't get to attack for a while. It seems to only happen when I immediately start attacking out of FD.
---
Yep. I regret not doing this. I made SO much money when I hit 60 and did my remaining quests that I just wished that I had saved all the level 50+ quests that I had done while leveling and gone dungeon grinding instead. Would've gone faster and I would've still had quests to enjoy once I hit 60 and gotten more out of doing them. I recommend everyone to dungeon grind once they hit 50+.
---
Any expectation that guild members will be on the phone with you for purely social reasons is weird, and is a new, weird thing that has nothing to do with WoW's history or typical modes of participation.
---
I mined 12 Arcane Crystals in \~250 Thorium (rich and small).  
---
Got all my Lionheart mats in 15h of gametime (2 days or so).
---
Only had to buy 5 Blue Sapphires and 3 Azeorthian Diamonds.  
---
I consider myself pretty lucky, got double crystals twice from same node (different nodes obviously).  
---
Did 5 DME Jumps with a Shaman and got 4 crystals.
---
Thats why I've asked how well does it work in practice. Its a .5 second delay in the stun lock.
---
Says the guy that felt the need to tell the world how morally reprehensible this guy's addon choice was, and how he was such a hypocrite  for not using an addon that you don't like.
---
Warlock he dueled hardcasted Shadowbolt in melee range against him.
---
That should speak for itself.
---
Engineering is king, preferably gnomish.
---
hunters can do more than feign death + trap . They are a strong pvp class in vanilla.
---
If you go Herod I'll get you some bags.
---
bong break
---
Not sure why you're so hostile to me, I agree I wish they'd cough up. I'm just explaining why they won't.
---
what about the guild name "Your mother is a whorde"
---
Don't pay that much for the ring. Get the Tarnished Elven Ring for 20-25g instead, or just farm it regularly as I think DM North has plenty of good stuff for Druids (IIRC).
---
It's supposed to be catch-up gear and a reason for higher geared players to do dungeons again (long after they're useless to them).
---
Adding them so soon after release, when many players aren't even 60 yet seems like a waste. It's not supposed to be used on your main that you leveled to 60 already. It's supposed to help the guy starting in a year get some gear. Or the guy not raiding get some epics.
---
You’re a douche when you act douchy, whatever arbitrary reason you make up.
---
I don't know, I'm on one of the biggest pvp servers period and have done dozens of dungeons at max level, and I can only think of one group that was not at the very least polite (if stoic).
---
Like I said , the .5 sec window is enough for any rogue to Blind/Gouge you while you wait for that last energy tick. 
---
The only way to avoid it is a 5 min consumable.
---
Yep, currently leveling a mage because I want more money.
---
Right, we call it "community" but really it's "oh god I'm going to die out here alone."
---
Get out.
---
I've had to stop myself from impulsively rage deleting my warrior so many times. Had I known it was *this* bad I wouldn't have started off this experience with one. But holy shit, this is not even fun anymore. I cant wait to hit level 60 and be done with this.
---
45g is unreasonable.  Within mining and herb its like 35gph, maybe less now that DM is out there devaluing mushrooms.
---
Blizzard started blocking a lot of functions in TBC and forward, you can read more about what functions are blocked here:
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Category:World_of_Warcraft_API/Protected_Functions
---
Grats but camping the flight master is alot more fun for me.
---
https://wowclassicpopulation.com/characters?realm=4410_Skeram
---
~31k and that doesn't even reflect the fact that this is based on user submission from someone using the addon and uploading data.
---
Also to note, the /who API for census addons was recently updated/fixed so the addons work again.
---
Your opponent will be spamming blind or vanish or whatever their escape ability is the whole time they are CC'd. The instant that breaks, they are free.
---
With scenes like this I truly hope Blizzard finally understand where they went wrong with retail and correct it in future expansions.
---
Well we (geared 60s)will be helping them. Our guild has been focusing on our active members and community. Even if we don’t need anything from the run, we get gold while running. When one of our team progresses WE ALL progress.
---
5 gnomes clears for what, a 33% drop chance item?
---
Not sure if you're just fighting locks on mobs or in group PvP, or you're just really geared and PvP with buffs, but it seems like warriors die faster than I can process.
---
Usually what happens is they charge and I get in battle mode, I think how I'm gonna dot, death coil, shadow burn, drain tank, cast immolate after the pummel, but they drop while I'm still thinking about my next move. Only reason why it's not more one sided is because I wait for them to initiate PvP.
---
Even in 2v1, I manage to kill warriors within the duration of time their partner is seduced.
---
I will confess though, warriors are stupid powerful once they get some gear. The most deadly player I've ever encountered was a warrior that was soloing people 2v1 cause he had BiS gear with full raid and world buffs.
---
Yea other ppl value the social aspect of this game and dont want to be in a dead guild with 40 dads that are too old and jaded to interact. 
---
You should try to be in a guild with like minded individuals. If theres a guild with a buncha twenty year olds  that all get along well but you cant relate, mayb not the guild for you.
---
Salt shaker? Do you need one? Or are you  just gonna shake your head a bit and use the crusty salt from your hair. GTFO.
---
RE what I posted elsewhere, in this thread:
---
"This truly is the endless debate on what people prefer in classic wow. Basically the only solution to satisfy everyone is to not have a hard rule or expectation for pugs. We need to discuss everyone's preferences when the group is first formed."
---
Me a rogue and my warrior buddies are hitting 1,000 dps in MC. Cats will need aq/naxx gear to get anywhere near that and by that time ... war/rogue gear becomes insane.
---
Look for guilds on Blizzard forum for your realm, much more organic recruitment.
---
It's very telling how they frequently use automatic dungeon/raid finder as a key example of what's "wrong" with retail, when anyone who takes the game remotely seriously or knows what they are doing outgears the auto-finder content in a day and never touches it lol.
---
Wouldnt want to do anything else, to be honest.
---
It's challenging, but, as I alluded to before, is very much self-directed in terms of pace.  I work in the health care industry which is absolutely archaic in terms of their use of technology, so writing some Python/SSIS ETL scripts to migrate their data for them on a routine basis and spit it into a basic web form or spreadsheet for their to track and monitor is absolutely black magic to them.  Before I joined my current company, for example, they have one person spending 5-6 hours each day to pull in all the hospital discharge information from local inpatient facilities.  Within my first month, I had the entire process automated, using the state's health information exchange, and running in about 10-15 minutes depending on the load.  So while I might goof off a bit at work, I think I've earned that :)
---
In terms of how to get here, I more or less knew I wanted to do something like this all along, I like numbers, spreadsheets, programming, etc, so I studied IT in college.  Go an internship my junior year with a great company, which trained me up even more and from there I have bounced around every 2-3 years to keep my salary going up.  The thing with IT is, every new skill you learn or perfect makes it much more valuable, to the point that switching jobs a lot if often the best way to keep your income going up (just don't do it too much)
---
tl;dr - Love my job, highly recommend it, study IT in college, get an internship by all means necessary, don't be afraid to switch jobs if the right opportunity comes along
---
&gt;never played it
---
Then you can't have an opinion about the gameplay of retail. As someone who actually played both versions, I can tell you that Wotlk and Cata are way closer to retail.
---
&gt;it's just an amusement park
---
We're talking about gameplay, not your feelings.
---
&gt;i swear the fact that you compare TBC to retail WoW
---
I never compared them tho
---
&gt;never played early WoW
---
I actually played both versions, unlike you. You opinion about retail is purely based in feelings. I guess the game got too hard for your boomer reflexes once they made raids actually difficult, so you stopped playing.
---
you can always use buttondown or mouseovers to show certain bars. 
---
i personally dont have any bars shown at all.
---
i use weakauras for every combat relevant info (cds, mana, hp, shields, buffs, procs etcetc.) and "alt" to show my actionbars.
---
makes for a VERY clean ui that shows you exactly what you need, when you need it
---
&gt;Reason I ask is that I was torn on two classes; Druid and rogue
---
You were correct, druids get all the loots.  There are 2 druid in our guild raids, and one of them is fully decked out in gear.
---
Only when TBC came out did MC become obsolete. Since this is classic with no expansion for the (very) foreseeable future, MC will be in every guild's rotation. Most guilds will have it on farm, though they will still be running it.
---
What about fighting non rogues. But yeah I get they could fear you whatever have you had any experience with combat spec in pvp?
---
I'm actually shocked you're able to troll people on reddit when you don't even know how google works. Keep doing you super chief.
---
Just a heads up this has been nerffed. You get a sliver more than 0 xp if in a raid group. I'd spam BRD, DM, Lbrs, then once you get to 58 hit up scholo and strat. Do Mc attune at 55 I think, and do Onyxia attune when you can as it has a long quest chain.
---
You are playing a much better game.
---
Skinner box games are meant for phones, not WoW.
---
Man I could mess with incendius alliance side, got a couple friends on there been thinking of making the switch
---
Not a fan of this at all.
---
I'd do this for a general PVE focused spec. It's more tank focused than DPS, because honestly, cat form DPS requires so much to be competitive it's just not worth it. Drop 1 point from HotW if you want Nature's Grasp for PVP.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/-505030130302215-05502300501
---
Wait...that doesn't work in vanilla? You mean i've been avoiding their feign death spot for nothing?
---
Because no tank needs any of the loot in there. Why should the tank only get a chance for an orb when all the other players get a chance for an orb AND a chance to improve their gear?  
---
Especially when most of the other players in there (hello Mr. Mage) will heavily outfarm the tank outside the dungeon? And even more so if the tank could just join any of the other groups looking for a tank to get payment or a chance to improve his gear?
---
Bingo. BiS lists for feral cat and tank have you shy of hit cap by 3-6%.
---
Problem is nobody is looking at everything or reading everything the BiS lists include.
---
What's wrong with enrage?
---
I'll roll on there with you man.
---
If you want to be a leather-wearing, blade-using, melee dps then start a rogue, dumbass. 
---
If you need my shit because you’re hellbent on basically being a mediocre, stealth-less, combat rogue then I’ll need your shit to ultimately get the gear I need.
---
1. While leveling shaman, is it possible to effectively heal in lowe level dungeons (&lt;30 lvl) without talents in the restoration tree?
---
2. Is it necessary to have a second set of cloth gear with Intelligence, Mp2, bonus to spells and Spirit for healing?
---
3. Is it scummy to need items for DPS when I heal and vice versa?
---
Depends on the mobs, some have truesight so they just laugh at your vanish. (Notably: the dogs in BRD, all ghouls in Stratholme). The indicator over their head about having truesight was added in BC so there's no real way to tell which mobs have it other than by experience.
---
It was super cheap. Less than 10g, &amp; tipped a guildy a couple g. 
---
Much cheaper than that freaking + healing power wep &amp; greater stats on chest. Ugh
---
How did you afford to live during your internship? And how long was it until you were on payroll?
---
Not quite T1, but pretty good.

I've got a spreadsheet calculator (for mages) and checked them a few days ago. If you've got high DPS the boots can be best, otherwise they're second to Snowblind shoes off Azuregos (so probably worth getting unless your guild controls the dragons in p2). The shoulders are second to boreal mantle, nothing else is close.
---
&gt; "hey guys, I looted ~~this stuff~~ this *one item* while you were out of the instance running back. in the spirit of fairness, let's roll for it."

It's quite common to have simplified highly effective/efficient rotations (with auto attacks taking up a large part of certain classes' rotations), but classes can have quite diverse options even if many are niche. I dinged a mage alt to 20 recently and I think I have close to 20 different abilities already, even if frostbolt, frost nova, arcane missiles, and fire blast are the fewer things I'm actively using at the moment within combat. Things like dampen magic are definitely niche but I feel like it's one of those things that if you pay attention to you can take the edge off of caster vs caster matchups that are less favorable compared to caster vs melee.
---
Well, because of the benediction. Kings gives 10% all stats, Might gives attack power and the dps are buffed with salvation, reducing their threat by 30%.
---
Horde does have Bloodlust and there are totems for fire resist etc to compensate the lack of auras if I'm recalling it right.
---
Both factions are good, Alliance a little better for tanks and smooth raiding but Horde maybe could have better dps/burst etc.
---
You'll be as good as you are playing- these differences are really impacting for high end minmax pve, you'll be really fine if you understand your strenghts and weaknesses. Play what you are confortable with, that's what will make a difference in the end (:
---
Is there a set time for when buffs can occur? I ran BRD last night and they were saying that we needed to finish by a certain time so we could get  the buff. But isn't it a turn in of the head which could happen anytime?
---
Regrowth is pretty garbage unless you're regrowth spec, if you're using it frequently that's probably a large part of your problems. I only use it when tank healing on certain bosses. 
---
Rejuv is ok but I don't spam it since most of it ends up as overhealing, I just throw it up on the tanks for the most part. The vast majority of my healing comes from different ranks of healing touch.
---
SmOko is broko
---
As if somehow being an adult male makes you unable to have enjoyable conversation. Yikes.
---
But yea, most guilds dont expect everyone to be all chatty on disc. Guild chat is fine too. Just not raid logging. The worst is when ppl in the guild help you out w dungeon rubs to get gear, and then you completely refuse to help others once you get your stuff.
---
I'd always go female Gnome with the tallest hair possible, pink. 10/10 the best.
---
Our first full guild clear I was the only other druid, came out with 5 pieces of T1 and Rag dropped 2x T2 legs. Other druid only needed the T1 chest and we DE'd an extra belt or something, cant remember.
---
A single player title with *community*?
---
Uhhh does reddit count for that? I mean, if by community you mean a game that you play by yourself, but you can chat with others or interact with them in a limited fashion, isn't there things like Guild Wars and other similar titles?
---
I'm not going to say WoW Classic is overly difficult, but it does have its occasional challenges for the more advanced players, and those not quite proficient at the game tend to need help and wind up asking questions in general chat and asking for people to group up for things.
---
There's something to be said about games that are challenging. It results in community coming together to accomplish things. If nobody did this in a game, like, say Everquest, nothing would ever get done. In these games you HAVE to group, unless you're so hardcore that you refuse to do so and strictly want to level solo. Man, Everquest was so punishing that it made progression and grouping with people so very enjoyable when everyone came together to accomplish something.
---
Nowadays the games just spoon-feed you everything and dub thee and everyone else the sole, unique savior of the world. Being handed everything tends to take the fun out of progression.
---
Stormstrike doesn't reset the timer in Classic.
---
Yeah it definitely seems likely. Although I could see guilds prioritizing rogues for DFT with this information.
---
Kinda silly to measure everything against the obviously crazy warriors.  He beats rogues and all the casters. That's significant.
---
World servers are down + a gym sock
---
We did this last night.  I boosted 4 alts last night in SFK.  We were pulling 32k-34k exp an hour.  It took about 11-13mins per run. We ran till the 23 mage got to 27.
---
60 warrior
---
25mage

---
I guess we'll have to disagree. Even in wotlk, they were comically deep, and I strongly doubt that the balance team could have done much with them beyond that without pulling their hair out.
---
I don't even mind the new talents in retail tbh. Of all my gripes with retail, it's far down the list. Sure, there are less total options/configurations of talents, but there's still a large difference between the options at each tier for most of them, which keeps it interesting.
---
As a side note, I was really upset that they didn't limit the number of artifact "talent" points you got in Legion. I think it would have been really interesting to limit them so you had to pick which perks you wanted to get. It would have been like talent trees 2.0, but easy to "throw out" after each expansion. Alas, the infinite grind was better for their bottom line.
---
You said in your post "if I was online I would have a hard time not doing the same" Now people are questioning the severity of the situation and all of a sudden you claim to be one of the people that abused it?
---
Oh...
---
What is spell batching?  Noob here
---
We're talking population cap, not relative daily active users.
---
But I can garuntee there is way more active users than OP suggests.
---
Lol bro there’s no way your DPS can be “too good” at this phase. If you’re not able to hold aggro. Idk what to tell you man. Has nothing to do with DPS output in phase 1.
---
Imagine believing this. Retail is that way ===&gt;
---
Probably because they updated the graphics for modern resolutions and you’re playing on one of the updated graphics.
---
Sure, but you have to acknowledge that alliance have a tendency to exacerbate the problem by fleeing in droves to get out of enemy crosshairs. There were mild server imbalances and then alliance leapt at the chance to transfer servers, making matters infinitely worse. And no, I don't buy any of the "omg literally unplayable" malarkey that they like to throw about. Been there done that, it's not that bad, that's the whole point of a pvp server.
---
Go into key bindings and reset all to default.
---
Fear is also useful if you pull a neutral (yellow) beast by accident. It seems to help clear aggro on them if you don't want to waste time actually fighting them.
---
i've been getting this since classic launch. only way i've found to fix it is to just reload the game.
---
I like this  video, so I liked this video.
---
there are a bunch of people in my guild with enough lotus to last them until late naxx.
---
they just rushed herbalism and used layering to farm.
---
Are you talking duels?
---
I guess at that time it would convert to a casual raid and wpvp guild
---
Its still bis for fury and fury still tops the meters by an even larger margin than private. Imo shoukd still go to furys.

---
I see. I've never seen BWL. I suppose that mechanically from boss fight perspective it wouldn't be anything more complicated than what I've been through during Burning Crusade or Wrath of the Lich King(which makes sense of course).
---
True but it kinda costs alot of mana to keep recasting it considering abolish poison costs less than half as much mana and can take off up to 5 total poisons and lasts 8 sec.
---
Warrior T1 is the coolest looking set still 15 years later, congrats!
---
The bow drops are good but that’s not what making you your money in a zf farm it’s the greys. The drops are nice added income but you should be able to pull around 6-10 gold in silver and grey drops from the whole graveyard. 
---
Idk what method you use but I like to pull the whole graveyard at once and then kill the boss for a chance at a blue to sell. If you’re quick you can loot the graves too. They greys from the graves suck but they have potions and cloth you can sell and occasionally a bag or green boe. 
---
Alternatively you can farm DME as a mage too
---
We had two epics drop within a matter of 15 minutes in a ZF run last night, but I still can't get Embrace of the Lychan to drop off the Chief after 30+ ZF runs. RIP
---
Are you ignored for this a lot?
---
I miss feral in WotLK
---
So you've never PVP'd as a priest before.  Got it.
---
Honestly a pretty apt breakdown of what happened on Monday. Heart sunk when my current boss told me I needed to go see his boss.
---
My rogue/spriest/rdru was beaten by 2 dks after we deleted their holy priest around 2400s because the priest stayed in angel form by spam healing and the two dks just ran at my partners while i was RNG feared in double death and decay. thinking about it gives me ptsd flash backs because the two that beat us were roughly 2000s max in bc and never should have been in our bracket other than the pure domination dks had
---
Learn to drop groups sooner. You could have left, partied with the paladin, found new DPS in a few min, and been done 3x faster.
---
Good thing hit cap is 5% and it's a different spec with diff min max goals attainable from plate!
---
Classic lets you play your class during questing.
---
Retail is more like... mount up, gather 10 mobs, press 2 buttons, mobs dead. Rince repeat. It's dull and braindead.
---
Like....people need to join guilds and such. I haven't run LFR or used group finder or pugged.....anything all expansion long because I have a guild that I've played with for over a decade to do everything with.....It sure beats playing with a bunch of randos I might never see again.
---
Or you spill your Cheerios, lay headset down for a quick bio, the reasons are endless.

Bryant University in Rhode Island, not the best IT program in the word, but really strong business focus which has been helpful.
---
My first job out of college was at Amica Insurance.  Not going to list my current company, but it's a health care company in Tucson, AZ.  That should be vague enough :)
---
Hush child I never said my DPS were "too good" I said they were good. Implying yours are bad...
---
Come on over to alliance side where they are 110g+
---
With DFT, I will be using it to cap my yellows, which is far more value than a few more hit% on a rogues white swings.   
---
IDK, I can see how you could twist it into rogue prio. But since I can easily still keep my hit down on gear, and a rogue is basically stuck with 8% hit in their talents, its a fury prio in my mind.
---
Big move from Rhode Island to Arizona!
---
"Gimmie my dolly!" - Donna exclaimed

Yeah, like I said, I don't necessarily think that theory is wrong, theres just something that doesn't add up.

Mage gets hit by a fireball and shaman takes the blast. Shaman then gets hit by the very next fireball solo, with no one taking the blast. This shouldn't happen if the shaman had his threat wiped.
---
Can you tell me more about how you perform this? Do you have to spam the button? Stand still? 
---
I've seen countless ppl saying that macro (and many others) don't work consistently. I'm just confused.
---
There are dev interviews confirming a form of dynamic spawning. Its a minimum mob threshold per zone, not based on player count.
---
&gt; DKP is designed to ignore literally everything.
---
And that's your definition of corruptible? Besides, it's not like there are a multitude of gearing options in Classic, especially at this stage. It's really a lot more of a matter of who gets what first, than each player achieving their own specific wishlist, save for a few exceptions that "could be good" for some classes/specs, but are obvious BiS for others, which I'll concede should go to those for whom it's BiS, which LC certainly achieves better than DKP would.
---
&gt; Its the only strategy.
---
No it's not, I specifically provided an alternative strategy, did you just ignore that?
---
&gt; If you spend DKP on an eye you are dumb as hell.
---
Which is why I've said I don't mind waiting for everyone to get it before I do, so I can spend my DKP on tier pieces I need. Again, did you just ignore everything I wrote?!
---
&gt; Also prophecy sucks for priests.
---
At least 3 (and up to 5) of the Prophecy pieces are (arguably) BiS for Phase 2 (Shoulders, Waist, Feet), depending on which BiS list you're looking at. I'm not sure if that's the definition of sucking, but whatever... I'm certainly getting 3 pieces of it, if only to use the 0.1 Flash Heal casting time reduction in PvP.
---
&gt; I mean that you don't know anything about loot councils.
---
Well, considering different guilds will have different ways of using LC, I can't obviously claim to be an expert, but is there anything specific about it you believe I'm missing, I really don't get why you'd say this, if not to antagonize me, while I'm merely trying to have a constructive discussion here, but can't help feeling that you don't...
---
&gt; But you also don't seem to know how to play a priest either.
---
How do you figure that? I've been maining Priest for 15 years and have always been part of top progression guilds on retail. Anyhow, coming for someone who claims Prophecy sucks (despite there not being many alternatives right now), I've come to understand your opinion is irrelevant.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I'm assuming we're done here, unless you feel like having a respectful, meaningful and constructive discussion here, which doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Yeah it's sort of all over the place, could be a bug, timer change, no layers on some servers, layers on some, dynamic respawns changing respawn timers due to population.
---
Yep, but definitely the right move, Rhode Island is beautiful but very expensive.
---
I've lost count of the times someone in a dungeon wiped the whole group and acted like a mong and then gave the excuse " Sorry. Im just so high right now"
---
Yea pretty much. We used to have to work to survive but now that’s nearly automated now.
---
I would love to see some videos of this elite PVP. I'm don't mean that in a smart-ass way, if you're really doing what you say it would be entertaining to watch. I don't care what side is getting shit on, I just like to watch good PVP fights and try to learn from them.
---
My boyfriend and I keep coming back to what we've decided to call "texture". All the little inconveniences that make the world feel a bit more real, even when it's blatantly not.
---
Like, you carry more stuff in your bags than would be physically possible - that's blatantly unreal. But at the same time, you need to buy arrows in order to shoot, and that's just so real. They've walked a careful balance with this, and mostly got it right, in my opinion.
---
Another thing is that your character feels more persistent than it does in retail. It's a bit harder to change spec, maybe you don't have the gold, maybe you need different gear. And you can't just change your looks. So it makes the character feel more real too, and makes your choices matter, just a little.
---
Cause he said "nothing pve to do"
---
In the sense that suggesting things that rely on an exploit makes it an invalid suggestion.
---
Not really. There are a lot of much better items than Might you can wear. Even for a hybrid of threat and mitigation. The 8p is really underwhelming for the tradeoffs you make. Even if you want to go full mitigation, having 2p Wrath is gonna be better than 8p Might.
---
The level up helps sure, but it's super easy to get overwhelmed by accident. A fairly common example is a third enemy just patrolling into your prolonged 2 v 1, or a fleeing low health enemy pulling even with only a short run if you miss a finishing auto. My understanding with rogues is that tab targetting kills your combo points, so it's one reason I dislike unimproved gouge as you only very briefly stun an enemy while also losing DPS momentum trying to do that. Gouging to genuinely run away or to take a bandage breather is a different story, and I feel like improved gouge is noticeably better.
---
Why don’t you just look up the prices on your server? Whatever someone says here might differ depending on server population.

Just tried it, still doesnt fix it

I live in California. I think IT is where I want to go, I just don’t know which college to go to or where and what to do... I’m 22 years old and I’m stuck feeling like I should have This shit figured out by now
---
1. yes
---
2. yes
---
3. It depends. while leveling it's more acceptable. best if you communicate ahead of time.
---
I majored in Global health in college to get an internship doing IT in Healthcare right as I graduated. Now I'm an IT/Sys admin in a completely unrelated field, and I occasionally doing damage control for our applications/website (C#, vb). We outsource our development, so I am the only one in my department/role and it's a unique one. All of what I do, nobody else can nor do they know how long it usually takes, it just gets done. The rest of the time is my own to spend as I like, so I use Parsec to remote in to my PC at home and play WoW, LoL, whatever, or just dick around on the internet. 
---
My tl;dr is yours exactly. 25 y/o chillin
---
Dodging has nothing to do with hit and you should be prioritizing hitcap.
---
Aye, even if this was phase 6, doing 60s dungeons for pre bis or rep grinds would still be meaningful. Think about that, in phase 6 that content is still meaningful, while retail hasn’t had a single meaningful moment for me in years.
---
Yeah I get what you're saying! Getting new gear does not really feel like a huge boost, because in your animal forms you barely notice it - with a few exceptions such as wolfhead helm. I just felt that by playing a support class, I would stand out and would be able to pull of more stuff by myself and help people. I also discovered I do not really like the Tauren model in comparison to the Troll I have now, haha. That also means I'll just sap paladins I encounter, lol. Sorry!
---
Are you referring to PvP or to raiding?  The answer will be very different as the stat priorities do not align between the two roles.
---
Use hammer plus joc for double dmg.  Use the downtime to socialize and get to know people.  Cast blessings on others for goodwill points.
---
Thinking of rolling a druid alt. I want to do mining and eng but I'm worried it doesn't make sense since I'll be in animal form so often. Is this a deal breaker for a druid?
---
Mugger belt and a cht is surprisingly dope.
---
You joined a group that only needed a healer and was good to go, only to be told to dps? Interesting
---
The part most new hunters don't grasp though is timing the enrages properly. Sting, get 3 melee swings in, wingclip pull range until enrage, sting, repeat.
---
Since int only gives a slight amount of crit, the ratio is about 1 sp = 5-6 int in terms of RAW dps. Now obviously manapool has its uses, so you have to consider that too.
---
Well, uhm.. according to that 500+ post forum thread plus several reddit posts, yes, it does not work in Classic WoW.
---
Mind you, I haven't actually tested it myself. I'm just trying to know whether that's true or not, and if it really matters that much, before I go deep into Hunter gameplay.
---
NICE CHEST YOU GOT THERE  DONT MIND IF I TAKE IT.
---
That’s just oversimplifying. A plate wearer is needing on rogue shit. Unless the leather wearers have that gear, stick to plate.
---
“It’s an upgrade to my character.”
---
Yeah, so is gold in my bags, dawg. Peace!
---
&gt;the grind keeps me busy when I want to relax after work
---
This is why. You're not being lead down some tunnel of progression when you want to relax. You're not working towards the next milestone. 
---
Classic feels better because you don't feel like you could be spending your time progressing in a more meaningful way. There's no FOMO in Classic.
---
Druids have a harder time tanking those. They might have more HP but the block the other tanks have is pretty important
---
I play on a medium server so it is still crowded at times, but there are several timeframes a day where you can kill them in peace.
---
I replied this to a comment above, but I feel it pertains to your comment exactly:
---

The hobo gear is my favorite part, I never hide my helmet on my mage cause the hoods are so awful they must be seen.

My current boss never went to college, barely graduated high school, completely wasted the first half of his 20s (his words), and is now the director of a multi-million dollar grossing health care company.  Not that I suggest his route, but trust me, you have time :)

soulstone
---
Interesting build, but it's focused heavily on cat dps at the expense of important bear talents. Given I tank 5 mans all the time rather than dps, and given that in raids, bear tanks are much more in demand than cat dps, that build is not really viable for me.
---
Now if and when I raid phase 3 or 4 content when cat dps gear actually drops, I could switch to dps mode. Just not before then.
---
reminder to self to check this out later

Yea, The horde raid fell apart at the tram exit. But lets only talk about the SW!
---
One day the top post over there was literally a picture of a wow bullet journal, WTF. That’s the day I unsubscribed
---
How would I run from Mulgore to Felwood? (To party up with a guildie to farm Timbermaw rep on a level 1 alt Druid, with a view to making a Twink with the furbolg medicine pouch)
---
I want to get a decent laptop soon so I can record 😪
---
Don’t want to share my spot here but I’ll give the overall strategy.
---
Me and few others, at best 5 will perch on somewhere looking down on a main road horde travel to a dungeon and pick off the horde, then hide, get mana and wait for next horde to come.
---
This is going to be our main strategy to get honor in phase 2 since TM vs SS is not viable due to honor being reduced to 0 if you kill an enemy more than 3 times in a day.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the analysis.
---
Imagine if this was a teaser trailer for WOW 2 like "In game graphics" jesus christ that would be too fucking good
---
Can't open a ticket either, that's bugged as well. Not sure what to do :(
---
Maybe so, but who tf is going to actually pay that unless you're a top 50 guild?
---
30g an hour is a good baseline for any class. Obviously for mages or hunters it would be higher.
---
Well that would server as a great title for the video, think I should've used it..
---
There is still an organized horde/allied mafia on my server, unfortunately.  Leather is still in the ~20g range.  
---
Last night 6 members of my guild went down to fuck with the devilsaur farmers (and take a few leathers for ourselves), and within 15 minutes about 60 members from the opposing faction were down there and corpse/spirit res camped us until we logged to alts or managed to escape.  Sad days.
---
Doesn't seem like the right use for an in game ticket.
---
might as well just find a new place to live
---
Idk about that. Assuming you have all consumables and grenades which you should. Lets say the rogue opens up with cheap shot. pops adrenaline rush, ss. gouge waits - kidney, ss, ss, ss. Vanish. Then opens up again. Cheap shot into evis. Theres a stun lock that i'm sure can take out a couple different people. Have Blade Flury somewhere in there.
---
I gotta pee.
---
Lol I did the same!
---
Still too good looking btw, this isn't the same engine. Lighting is VASTLY different.
---
Classic horde move
---
Definitely incorrect
---
Mongoose *does* erase the 25 agi elixir. Doing it the other way around is what OP did.
---
Waiting in an instance for the rest of your group + coffee refill
---
I dunno who went to IF first, Ally atacked Ogrimmar, than Horde blimped to STV after defending Orgimmar and ran straight to SW. The raid did die after taking the Tram to IF and dieing while zoning in.
---
Yeah, exactly. I mained a holy/ret pally in vanilla so I miss the survivability but I’ve played warrior ever since late vanilla and just like the play style so much more. Pally toolkit was so much fun pvp healing though and if I had a personal pally it would make WPVP so much more enjoyable. Sometimes the challenge is nice but it’s rarely gonna come out with a win from a solo warr
---
If I tall that story you gonna strangle me... ^^ I got HoJ in a guild run, was like the 3rd or 4th kill... and no one had need for it - and I got it with a 1. The chest took a few more runs.. and the first time I got the boss, it dropped - and no one needed :O
---
I only have Flurry Axe, sniped it for 200g on my server (usually up to 400) and now no G for Deep Woods :(
---
Im sure it could work but expect a lot of turnover from people leaving for better endgame guilds.
---
Guild banks will have the money from selling BoE epics, flask of Titans is responsibility of guild.
---
It’s happened randomly a handful of times throughout leveling and at 60. Wondering if it’s unique like the other guys said. Idk it happened on a Hand of Justice
---
There's an option called "submit a suggestion"
---
You don't need anything in the resto tree to heal. As long as gear has int, you should be fine leveling, late 40s is when you start getting enough healing power to matter gear with healing gets better than int.
---
Not through most of the leveling process. 45+ where you start getting into end game dungeons it will be considered by most to be scummy if you need on DPS items while healing. During leveling it is generally accepted that you will be needing on DPS gear so you can handle content while soloing.
---
There are theories I have seen that suggest the threat reduction is split under that circumstance, rather than reset for one individual.
---
Not only that, some specs lock you out of weapon choices. Like, if you're survival hunter in retail, you can't use a gun/xbow/bow. You can use a polearm.
---
That's true, yes.
---
But my main question still stands: Is the FD Trap mechanic really buggy in Classic WoW? I'm getting mixed answers, some saying that it's functional and some saying it is not.
---
It's... Not tight at all. Warriors are spam hitting their fear button, rogues their blind/vanish, warlocks deathcoip, priests fear etc. You will be cced and lose the fight.
---
What AddOn tells the cooldowns of the target like that? Super handy.
---
Agreed. The whole raid (our at least leader/officers) needs to be on the same page. If they're cool with someone going off-meta, then great, but if not then the off-meta player either needs to pick a different spec/build or find a different group that's cool with them playing off-meta.
---
Didn't mean to make it sound like "do whatever you want cuz fuk u", sry
---
Happened on a hand of justice and I do already have that. That what it is?
---
&gt;And that's your definition of corruptible? Besides, it's not like there are a multitude of gearing options in Classic, especially at this stage. It's really a lot more of a matter of who gets what first, than each player achieving their own specific wishlist, save for a few exceptions that "could be good" for some classes/specs, but are obvious BiS for others, which I'll concede should go to those for whom it's BiS, which LC certainly achieves better than DKP would.
---
Why would I want a loot system where all of the casters are gonna hoard DKP and pass on everything for the chance that a Mageblade will drop?
---
&gt;No it's not, I specifically provided an alternative strategy, did you just ignore that?
---
Your strategy is wrong. Sorry.
---
&gt;Which is why I've said I don't mind waiting for everyone to get it before I do, so I can spend my DKP on tier pieces I need. Again, did you just ignore everything I wrote?!
---
Prophecy also sucks so you are wasting DKP.
---
&gt;At least 3 (and up to 5) of the Prophecy pieces are (arguably) BiS for Phase 2 (Wrists, Waist, Feet), depending on which BiS list you're looking at. I'm not sure if that's the definition of sucking, but whatever... I'm certainly getting 3 pieces of it, if only to use the 0.1 Flash Heal casting time reduction in PvP.
---
5/8 of the prophecy set sucks, more than half of it sucks, meaning that the set sucks. Dungeon blues are better than most of the pieces.
---
&gt;Well, considering different guilds will have different ways of using LC, I can't obviously claim to be an expert, but is there anything specific about it you believe I'm missing, I really don't get why you'd say this, if not to antagonize me, while I'm merely trying to have a constructive discussion here, but can't help feeling that you don't...
---
Its pretty clear you have never been in a guild with loot council.
---
&gt;How do you figure that? I've been maining Priest for 15 years and have always been part of top progression guilds on retail. Anyhow, coming for someone who claims Prophecy sucks (despite there not being many alternatives right now), I've come to understand your opinion is irrelevant.
---
I've played with one of the major spreadsheet guys for a class and he was complete dogshit at playing it. You can have mained a priest for 15 years and still suck at it. Also I highly doubt any of that is true based on your loot comments.
---
&gt;I'm assuming we're done here, unless you feel like having a respectful, meaningful and constructive discussion here, which doesn't seem to be the case.
---
Have fun with your shitty DKP system.
---
I think things as simple as "supercharging" certain existing abilities could have worked, even if some pruning ultimately happened. Like spending 5 points to cut a powerful cooldown in half or something, or just incrementally boosting an ability by 10% or something for people that really liked relying on it, without completely obsoleting people that didn't invest into that boost. I feel like Classic itself already has a thing where you can get diminishing returns the more you invest in a specific tree, and while I'm not a big fan of longer grind leading to smaller power increases, I also understand that interactions can make even small boosts more powerful than they appear, or otherwise powercreep can get too severe if they didn't tone it down somehow.
---
Its funny cause heartseeker is like this but in favor of the alliance. 
---
I rerolled to a more balanced server. It sucks but it only gets worse if blizzard doesnt try to have transfers back
---
Dagger might be a better idea, only class that cannot use them is Paladin.
---
It's a variable addition based on the cast time of your spell.
---
You think portals and conjuring are the only skills that arent keybound? Also impossible to use downranking on all spells, there are too many. All 5 action bars are completely full with only one downranked skill so think what you want
---
No PvE is hard really if you have semi decent gear and raiders, it’s annoying that guilds have to min max instead of having a healthy mix of classes in classic
---
Lol "roll a warrior" 
---
No thanks, already did that in Vanilla.
---
I'll have fun camping people like you, with the exact "no hp have to stealth and stunlock to kill folks" toolbox that I was given :D
---
Right, 100% of the time everytime. Theres ways around that .5 seconds which Is why i'm asking people who've played combat in pvp and how its went.
---
Except did you notice that he's getting DUMPSTERED by warriors in the same raid?
---
I’ve heard that +healing gear has a 100% coefficient with it.  Tell him to try putting on a few pieces of with lots of it.
---
I don’t like guilds that do free roll unless they don’t. Either do free roll for everything, or don’t. But don’t prefend to be a free roll guild and then loot council only the bis shit to guys you think are worthy.
---
I recently picked up Gutgore Ripper in MC so I swapped from Hemo swords (where it was easy af to solo Pyromancer) to combat daggers for raiding. I just decided to fuck around with a 21/8/22 CB/Prep build which unfortunately isn't working as well as I'd hoped, because killing Pyromancer and Plugger has become a lot more difficult.
---
I managed to pick one up from the AH for 50g.
---
Somewhere, a level 55 hunter at the time missed a zero on the end of his buyout price, methinks.
---
The minor upgrade would be enough to put me off from buying one for hundreds of gold, though.
---
Yeah, pretty good timing. I only reached max level in wrath, raided until cata came out... and quit because something happened to the social dynamics and people started being consistently nasty in dungeons. I don't remember what exactly they changed, maybe that was when the cross-server stuff got out of hand.
---
Every time I've poked my nose into the game since, it just felt boring and unrewarding.
---
Exactly. OP should recognize a buyer's market when they see one, stock up on these cheap mats, then put the extra up for auction once the price goes back up. 
---
But nooo, let's fuck everybody who isn't a gatherer because *muh profits.*
---
Why is literally every undead rogue player this way.. it's like y'all share the same brain cell.
---
Just because warriors are on top doesn't mean the raid dps improves the most by giving it to a warrior though..
---
I just hit 40.  Been running dungeons tanking as a warrior and having a blast.
---
Phase 2. No lyaering and pvp. Its going to change.
---
yea https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9449/manual-crowd-pummeler
---
At endgame wolfshead is BiS forever, no amount of stats even comes close to what wolfshead provides. It's one of the most important items you can get for yourself on any class and it's dirt cheap.
---
One other thing, spell damage on earth shock matters A LOT for threat generation - so keep that in mind in case you play with others. 
---
Later on, you could get storm strike as an enhanco, amplifying your nature damage by 20%
---
I was online whole night to 07.00 doing herbalism in Silithus and Burning Steppes - didn't notice any weird stuff whatsoever. On Gehennas-EU, horde.  
---
Maybe it was a different layer that kept resetting?
---
That's why we took red/yellow. Fast combat yeilds no adaptation, and as such becomes a rinse and repeat borefest. We fealt as you did until we were forced to heal, kite, fear, CC and more.
---
As for mage, I strongly advise against it. Mages are fast levelers but aside from PvP seem to be everything you've talked about hating. Rinse and repeat snoozefests into a one button rotation at endgame. I reccommended gunters not because they were fast but because they provide more in terms of potential input.
---
Either way, that's only a possible future...
---
I want to say man it's been fascinating hearing from someone who's not clicked and why. It's a side of the playerbase not often heard and I thankyou for that
---
Don't re spec to holy until you are raiding, it's not needed provided you have healing gear. And if pugs ask if you are holy just lie and say yes.
---
Top tip, sir!
---
But do we really expect them to cost 1k per flask? People are hoarding hundreds of black lotus right now, the supply and demand aspect of it should keep the black lotus price in check to some degree.
---
With current damage bosses deal Sunder is still better threat because you don't have the rage to HS constantly. Major goal is to be able to cast an ability every global with SS&gt;Revenge&gt;Sunder revenge and SS have Cooldowns so you need to mix in sunders. Heroic Strike only when you have the excess rage. It's threat per rage isn't great.
---
This priority is doubly true for Horde where your sunder has a chance to proc windfury.
---
I usually just polymorph if I remember and run if I don't remember I die .. Every time
---
DMC: Twisting Nether from Portals Deck. 10% chance to rezz upon death with 20% HP/MP. Fun little thing when it worked.
---
As a Pally, I spend more time tabbed out while playing wow than not. All that porn isn't going to watch itself
---
seconding the importance of communication
---
Priest stat priority in MC is +healing over spirit and int and stamina.
---
Priest stat priority in PvP is stamina and int before healing.
---
There is a big difference between gear for raiding and gear for pvp.  Necropile Vestments are a big example of prime PvP gear and poor raid gear.  Priests do a lot of binary actions in group PvP.  This requires a large mana pool and throughput is not important.
---
But hey, what do I know.  Go ahead and run into wPvP with your +400 healing and low health/mana.  See how many dispels, shields, mana burns, and fears you get off before you go oom.
---
Do you approach every casual online conversation with the intention if being condescending and insufferable or can you just not help yourself.
---
Personal experience from 0/30/21 druid myself:
---
1. I passed on Blood Frenzy as it only affects your generator crits, not white crits
---
2. I passed on Feline Swiftness because very few instances are outdoors
---
3. The two points from Blood Frenzy and Feline Swiftness went into Thick Hide (3/5) which is good enough
---
4. I constantly forgot to cast Insect Swarm so just respecced my second point into Improved Enrage; otherwise my resto tree looks identical to yours
---
5. I had the exact same debate about Nature's Focus vs Tranquil Spirit and ended up not really missing NF.  Don't get hit or Barkskin.  I may feel differently come raid time if there's a boatload of splash damage but in 5 mans i'm totally fine.
---
Thanks for the reply man, really nice. The stuff you mentioned about shaman triggered me a bit because something inside of me kind of wants to roll one. Restoration druid is something I despise, and shaman seems much more engaging as a healer imo. Totem buffs, chain heal, throwing a shock just for fun - sounds awesome. Never played a shaman EVER. So that's also why it speaks to me. Elemental/Resto hybrid sounds amazing. 
---
I get what you're saying about the casual point of view on druid - it just works. Tanking is something I would miss, but at the same time, I like PvP and screwing around so much more, so that's a sacrifice I am more than willing to make. I think I like warrior tanking better anyways, haha. As a druid I feel like a damage sponge instead of a parrying, blocking beserker. 
---
Maybe that's why rogue is 'clicking' for me, there's a clear, smooth and efficient way of playing it without having to use a complete arsenal of forms, spells and resources
---
Reminds me I should install an auto dismount addon
---
.......congratulations?
---
So, you need to understand the concept of protected API functions. In the modern client (which is also used for retail) it is no longer possible for macros/scripts/add-on to use if-then logic in any way that results in casting a spell or using an ability EXCEPT with certain specially-approved functions. [stealth]/[nostealth] is one of these, as are others that check what kind of equipment you're wearing, what form you are in, what modifier keys you are holding, and a few others.
---
No legitimate add-on is capable of using the information it knows about your swing timer to change what a button does. It can provide that information to you, but it cannot act on it for you.
---
Assuming you don't run oom, 1 intellect is worth 0.016949% crit
---
Crit is worth a variable amount of spell power based on how much crit you already have, and how much spell power you already have.
---
So at super low gear levels, let's say 110 spell power and 10% crit rating as a fresh level 60. **Crit is worth about 7.67
---
 Spellpower (conversely 1 Spellpower is worth 7.69 Int)**
---
At mediocre gear levels (can farm this in a week or less), Let's say you're at 300 Spell power and 15% Crit.  1**% Crit becomes worth 9.57 SpellPower and 1 Spellpower is worth 6.16 Int.**
---
At extremely geared levels, you'll be around 550 Spell power and 20% crit. Then **1% crit = 12.07 SP and 1 SP = 4.89 Int.**
---
Spitballing I'd say 50-80g?
---
Not past the earlier zones, and definitely NOT in Un'goro.
---
But then it feels so good once you get the tools to actually handle two mobs. Mwahahah, so powerful :D
---
Will help after work if you still need just send me a message on here to coordinate. Gunna be about 4 hours tho
---
yea batching is indisputably worse for casters but it's still extremely cancerous for rogues(although you can abuse it to your advantage in certain situations)
---
&gt;Theoreticals
---
It doesn't work how your are describing in practice like 99% of the time. With spell batching its nearly impossible to pull off the rotation you described without your opponent messing it up with a DoT, CC, reset, etc
---
I always knew Blizzard would find a way to kill Classic but I expeced them to be more subtle.
---
How are you gonna use DFT to cap yellow when it's 6%, how are you not capped already?
---
You have to literally replace good gear with less good gear that has no hit, so that you can make use of the 2 % hit off DFT, and warriors will have the warrior quest trinket at the time BWL is out, which is crazy good anyway. Rogues will get the most stat increase from DFT, and in turn get the most dps increase, it's honestly not really debatable. You can debate that fury warriors should get it so they have DFT for tanking though or that rogues already get so much gear or something, that's a fair argument.
---
Nah, in high school I did because we didn't really know better back then. Now I don't because I realize it hurts people's feelings.
---
So many tanks have died from my heals being batched
---
Is there a way to filter out all the damn "Classic is such an untainted sanctuary. Oh what could it be? Tehe Tehe. I love it sooooooo much. Retail can't do ANYTHING Classic does. There's no bad people in Classic at all. No one is rushing anything! No one is grinding! Tehe. Look at me I'm not even level 10! Tehe! It feels like a world again! I love killing boars for meat in Classic but not Retail! Tehe!" bullshit?
---
Yea trust me I won’t be struggling to hold aggro cuz of DPS in phase 1 lol
---
You can get there by walking up the mountains I'm pretty sure.
---
Also people who cant speak English. My guild has a couple of people who straight up cant communicate properly.
---
The locks in that video by Xaryu were literal bots. If he would duel any half decent lock he would get destroyed immediately (and did in the duel tournament). Mages are not favored at all in the match up.
---
But I've read tons of reports of people contracting cancer after reading comments on websites such as YouTube!
---
YOU SHOULD TAKE A SHOWER EVERY HALF-HOUR!! /U/WEEZDAJUICE711 IS DISGUSTING WAITING UNTIL A FULL DAY
---
I can see the compromises there for a PvP spec.  OP is on a PvE server.
---
Gnome warrior is my favorite. Escape artist is the best ever for PvP. But humans weapon skill is unrivaled in raiding.
---
...the only zone with two flight paths and most only know of one of them! LOL
---
That's only true at fresh 60 levels. Eventually you have sufficient spell power that, that stat weight nearly halves.
---
The runecloth bag step is basically a bust because it is camped and a 20-30g pattern just for 5 levels of tailoring, just keep making runecloth belts or boots or something else.
---
Rattlegore represent. Definitely way more horde than alliance but not to the point where we completely overtake them.
---
Oh hell yeh.
---
On arthas server vanilla retail Titans went to 800 gold during aq and naxx.
---
There are around 20 serious raiding guilds on my classic server, maybe more. There was only 4 on arthas server.
---
You can’t be moving to use the instant cast when it procs... definitely not worth it
---
But I will agree we have bigger balls in raiding alliance cities
---
I can’t wait this st work, but no flurry or bloodthirst has me intrigued.
---
On a PVP server I would probably take sprint, but parry stops the attack and lowers your swing timer, I might go for that on PVE.
---
He could even be level 22 by phase 2 and have a whole 3 gold to his name
---
For being the smart race, gnomes sure are dumb.
---
[https://discord.gg/](https://discord.gg/)
---
That's the Incendius discord. Would be more likely to find help in there.
---
Take it from a 230 tailor, hording cloth is not nearly enough.  If you are leveling first aid, you don't have the cloth from just questing to go from 1-300 tailoring.  Around wool, the amount of cloth needed will require you to grind it specifically or buy it from other players.  I tried to keep up with my tailoring and never had cloth for my first aid in wool and in silk.  And that was with buying cloth from the AH.
---
Im trying to join a friend with the "Recruit a friend" system, any idea why is this not working?
---
We both searching the web but cant find anything
---
Um, dynamic respawns exist in the entire world my man. Each areas have different variables however.
---
When that happens to me I tab out and back in and it fixes it.
---
I would take lower levels (40-59) over someone who is already 60 with partial MC/Only gear. You don't want to inherit another guild's baggage such as loot whores who rage gquit after not getting a piece. Focus your recruitment on 40-59 and very, very recently dinged 60s. Start doing BRD, Strat, Dire Maul as guild activities to help folks get pre-raid bis. Make your loot system attractive (something other than LC). I look at fresh LC guilds with heavy skepticism right now given anyone who is hardcore is already in a guild with MC/Ony gear.
---
They're way too far into development of the next expansion. They're essentially largely locked in at this point, so any chance of change likely wouldn't occur until the subsequent expansion.  I'm really curious about what the numbers of active players in each version look like. I've logged in to both and Classic really does seem to have more active players than retail, but that could actually be due to how much larger Azeroth is in retail, flying mounts, etc.
---
A distinction I think should be made is that spellpower is superior for single target / raiding, however, int and stam are better for AOE farming. The amount of +SP you get from an item depends on the cast time so you get full for something like a fireball and nothing from a fire blast. You don't get much on blizzard so its better to have more mana/health since blizzard is so mana expensive.
---
Fair
---
Thanks just checked it :))
---
Literally in every world if you let them. I can outthreat every tank in a blink of an eye with rockbiter and earth shocks.
---
I was able to get a fishing bot removed from Grobbulous.
---
I have found another one...but it's just random enough that I can't make a case its not a person.
---
I’m pretty sure trees could barkskin, at least by 2.4.3
---
STARSHIP TROOPERS AND SILITHID
---
That's because it's from 2019.
---
If im going to be honest, you get into dungeons almost immediately because noone likes to play tank (assuming you are a tank). As a mage i have to wait i shit you not 45 mins to get a group together sometimes. + travel time.
---
I currently just lashed farm as disc spec. 50g an hour about, prob your best farm. Also quests aren't too bad for gold. As for professions you just want tailoring for truefaith vests then you can drop it. Xp grind I did a bunch of bird getting my pre raid bis. And lots of strat.
---
Nothing says challenger quite like this ui
---
Holy Priest here, been 60 for a few weeks. Went Tailor/Skinning for leveling. Dumped skinning for herbalism at max level. Nearly all skins were vendored other than Thick Leather oddly enough, and didn't see myself skin farming or being in the open world killing things enough to justify keeping it. Also, due to my gold farm method, herbalism made more sense. 
---
XP grind - I did a lot of BRD random groups in between questing, but still kept questing as the initial batch in the later zones, along with the general mob grinding required to finish those quests, resulted in a lot of XP with not a lot of dead time IMO. 
---
Gold - I am currently farming Dire Maul East lashers as my gold grind. It took me a bit to get all the mana I have now, and I supplemented it early on with mana pots and Int flasks. Beginning wasn't super economical but I was also learning how to do it so took it as 'training costs' . Have gotten two tomes to sell on the AH, also got the priest tome for myself instead of needing to buy it so that was nice. Herbalism allows each run to also pick the few nodes that pop up near the lashers, increasing the gold / hr. I do no raiding of any kind, all my gear is BRD/DM essentially with some Intellect greens sprinkled in to get the mana pool where I can use max rank Holy Nova for it. Rank 5 also works.
---
You need to put it in the stable and tame other animals. Then use those new pets until it says you've learned the skills they have. This will allow you to train your stabled pet.
---
Classic petopia will have all the information for what abilities and where to learn them
---
https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/
---
Ah yes another non statement ending in a lol. The final death call of a defeated noob. Where's the "bro" this time?
---
Still waiting on those logs "bro" you can DM them too me if you're too embarrassed to link them.
---
The one I described in practice should be a clean stun lock. And spell batching apparently is like 20ms or so in classic. When it was way more in vanilla.
---
To make money just get:
---
1. Skinning
---
2. Either mining or herbalism.
---
You can only search for ores or herbs on the minimap, but not both, hence why I recommend skinning.
---
Leveling both those as you level will yield some extra cash, and can be scrapped (if you want) later if you choose a production profession
---
Not when these same people get to control the market when black lotus is actualy needed. They hold all the power- the flowers will move high and fast or nobody will have a flask.
---
Damn you make a lot of assumptions. I’m in my 20s. Just chill
---
Got old my friend.
---
Agreed, just saying those dungeons suck.
---
This would be a great submission to /r/nocontext
---
bro it's a fucking massive amount of homework for such easy difficulty raids.
---
Just healed four bosses in MC, all one shot last night as a 31/20/0.  #3 in the heals with the second to lowest overheal in the raid.  And my gear isn't anything special - like +270 healing
---
I wish my groups had two caster dps.
---
The archivist (room opposite of the last boss) has a good drop rate. I could be wrong, but I think he has about 20%.
---
Sugi pl cu hoarda ta
---
Fair enough. Honestly I skipped leveling first aid on my priest but am kinda kicking myself now as it'd be handy to top up lifetapping locks.
---
I have some cast spell by name macros on my druid and hunter in classic.
---
Thats accurate af; wholesome ppl want their wholesome karma points
---
A casual player does not equal lack of raid knowledge. Maybe this time around, some players cant play more than a few hours a day.
---
Is there a working rare mob alert addon?
---
WoWhead has it at 52% Horde and 48% Alliance.
---
How dare you say that about my mother
---
I'd rather deny it then report them for it, if that even works.
---
Part of my problem is I have a wife and 3 kids, and a busy ass full-time job. I remember I used to be able to read up on encounters and stuff, but now I don't. Any spare time I have goes towards actually playing.
---
I’m on the one of the highest pop servers now and I was on a dead server back in actual vanilla and (outside of peak times) don’t notice a difference.  Peak times it is harder to find nodes, but imo the other benefits of high pop server are worth it.
---
Hahahaha gotemmm
---
Everytime i jump on a flight path i play a couple of rounds of smash bros. Ultimate on my switch. Honestly worth the console just for that
---
Ah the legendary wooden cloth, drops off the tree guys walking around feralas. Just keep killing you’ll find one eventually!
---
It's a guy.
---
57, 23, 22, 20, 19, 18, 17...I agree. Still haven't hit 60 and don't care. Basically just grinded from 55-57 on rest xp only to farm the mats for my Robe of the Void as a lock. Now that I have it, time for some more rest xp whoring, fishing and cooking as I prepare to start grinding dungeons for my pre-BiS.
---
I'd say 2 out of 3 days I log in, I kick it around on alts only for 2-3 hours and never log on my main.
---
I played during vanilla, started in beta and played heavily though MoP. My only real goal with classic is to have a 60 of every class. I'll do some pug raiding but definitely a different approach than the hardcore raider I was for 10+ years.
---
People do tend to get sick of having a 70-30 leveling experience when there is literally no way to win on a pvp server. People are going to opt into something more fun and fair, and then the Horde players will whine that they arent getting free wins anymore wondering where the alliance went.
---
&gt; I feel completely unimproved gouge is too short to be of THAT much use, maybe to bandage as you say if it's close. It takes like half of the gouge time just to tab target and get back to attacking the original target.
---
As long as you have Auto Self Cast turned on in your game options, you can Gouge and bandage without changing targets. With unimproved Gouge lasting 3.5 seconds, this should give you enough time to get 3 ticks worth of bandage heals before the mob interrupts you.
---
&gt; However, if you can stealth sap that's a pretty amazing crowd control option for dealing with two or even three enemies. Evasion is also quite good too.
---
If you go down the Combat tree while leveling, you can power through a lot of 1v2 and 1v3 encounters with cooldowns even without having a chance to Sap. Get Slice and Dice up and pop Blade Flurry, Adrenaline Rush and Evasion. Once those are up you still have Gouge and Blind to use in combat. Lots of tools in the toolbox.
---
the most annoying part is how he waited for everyone else to hit greed, then he needed it.  What a dickhead.
---
target a mob, type /cast mind control, and see if it works?

&gt;Calm your tits

Really emphasizing the personality of mages right now.
---
Also you're not exactly correct yourself.
---
Yeah it’s BiS for aesthetics maxxing. That’s also why I refuse to wear devilsaur crap. Stylish tanks gen more threat.
---
It's a very good tank weapon. Ludicrously fast weapon with a proc that gives
---
E V E N M O R E F A S T
---
Lol couldnt be more farmfrom the truth
---
Wrath, or rather the first wave of Titan’s Grip warriors definitely created a false sense of “skilled warriors”. As long as you were specs right and had whirlwind on your toolbar on cools down you were top DPS.
---
The only skill went into levelling that warrior
---
How to get raid tiles to go with class color?
---
I'll try tonight and see :)
---
OMG I just found where to assign them. I have been playing for 20 levels and only now did I find out how and where to assign them! Sigh!
---
Beam runs and all the Scholos for flasks dropped the prices on those robes. Not as many Strat Lives going on at least from what iv seen.
---
Sometimes if something should cost a little less than 5g on AH I'll sell it for 4g 20s and 69c. I know I'm a child but it's funny to me!
---
I'm glad you can appreciate the beauty of the place even if the mechanics don't work for you.
---
I'm awestruck several times a day and I've taken hundreds of photos and I can never tell if it's the nostalgia of returning to places I last saw at 15 years old. Nice to know ever a fresh set of eyes sees what I see.
---
Did you find the tide pools below the sea cliffa in Azshara? I think they are my favorite place in Azeroth.
---
Wonderful, thank you. 🙂
---
LMFAO. When you see that instant release you know he's salty.
---
Then don’t play feral dps, or join a super casual guild that’s only gonna do MC and Ony, maybe BWL. 
---
Some specs just aren’t supposed to be viable for raiding, there’s nothing wrong with that. Not every class SHOULD be viable for pve.
---
I don't think so, hp5 restore health points to the user wearing the item every 5 seconds.  It is mostly used by warlocks so they can life tap more often.
---
Thanks for the in depth reply. What lvl did you swap to a dedicated healer spec? Ever quest in that spec? And what level did you first attempt farming DM?
---
I've also got a journeyman's backpack out of one too.
---
IMO Riposte is fucking great for leveling.  It's a 10 mana backstab with a sword basically every 1-2 fights.
---
Also every piece of gear you get and lvl you gain feels like you earned it.
---
I'm 30, so I don't think I'm that old. Most the others in my guild are 25-35. I'm just well behind the curve.
---
Arcane Elixir increases "SPELL DAMAGE". Therefore only damage and no healing. There is no such thing as spell power in vanilla wow, so it should always say spell damage and healing, or one or the other.
---
5head
---
Lulz gl with that one.
---
Recruit a friend is not currently available. They deactivated it a few months ago and announced the rewards they will put in when they reactivate it - with no scheduled date.
---
I would guess that they will wait til the initial hype for classic dies down and release it when they need a boost in their sub numbers.

You could level your druid up to level 10 to learn the spell Teleport: Moonglade.
---
I don't think Lionheart gets replaced for threat unless your hit capped, then you might want to get Helm of Endless Rage or T2.5.

My sweet summer child
---
sorry my question whas badly written ,check the edit !
---
You're absolutely correct that nothing prevents any other loot system from doing the exact same and figuring out who gets loot is the exact reason loot systems exist.. I've not implied otherwise, my argument was that its simply not as *efficient* [as with LC] in the long term as you tend to look at the short term gains when using roll/dkp. But yes, you could just as well /roll and have class prios, and you'd achieve more or less the same thing in the short term. Do whatever you like if everyone is happy with it.
---
Where loot council excels is planning loot distribution in a long time frame and doing it *efficiently*. Loot councils tend to consider the loots far more extensively due to a council being a inherently unfair system. You try to mitigate that unfairness as much as possible by considering every angle and figuring out what is the most optimal way of getting use out of gear, and it means you _have_ to try to be as efficient and just as possible or your guild falls apart.
---
This gives you that edge over roll/dkp in a long period of time as roll/dkp simply don't allow you to make these decisions as well as LC does.
---
For example, with a DKP system the loot is given using this thought process:
---
&gt; *Okay, BIS item X is priced starting at Y dkp and all furys, rogues, hunters and ferals with over 60% attendance can bid on it. Biggest upgrade would be for persons A and B so they really really want it but person C has the most points. They bid for it and C wins because he has stacked points, that is that and no more discussion about it.*
---
You can't really start considering whom would get the biggest upgrade too much, or you start going against the dkp system and what it tries to accomplish. You might limit the bidding to a few persons only but that's about as far as you can affect the distribution or people will start getting mad. With a roll, its the exact same thought process but you'd also consider:
---
&gt; *A is a warrior and gets a 10% upgrade over his current epic item, B is a feral gets 25% upgrade over his current blue item, C is a rogue it'd be 3% upgrade over his current item. A and B get the most use so they both roll, someone wins and that's that.*
---
Now you're starting to consider for whom it'd be best but you can't really use that information to influence the distribution at all, you'd most likely just limit the rolls to a few persons, like with a dkp system. LC adds this layer to it:
---
&gt; *For A warrior, it'd be BIS until AQ40 . That is ~a year of use. For the feral, they'd replace it in BWL. That is ~3-4 months of use. For C rogue its a sidegrade that gets upgraded in BWL so ~3-4 months of use as well for the rogue. Even though both feral and warrior would deserve the item, it should be going to the warrior despite the warrior getting a smaller upgrade currently, as the warrior gets the most use out of it over a longer period of time. With LC you can also stack gear on certain classes that scale with gear better than others, without getting loot drama (again, as long as there is some trust between LC and raiders, and LC communicates the reasoning well).*
---
This is kinda how it goes with LC, excluding considering attendance/performance/prep for each player. If those are taken into account:
---
&gt; *A warrior has 90%, feral has 95% and rogue is at 50% attendance. All perform well and parse between 90-95% on most bosses. All players are prepared for all raids. Rogue gets eliminated from consideration due to low attendance. Feral and warrior are equal enough that they both deserve the item. As such, the reasoning above applies and warrior gets the item.*
---
&gt; *Now lets say warrior has 60% attendance instead of the previous 90%, the reasoning changes and feral would deserve the item the most. Now he'd only get use out of it for a few months, where as the warrior gets a year out of it. Then the consideration becomes much more difficult. Warrior should get the item because of the longer use but Feral has been here grinding through this shit every week. Hmm. We'd give it to the feral despite the warrior getting the most use out of it.*
---
What would you do in this situation, out of interest?
---
We also used dkp for a while on Lightbringer, and eventually started using auction dkp due to people gaming the previous dkp system. From there we eventually moved back to LC because it makes more sense for how we run our guild. We also use a +1 roll system in our guild pugs and have used soft reserves before as well. All systems are viable provided they work for your goals and are done well. Doing it well is the most important thing. For what we want to accomplish with our guild, which is to stick around, LC helps us reach our goal the best.
---
Additionally, we found that out of all 3 systems, with dkp we don't tend to do such planning *as extensively* as the loot system is inherently aimed at making shorter plans that try to distribute loot as evenly and justly as possible in a short term. We parsed much worse when using DKP due to not being able to stack certain classes with gear, like fury warriors. We could of course try to make longer term plans, but its rarely done as it kind of acts against the optimal use of that loot system and your raiders tend to start getting upset when you're trying to prevent them from bidding at things they really want. With a +1 roll system, you might use the same class prios as other systems but that's about it. If you try to limit the system more, its again working against the ideal use of +1 systems. This is the part where LC brings alot more longevity to your guild than the other systems do. They simply don't work towards that direction inherently, like LC does.
---
If you're unfamiliar with a +1 roll system, its basically:
---
* You have two rolls in a raid setting: either a "regular roll" or a "+1 roll", which is done before the normal roll and takes priority.
---
* Each raider can use a single +1 roll to roll for a piece of gear that they really really want. If they win, they're marked "+1" and can no longer use the priority +1 roll. 
---
* If nobody wants to use their +1, you do a normal roll.
---
* Some guilds reset the +1 stats at some boss, like at Nefa or raggy or where ever.
---
Because the rule is 1 action per click per account. /shrug

Thatgot a legitimate laugh out of me. Well done
---
The main way we have been recruiting people lately is just by being friendly to pugs when we need some pugs to fill out the raid.  2 weeks ago we had maybe 18-20 guildies ready to raid so we pugged the rest.  We invited them all back for the ony, and then the next week's MC.  They were getting loot, we were clearing, so after a week or 2 probably a good 8-10 of the pugs joined the guild.  As an officer I keep stressing to the other officers to be extra nice to the people we have to pug, cause its our reputation and hey they may actually join.  A pug ends up winning the mageblade over the guildies, and low and behold after the raid he joins the guild because we're killing stuff, he's getting loot, and we're fair.  
---
We're starting to approach the point of pushing 40 guildies to raid with and still have more leveling and are only recruiting locks/rogues mainly.  The best way to see how a new group of people are, just hop on disc and mute yourself if you don't like talking, but its good to be in disc to hear how we communicate, how we decide things, how we make fun of each other, etc..  As an officer I remember the people that run dungeons often and are on disc often even if they don't talk.  I don't remember the people who only show up for raid and thats it, i'll often inspect people thinking they're new, but they've raided 2 or 3 weeks but i've never seen them outside of raid.  
---
We're probably a week or 2 from starting the actual loot council, have only done with the ony heads reserved at this point.  If you see a loot council making fishy decisions and they are not open to feedback at all, better to just leave.  I'm sure we will make a mistake but we are very open to feedback and have spreadsheets tracking whos getting loot, whos showing up, and all that fun stuff.
---
Thanks, it worked =)
---
Where’d u get those boots babe I absolutely MUST have them 😍💁🏼‍♂️
---
Hunter is currently 3rd best DPS class, outperforming warlock and mage. Competent feral can easily outDPS all casters too. Yet you still claim they\`re "meme".
---
I'll put the tl;dr first: It's entirely possible for good people who suck at raiding to learn to be good raiders if they keep at it long enough. I have never seen a pack of assholes who are great at raiding learn to not be assholes. So if you want a guild that is full of good people and also good at raiding, and if you can't find a guild that is both, maybe let that guide you on where you want to compromise.
---
That said, I read the OP, and I don't see how it relates to your subject line. Your subject line asks where you can find a "socially awesome guild." Your OP is all about how you cycled through a series of wannabe pro gamer "raiding guilds," because you wanted a guild with "like minded" people who were going to level fast and push content aggressively, and you were disappointed when those guilds were full of toxic assholes and loot drama. But it doesn't seem like you actually have looked for "socially awesome" guilds, so I'm not surprised you haven't found any. 
---
If what you want above all is a guild full of people who like and are nice to each other and like playing together, and do that regularly without drama, then you should start by looking for guilds that advertise that they have that sort of atmosphere, that say friendliness and community is their priority, and then talk to them for a while or try them out to see if they live up to their pitch. You may have to compromise and take a chance on a social guild that is not raiding regularly yet, and may not be for a while. But if they have a strong feeling of community and enough players who are sticking with the game, then they can get there eventually, and inevitably they likely will, if they make any sort of organized effort and keep at it.
---
If what you want above all is a guild that is going to reliably push content in all phases of the game, then by now it is obvious which ones are doing that. Everyone knows what guilds on each realm are clearing the content weekly with ease and gearing their teams up to be ready for future phases. You won't know until you spend some time with them if these guilds that are good at raiding also are drama free. Some are. Many are not. You can either find one with a level of drama you can tolerate and then put up with it to get the progression you want, or keep looking until you find a well progressed guild with no drama at all. It might take a while.
---
Maybe you can find the unicorn of a huge socially awesome guild that also is super pro at raiding and drama free. I'm sure there are some out there. They're also not going to be openly recruiting (since they're already full), and, when they are recruiting, damn hard to get into since they're overrun with people who want to join and by definition extremely selective about who they let in. So, maybe at some point you will find them, only to find that they don't want you (or anyone else) to join up any time soon.
---
In the meantime, if you can only get one thing you want, just decide which you want more and look for guilds that do that.
---
Can I ask why? My only familiarity with Timbermaw Hold rep is the ability go through the tunnel to Winterspring.

Earthfury is super even spread community if you're looking for balanced wPVP

Is there a good guide out for leveling priest both solo leveling but also capable of healing dungeons?
---
1. There's no "Deadline" where you need to complete X before the next patch before it's invalidated.
---
2. There's no time gate, you go at your own pace.
---
3. Because it takes effort, the rewards feel earned not given.
---
4. Because the rewards aren't handed out like candy, each upgrade feels special.
---
For shades in Scholomance that spawn from the occultist, is there anything a rogue can do to damage them? Holy water doesn't work? Poisons don't work.

Any suggestions would be helpful.

How did you get the Enemy Cast bar? Seeing the dwarf cast Resurrection... is that available in game?
---
shut your mouth. you didn't play early wow as evidenced by your use of the boomer meme as an attack against a mid 20 year old. not to take anything away from you, that made me laugh, but also kinda proves that you are too young to have played vanilla/TBC. in other words, you are lying.
---
you play a pink haired gnome, fact. you complain on blizz forums when you see someone with better gear than you, also fact. you probably think that the ally/horde divide is stupid and want it gone in the next exp, again, pure facts. you are a noob and i would beat your ass in a duel ez pz.
---
Guild I'm in doesn't recruit outside of dungeon runs really. We all met because we ran multiple Strats/Scholos together, some even way before like Mara/SM. We've never once advertised and have a full MC/Ony raid group and plenty leveling up to join us.
---
Gnome is life
---
Here is what I think is the most efficient profession route for a brand new mage with no support. Keep In mind if you intend to play through Naxx this is the optimal profession progression, and you can ignore any part of this, none of it is "necessary". 
---
Start with Skinning/Mining/first aid. 
---
The goal of Skinning is to make a small amount of free gold while farming beasts.
---
The goal of Mining is to farm enough mats to "double level engineering" in the future 
---
The goal of first aid is to convert your cloth into bandages that you can vendor for increased profit. 
---
When all of these are maxed (and you're level 60) make sure you have all the leathers you need to level tailoring once and engineering twice. Then unlearn skinning and farm low level dungeons to level tailoring (you can sell these low level runs to alts for like a gold or two per run). Just tell them you want the cloth. Max once you max tailoring craft robes of the archmage and unlearn tailoring. 
---
Then level Gnomish engineering and craft all the BoP items. 
---
Once you have the BoP items unlearn it and level goblin engineering. Once you have all the mats for all the engineering items you will need to craft, unlearn mining and get herbalism. 
---
You'll stick with herbalism until phase 4 when ZG comes out and you will have 300 tailoring until you no longer are using the 3 piece set bonus of bloodvine. Then drop tailoring for herbalism again. 
---
This is optimal profession management throughout the entire lifespan of Classic. Use this as a guide to decide what you want to do yourself.
---
Mages assuming you’re counting farming as looking for your pre-bis.

I made a rogue to pickpocket BRD with later on, so why is this macro using stop attack and stuff? Wouldn’t you just be able to walk up in stealth and pick pocket? What’s the purpose of all the extra lines in the macro?
---
I honestly feel like spy is kind of bullshit and shouldn't be allowed as it kinda breaks PVP. It is just a lesser version of having walls for a FPS imo.
---
Just follow one of the shadow or disc print guides. Shadow can heal quite well.

People underestimate the effect getting old has on your muscle memory &amp; ability to make quick decisions. It's why you never see old people winning any esports tourneys for fast paced pvp games ... only slow, turn based games.

Some icons in the action bar, like my pet abilities, have an animated yellow selection box around them. I assume this means something like, this is automatically activated/done at certain times?

Horde or Alliance?

Never said it was.
---
Servers were capped back in the day at 3k from what I remember a blue post saying. 
---
30k unique characters in the past 14 days on Skeram for the data aquired.
---
I'm not arguing any points just linking data.
---
Lionheart will be bis for all of the expansion for threat, even if you get hit capped. Of course, once you get hit capped though you'll want other items like Helm of Endless Rage or T2.5 for more mitigation since they offer agility/stam/strength. Still, it's always worth to have lionheart in your pure threat set.
---
I love how everyone immediately turned around to run
---
Not sure. I honestly struggle to understand how raids exist that can't clear all of MC short of them not being able to fill out the raid slots.
---
Like if you cannot clear MC, they're never ever going to clear BWL onwards. 
---
So it's going to be a unicorn to find a guild that is legitimately progressing through BWL/AQ (progressing, not just repeatedly wiping and making zero progress week over week) but not have it on farm status, or on farm status minus 1-2 bosses.
---
What'd you say about my mother?
---
Nice!

He doesn't want longer progression, he wants the *brand new* experience. Did you even read his post? How are you this lost? Lol

Sooner or later youll end up saving enough gold.

Dude, it’s fine. Enjoy playing your human

Human best for pve dps, gnome is probably best for pvp due to the passive which is HUGE for warriors

Lmao that and long flight paths are my most productive times of the day.
---
How does pet respeccing scale? Same as Talent respeccing, but divided by 10?
---
Its a well kept secret that you get more experience by stringing combos between kills with 360 front flips.
---
Rogues gain more than 24 ap and 1% crit from DFT.
---
In order to max ur xp on the alt getting boosted by the mage make sure u have a healer for the mage and the most imoportant part is make sure ur alt is second highest leveled after the mage that is that will make it so he gets the most xp from each mob also stick to deadmines until 19-20 id say but not sure tbh maybe it works this early in stockades
---
I said the stat priorities are different.  Even if some pvp gear is bis for mages, the hit cap changes require you to change pieces, or at least you should.  If you want to pretend it's the same, go nuts.  You'll be leaving damage on the table if you do.
---
&gt;and guess who was 4/8 Nightlsayer with 2/2 Bloodfang , with Gutgore Ripper at the end of the raid week ? Ofc the Rogue classlead.
---
Why would you scatter tier pieces across several players intead of stacking them all on one player? To make you feel good, or?
---
Level up to 10 and get the free port to Moonglade.
---
Or scream?
---
2% hit on whites &lt; 24 AP and 1% crit for a rogue.
---
This is not really debatable.
---
&gt; Why would I want a loot system where all of the casters are gonna hoard DKP and pass on everything for the chance that a Mageblade will drop?
---
You don't have to want that. You do you and I do me. I didn't think my comments would be perceived as arguing that either loot system is superior.
---
&gt; Your strategy is wrong.
---
But at least, you do acknowledge that there's more than one. Progress.
---
&gt; Prophecy also sucks so you are wasting DKP.
---
Like I said, at least 3 pieces are BiS until Phase 2, so much for progress, we're back to you ignoring the relevant parts of my comment...
---
&gt; 5/8 of the prophecy set sucks, more than half of it sucks, meaning that the set sucks. Dungeon blues are better than most of the pieces.
---
Well yeah, that's why you don't get the entire set. And also why saying the entire set sucks is stupid if you acknowledge that 3 pieces of it don't suck.
---
&gt; Its pretty clear you have never been in a guild with loot council.
---
Yes, I've stated that fact earlier. I'm not sure why you're bringing it up.
---
&gt; I've played with one of the major spreadsheet guys for a class and he was complete dogshit at playing it.
---
You realize that playing healer is pretty much just making sure you don't go OOM before the boss is dead and making sure people stay alive, right? It's rather hard to suck at playing it, unless someone ignores downranking completely.
---
&gt; Also I highly doubt any of that is true based on your loot comments.
---
Assuming that my "loot comments" were wrong, didn't you just say that you played with a major spreadsheet guy who was complete dogshit at playing Priest, so why would you assume I'm bad at playing Priest because you disagree with parts of my comment you choose to misunderstand, if you admit that being good at theorycrafting is irrelevant to playing a class right? You're not making sense.
---
&gt; Have fun with your shitty DKP system.
---
I will. Have fun being a keyboard warrior who insults people over the way they decide to play video games, if that makes you feel better about yourself.
---
I picked it up on a mage, levelled it to like 200 and didn’t find the payoff to be that great vs. How much time/resources I put into it. The +spirit goggles were cool though.
---
Reeeeally hated not having the bag space with all the shit I needed to carry around... filling up my bag slots and action bars with stuff I hardly used... running back and forth from two sides of org for the anvil/bank... ughhh. There’s probably way more efficient ways of doing it, I know, but I just don’t want to worry about engineering for now. Maybe I’ll pick it up once I’m 60 and looking to pvp.
---
Ohhh ive heard the term powershifting but never really understood it until your comment! I think youre saying that with the furor talent you can essentially be in bear form, instantly cancelform and back to bear for free rage right?
---
It all makes sense now! So maybe i do just need to have cancelform be its own button then
---
I will check it out thank you!
---
Layering has 0 impact on fish production due to how pools work (or don't work I guess you could say). I highly doubt pvp consumables are going to pick up enough in P2, P3 maybe. Worth noting I'm not on a hyper competitive server, I'm on one that was spun up 12 hours after launch.
---
But really the biggest problem: Prices going up is just going to increase the number of botters doing it. It'll never be worth peanuts compared to any other activity for a player.
---
How does DM devalue mushrooms?
---
I like it. Might use it on a setup for a non-raid character.

Wrong wrong and wrong

For real. Looks like a PC RPG ported to console with a horrible UI.
---
Sense of community can be gained from successful clears and wpvp.  Wiping sucks and saying you want to be a part of it makes zero sense.
---
I really struggled with my keybinds. Finally found a system that works for me.
---
1-9 on my mouse with Shift, Ctrl and Alt keybinds for a total of 36 keybinds. These are all multiple ranks of spells or one bind with multiple consumables.
---
Mouse wheel up and down with shift and Ctrl modifiers are things like mount, quick need PvP totems like tremor, grounding and poison cleanse and ghost wolf
---
F1-F4 are weapon imbues
---
Q, E and R are purge, disease and poison cleanse
---
Now totems. Oh boy.
---
I use Z, X, C and V with shift, Ctrl and Alt modifiers for a total of 16 keybinds for totems. All Z totems are earth, all X totems are fire, all C totems are air, and all V totems are water. Bit of a learning curve but really intuitive after a while.
---
I’m pooping right now!
---
Awww, Bitch

You’d be surprised how good you can get this game to look with some ReShade filters or Nvidia freestyle filters, specifically ones that help with sharpening and detail clarity ...

I play a 24/0/27 moonglow spec, but have tried out HOTW/NS a bit. Tranquil spirit is pretty much a must have if ypu wanna do some healing. Natures focus is a pretty terrible talent. You only need it when the tank fucks up, and you cant solve it with either/or using rejuvs, using natures swiftness or using barkskin, and still managing to not whipe. 20 % extra less physical damage taken and no pushback to spells is well worth the 1 sec extra cast time. 
---
I never put any points in naturesocus, my extra point from row 3 goes into imp enrage, even as in moonglow spec.
---
To be fair, I don't think most people spend 10 hours purely farming. You probably play way more then most people to afford all of that.
---
Are you forgetting the 56 ap?
---
Auto dismount is becoming one of my favorite addons next to questie.
---
Ok, but without the rest of the group the rogue wouldn’t get to kill the bosses in the dungeon, and in most cases wouldn’t be able to clear the mobs around the chest either. Other people may feel differently but I would certainly kick a rogue for behaving like that. If he wants all the chest loot he can go do some solo runs.
---
does the helm activate a buff of some kind? maybe you have a addon like smart buff triggering it?
---
Was the blue pvp set ever confirmed to be in phase 2? I heard they weren't going to add them until way later (phase 5 or 6). The blue pvp set is pretty strong for some classes this early on so I'm curious.
---
With your logic, why can’t the person who “needs” the BoE just play the AH and buy the item? BoE’s=gold everyone should roll need unless they feel they have enough gold.
---
sure, saying that less will know the mechanics may be wrong wording there.
---
your margins for error are just objectively smaller when your casual guild is consuming less and bringing a less optimized group to the table, and the progression in a casual guild that is basically raiding on hard mode by not min/maxing as hard as a more intense guild is could feel more exhilerating for someone with OP's mindset

It's good, you just have to wait until your auto attack hits before charging it so you don't waste a swing. Also it behaves like a cast and damage interrupts the casting so you can't really use it if you are getting hit too often.
---
yes

In my personal opinion having both dagger and swords is the best way. Just swap between the two as your cooldowns replenish.

Except classic has been alive and well since release in various forms, whether through pservers or through classic which is currently more popular and set to totally eclipse retail once the next exp flops.
---
It will be even funnier once the TBC servers are released and those are also more popular than retail.
---
You go ahead and enjoy your mechagnomes and pandas though 🤣🤣🤣 clown
---
What are you farming for?
---
I firmly believe the 1-10 zones are the most fun to level in. Except maybe durotar... lot of running in that one
---
“looking For group” they want to join a group
---
3. When I’m looking for DPS items, I advertise as DPS and vice versa. If I’m asked to heal even though I advertised as DPS I’ll ask at the start to roll for DPS items. In either case if it’s a BOP that only I can use and that’s off-spec for my instance role I’ll ask to need and no one has ever said no.
---
For pve, yes but for pvp they are not that good compare to dwarf or gnome
---
Tukui does an awesome job of that!
---
Ah yea, that's probably why I don't find myself practicing engineering in TB. Good point!
---
There isnt a one size fits all answer for every scenario and class.
---
And someone else tags it while you build a sap train haha
---
Just fish them up, way less stress and competition, and much higher drop rate.
---
If I'm saying LFG, I'm looking for someone else to invite me to a group they're leading.
---
If I'm saying LFM, I'm looking to build a group.
---
Ah I didn't realize the BS trainer in TB wasn't equivalent to what's available in Org.
---
I think most but not all who say lfg are looking to build a group if there isn't one already forming.
---
I made freaking bank with alterac swiss cheese for the cooking quest. I could easily sell them for 500-700% vendor price.
---
The 56 AP was ignored as it is provided to both the warrior and the rogue.
---
Poop rags in all your laundry is lol. But do you
---
How much hit rating should a lvl60 use for fighting enemies below 60. I know you need 9% for lvl63 bosses. 5% for lvl60 enemies/players. What about lvl55-59 or for enemies that are much lower. Is hit even necessary? For example, I’m farming Mara with 5% hit and I feel like I can go even lower.
---
Plenty of 30s winning esports, just not in the kid titles.
---
What I know for sure is that they have enchanting formulae.  The have other patterns too, not sure if it's blacksmithing, leatherworking, or both.
---
Why is it nearly impossible to kill orange (+2 lvls) enemies as a caster? They literally resist 80%+ of my spells... Is this intended? Is there a enemy resist percentage reference for this shit ass mechanic? Thought Red enemies should resist that much, not orange...
---
&gt;You don't have to want that. You do you and I do me. I didn't think my comments would be perceived as arguing that either loot system is superior. Just because I like something better doesn't mean or imply I want everyone else to agree with me.
---
Too bad, thats what you want.
---
&gt;But at least, you do acknowledge that there's more than one strategy. Progress.
---
No, yours is wrong. You might as well be gearing Str as a priest.
---
&gt;Well yeah, that's why you don't get the entire set. And also why saying the entire set sucks is stupid if you acknowledge that 3 pieces of it don't suck. For that matter, there are a couple more that are 2nd or 3rd BiS, which I wouldn't consider as sucking, but let's just ignore that, right?
---
Yeah, the set sucks. Thats basic math. Are you incapable of basic math? 
---
&gt;Yes, I've stated that fact earlier. I'm not sure why you're bringing it up. However, I'm beginning to see why someone with your limitations would appreciate other people telling him what gear he's allowed to use.
---
Thats why you should shut up on stuff you are completely wrong about.
---
&gt;You realize that playing healer is pretty much just making sure you don't go OOM before the boss is dead and making sure people stay alive, right? It's rather hard to suck at playing it, unless someone ignores downranking completely.
---
Ah, so you are also dogshit.
---
&gt;Assuming that my "loot comments" were wrong, didn't you just say that you played with a major spreadsheet guy who was complete dogshit at playing Priest, so why would you assume I'm bad at playing Priest because you disagree with parts of my comment you choose to misunderstand, if you admit that being good at theorycrafting is irrelevant to playing a class right? You're not making sense.
---
Well you are wrong about loot, you are wrong about loot systems, you are wrong about healing/priest. Pretty sure you are dogshit.
---
&gt;I will. Have fun being a keyboard warrior who insults people over the way they decide to play video games, if that makes you feel better about yourself.
---
Have fun being trash
---
Want to make sure I'm doing Princess runs "correctly".  Zone in with Sceptre.  Kill bosses in this order -&gt; Landslide, Princess, Rotgrip, Tinker.  Then take off gear and suicide.  Run into Purple.  Repeat.  
---
Is this how other people do it?  
---
Do you skip bosses that no one cares about or do them for vendor loot?
---
Kargoz' Guide is really good. The holy build is better than shadow pre 40.
---
No. You wear plate. Leatherworking creates leather and mail at endgame. It's pointless for you. I know Devilsaur gear is hot, but it's not worth investing in an otherwise completely worthless profession for you. Just buy them.
---
If you want a profession, go for mining/blacksmithing or herbalism/alchemy.
---
I would but I just spent all my gold on the Flask of Supreme Power recipe for my guild. lol
---
Astounding how that LFG adorns was banned and yet this hasn’t been. 
---
Its an addon that instantly turns you from some clueless adventurer wandering the dangerous world into some battle-bot that can scan and assess any threat within a certain distance, stealthed or not, and let them decide for themselves what to do. 
---
The point of stealth isn’t just to be invisible, to for the enemy to be unaware of your presence, an addon that reveals that you’re there is bullshit
---
Please justify why you feel this addon is somehow not essentially just cheating? Because how I see it is imagine you and I are participating in an Easter egg hunt. In each egg there is money ranging from $1-$100. We both start at the same time and are even in every concevable aspect possible except for one. I have a device that alerts me to the presence of eggs in my vacinity as well as the contents of those eggs (how much money inside what egg) while you have nothing but your eyes. Please explain how it is fair that I have that advantage while you're left with nothing but your own senses?
---
dual wield has a lot higher hitcap than a 1h + shield
---
He knows what he is doing.
---
Join PvP guilds. They still raid, but don't get as worked up about it, and it forms a good sense of bonding when you are out "red is dead"-ing everything you see as a group.
---
Edgemasters is still great for dagger tanks and you'll need to buy them anyway for when you inevitably get Tfury. Alcorz Sunrazor is a great boe option that doesn't take weapons away from your dps.
---
Yeah it definitely works
---
And the great lloking mount :)
---
I have a feeling you’re mistaking correlation with causation. Competitive gaming is a terribad way to make a living and burnout is rampant. Those are two far more likely causes than reflexes declining. 30+ year olds are smarter than teens and 20-somethings and generally understand how bad gaming is as a career. Someday, that may change when the money gets bigger, but the amount of grind needed for the minuscule chance at getting paid is absolutely absurd. Games get boring, people move on, regular 8-5s are far more stable if you’re trying to start a family, etc.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroplasticity
---
&gt;Neuroplasticity, also known as brain plasticity, neuroelasticity, or neural plasticity, is the ability of the brain to change continuously throughout an individual's life, e.g., brain activity associated with a given function can be transferred to a different location, the proportion of grey matter can change, and synapses may strengthen or weaken over time. The aim of neuroplasticity is to optimize the neural networks during phylogenesis, ontogeny, and physiological learning, as well as after a brain injury.[1] Research in the latter half of the 20th century showed that many aspects of the brain can be altered (or are "plastic") even through adulthood.[2][3][4][5] **However, the developing brain exhibits a higher degree of plasticity than the adult brain**
---
And this is why classic raiding was "hard"
---
Hahaha! NEVER! I make them a project and make them run back and back and back and back and back until they've been doing so for nearly two hours.
---
I'm just chilling there, stabby-stab, and wait for them to rez, while I eat noodles and watch Frasier. It's legit my ideal WoW day.
---
i said "if i was online at 05:00" learn to read please.
---
Rogue mage in 2v2
---
How can you do Netflix picture in picture with wow? Been trying to figure this out
---
Yeah, that won't work while leveling because you have basically 0 intellect on your gear.
---
Just 2 shot them while they're drinking with Ravage -&gt; Ferocious Bite instead.
---
Fellow Arthas native, were you ally or horde?
---
It's not the White House fence. It's just a random fence outside the 2016 DNC.
---
Anyone who is saying "its all cleared and joining now is worthless" probably haven't been outside in weeks.  You're doing fine if not a little slow. My group of evening/weekend warriors are all hitting 60 or 55+ around now.
---
For reference to others it is at 7:38 in this video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_CLytIpJniY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CLytIpJniY)
---
Lmao then we've shared a lot of similar experiences.
---
Shadowburn can easily hit for half of most players' hp if it crits. Not a novelty.
---
If you want to skip the suicide, get a friend to invite you and your alt into the group. Have friend leave. When you're done with the run, log onto alt, wait 2 minutes till lead is passed, then reset all instances from your alt. Log back to your main and you'll be back at the beginning of the instance.
---
Just dont flask if you arent MT. This is such a pserver thing that everybody and their mom expects to flask for lucifron and friends.
---
Yeah, that isn't toxic, it is realistic to self reflect after having continued bad experiences.
---
it is bullshit
---
Some spell batching is important to provide some of the common but fun interactions in WoWclassic in particular in pvp.
---
400ms is AN ETERNITY though. It really should be somewhere down around 100-150 MAYBE 200. Giving a big enough window that those interactions occur, without basically making several abilities useless.
---
Kick right now is often useless even in classic you could kick towards the end of a spell to prevent the cast. Now if it is a 1.5 second cast, you need to kick 50% of the way through it to ensure that it actually interrupts.
---
It also makes solo/duoing content much harder. 2 man jump runs in DM where you interrupt sacrifice means you have to get the sacrifice EXTREMELY quickly otherwise it goes through. Some people actually questioned whether they made sacrifice uninterruptible, when actually it is just spell batching, you literally need to react immediately to get the interrupt.
---
There is a balance to it, right now it is DEFINITELY out of balance. But I do think it should be a part of classic wow, because of the pvp interactions it allows.
---
What? No they haven't.
---
This idea of burnout only really comes from retail WoW, where you actually burn yourself out doing shitty content that nobody should ever do a thousand times in their life in the span of a single month. I experienced it multiple times in my time doing mythic raiding.
---
In classic, the people who grinded hard, hit max level, and are geared enough to start raid logging have mostly started their alts now, and are doing it all again. The hardcore crowd doesn't "finish" the game and say "yay I'm done," we stick around and keep going because we love WoW.
---
It's 17% on an enemy 3 levels higher... which is ridiculous considering I missed over 50% of my attacks on 5 enemies.
---
Time yourself, your goal is to kill Princess 5 times per hour with no down time. You probably don't need to be killing all 4 bosses, at least not every run. Lock in my guild was doing landslide -&gt; princess, and then killing rotgut only 2/5 runs to get himself to an hour.
---
sent you a msg, look up the discord fight club
---
warriors are objectively the best dps in classic by far, and you can say this about literally every other dps spec in the game, so that's not really a fair comparison. imo, a fair comparison is with hunters, the pure-dps class with the lowest dps. if a hybrid class can do hunter dps, then they're completely fine, because hunters are brought all the time even when the raid already has enough hunters for the fights.
---
went 13 resets in a row last week without one. Finished my farm with 12 of them and put iron counterweights on all of them. Sadly the item is too low level to apply elemental sharpening stones as well :(
---
Depends on what you’re looking for.
---
The big answer is if you’d just rather work for the public than the private sector.
---
It’s not a bad place to start if you want to make sure you have a paid internship.  Plus, some companies really like seeing you if you apply having former government experience and a government clearance.  Even the lowest level clearance costs a company thousands, so them hiring you later could save them the initial investment.
---
If you want to work for the government at some point, but want to focus on cash, many people build up government tenure while they’re young and then bounce between government contracting companies and the government itself.  This allows them to negotiate their own pay with each job hop which can add up nicely.
---
If you’re into job security, the government tends to be more secure.  I’ve seen many people in both contracting companies and other private sector companies who are “promised” certain lengths of uninterrupted work.  I’ve learned to be cynical of such promises.
---
If you’re still a student, I assume you don’t need the family insurance benefits or the holidays/time-off bonuses, but those are also there.  I tend to have more days off (holidays and vacation time) than many of my private sector friends.  Plus, the insurance is nice and occasional federal/military discounts at stores/restaurants are kinda sweet.
---
In the end, as a student, the only reason I’d recommend getting into the government at your age is to secure a spot in the government for your future - if you want one.
---
The government prioritizes hiring current feds and former feds who have tenure.  This makes it difficult for people later in life to get hired if they aren’t already in the system.  Federal internship programs have no such preference and are therefore a really secure &amp; easy way to get in as a student.
---
If you want to go into the military at some point, I’d recommend doing that first.  First of all, the military helps with schooling.  Also, the federal government has a veterans preference system in place that prioritizes hiring former military.  The veterans preference trumps the hiring preference I mentioned in the last paragraph, so the military effectively becomes your “internship.”
---
Why don't you try and use the AH for the Silk? Unless your servers Silk prices are low.
---
What kind of radio station plays that song?
---
the wingclip snare didnt work for me when i did it, neither did he ever use his fear
---
still the most difficult  one by far
---
It should be, but it won’t. In the beta we begged them to reduce the spell batching window just slightly but to no avail. So there’s 0% chance they’re gonna do it at this point in the game when most people are used to spell batching.
---
Yeah, there's a bit of a hole there too, but it's not nearly as bad based on, ya know, counting numbers and realizing one is much bigger. 
---
But the point is you're not gonna get enough junk boxes and lock boxes to not need to grind out about 20-30 points on world stuff when 175s start going green, the math just doesn't work out that way and any rogue that isn't half remembering shit from years ago knows this.
---
He probably whispered him with his class/role instead of just inviting him
---
There is no Timbermaw Hold mount.
---
I was in a guild that did just that when the game was released... Created some 30 rank 14s before it was all over. Gear is a factor and the hardest teams we faced were often teir 2+.. but coordinated teams will still win.
---
We are already handing out DKP for gold. 40 gold, 40DKP.
---
If you knew what half those words meant you wouldn't of looked like a moron posting me a wiki link. The brain is a muscle. If someone gamed every day from their teens into their 30s they would still gain strength in reflex and response time. 
---
Thing is, many of us in our 20s gamed less due to RL priorities so a lot of skill was lost. It applies to anything. Age only matters because the higher the age the less hardcore someone can be at games. 
---
I'll wait for your google search.
---
Why the hell aren't you using pummeler?
---
Death ray probably wont work since it is physical damage.
---
&gt;  Levitate? Important spells but not ones I need reflexively.
---
Unless you're falling to your death, then you need it really quick.
---
I bet he has the only Thread on the AH and priced it at 5-10G in the hopes someone who doesn't know will buy it and try to turn around and sell him the mats.
---
Quests being linked to the economy is so true, and something I hadn't considered. A LOT of them require that in some form.
---
Because here on r/classicwow we have to continually reinforce the "retail bad, classic good" mentality or we'll lose karma points.
---
More botters doesn't mean increased production. Production is going to either shrink (layering) or stay the same (blizz decreasing respawns like they have with devilsaur). Demand will go up. 
---
I dunno how else I can put it.
---
No one needs to downrank all spells. You might have 5 action bars full if you include consumables and shit. But if you as a mage have 5 actionbars full, other classes have 6-7 or 8. I have 8 action bars active as a druid including consumables
---
So you're just going to resort to insults when you're wrong. OK, reported.
---
Back when Stormwind was only viewable in PowerPoint format
---
Ungoro and then searing gorge are great for 49-53.
---
Flask of the Titans is available
---
Yikes.
---
Also - &lt;I Like Big Buffs&gt;, Horde, Netherwind is doing the same.
---
Lol, I ran away from an alliance group on this samespot using water walking.
---
: ^  )
---
I used to work a job with a private office with only me in it.  No windows, unmarked door.  No one ever bothered me.  It was great.  I used a flash drive w/ the 1.12 client to play a lot of private servers when work was slow.  I got moved to much more public office now though, RIP
---
Time invested + experience = skill for the most part. You just need to practice and hone your abilities. You should just focus on one thing at a time, then move to the next. You have to work at it. You are not going to instantly be as quick to react as you used to be 7-8 years ago.
---
That's literally nothing at all compared to people running UBRS for Dal'Rends 100 times.  It takes less than an hour a day.
---
It was way ahead of its time
---
I think he is running a scam banking off the fact someone will go to the AH and buy the cloth and then an exorbitantly priced thread (cause it is easy to be the only person selling thread on the AH)... once someone buys the thread he will likely do a /ignore on that person and keep advertising.
---
...casts roots on a mage. Good call.
---
People say there's a version of SilverDragon that works with classic.
---
I don’t know what I’m doing
---
And then you still don't have a taunt, which means you're going to get yelled at by garbage dps who will never let you spend the 20 seconds you'd need to start holding threat.
---
It's the same issue Paladins have, and Paladins have *significant* advantages over Shamans when it comes to tanks. At the end of the day, it is incredibly hard to hold threat, because you have to way to quickly work with bad dps players.
---
Could you blame them lol. I've tank in classic and I admit I'm not the best tank but the majority of the wipes were out of my control. I've read on fights, I spend time navigating dungeons, I try to equip appropriate gear. Yet I'm a bad tank and getting yelled at when my taunt resisted twice and my mocking blow missed.
---
Death ray is physical damage, won't work
---
Older people remain better at strategy, but can no longer compete mechanically. That's why i specified high pace PvP games with quick twitch reactions at the center of the game.
---
You might just be having some really horrible RNG? Do you have any talents that increase spell hit %?
---
I soloed an orange 32 elite last night for a quest on my 29 lock and I was only resisted ~33% of the time. I realize that is nothing more than anecdotal but I've never noticed the majority of my spells being resisted by at that level discrepancy.
---
TOooOoOoOooo be Faiaiaiaiaiiiiiirrrrr
---
If you are on thalnos I will shaman tank for you and make sure you get all your fucking gear. 
---
This minmax meta bullshit needs to slow down a notch. And healers being shafted is definitely not cool. 
---
Every time my priest friend says "hey I need this" weve gone out of our way for it. If it didnt drop, we'd try again. 
---
Your healer being geared means you get to do more stupid stuff and survive through it...
---
Does this work? I’ve feigned death and had party members and mobs run right over me, watched them die next to me and then watched the mobs return to their patrol points. Maybe if there’s no AoE? I always hope they haven’t released at the point I sit up and eat/drink next to their body.
---
Depends on context.
---
... Well, you sound like an awfully pleasant person to group with.
---
Na just 2
---
Impale prot is like a 1.8% threat increase at 40% crit. It's not at all worth the talent point investment.
---
The demand is much higher than 3x. Very few people used a flask back in Vanilla.
---
This has been my exact experience as well. I'm a bear main and have MT'd all of MC without breaking a sweat. I can pull solid cat DPS if needed or if we have 3 tanks and/or if I want a break. Consumables play a big part in its success, but it's by no means impossible.
---
The community has also matured from the old days of Vanilla where Feral Druids were considered a joke. Any spec in capable hands will do just fine.
---
He was doing fine, probably exceptional actually given his level.  One of the smoothest runs I've had.
---
And you can mend them real quick if they do take any damage.
---
This is for sure the best way. Alternatively you can just not take mining and have herb the entire time and just buy all your engineering mats. Engineering mats really aren't too bad to buy your way, and it would save you a ton of inventory/bank space not having to carry around that mining stuff from the very beginning.
---
*In-game rewards are available to use in World of Warcraft, but not in World of Warcraft® Classic. Free game time earned through Recruit A Friend provides access to both World of Warcraft and WoW Classic.

It's the same engine.. they've just improved it over the years.
---
Work at an office job (preferably one that lets your work remote, which a ton of companies allow now a days) that doesn’t require personal metrics to be tracked and one that you can get your work done in the course of an hour or two. 
---
Then play wow the rest of the time while waiting for more work to come through your inbox or phone.

At least that’s what I do :)
---
You only need +6 hit with 305 skill.
---
Finally a day that this sub wont hate mages.
---
Maybe go outside....
---
That's just not true.  I'll get 10-15 lockboxes in one instance run.  Even getting only one or two skill points for 10-15 of them, you're not levelling fast enough to outpace lockpicking.  I don't think rogues pickpocket every mob.  That's what I think.
---
Are they shorter in retail?
---
As a warlock...
---
*frantically takes notes*
---
I play a resto druis and haven't got the answer to this question, but i will sya this. All the priests i have raided with, both in my guild, and a guild I've pugged with, spam flash heal no matter the fight. This results and me and the paladins top the meter on all the boss fights, no exception. If the druid feed the priests innervate, they will outheal a druid, but if we dont they stay at the bottom of the meters. I have made it a point to not use innervate on a priest spamming flash heal, unless we nees alot of fast raid healing and the paladins can't keep up. That said, we down all bosses in MC in 3 h anyway so it really matter that much.
---
Yeh my bad, i meant the winterspring one, think im forgett8ng where they all are haha
---
human is the worst race no matter what class you play unless you're on a pve server. pick gnome so you don't have to stand in frost novas forever
---
Not the case. There is an instant where you are not shadowmelded and not feign deathed. 
---
With invisibility pots, there isn't that brief moment of being revealed, but with shadowmeld there it. It can still help but it isn't reliable. If you FD'd within range of a mob, shadowmeld likely won't save you.
---
at least u landed there
---
ive had it happen out in the middle of the ocean west of kalimdor
---
Mis-leading title.  Should be:
---
 40x lvl 29 multiboxer versus lvl 60 mage.
---
As a Warlock I zone in, kill Tinkerer, Princess, logout and reset then repeat. Killing Rotgrip is kind of a pain in the ass in most situations so I don't bother with it.
---
I won't be that efficient.  I'm 54 warrior, so these will be full groups of 50-56 or so level folks.  That's a good perspective, though, I guess we can just do the bosses that have loot people want.
---
After you buy the ability from the trainer, call your pet and then [go here to actually train the animal.](https://i.imgur.com/9ntcGu0.png)
---
Why are you in a guild with people of that mindset? Then you want to cry about it on Reddit? Snowflakes everywhere
---
Ghost mushrooms are not very common, there's only 1-2 caves out in the world along with maraudon where they can spawn.  A few classes can solo farm gold in mara; warlocks, shadow priests and hunters.  
---
So you have a steady supply of mushrooms from these solo farmers.
---
Now DM comes out and it's popular.  There's way more ghost mushroom nodes, and it's also a lot easier for some classes or duos to farm (jump runs, for example), aside from just a lot of max lvl people running DM a lot versus how comparatively fewer real runs of Mara there are in the same time period.  
---
More people herbing = more herbs on market = lower price, since the demand has not risen nearly as much.
---
Right, but you'll still be spending a fuckton to give your tank a flask in later tiers. I don't flask rn cause I don't care considering we do ~55min mc, but flasking for the first clear of bwl, and other raids is pretty reasonable for guilds that want to try
---
Darkness and grue.
---
I'm still sporting my trusty Whirlwind Axe on my Orc Warrior, currently level 47. Is there any good 2h Axe I should be aiming for as I approach 50+?
---
I was considering Gatorbite Axe, but my guild mates suggested against it.
---
It took 9 days 13 hours to reach 60 on my warrior.
---
Uldaman you need a shield simply because the end portion of the instance is pretty rough unless you over level those packs. Of course if you over level those mobs then you are in ZF, because Uldamon is terrible experience for half the dungeon if you do over level the end packs.
---
ZF definitely doesn't need a shield (unless you are popping a bunch of zombies, pull your shield out for that). I guess if it was a druid healer (or shaman) a shield is good for bosses that stun and can't be cleansed. But a lot of the tougher healing fights it is because of magic damage, which your shield isn't helping.
---
Maradon you don't really need for most of it and you can get away with swapping.
---
ST is really the first dungeon (outside of the 2nd half of uldaman), where you spend the majority of the time with a shield out, to the extent, you figure maybe you should just only use a shield.
---
So respecing in the late 40's tends to be where people respec if they are going prot. They can go Prot and still get the arms talents to stance dance.
---
He means like he went out, made a best friend. Wingmanned that best friend into a relationship and proposed a toast as best man at their wedding.
---
Are they right? Are you taking too long to level?
---
If no, to both, then who cares. Dont let one guild run your emotional state. 
---
Did you like this guild? *Did you want to level up fast but couldn't?*
---
If yes to both, then fuck em. They could of helped you. We helped our 60s grind up to join the raid force. 
---
Will this impact your future view of players and guilds?
---
If no, you sir are a great person and continue doing so.
---
If yes, smoke some weed.
---
What's the bottom picture of?
---
Incendius actually got better post free transfers per alliance players.
---
I'm in the 40's and there's a lot of them.
---
Every one of these replies blew my mind, but this... A hunter that can't use ranged weapons??
---
&gt; it was a come one come all guild for anyone
---
Yeah the megachurch invite-all guilds are shit, what's new? They throw a giant net to catch people too lazy to find a better guild, and are usually run by a lazy management team that goes for quantity over quality. Don't expect any kind of reasonable leadership in a guild like that.
---
Does plus healing affect hp/5?
---
It’s something like 10 minutes based on my Mark of the Wild. :S
---
Oh I see, this is the opposite of what I thought you meant.
---
BWL suppression room had me under 1 fps no joke
---
Only time I ask for straight gold is if I see “WTB tank” other than that, just gimme some blues
---
People expect you to not be a total fucking moron, especially in guild runs.
---
how do I get my raid bars colored to class? I'm an addon n00bl0rd :(
---
Enemies can have different levels of resistance to different kinds of spells. My level 30 mage was doing quite ok against level 33 mountain lions using frost magic, but level 30 snapjaw turtles resisted a lot and they bite hard. Try using a different school of magic, from frost, fire, arcane, shadow, maybe there are others
---
So you take the right path to Tinker then instead of swimming?
---
Solid stone
---
Listen to this man, don't play a hunter.  
---
Less people rolling on my loot
---
You'll be good.
---
Does spell power work more like a rating rather than actual increase?
---
Spells have coefficients, its rarely 1.0.
---
In other words, arcane shot may only take .5 of your spell dmg, other spells may take 1.0, or some 0.0.
---
Each spell has a different coefficient that gets applied to get from spell power. 
---
It gets into some math and theory-crafting but here is a Reddit post that outlines the mage coefficients.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/)
---
Well +29 does not equal +12 I know that much about math.
---
Is it possible the mobs has some sort of resistance someone posted in the past that some mobs have a base resistance to all spell schools whereas others might have a resistance to just a certain school.
---
Actually, no. I probably have a handful of butthurt warriors. I know I have one for sure. 
---
But I've only had to exercise my "You need my shit, I need your shit." policy about four times.
---
You have a conversation with strangers.  
---
want to run scholo?  need a tank.
---
Copy that and paste it to every warrior and druid, whether they are in an instance or not.  I'm not sure how that is a conversation, but you keep those rose tinted glasses straight on panda love.
---
The counter argument is that warriors might have too much hit in later gear configurations, but there are similar arguments you can make for rogues. Are we really going to consider Naxx level gear configurations when looting DFT in phase 3?
---
I did BFD once for the wand.  Never stepping foot in there again.  Seems to turn sane men into hollow shells of their former selves.
---
Different spells have different spell power coefficients. In this case I guess arcane shot coefficient is 12/29 ~= 0.4
---
Different spells have different spell damage coefficients, usually tied to the cast time. An instant cast would get far less +damage than a 3 sevond cast.
---
It increases by up to 29. It’s not a flat 29.
---
Thank you. I found it but hell, they sure know how to make this unintuitive!
---
Why not train in SW?
---
Yep, at level 60 you shouldn't aggro any mobs at all. If you herb/mine you will grab a few nodes while you do it.
---
Regardless of how you engage with your pet, once you FD, you reset both aggro tables, and both cho and the boss will have separate ones. 
---
When you FD their agro is only on the pet. If you attack one, the other won't suddenly have aggro on you.
---
Arcane shot is a instant skill? Casting skills benefits more from spell power, instant skills get decreased amount of spell power
---
You realize that fishing production has nothing to do with pools right? Everyone who throws a pole in the water gets the valuable fish. Layering has 0 impact on production as a result, it's not like nodes.
---
Spell coefficients. It's not a flat increase. Also don't bother boosting your arcane shot lol.
---
I didn't want him to answer me, it was just a list of questions to consider.
---
Just totem twist wf and grounding totems. Unless you’re alliance, god help you.
---
&gt; But then you’ll face a sharp drop off after mauradon time span and will be peer pressured to go holy lol.
---
Nope. Paladins are hands down the best 5 man tank in the game, for the whole duration of the game.
---
It's worse than you think. It's adults with the social skills of mesadapted 12 years olds.
---
dynamic respawn was not the case for Devilsaurs. They have a fixed respawn window. 
---
And it got reduced to ~5mins
---
Then you log back in and realize rez sickness doesn't count down when you are logged off.
---
Oh man you must be good. If you ever gank me I'll make sure to jack off to you instead.
---
Stop trolling. You dont know the guild mindset unless you're...you know...in the guild.
---
Yeah i worded it poorly, gonna edit it
---
Ban thok sash is probably not the greatest example considering how easy it is to get with all the arena spam groups running 24/7 for SGC...
---
&gt; They also have a horde guild here
---
Don't take everything you read in world chat so literally.
---
I mean....ehhh....Maybe. There were plenty of people I only ever saw once when I was playing in Vanilla/BC/Wrath before cross realm became a thing.
---
Darnassus to anywhere south of Ashenvale. WTB Portal to Theramore.
---
I have them bound to my F keys. F1 through F8 do a mark.
---
You don't need to kite anything. This isn't 2005. You just instantly kill everything
---
I struggled with understanding this at first, but put simply, don't forget every other party wide buff in the game. Hunter with trueshot, warriors with the ap buff, warlock imp, ect. All of these are so incredibly more important than the off chance you get a good prayer of healing on 3-4 half health targets before they die. (which in raids if someone is below half for more than 2-3 seconds they're probably going to die)
---
*Weebery intensifies*
---
Part of me wonders if the huge window is just a cheeky excuse for running the servers at a really low tick rate to cut costs
---
You’re not a teenager anymore and in any case you haven’t played for ten years.
---
We got him last night too. Was amazing.
---
Not mad, just using the same logic here that everyone else uses to justify why they need loot.
---
"X is better than Y so I need it" 
---
I understand after 15 years, people number crunched everything possible and crafted BiS lists. 
---
If a warrior is allowed to on x3 the amount of gear than me just because their class allows it and they in turn roll on gear that I could use and am ONLY limited to, then I should be able to roll on their plate upgrades as well.
---
2 BiS rogue pieces are BoE epics that go for thousands of gold on my servers AH, that gold from the vendored plate goes towards that upgrade.
---
NOW IN REALITY I would never actually do something like that.
---
But that is essentially the same logic that DPS warriors use to justify why they deserve leather just as much as rogues.
---
None of the fights in current content should be lasting so long that you need to innervate yourself. You can get like 6 powershifts in throughout the duration of a fight, if more than that, have a second powershift macro that consumes a demonic rune in the process for a chunk of mana back, or even just use omen on a powershift since it gives 60 energy, and your skills cost less than that.
---
1.5/3.5
---
Oily blackmouth is from pools, so are other valuable fish.
---
+1 incendius
---
If you clear fast sure. I can clear stockade in 3 pulls which is about 3 or 4 bars of exp for a lowbie, which can be done in 10-15mins.
---
I was just thinking this. The guild has the right to set the rules as they wish. Would I have kicked you if it was my guild? Prolly not. But I want the guild to have the right to do what they want because its theirs.  Crying on Reddit isn't going to change that.
---
Hmm, I guessed right that it was an NE Hunter who did this, but it wasn't that hard of a guess either.
---
Spell coefficient... 
---
Its basically 3,5 sec cast time to get 1 spell power = 1 dps
---
and fast spells get less dmg
---
Source?
---
i lost it when you escaped as a sealion. That was the cherry on the cake
---
They do, I never trained in UC until hitting honored or whatever for the discount, always went to org. Plus orc warlocks are more powerful than smelly dead ones
---
They killed the boss in 1:24. If he wasn't doing over 600 DPs I would be worried. As fights get longer Druid falls off hard as they go OOM like balance druids and spriests.
---
Lots of people say lots of things, this isn't something special, if you're so triggered by words that you make lists of some political side that uses them, then try to use that as an argument.... on a fucking gaming forum?  you have to be the most pathetic snowflake to ever exist......seriously, you need professional help.
---
Update if anyone is interested:
---
I did end up running slam build, and was generally pleased with the results. I set some single-target personal records even (best single target was around 700 dps on mag). The cleave on domo was amazing too and was able to parse legendary on that one.
---
Unfortunately my shaman this week was not the most diligent on wf so I lost uptime on Golemagg and sulfuron - I bring this up because I felt this more than when it happens dual wielding. Something to consider if your shamans aren’t on the ball with WF all the time.
---
Overall I found it to be more rng dependent, and frustrating at times after I lost ony buff dying on trash - but at the same time extremely fun to play and more rewarding than DW. I’m going to stick with this for the foreseeable future, and would encourage anyone else in a similar situation to try it out!
---
Also a big raiding guild wants as many raiders as possible so having big recruitment early on is good to amass a pool of potential. Now that all the dust has really settled not surprising they want to cut some weight, and for a serious raiding guild dropping based on level requirements makes some sense.
---
Horde or ally? Im on kirtonos too!
---
you dont need any
---
It's not random though, it's 1.5/3.5*29 = 12. Every shot.
---
WHAT? thats so DUMB.
---
Their it is I love when sumone learns me witch ward is the rite won.
---
How're ya now?
---
Im sorry for you bro. I was a healer needing that and i stuck through till the end:(
---
as far as i can tell he wears one leather gear piece which rogues use as well.
---
Man this thread is a shit show all the way around.
---
oh haha that makes sense
---
If this is the case you can kinda do it as much as you want since the cap will be super cheap
---
You probably didn't use Rank 3 Wingclip.
---
It's so shitty.  The amount of times I've cast feign death in the same batch as an enemy uses some spell or auto attack and simply nothing happens... Fuck right off
---
Not all competitive guilds require the roster made of only raiders.  Some are fine with social players and others have a full raid team already.
---
If the guild is worried about the levels, then they are try-hards.  Unless you are reaching the member cap (most aren't), kicking for levels is ridiculous.
---
I prefered shield and a one hander tbh
---
The best system I found for totems is binding them to different action bars relevant to their element.
---
I bind five different action bars to keys:
---
Q is to go to your starting bar with your shocks, lightning bolts and heals
---
E is to go to the earth totem bar
---
R is to go to the fire totem bar
---
F is to go to the air totem bar
---
V is to go to the water totem bar
---
Then I just bind the totems to their respective bars and with a bit of practice you can very easily reach all of your totems.
---
Instead of grinding to max level to finanly start the game..
---
U start the game when you kill your first mob. Leveling is a journey on itself.
---
The coefficient depends on cast time and effects, it's not just 100% for casts and less for instant.
---
The truest point. Hedonic adaption. We are designed to build up a tolerance to anything and everything, so one should just enjoy things while they last.
---
Do not forget to loot the gems &gt;.&lt;
---
I love my stoneweaver legs, got em on the third run, i quit trying after the second group wiped on final boss. Too demoralising spending a half hour finding a tank just for a dps to leave and now you cant dps the adds/boss fast enough on the last fight and you have to call it a failed run..
---
I LOVE this about classic. I can use all the warrior abilities through stance dancing. It's great.
---
Lol oh
---
Dirty laundry is dirty.  You must be young, when you get older and have your own kids you'll realize poopy clothes in your dirty laundry is just part of life.
---
"Fren" is a dog whistle towards those anti-semitic subreddit groups that were recently banned - basically severe alt-right.
---
&gt; I quit halfway through wotlk because I started college and didn't have time to play 
---
Lol, this IS when I started playing vanilla. Am I lucky that I still graduated?
---
Bro, I'm in my late 30s with a career, a family, a social club, and live near tons of family.  The limited amoutn of time I get to play this amazing game is getting poisoned by teenagers and No Lifers who gank players either only when theyre 10+ levels above you or when they have the # advantage.
---
I just dont have time to waste making GY runs because someone wants to stroke their ePeen or whatever.
---
Wow.
---
Uh.... That guy was prob the worst pvp player I've ever seen lol.
---
1680 x 1050 with a 3ghz pentium 4, 1gb of RAM, and a Radeon x600. 
---
It was still prone to slowing down in cities and raids but it was totally playable, and not really a far cry from the 1080p that most people use today.
---
Try rerolling on a server where you haven't had people you played with for a decade. Then you're in their shoes.
---
It is bad from a player perspective, because members have effectively zero influence on the way the guild functions. There are too many players, so they're ultimately just ignored by the officers. There's just dumb luck that they will happen to be in a guild that will actually work out well for them.
---
It's lazy and irresposible on the part of the officers, because they're just mass inviting and wasting tons of people's time instead of putting in the minimal amount of work to filter out people who obviously aren't a good fit from the start.
---
It's just bad all around, it's lazy, it's inefficient; the benefit only goes to the officers. Sure, it can be useful as a leveling guild since you have a bunch of "guildies" to run dungeons with, but when it's too big it's essentially just another /LFG chat. But in every other instance, it's just a bad guild for your average member.
---
you can herb and skin in animal form. Not a dealbreaker but, you cant use half the engi stuff in animal form so might not be worth it
---
So would you say resistance isn’t that important overall then? 
---
Thanks for the detailed overview man, really helpful
---
Lol, no what?
---
How is there no time pressure? I'm still only level 32 and I'm worried I won't even get 60 by the time the next raid tier (AQ?) comes out.
---
Is it different in classic/vanilla and people still did/will do the old raids/dungeons regularly after the next tier is released?
---
You do. You don't shower, you stink. Disgustang
---
At least he followed the "Loot the hounds" instruction.
---
*checks post history*
---
Yup, this reply checks out.
---
Sure maybe, but I think more players are going to be multiboxing to delete players in PVP.
---
I saw people saying 1h and Flametongue. Rockbiter if you're wanting threat, but typically Earth Shock is plenty of threat.
---
That’s alliance right there ! Tough when 5v1 but carpet when 1v1
---
Vanilla is also properly learning how to play your class by leveling slowly and getting new main abilities over time, instead of the instant boost to max and trying to figure out which two buttons you need to mash
---
Does the entire group have to be in the zone for the average to take place?
---
For example, I have a 60 mage and a 17 priest. Could I invite 3 people around the same level as my priest who are doing their own thing like chilling in Stormwind/Orgrimmar while I spam clear Deadmines/RFC? Or does the entire group have to be in the zone for the group to be averaged properly?
---
Would you say in the later phase survival is a lot more viable then in terms of the agi bonus, even for pvp?
---
Are there any good methods for power-leveling or accelerated leveling with the help of a 60? I know the go-to answer will be to run dungeons, but has anyone measured the efficacy of this compared to a normal 5 man or solo/duo questing at appropriate levels? For reference I'd like to get a character from 14-20 asap so should I run it through RFC/WC with a 60 or do quests are normal with another char my level (or even do the quests with the 60 to get them done faster). I'm not sure if there are any resources that measure the effectiveness of these methods.
---
at which point do u swap to aoe leveling?
---
You’re 47? *looks at level 26 main* uhh, to me you’re hardcore.
---
Isn't wooden cloth just paper?
---
They are, and they are highly contested by druids shamans and priests
---
Name &amp; shame!  It’s a video game.
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Yeah later definitely that is the endgame build
---
I've been finding mobs that stay linked VERY frequently lately. Really weird to me. Like the dwarves in the Tauren 5-10 area stay linked together in big packs. I thought I could kite one away from the others. Nope!
---
Also me right now, back to work in 30 min :(
---
I'm either looking at r/classicwow or looking at what piece of gear I want to work towards next.
---
Argent Dawn in the fields of WPG and some in EPG.  You can start in WPG around 51-52.  There are more rep quests in strat later.  You will pick up a trinket that will let you start collecting scourgestones, which you should save for later turn ins when you hit higher rep.
---
Not any around around here, that is a true all time banger.
---
Thanks for the reply. Care to share your spot??
---
yes definitely will be checking it out later tonight! if you don't mind, what are your favorite features/ uses with it?
---
You think you do, but you don't
---
They all have to be present. Pretty easy to grab a bunch of randoms nearby though.
---
Why do all rogues forget they have a ranged weapon. He had like 8 seconds for a killing blow there...
---
Yeah I wouldn't touch that lmao
---
I mean, we're almost three months in and you've only barely passed the halfway mark. If they're a guild that has a server first Ragnaros kill, they absolutely are a hardcore raiding guild, and I imagine that when they initially started mass recruitment the goal was to field as many raid teams as possible. 
---
You can /spit on em all you want, but at the end of the day they have drastically different goals than you do. They're almost certainly looking for a server first Nef kill, and you don't get those without having a certain level of dedication.
---
A godlike tank with a bad clueless party would take control of their party or give people the boot. You're supposed to be a leader as a tank, if people are fucking up the dungeon then tell them to get their shit together. You're relating things completely unrelating to tanking to it though anyways.
---
It could be that they are full and they found a lvl 60 player that they really want. So they need to make the space available.
---
Just ran Mara with a shaman tank last night and it went incredibly smoothly. Of course this is anecdotal but there are quite a few people with similar anecdotes. It may not be optimal but that’s part of the beauty of classic imo.
---
If you want to play optimally and get to 60 as your goal, you are absolutely correct. 
---
But this whole thread is about Classic being just fine and enjoyable when that *Isn't* your goal. Which is one of the things that makes it beautiful.
---
Paper-Rock-Scissors bby, UD Prot is your hard counter. 
---
One day you'll find one in the wild, and he'll splooge all over you.
---
Thanks.  That was a good laugh at lunchtime.
---
Freedom is entering a group for Stratholme and being asked by the rogue if I was going to "steal" his loot. The reasoning was that those items were his because he couldn't use plate gear. What can I do if most plate gear sucks?
---
if you market it as a friendly leveling guild it will be just that, but as people get into their 50s they will get sniped by other guilds or just leave to prep for raiding
---
oh i read 48 as 43 my bad, yeah u should be more than fine
---
I suspect that the high end guilds will be trying to  poach players with large stockpiles instead of paying that amount.
---
Damn those flight point masters collecting coins like a direct deposit hit the bank
---
No it’s the same argument. Because BoE’s=gold and everyone needs gold.
---
LEROY JENKINS!
---
Yep...look down a couple posts.
---
Initially I wasn't sure if the OP was just unknowingly joking or actually a prick.  Looks like they are actually a prick.
---
And after all that - you still went back to the carpet store.
---
mfw when I get Netherwind Crown but it clips all over my toon's face/hair.
---
&gt;I think we can all agree that he is rolling need because he damn well know some people will roll greed.
---
My second sentence began with, "If **everyone** rolls need..."
---
He's fighting a battle against a villain that only exists in his mind. I appreciate your well-structured replies, but they may be falling on deaf ears.
---
What elite dragon did you kill in winterspring?
---
50 to 75 ms version would be not terrible but current version is horrendous
---
It doesn't tell you what class they are until you have actually seen the person on your screen. How does he know they're a Rogue?
---
You aren’t level 60 yet? How?
---
It works but some things out of your control will fuck with it.
---
Me as fuck right now. 
---
No raids till Monday but i still cant wait to get home and kill some filthy allys.
---
How did you know?
---
A warrior got me while I was low on health and mana once and engaged with three mobs. I still slowed them enough that my mage friend could make it in time to finish them off. She had been busy selling water at the time. Typical mage. Ugh.
---
Who the fuck goes to the auction house to buy some othetr dude thread? "This guy asked nicely and hey, im friendly, lemme go to the ah and buy this guy his mats" My first thought is hes just hoping for free shit but wools cheap so idk..
---
Yeah I did. I guess if you tell the lowest white man that he's better than the highest brown person he'll run with it lol
---
Your guild sounds nice, but at the same time that puts a lot of pressure on you. I understand you want to validate all the effort they put into you. But it sounds like that pressure is getting to you a bit. What you need to do is block out that whole social part of trying to by worthy and maintain a certain image. That tryharding will make you rush and make mistakes like accepting quests too soon. Just block that part  out and focus on the thing you are doing. Clear your head before each pull. Do you want cc here? Are there any patrols? How do I want to position my party and mobs? You are not getting old at all, you are pushing yourself too hard, which is why you don't play to your level right now. If you manage to stay calm and still feel you underperform, go watch some videos about the dungeons you want to run. Preparing everything on your own time will make you feel less rushed in game. Because you know everything already, and you know that you know. Glhf
---
Well... partial resists exist... but you are correct its coefficient
---
Oh hell yeah, the real FP is much better.
---
I mean, to you theyre not a "hardcore" raid group, but maybe they want to be. The only way for them to get numbers to do MC early is to invite people. Now theyre considering themselves a raid guild and want a tight core. Fair enough, the only other way to do it is for all the officers to leave anyway and remake the guild with their new core.
---
Just sounds like a guild restructuring to me.
---
Level engierneering, use grenade, fd+trap. That way you save the DR on scatter shot and also stop them from attacking you in the middle of FD
---
Again, thats just a bad loot council. I agree- the system's big glaring issue is that the wrong members on the LC pretty much destroy it. DKP though.....I'll just say you should look up a few videos on why DKP is not a good system overall. I have been in guilds that have used it, and I don't think either one is flawless, but DKP in my experience has been abused in much more anyoing/ridiculous ways.
---
Good circle jerk thread, but ironically, this is less freedom.
---
Reading through your earlier comments reminded me of why I never liked the early levels as horde. You are in the Barrens forever. Then you go to Stonetalon for a long time as well. Some people prefer this though. Everyone says horde has the superior leveling experience, but I much prefer alliance. If you come back, you should try to level your dwarf up to around 30 and see if you like it any better.
---
The general demand for tanks drops off dramatically for everyone moving into raids... Where before you had a 1:5 ratio you move into a 2:10 then 2-3:40 ratio. 
---
If the scale was direct from 5 mans to 40 mans you would have 8 tanks in a raid. Its not until one fight in Naxx that you need 8 tanks, and even then you can get by with non-tanks pulling it off.
---
And as an aside, the hybrid tax being real for every hybrid class but warriors is a bad design. Yeah, warriors are hybrids.
---
&gt; Bro, warriors wear plate. Period.
---
Not the case until armor specialization was introduced in Cata.
---
DKP and loot council are literally the exact opposite of each other. DKP is the fairest system of the 3 you mentioned; DKP/Loot Council/Rolling. Dkp is nothing more than "raid bucks", show up on time, get a raid buck. kill a boss, get a buck. Over time accumulate raid bucks, you get to buy the gear you want. This rewards the consistent players and drives retention for other raid members. How is this not fair? The guy who has been around the longest has priority. Loot council is usually extremely susceptible to cliques/egos/poor management. You can throw out xyz excuse as to why a certain person got the loot, but in all reality, its because they're in the "group". Lastly, rolling, which I would say is neutral but can be so frustrating. Bad luck and stupid people can cause the player to give up. Again, not good.
---
If my server had one I'd be surprised
---
Anyone who reaches R14 is going to be in BiS pbe gear. It is a guild accomplishment.
---
But that warrior is a rogue
---
PvE is all AI. Things are predictable. Now sure you can say "if I, a Rogue, fight a Warlock they might do X and Y", that's true yea. But you dont KNOW what each Warlock will actually do. Or when they will do it. And vice versa.
---
May you provide a screen shot
---
Am I the only one who actually is able to play at work? Alt + tab for the win
---
But Sap lasts longer than blind
---
Or even better, just instantly killing them with EleM CL+ES
---
Just make sure that you wait for Abolish Poison's duration to wear off before you refresh viper string, otherwise Abolish Poison's duration will just automatically remove it for free.
---
Try playing the game.
---
zygor has an ingame addon with step by step quest directions (subscription... but you can download it....elsewhere...)
---
joanas online guide is great as well (no ingame addon)
---
ive been using zygor's guide and its fantastic and easy to use. i picked it up midway through level 20 and aside from the first 1-2 zones i didnt really have much issue with missing prerequisites from earlier in the guide and such.
---
Meltdown? Lmao
---
Me: *clicks “Need”*
---
You: “OH MY GOD, YOU’VE BECOME UNHINGED!”
---
Impale prot is booty. Just go 14/5/32
---
you dont need to. Spec SL and you can faceroll mages 9 times out of 10
---
It's really hit or miss. I collected like 4 stacks from BRD pickpocket runs and only managed to sell one of them. I tried reposting but I was just losing deposit cost over and over.
---
I am good, probably better than 95% of the players, but I don't see the point in world pvp. Arenas and perhaps BGs is where pvp is at.
---
not sure they should make all their structures purely out of very dry wood with fire all around it. but that's just me.
---
The guild alchemists bought them. Also literally everything is dirt cheap on DD because of the massive undercutting. Mature Blue Dragon Sinew was going for like 240g buyout not too long ago.
---
Thats not what happens at all. He is casting his own frostbolt. He gets hit by the enemy frostbolt at the same time he releases his own.
---
Alright Yea you're right. People, especially guild leaders who are trying to be efficient with loot should definitely have been on top of this
---
you should describe how his nutz taste next. lol
---
So, besides bragging rights .... what does it do for the guild? 
---
Exactly. 
---
Yes, it might bring a few fanbois to the guild because thats where the HWL/GM is - but ultimately it does not help the guild progress.
---
push it to the limit
---
What's wrong with just a ty and leaving though? I don't understand. Do I need to blow each party member before satisfying your required social interaction requirements for leaving? I have shit to do, you have shit to do, I'm not going to just hang out with randoms that I don't know unless I really like you. We are either running this shit again or I'm going to find another group. Neither of these involve patting each other on the back for completing a dungeon we've all probably already completed.
---
And get a mature blue dragon sinew or two (as long as there are no hunters in your group). Had to kill Scryer twice and we got two of them just killing 15 dragons on the way in/waiting for respawn.
---
I farmed that for 2 whole days on my hunter, by myself! In the snow!
---
Stop jizzing on your mouse.
---
This is an ignorant statement and in no way can be applied to every guild.
---
I’m in a 500+ person guild. We have 4 raid teams. The officers make sure that as there’s more people wanting to raid they help facilitate new raid teams and scheduling and availability.
---
We do group PvP together. I frequently play with all sorts of people, and anyone who has issues is free to talk to officers.
---
Does that mean everything will turn on it’s head for 1 person? No, and it would be absurd to, but the more people you have, actually the more accommodating you can be to people with different needs.
---
Sorry your officers don’t like you lol
---
I feel ashamed. I have stopped playing consistently and it bothers me because I'll be here at work reading through all these posts and I'm like dman, I need to play more, but there's this thing called life that continues to get in the way and all I want to do is play wow in peace, but I can't because I have responsibilities and I hate being an adult and someone please do my work for me kthx.
---
Play what you believe you'll get the most enjoyment out of. Not every guild is a hardcore min/max dps number-crunching lot. You'll eventually join one that recognizes merit over whatever looks best on paper, and honestly, would you even want to join a guild like that if hardcore raiding isn't your thing?
---
&gt; That’s just oversimplifying
---
No it's not. You're a giant baby.
---
When you level to 60 you find good players you grouped with and add them. Eventually the discussion of joining guilds comes up.
---
When you’re getting pre-Bis you group with people. The good ones will be obvious. If you’re good they will notice as well. Eventually you will cross paths enough or you can simply ask if they’re recruiting.
---
It’s that easy usually. Just group with people and ask the good ones if they’re recruiting. If none of the good players you encounter while leveling or grouping is asking you to join, then they probably don’t think much of you as a player and you can maybe do a bit of work on mastering your class before trying to get into a good guild.
---
My momma told me
---
Agreed, addons shouldn't be allowed but I do see the point of using it if you're at a disadvantage but I would rather it not exist if that was the option
---
Me every weekend please stop sir
---
Lol the amount of butt hurt is astounding.
---
It 100% works......
---
Wait, you ACTUALLY thought *this*:
---
&gt; “I need to not use my brain, plz halp”
---
was going to get a serious response?
---
I was having that same problem until I found [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NK0C0bU92mgoiDsP0wgir3_HINzTkWrIL1PCZlYB5X8/htmlview#)
---
It’s the best Shaman BiS list I’ve seen, for all specs.
---
How often to log in? My guild kicks inactive people after about a week.
---
Kai?
---
Actually the core of WoW was *great developer practices* but that's gone now.
---
? Thanks for proving my point yet again, dummy.
---
Raiding is not a big aspect of the game, so trivial information like that gets easily forgotten. And if you actually clicked the thread I already knew about mc, but needed clarification for onyxia. Guess clicking was too hard for ya, retail has completely fucked over your little brain.
---
Keep contradicting yourself though and playing shitty dead games while we all are having fun. 
---
EDIT: Also, you really shouldnt talk about post histories when yours is filled with 'Walt disney world' and primitive fanboyism, lmao are you like 12? Would explain why you are a mentally deficient retailtard. 
---
Explains it all honestly.
---
Leatrix plus
---
There's some niche uses. Last night in ZF with an odd group comp(me as the druid, two warlocks, two mages), I utilized it several times, mostly in conjunction with Tranquility.
---
Not that you probably \*should\* have the healer and the tank be the same person so you can fit an extra AOEr in, but lol, it does work.
---
laughs in orc
---
Yes you have to stand still. Yes you have to spam it or use Razer Synapse to spam for you.
---
It used to be very alliance favored, but with the transfers it has evened out with horde taking a slight lead in terms of active players/characters.
---
RFD for you, BRD for me, brother.
---
Counterweight actually affect druid swing speed?
---
The boost is both wonderful and horrible.
---
Levelling 1 to 110 is painful.
---
Being told how to play with half your skills over 15 minutes then shoved off the airship with talents and your other skills is also awful.
---
Do you have to wait 5 minutes every time you want to reset the instance you are farming? It would be just as fast to die with all my gear out in to my bags and run back
---
The best server :)
---
At least you won’t have any hair to pull out when you find you misclicked again and are still in Tanaris.
---
What is your talent spec if you don't mind my asking?
---
What's the best US East PVP Server to play as Alliance? I am trying out Herod but keep hearing about how it's completely Horde imbalanced and I don't wanna waste my time levelling here if it's going to be a bad time later on.
---
I ve read about the owl but since I am horde side I dont really fancy the whole hassle to get one. I might try one later on.
---
Yes. Why would you hinder your group's overall dps by giving various players individual pieces instead of gearing on a person-by-person basis to maximize overall damage output?
---
I mean it's up to Blizzard to balance their server population with the resources available. Especially when they decide to use layering on launch which caused the markets to do some weird things when they removed it. Just cause you're ok with playing on a normie server doesn't mean the rest of us are.
---
Horde gankers and small penises.
---
Steam has a beta for something called steamlink that allows you to remote in via phone and play. I have had guildies that had to use this to get on for raids while they were on their way home. 
---
I believe you have to enable beta options to get to it or something. I am sure if you google it, you will see the entire set up to make it work.
---
Night Elf Hunters and Warriors.
---
Okay grandpa
---
Ban this shit pls
---
XP gained in the world is not based off % damage you deal to the mob and this is so easily tested I do not know how people continue to spout this blatant myth
---
well rolling in a raiding guild is the first problem (unless its a casual guild, and then "prio" shouldn't be a thing besides MS&gt;OS lol).
---
mageblade = bis for mages til naxx(i think)
---
locks = would replace mageblade p3 with nef staff
---
hence why u give mages mageblade and locks staff of dom
---
also locks benefit more than mages from having more stam/int. lifetap baby.
---
You dont get honor for someone 30 levels lower, you literally lose it.
---
Please explain gatekeeper.
---
Particularly if you try-hard and use the HS queue/dequeue "feature"
---
ppl on WoW Classic are a bit odd sometimes...
---
Was wondering what side you're on, level 60 human warrior reporting in
---
I was one of those dumbasses that bought alrerac swiss from the auction house, paid 4g for a stack I think.  It honestly wasn’t that big of a deal to me when I found out I could just buy it from a vendor, but now I check wowhead for items I need before buying from the AH
---
You don't deserve an item more just because you put more time and effort in the game.
---
glad to be horde and on every shamans side
---
Dont feel bad. I have a buddy who bought the 6 months mount.
---
HOW DARE THEY TELL ME HOW I SHOULD PLAY
---
All X hundred people in my guild should play in a way that accommodates me.
---
- Like half the people in this sub with guild complaints
---
Strange how it works for multiple spells in those kinds of situations, but not for Clearcasting. Only one spell gets the no mana cost, the instant cast spell that instantly follows costs full mana.
---
My mistake, I am honestly just using the information I have heard as I have had no desire to is the addon myself.
---
Questie
---
Does stuff like this happen in the US? I've never met people as massively unpleasant, entitled and full of themselves on EU servers
---
Looks like your guild dodged a bullet there...
---
You are wasting the companies time, you’ve just deluded yourself into thinking you’re not so you can justify playing wow while on the payroll.
---
Then why not roll need on everything? Gear is much harder to come by.
---
I would recommend you go DPS before you start tanking.  The tank does not only serve as the person who holds aggro, the tank should have the strongest grasp on the dungeon in general.  You should understand the mobs and their mechanics, the pats, and the layout of the dungeon.  
---
It sounds like you need more time to learn the game if you are getting lost walking into BRD.  Just give yourself more time to learn from seeing someone else tank, and then try and pick up how to do it yourself.
---
Must be in a raid to enter.
---
For leader to pass automatically, yes.
---
I know the feeling. I’m only level 38 in 7 weeks of sub.
---
who passes...
---
something that catches me is when a non-lock, that doesn't have a lock friend close/with him, uses a HS lmao. u can easily tell difference between a hp pot/tuber/whatever and a 1200 hp healthstone. killed me more than once when i wasn't the only one with a "insta 20% to 80% hp" button.
---
Too many cooks in the kitchen guys :p
---
Calm down dude, you're putting way too much loyalty into a guild that literally doesn't and can't give a shit about you. 
---
&gt;Sorry your officers don’t like you lol
---
Yikes
---
Multiple teams, possibly split too
---
What Commandier said. Once he knocks back all melee need to get to the edge and stop attacks to give the tank time to gain threat again.
---
We Destiny 2 now playas
---
I’ve found mob tagging to be super fast , after level 40 you can get 60k xp/h ( that’s the best we managed to hold it on , level 50-60 we’ve managed to sit on 85k xp/h , 
---
basically the lowbie tags the mob and you ( the 60 ) kills it, not in group . I rate grinding to be faster leveling as there is never any downtime,  it’s just constant xp
---
c) stick shadow and you can do both easily
---
Wait, did you guys give your EoS to an unreliable player who isnt active and doesn't contribute to the guild? Or did I read this wrong.
---
Probably a decent amount but I'm not a loot goblin and I make more gold farming than any boe is going to get me. My bank alone is worth like 5 times the value of that dagger.
---
Granted we started as a come one come all mega guild on my server and partying on discord all the time. 
---
a month or so ago we all started getting 50-60 as the leaders of the server and most of us were officers in the guild, but the GM was just not active at all or making decisions... so one day all the level 50+ had a chat in the guild and bailed on the guild in the middle of the night to create as little drama as possible, and I logged on the next day to see the original GM and I were the top levels in the guild and they invited me over and made me an officer. 
---
Fast forward 3 weeks we are raiding, and they are a leveling guild. We are both focused on community, but trying to balance the 2 communities with 700+ people looked like a fucking nightmare. Especially because it took those 3 weeks for the original GM to finally log on and PM me asking what the fuck happened to all the discord people who partied and talked all the time.
---
you'll post other things with the same title except for the name of the items when you get bre lmao
---
I never said i was, oh salty and pissed off hater of comments. Please tell me what to feel, so i don't offend your delicate sense of what is right.
---
I see why doing a video is in line, but why also aa reddit post on top of it to promote it, if it is a PERSONAL journey
---
at the cost of 39 other people's time! surely fun for them!
---
You’re wasting your time. You can’t power level in classic wow. Otherwise we would all have a bunch of 60s and alts. There’s a reason why people don’t
---
Flight Path + Pornhub 
---
Helps relieve the stress of playing on a PvP server.
---
iv'e lost like 20 players to this... it's really annoying and makes me look bad even though im chaining globals.
---
I didn't feel useful as a warrior until I hit 60 and started getting gear.
---
You have to remember how gear-dependent warriors are. This isn't retail. Multi-tanking is not easy, aggro will drop, you just have to be mindful with your Taunts and Mocking Blow use.
---
It gets better.
---
You can and should 2H Arms tank up until BRD. It’s easier after level 30 when you unlock berserker stance (and WW Axe). Charge in and stance dance to maintain rage and threat.
---
It's something special for sure! Probably the most sad quest I've come across. Not found any info on Yuriv though, would be cool to follow his history.
---
hearthstone cast and toilet run
---
no you dont. you only lose honor for killing civilian NPCs
---
Do you rly wear spell dmg as hunter? lol
---
I gave up on finding a decent guild and decided to help build one lol
---
Azuresong Ally Guild, been fun so far. Rushed a pally to 60 as a tank and now I'm running guildies through to get them to 60. 
---
I also found bigger guilds / bigger drama, so I'm cutting off recruiting around 100-150 mains, and will switch to a referral system for recruits.
---
It's all about luck with the guild you find, so I decided to make my own luck. :-)
---
Cheers and Good Hunting OP
---
Yes and I love it, when it is a challenge. If it is a simple one shot, there is nothing rewarding so why waste my time and piss someone off. I'm here to enjoy the game just as much as they are.
---
Class specific discords have been the best source of info, imo.
---
you dont need flasks at all,unless you are tryharding speedruns or split runs anyway
---
He's using default raid icons in the game settings. You can select class colours all without an add-on :)
---
Sounds like they spam recruited in general chat to me, likely hit the membership cap, and had to make cuts.
---
The exp is based on damage done. Tagging doesn't work like it did.
---
A dishonorable kill takes away honor points.
---
grinding where
---
Sulfuras I would say. Very good faction balance with high population. Herod is indeed grossly in favor of horde.
---
he is just stressed out and wants to play better. is kinda weird but good on him imo for trying idk
---
I agree. The answer do depends on where people intend to use the gear.
---
i have fun pressing my buttons and not dying due to threat because my tank isn't actually garbage and knows how to "spreadsheet" properly to itemize his gear. that's FUN
---
what server you on bud?
---
Yah UNZIPPED ME, DOC! lol, chill bruh
---
*Needs on plate gear*
---
You: "YOU'VE LOST YOUR MIND!!!!"
---
lmfao, thanks for taking some time from sniffing gooches to chyme in. Im gonna keep doing my thang tho
---
How do you guys go about giving advice to a newer tank? Ive done a couple lower level dungeons on my rogue alt, and I'm seeing rends, heroic strikes, and rage-starved tanks struggling to keep aggro.  I want to suggest shield block -&gt; revenge -&gt; sunder armor (or something along that nature of efficient rotations) tactfully.
---
Lol, I got it. I was joking that he was only raising one glass.
---
Who cares?
---
it will never be so expensive,you are delusional
---
untrue?
---
I’ll check it out thanks!
---
Herod is way overpopulated, there are no dead servers.
---
I played a druid in Vanilla with exactly the build I linked (and got linked again above).
---
You can do fine in catform. Your DPS will not be high in a raid, but you'll do fine grinding mobs. Once you're in decent gear, most mobs die fast enough anyway.
---
Lucky him! Usually the loot window has to timeout for the people not inside the instance and you can see the loot that dropped.
---
We were in LBRS for Gloves of Power tank pulled a lot of the room including the Quartermaster so we wipe. Sure enough the hunter managed to feign and we told him not to loot anything, you can guess what happened, bumblenuts loots while being the only person with loot options so we yell at him just pass casters can roll and pickup later but nope he greeded. 
---
One of the few times I restrained myself from going off on someone in chat.
---
Level 60 isnt hard to get to and MC was being downed after all of less than 2 weeks with partial raids and people under level 60. Classic has been out for over 2 months which is plenty time for casual raiders to start popping up
---
I don't bother doing this in my groups and what ends up happening is we get 3 fury warriors as dps. I guess they're all the ones struggling to find a group. I don't really care but it's been funny to notice.
---
if your guild is decked in mc gear and pre raid bis,bwl will be super easy,without consumables
---
Cause people on PvE servers are usually pretty bad.
---
clearing in 3h =/= clearing in 1h
---
"look like a badass"
---
someone should go farm transmogs on bfa.... 😂
---
can you explain added group bonus? has anyone actually tried powerleveling in classic wow we have comments in here saying it is not possible
---
... and killing lowbies doesn't count as a dishonorable kill.
---
This picture makes no sense to me
---
Yeah, the problems with addons is that they become an arms race. I hate addons too but how am I supposed to compete with people who have them installed? Even in PVE raid content, addons can make you look more competent which is important if your guild awards loot via loot council that partially bases decisions on performance.
---
I was talking about the guy who’s server has a set for only 140 gold as being the reason it’s cheap. 
---
I made a mad amount of money on retail buying cheap easy sales items on my bottom 10 server and transferring to illidan
---
Well, for as hard as you try, you can't seem to call the weapon by it's correct name. It's not called the EoS as you abbreviated it multiple times...it's Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.
---
&gt;Karghat
---
Biggest things is that the alliance have better vantage points and can turtle hard to prevent the loss if it comes to it. Also alliance can cap towers with minimal issues with NPC's which gives a very slight advantage.
---
Yes and no. There are subtle changes that can improve the classes without removing their uniqueness. Even 1.12 was rough with balancing. Changes I'd like to see after all the phases have been released and things are developing into Classic+.
---
It's very tough to do, lots of people dont take criticism well.  I'd recommend messaging the tank via PM first (dont air it out in party chat for all to see) and ask if you could offer him some advice to hold aggro better.  If he is receptive, there ya go, if not, you'll just have to tough it out.
---
I've had great experiences with newer tanks but most of them asked for advice before I offered it.  I've also had some terrible experiences with tanks who clearly were new but were certain they knew how to tank.
---
I saw enough signs during classic beta to see how bad he is, especially as a Warrior. He's terrible as a person and as a Warrior.
---
Level 60s powerlevelling SM is super common. Mages charge up to 5g a person per run to boost them. XP gains will take a hit but bbn if you're fast and efficient that wont be a problem at all.
---
But if it works... How is it invalid? That's like telling your group in Deadmines to not jump on the wheel to avoid a wipe because it's cheating
---
Yeah I decided on Enhance because I've leveled a shaman as Elemental and then ended as resto back in BC but never did enhancement much at all. Just trying tsomething different. Kinda wish I just went Horde from the jump  Instead ran an ally druid to like 38 then switched
---
it's the most basic recruitment scheme...
---
you have a 10-man core, need to fill bodies, so you mass invite early on, and when you have a stable and proven 40-man raid, you kick those who aren't usefull anymore.
---
to be honest, it's pretty hard to figure out who's a good player in classic, considering everything is so damn easy.
---
its going to go to 200g unless blizzard alters spawn rates
---
I'm not talking about how long it lasts, but that blind has way longer range. So it's a lot easier to stay away waiting for skin, then going close to blind, than it is to go all the way melee to sap.
---
It has a sandbox quality as well. At level 30 my warrior can push into 30+ zones: Stranglethorn Vale,  Alterac Mountains, Arathi Highlands, Desolace, or head to Shimmering Flats or I can cleanup easy quests I haven't done in Wetlands, Hillsbrad, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, Duskwood, and do/start peeking into several dungeons: Shadowfang Keep, Blackfathom Deeps, Stockades, Gnomeregan, Razorfen Kraul, and even peek into Scarlet Monestary's Graveyard.
---
Add in leveling professions and there is a lot of replayability.
---
I thought the drop rate was 100% because when I was questing in Westfall and getting merked by those things I managed to kill 2 of them and was ecstatic that I could vendor the dust for a silver a piece. I felt rich. 
---
Came back once I found out what they were worth and haven’t seen one in like 15 kills. 
---
RNG is weird
---
Yeah because raiding with \~39 other people and having bosses drop 2 items at a time sounds *exponentially more rewarding.*
---
/s
---
well when p2 come,every farm spot will be a battlefield
---
&gt;  spam trade for boxes to open and see how far you get
---
not very far, until 225
---
then everybody wants you
---
one SS to explain the new generations to older ones.
---
First and last time I will ever root for the gnome.
---
Sesame Street
---
&gt;There's just dumb luck that they will happen to be in a guild that will actually work out well for them.
---
So GZ, the guild happens to work out for you. I'm saying they can't and don't care about you because they *literally* cannot give a shit about your opinions, there's 499 other members. What you think or want has zero impact on the guild as a whole if you aren't one of the people running it... that's just how it is.
---
&gt;but it’s sad you think that big guilds are incapable of being nice communities where people genuinely want to help eachother
---
When did I say that? I never said it's impossible; but it's a moot point because smaller guilds obviously do that as well, and in general are probably more active about it. The fact that it has some positive characteristics doesn't mean it's *better* than a more appropriately sized guild.
---
And pretending like the majority of recruit-all guilds aren't dumpster fires just because you're in one that is mass recruiting raid teams (which is a giant red flag for a lot of people) doesn't prove your point either.
---
Anyone who says the community for this game is great I'd like them to read the comments in this thread.
---
I'm not gonna need a 1g gem, but I'm gonna need a 30g Orb.
---
Not gonna need a 5g green piece that will cut tour profits in alh fees before it sells, but I'm gonna need an Epic drop.
---
I'd say 20-30g is the soft spot when Need before Greed.
---
He probably did something dumb like talk about it
---
It was a mere trick. Happy Halloween!
---
Lol over thinking the fuck out of it bro MC gets cleared in greens with lvl55s in the raid
---
im a 60 warr that would be cleave pulling and leveling my buddy who is a 39 rogue
---
Nothing says basement dweller quite like this comment
---
Yep. They don't even know how to play the game correctly and that's why they like classic, it's easy &amp; simple as can be.
---
This is wrong, and so easy to test its stupid. Base XP from mob is determined by the experience the highest level player in the party/attacking the mob would receive.
---
Try it out and tell me how it goes. Again there’s a reason why we all don’t have a bunch of 60 alts. It’s not because we don’t want them
---
Dont stress about it. I suggest waiting until you're starting to get your pre-bis before worrying about being in a raiding guild, otherwise there isnt much of a point.
---
I transferred to Earthfury from a server that was major horde. Been three weeks now and I couldn't be more happy! Don't put time into a character and then realizing at 60 that you can't do anything because horde are camping hot zones.
---
Make the switch !! You will not regret.
---
Fucking game is dead!!!  (sarcasm)
---
GuideLime is a free alternative to Zygor. Using it now to see how it is compared to Zygor.
---
dude your Faerlina streamer server is just a spec in classic wow,the EU servers are way bigger,with no streamers,we are not going to fuck up the game because you and every other asmonsperg decided to roll on one server
---
Usually only looking to join. But sometimes if you ask, one of the 2 of you will start the group. Groups gotta start somewhere after all.
---
You *can* get to 10 in just over an hour if you're pushing it. I see no reason you can't make it to 18 in 5 or 6 hours.
---
Power to ya, I have no problem with others enjoying the content. It's just that there's no alternative to MC-- it's the *only* endgame content available right now. And even average players can autopilot it so that's why I called it the raid finder of classic. xD
---
Was meant to be a funny but it seems there are a lot of butthurt people here. The awesome classic community seems to grow teeth the moment you mention you're taking a break... typical fandom obsessive-reactive.
---
Available but not reasonable to be using, rather. Once there is a need for it, I should have said.
---
"On for only a few hours a day"
---
What the fuck are his standards?  Quit working and make a living playing WoW?!?
---
Sixtyupgrades - you click on item slots, select your filters, and you see all items as well as the phases. You can put together your own set there. Simple and useful.
---
You didn't read the post, he said: at level 37 meaning FOR LEVELING. 
---
He did not say:  for PVP 
---
You just wrongly assumed that was what he meant.
---
People who don't care wouldn't have clicked the title or written a response. Take some time to get to know yourself. ;)
---
Its not about the parry haste, its about the interaction when you are a tank.  If you run into a boss fight with a 2.8s one hander, and get parried on your first swing, you have no rage and no threat until your next swing, 2.8s later.  2.8s with no threat at all on a boss is a bad feeling.
---
With a faster weapon, if your first hit gets parried, you get to swing again in 1.6s or w/e you are using. Cutting this 'dead' time down over a second.
---
It's something small, but noticeable. Gets much worse as well if your first 2 hits are dodges or parries, then you can be in real trouble.  5s without a real hit on the boss, healers can pull threat off you, etc.
---
I feel like there's far more of these people this time around than there was 15 years ago. I don't attribute it to the younger people playing now, I think it has more to do with how much broader the audience of gaming is now.
---
If you listen closely you can hear which form we're in while we howl our lamentation...
---
If thats the case then why was i fireballed over 3 times as a shadow priest who did 0 damage in p1 and opened the fuck up in p2? Im going to lead an ony again tonight and this fucking transition to phase 3 is giving me cancer and super aids.
---
There are plenty of people in the same boat as you are... I wouldn't worry too much about it. I am lvl 34 atm btw
---
Having our limited toolkit made even more sparse a shit mechanic like batching is definetly a problem.
---
Gryphons are on strike.
---
boohoo
---
Yeah I guess rogues are one of the exceptions where I can see it making sense, but literally any class that buffs might want to cast something at least up to four times not on themselves. I realize you can just target them in advance, but sometimes I quite like mouse activated targeting too.
---
If you have bartender you can get the azerite skin for it so you still have all the bars.
---
The only port I really find useful is Theramore to be honest. The other two are just less efficient version of the zeppelins to me.
---
I'll grant that at level 1 thunder bluff to org is a bit of a hike, but level 1 night elves trying to get to eastern kingdoms capitals is even worse imo. You're going to get rekt at least 4 times by crocs on that one. Plus that's only for level 1s, since Taurens will gradually quest there way over to crossroads for that reasonable 10 minute flight. Meanwhile anyone trying to get the menthil flight point is guaranteed to have to do that full nasty run eventually
---
Perhaps p2 threat is ONLY p2 threat. P3 is the continuation of 1
---
Any chance this happening soon ?
---
Really? I feel like that's still not it. Even with settings on "classic" the grass is still moving when you walk through it. I don't think that was the case in classic.
---
Had a change of heart while learning a recipe and moved to cancel it...rip.
---
Go with SP and get some nightfin soup or sage fish delight for some mp5
---
The winner gets to pay thousands of gold, and even if he does win, hes still an enhance shaman.
---
How the fuck are you not 60 already ive been doing 70hour weeks and my mains 60 with epic mount and T1 3set, possibly the easiest version of wow step your game up
---
Ah I wasn't aware it was changed. I only pugged MC a few times back in vanilla, I was more of a leveler and open world PVPer back then. 
---
I was in a guild that one shot almost every boss the first week and then DID one shot every boss the second week. Not hardcores or anything either. So at that point I was like nope, I'm paying a monthly sub to for this. 
---
That said, it was a great month or so and I have no regrets. I might come back when a few more raids are released, or if they do a Burning Crusade server-- I loved BC dungeons, there were far more of them and heroic modes ensured endgame content would stay fresh for awhile.
---
I can see that on Weaponswingtimer if that helps. I set it up so it goes transparent when I am not in combat.
---
Arguably, items earned by a guild activity should go to the person in the guild most capable of helping the guild. We only have half the story but if this story is true then it was a dumb decision to loot it to Kai.
---
It's not that hard for class leaders to figure out the basics of what's what. Are they prioritizing BiS, is their rotation correct, are they using basic raid consumes, are they using the right abilties, are they doing anything glaringly wrong (ass pulls, pulling aggro, AFKing, standing in the fire), are they an asshole?
---
That's all you need for classic, but you'll still find a *shitload* of players failing to meet those very low bars.
---
"Ours is a cycle of hatred"
---
Or just dont play on a PvP server. I've been butting heads with Prepared for years on Darkspear-US because hes always at every horde hub for each expansion wrecking havoc on everyone. Some people dont like it, but organizing a full raid group to take out what is essentially the PvP equivalent of a raid boss is a lot of fun. When hes level 60 expect to see him in Orgrimmar often, which will bring in a constant flow of WPvP attacks on the main city, which is what were playing on PvP servers for.
---
Bye (:
---
Another life lesson: if you're as unpleasant as whoever wrote that diatribe, no one is going to do you any favours.
---
I guess speedrunners would appreciate that everything is so close for so many levels, but yeah it's definitely annoying to be staring at the same mountains for so long. Doesn't help that Barrens and Stonetalon are so visually uninteresting compared to the rest of the world.
---
This 100% does not work, if the dmg is split, the EXP is reduced.
---
Nope, not in the 1.12 patch classic is running. You can catch all the types of fish from regular water if that area can spawn pools for them. Pools give better catch rates, but they drop so few fish (3-5) from a time point it's still almost better to spam fish.
---
You wouldn't have had so many details and shaders on the textures in 2014, but that's alright. 
---
The real deal here is that Blizzard back in the day managed to make a huge world look amazing with some of the lowest polygon meshes in the world. Hammers are essentially hexagons, trees are almost square. Look at those spires beneath Onyxia. Four sides and 3 vertical angles. Boars look like logs with a head and legs. This is what really allowed for the game to be run on most computers back in the day, even if you had an on board graphics card. If you look at just about anything on a white background, it looks like crap. But they had themes to each zone, interesting constructs, and a huge open world that helped you miss the finer details. It's truly one of the games that capitalized on the less is more mindset.
---
Don't forget that we also get more people raiding this time than in vanilla.
---
Are these his [logs](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/character/id/41224414#metric=dps&amp;difficulty=3&amp;partition=1&amp;bybracket=0)?
---
Just to be clear...weapons are stat sticks for feral (which is it's own problem).
---
So the MCP not changing is not an issue.
---
I am a server with 1k queues and nice spots are empty at 5-9AM.
---
Hey, your the one that started throwing shade with your "elitist garbage" saying sub is the only "real rogue spec" and that the other specs are inferior. You look like the elitist to me.
---
Well I'm not healing DM as shadow while leveling strictly from a QoL perspective,  I don't feel like having to chug Mana Pots and drink after every pull even with 250 spirit 100 healing and 17 mp5 buffed.   Maybe it was because my group for ST sucked &lt;150-200dps avg and the tank took a lot of damage last night but, without quest xp it was way slower than solo questing speed.
---
+/- on my numpad
---
You realize some PvP items are BiS for PvE too, right?
---
500, 200, 350. It doesnt matter if your dispels and positioning is poor. I've never ever heard of a dps number requirement for MC lol it sounds silly. You're overthinking it. 
---
P.s can you even sustain 500 dps without any MC gear wtf?? Possibly with 100% preraid bis? Idk. The average has gotta be around like 200 lmao
---
Update them.
---
God, since leet pwnsaucers all replied in Greek here is my version.
---
The amount of damage that helmet offers is directly related to how long the cast is.
---
Max is a 3.5 sec cast will give you 29 damage, the most.
---
A 1.5 second cast will get what ever you ended up with.
---
Are warrior really slow? My buddy carried me in SFK, he's 40 warrior. He was doing whirlwind along with the ravager weapon that procs a spin for big AOE. 
---
At the very least it seemed way faster than when we tried a high level rogue to carry.
---
Start with getting 5+ people who will stick around no matter what and pick your raid times for what works for you guys. Starting with solid tanks helps a lot. Then advertise specific raid times. Only take people that can make those times. pug people for a while. ony doesn't take much more than 25 even in a pug. You can pug quite a few easy mc bosses in 3 hours. Getting to 8/10 MC asap will help recruiting a lot. make sure everyone gets douses.
---
Community problem requires community solution
---
Cool down on Rez timers would hurt this
---
Eye of Sulfuras is the drop in question bud...
---
Warriors in classic are ridiculously gear dependent so dont be surprised that your numbers aren't competitive at level 56. At that level range other classes that are picking up their pre-bis can have a huge jump over you on the meters. 
---
Try switching it up too. Experiment with different talent tree builds. I just dinged 55 and ditched my 2h axe for 2 1h axes and switch from arms to fury and the dps jump was massive.
---
You get full damage on an untalented spell that takes 3.5 to cast.  Instant cast spells are counted as the 1.5s global cooldown they cause.  29/3.5*1.5=12
---
Maybe you sucked before too, but didn't realized it.
---
So...what's the context?
---
That alome is simply not enough.
---
I dont play on Faerlina ass hat
---
You can still play alli on Herod. My alli guild has gotten like 30 arena wins this week at gurubashi.
---
isn't there an option for that in the default floating text settings?
---
and that is exactly why Vanilla is a great game.
---
What you did there? you used logic, planning, took a risk, you understood world is bigger than you and executed a calculated plan.
---
While in retail for many years, it would be RUN TO THEIR FACE AND KILL EM ALL BECAUSE YOU ARE THE MOST POWERFUL THING EVER! and you got the quest item.
---
Thank you. So many people spreading false info about HS being better to use than Sunder. I don't understand where they are getting it from.
---
I feel like BRD is also a bad example...i've run it half a dozen times, I know all the boss strats and I can still get confused about which way we need to go to get to some specific boss.  It's absolutely huge.
---
Probably the oddest thing is him trying to get Ony attuned in BRD tho...
---
It may not be the most responsive, but the priest toolkit is hardly limited. I will grant that I forgot about PWS in my post, which actually does a pretty good job of registering when you expect it to.
---
Not even shield block. Not needed. I usually try and tel tanks that revenge and sunder give more threat than anything else
---
Above 200dps and you’re fine.
---
Mk fanboy. You know I was complimenting the game while sharing my opinion that it needs to stick to the regular schedule for raid releases. But if you want to be a petty little douche because I mentioned cancelling my sub then keep on ;)
---
Guessing he needed to kill that mob for a quest item, it ran/died up there so the OP can't loot it.
---
I always wondered where they got the massive tusks for all their structures...slain pit-lords?
---
It depends.

https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/wow-classic-molten-core-guide/#plink-trash-mobs
---
Assuming this guide is accurate, if you are doing a full clear then the only respawns would be firelords, lava annihilators, and core hound packs. Ancient Core Hounds stop respawning once you kill Magmadar, Lava Surgers stop after Garr, and giants don't respawn. I don't see any mention of it in the guide but killing Rag may effect whether or not things respawn as well.
---
If you only want trash my guess is the best time to do that is at the start of the run; you can clear up to the imp cave and then over to Gehennes, then probably grab a core hound or two respawning on your way back out and then reset the raid.
---
Totally me 2 days ago,  at least I managed to get naked before dying.
---
OP is Kai
---
Nah that's just a mirage.
---
Have a pulse.
---
Its easy af, even go at 58. It really doesn't matter what your dps is, do your classes job and do it well. (Banish, Dispel, Decurse, Totems etc..)
---
Fair point, I thought he was asking more on a general basis.
---
Silithius has almost no purpose atm besides mining and hydraxian rep.
---
I bought the Spyro remake too, love it. It’s like seeing a game how your imagination fills in the voids. Looking back at footage of the original Spyro it looks completely foreign and unidentifiable. I would hate to see wow completely dump it’s art style for hyper real graphics, but it’s also 2019 and it could sure as hell use a face lift.
---
Uh, I wasn't playing with a single addon. Nor are they needed.
---
I don't know if you've actually been in MC but it's ridiculously easy in 2019. Not the dev's fault, but it is comparable to raid finder as I stated, each boss has like one ability of consequence and they're all easy to deal with.
---
I was just continuing the joke as well :P
---
This has been hugely helpful (albeit the twitch streamer inevitable tangents make it longer than I’d like!) , thank you! what other resources will you be using, as mentioned above?
---
join a smaller guild wich is still recruiting and be patient,or suck it up and obey the nepotism guild rules
---
He put more time and effort into the guilds success.
---
For me almost every group on Gehennas has been very good. A couple of bad ones but nothing noteworthy. Probably has to do with perspective and attitude.
---
Maybe a dumb decision, but not an unfair. Don't blame Kai and his build, his way of playing this game or whatever... If he was allowed to roll, definitely not his fault. Why all the hate and rage?
---
Couldn’t I just be in a two man party with my alt and then promote him to leader before logout? Thereby avoiding having to wait for it to “automatically” promote them to lead? Or does it not allow you to give leader to a currently offline player?
---
Age has no relevance to the matter at hand, you’re just rusty and have to put in the hours to get better. I was top 500 eu in pubg a couple weeks back, playing cs on high level faceit and I’m turning 30 next year. Sorry for sounding like a douche but it’s really what it comes down to. Put in the hours good sir
---
LOL wow. I take back everything, you're just an idiot. Checked comments, saw grobb+alliance... Hmm, 500+ guild with 4 raid teams? Let's do a ctrl:F Horrigan and enclave... Ah, yep, there it is.
---
Yeah, I put zero value in your opinions, you're an enclave asshole got it.
---
Market is still huge and it will take months (maybe years) for a market to regulate itself.
---
2 days ago at maraudon I asked priest to use mind sooth on some mobs so we can pass them without agroing... priest was almost crying of joy, how simple yet an effective that 1 spell of a 1 class can become. 
---
That is what clever play means and retail completely forgot about that.
---
The itemization is probably the biggest factor overall.
---
Come play on Stalagg the Alliance love it here
---
Diremaul was released ahead of schedule and there was a big stink about it on this reddit. If sub-60s are going to whine because Blizzard recognizes their endgame players need more content, then this game will suffer for their selfishness.
---
If anyone here is not yet participating in endgame because they're taking their time, they should have no say in its release form or schedule.
---
Probably very high.
---
just add a smiley after every sentence =)
---
*Eye of Sulfuras drops the following week*  
---
&gt;**Loot Council:** Hey remember that guy who wanted this and ragequit?  
---
**Kai:** Yeah, lul  
---
**Loot Council:** Oh well, any hunters need?
---
Every instance portal while levelling was constantly swarmed with horde, so now every time I'm farming mats I spend the entire time converting the local horde lowbie population into a wasteland. To date, no one's actually bothered stopping me.
---
LBRS was really good for me. like 45k xphr in normal pugs. grind rosewine there. UBRS is very bad xp and there isn't much healing stuff in there. DM has tons of healing stuff. It will be the best for gearing and xp. 
---
skinning money is all in ungoro so it depends on devilsaur prices and competition. It's one of the best money makers for a while. you're coming in late most likely so it might be fizzling. as holy you probably can't kill them well.
---
You don’t need to dual wield to tank in fury prot. The build still generates more threat than deep prot even with 1h+shield (as long as you have the crit)
---
Warriors are way better for dungeon clears than rogues or hunters imo
---
I gave about a third of my wealth away in events just after I canceled, to support new players.
---
The rest will be vaulted in case I decide to come back when the game has more to offer. ;)
---
Can confirm, shower at least once a day,started playing at launch and am level 46.
---
The other reply is likely right but I first read it as the mob didn't drop the key it was supposed to, since chat says he looted.
---
In 2006 there was an enhancement shaman god on my server (Gorgonnash - US), who achieved rank 14 with nothing more then trash loot nobody else wanted from MC. Getting into a group with him was a guaranteed win in any BG - the dude absolutely steamrolled everything. I'll never forget how utterly disgusting that guy was in rank 14 gear, and he didn't even need hand of rag to do it.
---
Its not possible anymore, and this is precisely why shadow reflectors exist.
---
Ally salt is huge on this sub lately.
---
Rockbiter also has a higher average dps most levels
---
Yes there is a PVP hit cap for each class. I think most are 5% but most class guides should tell you.
---
gnoooomes!!
---
I would be pissed too, if I see someone online every 7th day for an hour of MC, only half preBiS geared getting prime loot.
---
corrupt LC confirmed
---
That kind of assumption makes you about as dumb as a bag of doorknobs.
---
Meanwhile lotuses are 80-90g on Gehennas, and a lot of guilds pop flasks and everything for raids.

The subreddit is toxic af, but isnt representative of the community as a whole... Hopefully
---
200dps will put you solidly into the happy average that no one will bat an eye at.
---
Being sixty for better hit is really the best thing you can do. That and knowing the mechanics
---
Yes I’m aware. The point is ferals don’t scale like other melee and that’s in large part because weapon upgrades have little effect on damage output. The fact MCP remains strong through the  phases is an issue because it’s a symptom of the same issue
---
I have a 52 ele should I be using ES or FS in my burst combo?
---
&gt;  Or does it not allow you to give leader to a currently offline player?
---
I want to see someone name themselves Grimreaper or something and their whole shtick is to just walk around as a ghost and stand on people's bodies when they die.
---
And for another $50 you can get armor for that horse.
---
Most of the other consumables are pretty standard, though. Pretty much everyone is packing potions and stuff. So, no delta there.   
---
You can start farming pummellers while leveling, too. You can pretty easily stealth run him in the mid 30s. Decent gold for the non-pummeller drops. If you need gold anyways, it's a pretty solid option.
---
I just use my mount hotkey. It illuminates when I'm out of combat.
---
Because I don’t need the 2g from a BoP item bad enough to need on it, but I could use the 500g I make from selling freezing band to buy my bis BoE.  By greeding on a BoE you are literally just giving that person gold.
---
Ok boomer
---
Well, there’s a little trick I can share. You need a 60 paladin. Or warrior but this doesn’t work nearly as well. The level 60 pulls as much as he can in a dungeon with melee mobs, off the top of my head something like VC/RFC —&gt; stocks/RFK —&gt; SM armory. The 60 then generates a bit of threat without dealing ANY damage. The best way is by healing as a pally, using concentration aura and the holy talent to avoid pushback. This also allows bigger pulls, but shouts work too. Then, the low level leaves the group and tags everything with an aoe spell or dynamite. The 60 kills everything and re-invites the other before the minute timer expires. I’ve seen it reported somewhere that this method can achieve level 35 in 9ish hours. Don’t go spoiling the secret though. For some reason this worked in retail until wotlk but no one knows about it.
---
It's not really a clear. You go in the back door, stealth to the boss, murder the boss, stealth out. It's only a few minutes. Lockout timer is the main obstacle to doing it faster.
---
Holy what the fuck. I hadn’t played this game in 8 years and had an account full of 70 twinks because all I did was PvP (I hate rpgs tbh). My friend talked me into trying classic again this past month and I thought it was okay but am not going to continue playing until battlegrounds open up. Anyways- all of my 70 twinks... a Paladin, rogue, hunter, priest, and mage geared with BiS shit from back in the day are now absolutely useless thanks to the set bonuses being “legacy” and I couldn’t figure out what the fuck they did to all the talent trees and just logged off. 
---
Mannnn I am probably not going to touch this game again after my month ends :/
---
even with classic settings it is still a lot different than vanilla
---
&gt; Besides that, everyone else was a sick cunt and it’s a fucking shame.
---
Is that a compliment in this context?
---
That dude just didnt want to put together the group but rather join one that's already been started.
---
It’s a pretty common pvp thing. Get ambushed and who am I?
---
Man your comment history is pathetic.
---
for example : Curse of recklessness. an ability that you dont use %95 of the gaming time, but when you use 1 time on that mob that was fleeing to pull the other pack, when you healer was oom, means the world. That "useless" spell, becames an "OP imba" spell.
---
Don’t compare other servers to Herod.
---
You must live an incredibly dull life if you consider that post a spectacle! 
---
Did you miss the part where I said I had a great time and that the community is great and the experience was fun? Because my OP wasn't a shitpost meant to create drama, it was simply meant to point out that the current endgame is barebones and people selfish sub60s who think they should have a say in raid release dates will only hurt the game. I was expressing an opinion directly relevant to classic WoW and to this sub, and guess what? That's exactly what reddit is for! xD
---
Please be a little smarter in the future. ;)
---
The circle must go on!
---
I’m curious as to how many times you have personally cleared MC in an hour in classic? If you have, that’s great and good for you. I fail to see the point of your second comment...are you arguing Felheart doesn’t look badass compared to Felcloth? 
---
This word you use “transmog” means absolutely nothing to me. I only played WoW during Vanilla &amp; TBC (probably before you were even born). So yeah, your final comment is also useless to me. 
---
I repeat my last sentence from earlier; Just enjoy the game.
---
He is already respeccing to resto as he should to meaningfully contribute to the raid. 
---
Once he has R14 gear, he will either be the nightfall bitch or back to resto he goes.
---
R13 gear is not even good for enhancement PvE, because all you do is stack +agi and +crit as much as possible, igoring all other stats in order to keep flurry uptime high in order to dispense nightfall procs. 
---
For a warrior R14 is marvelous, for a mage is quite strong with spellblade etc.
---
An enhancement shaman? Maybe gloves are decent.
---
Hitting 40 and immediately dropping everything to hearth and get your mount might feel a bit more rewarding honestly..!
---
i'm using Elvui and just got to lv. 10 w/ a hunter. done the pet training quests, but where/how do i get to the beast training window?
---
do i need to have a beast that has 0/positive TPs?
---
I swear, everyone does this. They're simultaneously every spec at once when talking about matchups. I have a friend that every time he talks about PvP matchups with his hunter he somehow has beastial wrath, scatter shot, and wyvern sting all at the same time (and he was level 30 at the time, lol) and obstacles don't exist.
---
I think their point is that sometimes bad things happen, taunt gets resisted and you can't get the heavy hitting mob off the healer...CC'd mob breaks free earlier than expected and your taunt is on CD.
---
I know hunters get ALOT of blame, the real truth is we all screw up sometimes.  Just about the only role that doesn't fuck up at least once per dungeon is the melee dps and the healer...and even those can screw up.
---
The trick is being able to tell the difference between a mistake and a bad player.
---
RP PVP it is!
---
Why is he even in a guild as a raider with an attitude like that?
---
You make it sound like he didnt cry everytime he was camped. This dude is pathetic, I faced him during all of MoP. He ended up lagging the server a ton of times when I was raiding, it was not fun at all.
---
That person said they are going for rank14, so I'm guessing they dont work, or they are able to play 12+hours a day while working.
---
It's not just about clearing it but also clearing it in a reasonable time without any wipes
---
You cannot make an offline character leader, thus requiring you to swap characters and wait 2 minutes for leader to automatically switch so you can reset instance.
---
Obviously if he plans on going R14.

He was about ready to jerk himself off to how much fun it was.

After I get my T1 gear (which, lol will probably take a while) will there be a reason to keep Holy Priest spec until Phase 3 or can I safely switch over to shadow spec for PVP until then?
---
Because DM has released early it seems like there won’t be a big PVE update for a couple months unless I’m missing something, right?
---
PW:S is bad tho 99% of the time
---
Pretty sure it doesn’t work in Classic. Even if you get the tag, if someone else does all the damage you get significantly less exp
---
That's basically what I did. Made it to 57 just off arena runs.
---
Click the train pet ability in your spellbook

it seems to me like: the one who /gquit is demonstrably less reliable than the one who is still in the guild? so they made the right choice?

I think you've taken a light hearted comment the way I would expect elitist trash to.
---
Look at your plethora of downvotes before you question others intelligence, child. You are making a spectacle of it because you need the attention because you have deep issues with what a pathetic loser you are. Your parents hate you, chicks abhor you and mostly you are a piece of shit. Thanks for taking all that is terrible, i.e. you out of Azeroth and thus leaving it a much better place. In closing go fuck yourself entitled snowflake and know I blocked you. So while you just read every word I wrote your reeeeeee will fall on deaf ears loser bitch!
---
Depends on what  rank they are. Just use whichever does the most damage at the time.
---
Do MC.
---
Thats your best test.
---
Nobody's telling all the rogues and casters to give up and reroll, right?

Or it could be that the item always sells at 4-5g and you just decided to sell it at 10g when no one else is selling. See this happen on my server all the time. People usually also won't buy unless they are desperate.
---
I like it
---
We had to do this to a member in our guild. He had half of his pre-raid bis gear, he was obviously under performing. We told him many times we'd run him through dungeons just to get him at that lvl. He didn't put in the effort, so we didn't either.
---
It goes both ways tbh.
---
You are legit brain dead bud. Get over it
---
Yeah resistance totems can be handy.  Personally you will USUALLY only have one at a time that you'd use, so if you have one keybind for your generic "resistance totem" you could sub in whichever totem you'd be using via your spellbook at that time.  For example-
---
In Molten Core / BWL use Fire resist
---
AQ- nature resist
---
Naxx-Frost resist
---
Resistance totems can also be useful in PVP possibly, although personally I would only consider using frost resist versus a frost mage, and only then if you were forced into a longer, defensive engagement say where you're a healer and have a DPS with you and are fighting a mage+another DPS combo.  Even still, some of the resistance totems are different totem types.  Like Frost resistance requires your FIRE totem, so you couldn't use searing or fire nova.  Nature res uses air totem (so no windfury or grace of air) and fire resist uses water totem, so no mana spring/tide or healing stream.  All have their uses potentially though. 
---
You could also do some more "PVP" or "PVE" centric keybinds.  Chain heal is rarely or never used in PVP, usually you will want as much healing as possible on single target to prevent their death, whereas chain heal is a more mana efficient heal that provides a lot of folks with SOME  healing.  
---
Your question about windfury is another way you could save a bind or two.  Personally I would remove rockbiter off my bars once I get WF because I would never use it (I don't like shaman tanking!).  But rockbiter CAN have uses say if you are in Sunken Temple as enhance DPS, you'll want to try and stay 2nd place on threat so you can offtank when he sleeps the tank.  But generally I would go windfury for most mobs and flametongue for targets that have higher hp/armor or if you're using a 1h weap/shield while leveling.  Flametongue damage ignores armor so if the target has high armor windfury is reduced by a relatively large amount.
---
Oh...I thought he meant the entrance to MC within BRD... those are vastly different things.
---
Not a dumb reason for them.
---
Price to sell my dude
---
Transfer. EZ.
---
You got downvoted, but this has to be it. This is like cooking a perfect medium rare steak and dumping ketchup all over it. I feel bad for the devs who put a ton of work into the game only to then have to add 400 ms artificial lag to the whole thing.
---
Whats your point? Its a one button spam spec, logs means gears, buff and consumables, its more like an effort ranking
---
I can confirm the enchantment remains after the conversion
---
For real instead of wasting everyone’s time lrn2capitalism
---
Four hot elementals and a dark iron?
---
But, does he raid?
---
As a warrior, it really wasn't honestly (have my mount now). The impact WW had on my leveling pace for the next 15 levels was insane. Not to mention it is always on and looks so epic!
---
Right, you don't even need to clear any trash.  You can just stealth (in certain spots) run to the boss and kill and then run back out.  It's easy.
---
Screw those guys man,  have fun.
---
~20g
---
How would that work out? &lt;APES&gt; is an alliance guild as well.
---
I'm not sure if this is the reason, but I thought I read that some add-ons don't integrate well with others. I installed roughly 20 add-ons or so, but have to disable almost all of them if I want to run TukUI without getting some Lua errors constantly.
---
Anyone know if this has to do with something else? I don't really understand the dependencies and such.
---
The reason why you can have a night like that in old wow but not retail is at the crux of your comment at the end: "minimum amounts of xp but we had a fantastic night". In old wow, things like levels and xp and pretty gear and items are bait. They aren't you're reward. Our mind wants to obtain them but the process of acquiring then leads to the emergent ability of the game to foster and support amazing community interaction and personal accomplishments. 
---
Misunderstanding this dymanic lead to retail wow. People began to errantly think the fun and magic of an mmo was coming from xp and items. You can trivial quest nowadays, see numbers and xp gains in the millions, get multiple epics per day. But it's just not as satisfying as what an MMO should be. It's because the bait became the reward when the real reward stopped being fostered in the name of "easy of access", "quality of life" , etc.
---
&gt; Wait, did you guys give your EoS to an unreliable player who isnt active and doesn't contribute to the guild? Or did I read this wrong.
---
I was in a raid in 2005 that gave it to a brand new arms warrior in green over objections of the LC to give it to a reliable ret paladin who was literally always there. The GM/ML/RL (all the same person) said, "we dont raid with dps paladins". 
---
The warrior never showed up to another raid.
---
Right, if they’re really undercutting them they should buy the available stock and repost it for the asking price.
---
Let's say the only important flask is flask of the titans.
---
It "costs" 1,000g on the AH
---
Also, 
---
- No one is able to camp the spawn point of black lotus
---
- the guild is not able to sell spots/BoEs
---
So, the guild charges the raiders to pay for the flask (incl. MT)
---
40 Raiders
---
1,000g
---
10g/Raider = 400g
---
20g/Raider = 800g
---
25g/Raider = 1,000g
---
So, it costs you 25g/2 Hours of raiding, so 13g/hour to be allowed to raid. Obvi, repairs and the like will increase, but i don't think it's a fuckton.
---
if you are in a guild that requires everyone to raid, then find a new guild.
---
That's true to some extent but like I told our guild the other night when onslaught girdle dropped, we aren't anywhere near having aggro/threat issues yet so there is no reason for the tanks to be rolling on it yet.

You're a hero, thanks!
---
My thoughts exactly!
---
As far as I have heard there is a normalisation going on in BG'S.
---
Prime example of the futility of this sub.
---
One of the coolest things about classic is the friends you make along the way. Some of the coolest people I played WoW with aren't the IRL friends I went in with, but the folks we made friends with in game. You don't need pals to start up, you'll start running instances with folks and build new friendships.
---
It feels good to use niche abilities, especially since dungeons might be one of the main places for them to actually see use. As a hunter main the basic rotation of auto shot, aimed shot, and multi-shot if it's safe (and sometimes even that is excluded because of sheeps and stuff) is *incredibly* dull for hours on end. But some of my most fun moments as that class have been when I've sent my pet to effectively off-tank (or at minimum tie up a mob before dying) during a clutch moment, or stuff like a cluster of mobs approaching that I can catch in a feign death + explosive trap. I also love the fact that I seem to be one of the few classes with the ability to slow an enemy from a distance by way of concussive shot. It feels super nice to avoid an enemy retreat pull by slowing them down enough for others to pummel them down in time.
---
Yep. Aussie slang. One of those "call your mates cunt and call actual cunts mate" things.
---
&gt;It’s great to have a skill roof to work towards, not maxing it just by spamming one button.
---
Shots fired
---
they probably gave it to somebody whos going to stick around
---
The nochanged aregument is null and void considering the shit they changed.
---
Release the game with no layers, progressive itemization, early talents, erc, then the nochanges argument has some weight to it. Otherwise it is in no way a justification for the batching window we have
---
I took a few steps back so that the shadow bolt travel time would let me cast part of the fear without enough time to dismount and interrupt for the rest of the ~0.5 sec. Also with batching you can cast a spell in the same 'batch' when the CC gets applied to you, so he casted it just as the fear got applied. You can do the same thing on retail except the window is much narrower, I think 20ms instead of 400ms, so it's much less likely to happen, whether intentional or unintentional. The loose batching window just makes the game feel laggy though, as it delays actions like interrupts quite a bit.
---
Will be more effected by raiders knowledge of the mechanics than raid avg dps.
---
The attempt to nova is my favorite part.
---
Both, but as I'm a dps class there's little point in trying to form a group as it's dependent on a tank joining.  Tanks tend to form their own groups, so I try to join one of those.
---
What’s the question?
---
Perhaps there is some truth to dynamic respawns kicking in, but I think this is the bigger factor.  The peak of the Devilsaur market has come and gone.  Devilsaur is not a consumable in the way that herbs are.  Most of the people who are going to hit 58/60 already have.  Demand is only going to go down for Devilsaur Leather.
---
Lotus on the other hand presents a different problem.  Its value will only ever increase as new difficult content is unlocked.
---
Yup, ain’t nobody got time to go to dustwallow marsh, especially since sometimes (or at least in my case) the alt who needs the first aid recipe isnt even a high enough level for that zone yet
---
And the mage one particularly
---
Soon ^tm , I need that coldrage dagger
---
I think the speed runners say the have way is 44 in terms of amount of time spent.
---
If 10 lions come into your favorite sheep restaurant, it’s a lion restaurant now.
---
Man, I totally looked around for the quest at the bottom of the bridge when I jumped. I knew there had to be a quest item, or a chest or something at the bottom.
---
doesn't work. You get the percentage of the damage you deal in exp. For instance.. if you do 50% damage you get 50% xp if you have tagged the mob and someone outside of the party helps you kill it.
---
The quickest way to level from 15-30 is to have a level 60 power clear stockades for you and to have people around level 20 in the party as filler for the group bonus. You get more exp the lower the average level is of the group
---
If world PVP is boring, classic is boring
---
It's because of some very old elitist jerks posts regarding best tps and how fast weapons can produce the highest threat  because the threat modifier on HS is a flat amount.
---
 The post was accurate when considering a fight like Vaelatrasz where you will always be able to HS due to rage cap, but it doesn't hold true in other content where rage is a premium. I'm currently a deep prot impale build wearing 6% hit, but still with pretty decent mitigation (no mail pieces) and I definitely have fights where I'm pretty rage starved (Onyxia for example). If I'm low on rage I want to be doing everything I can to optimize the amount of threat I can produce per rage.
---
If anyone else still here, my math works out for 4 or more hunters to use Hunter's mark, otherwise a "bottom dps" warlock is going to get more DPS from a corruption.  One hunter gets 110 AP from rank 5 hunter's mark.  
---
    110 ap / (14 ap / 1 dps) = ~8 dps.
---
You would need four hunters to get under 32 dps, which would equal the dps expected on a 150 shadow damage warlock corruption damage over a fight.
---
i would say it is a double whammy since you are talking about both 3 times the playerbase but also more percentage wise of the player base are going to be raid and raiding end game than in vanilla. that is also going to hit the black lotus market super hard.
---
i mean just trying to mine thorium is impossible and still arcane crystals have insanely high prices.
---
You can only receive heals not damage from outside help. Roll an aoe class and find a healer friend.
---
Classic isn't "from 2004". It uses modern graphics settings, just with lower-poly models.
---
Exactly, the one who /gquit was the reliable one who contributed. The none deserving one got it. (According to post)
---
ok that kinda makes sense but i wouldn't have thought of that XD 
---
thanks.
---
None lol I'm just bored at work and want to talk and read wow!
---
Very eye-catching.
---
Hi its me.
---
I'm here to validate your unhappiness by confirming that &lt;Dire Nail of Power&gt; is not a mage weapon.
---
I hate both sides of it... one side of me tells me that the poster shouldn't be so fired up about loot in a game that won't be worth anything other than "wow look at me" in a year's time.  But the other part of me agrees that Kai is a complete douchebag and shouldn't have gotten anything.
---
Honestly if I got this pissed off about loot I would just stop playing the game... it doesn't sound remotely healthy.
---
Alliance do not pvp wtf you talking about.
---
I wonder how many of the people who pushed for this garbage still support it.
---
i was lookign in beast mastery for it, it's in genreal tab
---
 no
---
all is viable but is trash
---
Somebody missed out on truestrike shoulders.
---
notice the comment I'm replying to. That's why I said "I don't get your analogy" by bringing in a counter example.
---
You can always pvp as healer
---
Hey next time you can just post:
---
&gt;I don't understand itemization REEEEEE
---
and it'll save us from reading a few sentences.
---
It has saved my ass so many times. It’s like playing with a UAV in COD(kinda).
---
Nice, but how is that rewarding? I never did my WW quest because I didn't want to be carried by a high level. The wind elementals are hard even at same level. 
---
The quest to get Berserker stance is rewarding though.
---
If you read the story he was allowed to roll because of the position on the loot council. So he essentially got to decide that he was allowed to roll. Like I said, it's only 1/2 the story but if we are taking what is presented as fact, Kai shouldn't have been allowed to roll and probably shouldn't even be on the loot council.
---
Idk, I can see both sides of it. If this dude was as committed as he said and got shafted in return like this, I'm not surprised he's a bit pissed.
---
I wouldn't call it a favor if the other dude genuinely didn't deserve it at all.
---
Notice the comment I was replying to. That's why I said I didn't get the analogy and brought up a counter example.
---
That doesn't make any sense
---
KILL BOSS
---
Plenty of alliance on Herod.  People just come here to whine after they get ganked and insert lots of hyperbole.
---
Look at it this way, you jumped ahead a good distance instantly... if you were headed to Gadget....
---
Works best for Druid, with regrowth+rejuv.
---
Reddit: minmaxers are ruining the game
---
Also Reddit on EVERY "look at what I got post": lol it's not even that good
---
The ultimate rogue play is to stock up on lock boxes, tell guildies to mail you any lockboxes and you'll mail them back. If they send you a lock box with good gold value send them back one you have stocked with shit gold value:)
---
More nonsensical dribble. Lol I came to you? Thats like someone standing in the middle of the street yelling stupid shit then complaining when someone comments. It’s a public forum, you brought your dumbass shit for all to see.
---
because you have player agency 
---
where you go what you do all totally up to you
---
quality? Honestly I don't see many benefits to being on a bigger realm at this point besides epic world battles and if you have an imbalance that is pretty much thrown out the window.
---
All of the servers are already larger than the biggest servers back in classic. I play on Thunderfury and it's difficult to farm certain mats. Essence of Water are up to 22g + after being moved to a single layer. I can't imagine what the mega servers will be like.
---
I had the same experience, really loved this
---
It's most obnoxious on Druids when you exit a building and have to wait literally 2-3 seconds to use travel form.
---
The one who /gquit was ___not___ the reliable one.  You can tell hew was not reliable because he /gquit
---
Okay. Suppose we all really value tier pieces at 20 DKP.
---
The warlocks collude so they all get their tier pieces for 2 DKP each, and get a whole set for 16 DKP.
---
The mages don't collude, they bid against each other honestly, so they get all their tier pieces for 20 DKP each, and get their whole set for 160 DKP.
---
Because the warlocks colluded, they all now have 144 DKP more than the mages, and can comfortably beat them every time on the best caster loot.
---
Have you all noticed that ability order depends on where it is on the pet's hotbar?
---
Anecdotal of course.
---
Most important tip: always have lead so you can kick assholes
---
It's better than I thought. I went slam build thinking I'd be bottom of the warriors in DPS. Not the case at all. I'm usually middle of the pack of the warriors on bosses, occasionally top. Seems to me it's more about whoever gets the most crits on a pull lol.
---
I'd love to be a mage with some sapper charges
---
If warriors weren’t supposed to wear leather then blizzard would have designed it too be restricted in that way. But they didn’t. Man up.
---
&gt;Spell batching is so stupid that I just want to stab myself
---
The knife will be covered with blood, cooldown will be used, but you wont have a stab wound
---
I'm very limited on what I can search at work, however, just going off of memory from Vanilla... here are a couple of thoughts (fwiw, I'm horde). 
---
Keep in mind you'll require a group (or a healer at a minimum if you're fine dying):
---
1. The dragons required for Onyxia attunement. I *think* they're boss level - not sure.
---
2. Teremus, the dragon in  Blasted Lands. 
---
3. Isn't there a boss in Blasted Lands on top of some spot you teleport up to?
---
4. What about the dragons in Tanaris near Caverns of Time. Unsure if they're friendly or not.
---
5. King Mosh (think thats his name) - rare dinosaur or w/e in Un'goro.
---
6. Volchan in Burning Steppes perhaps? Don't think he's a skull though.
---
Correction of the correction of the correction: it does convert. Wowhead incorrectly lists the rewards for some quests as the gold value including the conversion in addition to the xp and base gold reward, so my tests were flawed; I was expecting more gold than the listed value.
---
Because it's a legitimate question lol
---
just wanna point out you've already softened your stance. went from never happening to just not worth it right now.
---
no game, even wow, can last forever. they'll have to eventually think about something new
---
I'm definitely going to bind the skull marker. That's a great idea, thanks! I haven't gone too in depth with macros, but I'm thinking it's time.
---
lmao
---
Of the eagle
---
May be true for ally. For horde, threat is a constant consideration.
---
Im doing 500 dps single target Ony. Cleave is around 900.
---
-rogue
---
Our warriors are doing 650 dps single target Ony, and 1200 Cleave lel
---
This is the classic wow subreddit. And blizzard let’s me roll on it, and by your logic, that makes it chill. Good talk.
---
There is one thing I want to point out here as a rogue, if you LoS pull a pack it’s perfectly safe and advisable for me to open up on a caster mob and have the other DPS kill it while you are tanking the melee guys. 
---
Between stuns and kicks, caster mobs don’t actually do much of any damage to a rogue tanking them as long as the group is killing it first.
---
Unlike the subject in your meme format, you're not open to have your mind changed.
---
You have given no premise as to why you think shamans shouldn't tank other than your own opinion that isnt backed up by any supporting arguments. So if you wanna delve into this, I'm more than happy to discuss.
---
This makes sense, as I played way more LoD than D2 lol
---
There’s fun in the simplicity imo. It’s why I returned for Classic. And let me tell ya, I’m having a ball leveling.
---
I appreciate that. Ive had people quit dungeon runs because we decide to kill Golem Lord to get second wind. People just wanna do arena/anger and reset. 
---
I refuse to help people farm anger if they won't kill golem. 
---
And I am afraid to do ubrs again after I was chastized for wanting to need on a BiS for my shadow spec because I was healing. How else is a shadow priest suppose to get gear? I have to heal or I can't find groups.
---
RUINED
---
How long does an UBRS run take?  Multiply that by the number of runs it'll take to get the weapons.  
---
You can still compare the time it takes to get Pummelers vs the time it takes to get Dal'Rends.  If someone spent as much time as it takes to get Dal'Rends on pummelers, they probably would never need to farm pummelers again.  You always need pummelers, but you don't use infinite.  You use a finite number per week.
---
This is a very rare occasion apparently. However both me and my friend had it in the same day. 
---
I was actually AFKing so as I came back I was absolutely clueless why I was standing in the middle of nowhere 
---
Just Blizzard trolling people and calling it a bug
---
Sounds like they lost a _toxic_ member to me.
---
We weren't using DKP. It was just everyone gets a piece of gear per raid per week (with exceptions, of course). We've already downed rag no problem so it's not a matter of needing to progress.
---
Agreed.
---
It honestly just sounds like someone literally opened the window, found people who weren't max level, and kicked them without even touching base beforehand or establishing that this could happen. 
---
Personally, I would laugh it off and move on with my day, but I can see how that would rankle for some people.
---
closest thing is going to be pugs
---
I highly doubt there will be many upstart guilds trying to do MC for the first time when the later raids are already out
---
God damn how long are your raids taking?
---
No I mean community isn't important. Plenty of games are multiplayer about solving problems together. Community isn't necessary in WoW because the game is good. 
---
The worse a game is the more it has to be about the community.
---
Blizzard doesn't scale the well with frost damage gear.  It's far more important to control the mobs so en extra cone of cold or blizzard will be far more useful.  Also, the stam gear helps you survive any mistakes.
---
Or they're a garbage guild.
---
They're forced to buckle to the group of 9 because they'd lose a 1/4 of the raid. Bad players or no, that hurts. 
---
Half of all loot council guilds are obviously corrupt. The other half is better about it.
---
:DDDDDD Ty for the waste of time
---
for the curious: mobs can't dodge, parry, or block attacks from behind. by going behind the target you eliminate those leaving "miss", which is why +hit gear is stressed so strongly.
---
I’m actually not positive it works in dungeons. I’ve used the strategy successfully in the open world but haven’t tried dungeons yet. If you get confirmation either way I’d be interested in knowing
---
A middle aged Dad probably has kids that dont want his attention cause of puberty so he has plenty of time to play ;)
---
If I gank a low level, I’m trying to pull level 60’s from your guild out to fight. 
---
But there is also the chance that there are people in your guild who have got your guild marked as KOS.
---
That's why I will do big undercuts on stuff I just don't want to bother with for a quick sale.  The ones cornering the market are happy, I'm happy.  Because the other side of the conversation if they don't want to buy the severe undercut items is "are you saying you are overpricing the items to screw everyone?"
---
Sure man. Have fun spending 3 hours in lfg while those dumbass fury warriors slap on a shield and get instantly into any dungeon they want and walk out wearing all your leather.
---
The DPS differential between the two is so great that it most likely makes up for not having sword spec. I'd just roll with mace spec for PvP until you can get a better weapon.
---
I think AtlasLoot does it with one of it's newer updates.
---
ok
---
While BiS is BiS the game isn't hard and unless you're in a top % Guild you could probably turn up in MC with full t0 gear. Well, depending on your role ofc.
---
There’s a quest for berserker stance? Lol I though I just learned it
---
What does rank 14 have to do with this? Everyone getting to r14 must have sulfuras? Lol
---
He /gquit due to frustration of putting forth a lot of effort and not being properly rewarded (or rather, someone undeserving being rewarded in his stead).
---
Can't blame the guy for quitting. If I worked a job where I gave 110% and dude sleeping in the breakroom gets the promotion, I'm out.
---
This is correct. Bliz sp coefficient is terrible. Better off with the health from Stam, and the mana from int.
---
Your own brain.
---
Topped heals in some MC boss fights as 31/0/20 in a pve try had guild. Lol
---
Much better for designing your own stat weights as well, depending on what you are attempting to do.
---
Feralas is a cool zone. Once you get to 48+ you can make good exp grinding the harpies in the north west. They are plenty, all very squishy and not dangerous apart from the casters.
---
Okay woosh man. Jesus christ. i'm talking about what pthomsen91 said:
---
&gt;If anyone else is buying it the timer resets
---
He completely ignored what you said:
---
&gt;Are you sure it's 10-15 minutes? I'm getting over 30 minutes now from the last one. Im by myself too
---
So my person opinion isn’t enough of a reason? and I’m not the one trying to change people’s minds you are supposed to change mine with your supporting arguments. That’s how this works.
---
Yeah... you don't understand how this game's gearing works at all.
---
The game's itemization makes a trade for more stats on lighter gear, where heavier gear has more armor. But since DPS is so critical to a warriors job, even tanking, this means the situation becomes a complicated trade off.
---
Further, only 20% or so of warriors are actually allowed to tank in raids. Because of how itemizing works, warriors need leather gear to DPS.
---
Your logic about vendoring works perfectly fine for BoE gear. But there is no good items to buy for most slots at 60.
---
If I know what I haved sogned for you totally go for Alliance for the best racial in the game: Night Elf juicy bonus movement speed while dead.
---
He *was* reliable upto the point the guild made a bad decision causing him to reconsider which guild he wanted to be apart of. I’m just assuming (as I have no other evidence of the events) that the post tells the truth. If 1 person puts in more time, contributed to the guild, was online more, farmed dungeons with guild and got preBiS, that would make him more reliable then someone with weird talents that never changed them after having them brought up. Obviously if you see the events after, but that was irrelevant before the rolls happened.
---
As alliance I absolutely hate feralas
---
Under 3.5.
---
Don't transfer away. Fighters that prefer to whine and run wouldn't have been useful fighters for the war on your server anyways.
---
They didn't realize that reddit will believe everything posted at face value..... its pretty pathetic actually.
---
I can only imagine the original legendary lines at the start of Legion felt that way.
---
Op specifically stated that’s what he was doing. Also, as a warlock, I use immolate to bait out silence/shocks so I can have shadow tree open to fear.
---
is there a way to autoloot pickpockets or nah?
---
What server? :o
---
Id love to be on an overpopulated server. I chose a popular one for this reason, and my faction ended up transferring and it's much less now.
---
Stalagg alliance is where it's at
---
I used to do some sort of client side thing to make my mount look like barons. You’d have to look it up
---
I think blizzard is seeing how many people want this kind of gameplay. You'd have to assume future retail expansions will be affected by the success of classic
---
What are you gonna do if somebody kills you there too? Whine again and wait for paid transfers?
---
I really don't get how people think they're gonna fix a problem by making it worse.
---
The Harvey Weinstein of warriors.
---
The people who think bigger realms are better are like lemmings.
---
bruh, i must not spend nearly as much time on that game as you if you're worried about a reality of actually waiting 3 hours.
---
Imma be fine lol.
---
So you NEED it to vendor it? Or let it sit in your bags? Because obviously if a warrior NEEDs on an item they "NEED" to equip it. 
---
You definitely sound like:
---
A) An Ally
---
B) The person no one fuckin likes
---
And C) A straight fuckin' loser who is crying because someone beat his roll on a virtual item which there are unlimited of.
---
Yeah good talk, make everyone blacklist your stupid ass until you are forced to re-roll. You are doing the community a favor.
---
No problem bud. You clearly have zero understanding of context, scale, and relative effort. You simply cannot compare what your guild is doing and apply it to a typical MC raiding guild. That's what makes you sound self-important. You literally just said you have subordinates. Get a grip, it's just a game.
---
The whole game is pixels. Why are you even here?
---
Facts. But I'm Horde so I'm biased lol
---
Thats basically what loot council is, but maybe if you want a sword and johnny wants a dagger LC will consider that  and that might mean johnny gets 2 pces on week.
---
Pally loot!
---
I don’t know you tell me :)
---
I'm with you on this one, been spamming rfd for the dagger and my job in groups is perma cc that casters zZz
---
Rogue can't equip Savage Gladiator's chest. Or Lioonheart.
---
I just keep my mouth shut unless were wiping, wow is a game of egos and Id rather finish the dungeon suboptimally than risk drama; I also never know how to word unsolicited advice and have it not sound condescending.
---
Unless theyre an asshole or ask for advice, then I just go all in.
---
&gt; I decided to level a mage   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; I plan to aoe grind   
---
&gt; Googled a few ~~aoe grinds~~ guides 
---
I feel like you just described 90% of all the mages that currently play this game.
---
Lol Dude. Just take a fkn shower lmao
---
So......Im gonna keep needing that plate tho
---
It doesn't work unless you abuse batching to trick the game into thinking the crit happened while standing. If you start moving when you were sitting while the crit comes in during that 400ms window, it'll trigger an auto crit but also count you as standing, proccing reckoning/redoubt.
---
It's also very inconsistent, seemingly dependent on the ebb and flow of the server as it'll typically not work for long periods of time but then randomly work every time. It's ok for soloing in PvE but I wouldn't try it in PvP.. but just the exploit, Reckoning is great in PvP in general though if you know how to manipulate it properly.
---
Why are you party chatting to yourself?
---
It's hard to slow down and take my time. Everything and everyone seems to be in a rush, myself included to a degree. I have no idea when my wife is going to want me off to do things. I have found more groups than not that are willing to boot me and look for a tank in LFG for half an hour than slow down when I ask. The odd time I find a group that'll slow down, buy I still get frazzled. I have 0 confidence in my tanking ability right now. My guild has been pretty good at either slowing down with me, or someone stepping in to take the reins when I get overwhelmed.
---
This so much.
---
Fixed it.
---
Yeah I've seen the stitches kite in action myself.
---
If you read your own post you'd see you actually needed clarification about MC and asked about Onyxia. Things you could easily google and not waste other people's time on. 
---
Settle down man, I don't think you can call someone 12 then use the phrase mentally deficient retailtard. Also, I don't play retail right now, as previously stated I play Classic. Look mate, ask anyone, raiding is the biggest part of wow endgame. 
---
From your post it's clear you've probably played wow for a couple of years max. So really don't have a clue what you're talking about. Enjoy the game how you want to, but I suggest you try be a little more open minded about the whole thing. 
---
Also, lmao at NFL being primitive fanboyism, now you just sound like someone who had a hard time at school. Peace.
---
Never underestimate the ability of redditors to gullibly believe everything in a 1-sided screed like this.
---
What are you supposed to say to acknowledge someone when they tell you they already know the thing you told them?
---
I'm at 26-33k on high pop
---
Damn, this post made you big mad lol
---
A.) Horde
---
B.) Everyone ADORES me
---
C.) Straight up badass lol 
---
Take a chillaxative you jabroni. You seem like you take that game way more seriously than i do. Sound like you haven't been drained in years lmfao
---
Ive used a wolf from lvl 10 to 60. I still use it. Put training points mostly into armor, resistance, and growl
---
I used the camp north of Grom'gol and the camp south of Nesingwary (the small one) as both of these have mobs that are at a minimum - 33. If you have good weapon/gear it's doable. By the time I was done grinding all 30 out, I was at least 31/32 depending on RNG. 
---
Spend \~10g and buy the charms and then finding a high level to  just kill the one mob.
---
I felt like I only *required* help once I went into the big troll area.
---
RIP Jens. This one gave me chills.
---
bonus to main stat while wearing x type of armor isn't freedom either
---
Anyone ever think about how incredibly efficient Azeroth's public transportation is?
---
Gotta be 11 levels lower or doesn’t count
---
I mean, you could have all of that without world PvP on a PvE server...
---
People think rogues are OP because they can run away when the most OP class, they can just fear and dot you to death and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
My first ever mc was with pug group we failed on rag, second time 1 shotted everything, I did 178dps on rag, was 5th on dps chart. I had no world buffs and used no consumables at all
---
They’re never gonna do it better. It’s like this in movies, cars and everything else.
---
Killing enemies repeatedly. This is a wow sub after all :P.
---
Theres nothing unbelievable about this post
---
How do paladins get 2 crits with Divine favor?
---
Jeff kaplan left wow to start on titan (later known as overwatch) after wotlk,
---
Coincidence?
---
True,  tho it’s people like you that share the pleasure and mystery, since I can never and will never be arsed to give attention or time to reading quests. The only game that succeeded in pulling me in was SWTOR, which truly had an amazing cinematic leveling experience.
---
TASTE THE FLAMES OF SULFURON is him casting the knockback. You then need to check if the tank got knocked back or resisted. If he resisted you are good to go, if he got knocked back you have to wait for a tank (usually it's the 2nd tank) to pick him up then you go back in.
---
Wats that addin for energy and combo points
---
Flasks are a luxury, not a necessity
---
If you don’t care about battlegrounds then transfer off. But those instant qs are going to to be so tasty.
---
Freedom is making your own group as a tank and cherry picking dps classes to avoid loot competition without even having trouble to fill up the spots.
---
Haha it’s just an easier way to level an alt quickly I feel, spent a lot of time exploring on my warrior
---
Toilet Break? More like run to the corner store and restock on energy drinks and junk food, come back, still only halfway to booty bay.
---
Raiding and contributing like OP says he does goes far and above average gaming. There is no reason to not take it as serious as he does when you invest as much time as he seemingly does. I too would be upset beyond measure.
---
As alliance, I farmed my lvl 40 mount money on the wolfs behind feathermoon stronghold. It was a great place to do it.
---
Boot that guy and raid with 39
---
Why wait till 60 to finish attunement? You can finish ony attune by 58 if you start while leveling.
---
Yeah its the worst, while raiding you have Tank+DPS+Fire res set with you. And on the bank you then also have a healing set most likely. Had to invest heavily in bagspace(all bank tabs+all mooncloth bags). Isnt a stupid idea for a druid to buy some ony hide bags.
---
In my experience, normal loot rules apply. I.E. my normal loot is set to auto, so I auto loot pick packet as well.
---
It does get a bit wonky when I’m fighting. Seems looting is not instant and moving or attacking will mess it up. Then I have to loot the corpse twice, once for what it drops and once for the pick pocket. Never had issues if I’m just pick pocketing though.
---
Don't forget the NPC with a little boys voice in cow starting level. Guess he liked Taurens idk, but I can't remember back story. Something like make a wish foundation... All I sorta remember is, he was sickly, and they allowed him to be a voice actor. Maybe a tauren who had lost his pet or something idk.... feel like I'm remembering pieces, but then I can't trust the accuracy lol.. it all seems right.
---
Bonus damage works with lifetap, oddly enough. More shadow damage = more damage taken = more Mana given.
---
And yeah, we aren't really a hardcore guild. Just a bunch of friends that play WoW. I couldn't imagine being in a hardcore guild like that...forcing you to farm and get an item because it gives 2 more damage over the item you already had. It's a game not a job!
---
Drinking between every pull is different than going oom every pull. I usually drink between pulls, getting 2-3 ticks of mana regen from drinking, while the tank is pulling mobs. Using mage water usually so you're not wasting money. Just move up towards the tank as the fight is ending, as soon as you are out of combat you drink and while the tank is pulling the next pack back towards you, you regen a little mana. 
---
Very rarely should you need a full blown 'I am 100% oom ' mana break. Maybe if a pull goes badly or the tank dosent let you drop combat between packs. 
---
I healed everything from BRD to UBRS as shadow when I first dinged 60. In level 40 blues (dreamweave) and a few greens. Learning to cancel cast big heals while letting the 5 second rule kick in can mean doing 1 or 2 more pulls before you need to drink again. Dire maul west and north is definitely a bit more challenging to heal but DME is very easy.
---
I've gone to smoke and then the bathroom, come back to the computer, and was still flying.
---
Sounds like a toxic guild to me
---
Yeah, that’s why I said for 75th over 95th percentiles. 75 is generally good players with some consumable use, but not getting into stacking loads of world buffs on top of those.
---
For what its worth, I bind my raid markers to F12, F11, F10, etc..  I use reverse order so that way I just press the keys right to left so I can mark each one. 
---
tldr - do more than skull.
---
If you enjoy PvP alliance in herod is a blast. So much fighting
---
Hey, Kai here. I just vendored the EoS for the last bit of gold I needed for my 60% speed mount. The loot council said it was for a pretty good item but I needed the 20g.
---
WeakAuras &lt;3
---
So the winner of Eye gets to pay 1k+ for the ingots and arcanite and dark iron.  Then he also has a 100g respec fee each week going back and forth between mana tide and stormstrike?
---
Same boat here. When i was 17 i was amazing at video games. Especially wow and call of duty. Im 27 now, and tho I havent quit for 10 years, the time i quit definitely made me realize i lost my skill
---
Classic *is* WoW 2.
---
im sure gnome is considered the best for pvp but i rolled dwarf because its my favorite race in the game
---
Retail is a pretty accurate representation of the 9-5 work life. Which does nothing but stress and burn you out. When I get off work, I don't want to spend more time doing more "work" so that I can progress towards see nebulous goal.
---
I just did my first full MC last night. I spent (a lot of) time working up for it, but it was a grind that I defined for myself. I didn't have to do this or that. I could have farmed gold for mats, level a profession or grind dungeons for gear.
---
Every step of the way I felt that I gotten significantly closer to my objective. Nothing quite triggers the reward center of brain like setting goals and accomplishing them. That sense of accomplishment is right up there with an orgasm, and is exactly what's missing in retail.
---
Retail is like your boss telling you that something has to be done by a certain time. Classic is like you setting personal goals and working to accomplish them your own way. I think it's pretty obvious which is the more desireable scenario.
---
I don’t think it’s that clearly entitlement when the guy says he’s putting more effort into the clan, helping guildies, etc and the other guy isn’t even specced correctly nor helps the guild. Entitlement would be expecting it without putting in effort
---
If you want your guild to be a good one, you need to ask questions about it before you join. Treat it like an interview. Play with some of the people first and see if they'll even be willing to take the time. Every time you join a guild and accept what they say at face value or ignore red flags, you have a high risk of joining a bad guild. Trust but verify.
---
You’re literally so wrong it’s hilarious
---
Why would a healer and tank take you in as a 3rd group member when they can easily two man dme jump runs and split money with you?
---
&gt; But how is that a problem?
---
It's a problem for non-colluding players, because loot that would be theirs in a genuine bidding system gets funnelled to colluders.
---
&gt; Its the system working as intended.
---
The intention is that you bid what the item is worth to you. That is not happening.
---
&gt; The same thing would happen if you didnt collude.
---
No it would not. If they didn't collude then all else being equal the non-class caster loot would not all end up on warlocks (in this example, obviously mages can collude too).
---
&gt; In this example the guys paying 20 can just decide to stop paying 20 per piece. Either by themselves or colluding. The mages would need to be lobotomized to all bid twenty and all cripple their dkps.
---
Do you consider it a good outcome if loot is funnelled to people who are better at colluding to rig the bidding?
---
Another vote for Sulfuras. I wouldn’t join a mega server like Herod, Skeram or Stalagg. Faction balance seems close on Sulfuras and both sides are active.
---
Classic is already dead as far as I am concerned. The hype is over and people lost interest.
---
4th week of MC (what was that? Week 5 of release, maybe 6?) was a timeframe when few guilds were logging. It skews the data a lot when your sample size is small. If you look now, 2 months later or even over the next few weeks, the data will still trend similarly but you have a greater sample size that isn’t influenced as much by the outliers (crazy high or crazy low).
---
So....Like you're suggesting I join a guild as someone who would be currently guildless and playing alone?
---
That's....that's what I said to do.
---
Oh so we just popped out of guild uterus, aight lad. We, like every single big guild, started as a small guild. We formed YEARS ago on Nostalrius using these exact methods, albeit less refined back then. Then we scaled up whenever required. Basically add more or take away numbers. Its all entirely scalable, why wouldn't it be? There is nothing that prevents any guild from:
---
- Having a good roster system including presigns, confirmed spots and a bench if you are of that scale
---
- Running a guild pug so that your bench also gets to raid
---
- Figuring out ways to run a LC without getting posted onto reddit
---
And yeah, I have people who I manage. I.e. Subordinates. How self-important it is to call people who you manage with the proper word. :(
---
Lmao reddit autists. 
---
"try to use that as an argument" I'm not arguing with you I'm toying with you lmao. The screeds that are getting longer and longer are proof that you're biting the bait.
---
We say the exact same things about you guys.
---
There's also an NPC walking around in Darnassus - most people probably don't notice him, because, quite frankly, who spends time in Danassus? - which is named after a dutch dude who ran a fansite, but was killed in a car crash. Crildor is the name.
---
It's the first part of the WW axe quest chain where you have to beat a bunch of guys in sequence on an island near Ratchet. That's for alliance at least.
---
For me is the gameplay. Specially while questing. 
---
Combat is not hard but it is strategic enough. You need to be careful with pulling extra mobs, manage your Mana. Watch out for the "run away in fear". 
---
Then you have the quests that actually need a group. And since everything is more or less a strategic combat. Nobody cares if you did less dps because you were keeping two other mobs feared.
---
No flying is another awesome thing... It makes the world feel so much bigger.
---
Oh it most definitely is. My first character to 60 for Classic was a warrior, but I mained a mage in Vanilla so that is what I made as my alt and have been leveling. The difference between leveling the 2 classes is insane.
---
In terms of gear, casters have the luxury of not needing it and still remaining viable at their level. the low level +frost damage gear isn't really amazing, you also don't really need a ton of stam because the whole point of aoe farming as a mage is you don't get hit. For leveling purposes I would suggest stacking Int whenever possible and transitioning to spell power and frost damage once nearing max level.
---
Sounds like you're just bad and wanna be carried in a pvp world.
---
The alt method requires you to log over to the alt and then wait two minutes for party leader to pass to the alt, then you can reset and go back to your main. That's the only difference really
---
IMO: It's because in Classic you're not a sex-god murder machine. Each fight is a struggle (unless you're a mage, in which case it's the same as BFA).
---
Yep, plus wolfshead helm at lvl 40
---
Part of my guild imploded because the main officer stonewalled any discussion. "The Council has decided" "if you don't like it, leave". Seriously not a good look and turned me off raiding with this group.
---
Meanwhile the top item always goes to the loot council. First mageblade, the first leaf, first 46 healing power ring, etc.
---
basically now, every spec is a different class. For example, survival hunter is full melee and marksmanship work without having a pet
---
Execellent thank you! I won’t bother grabbing 245 engi just yet for green lens till later levels then, as others say of the eagle greens will do this just fine I’ll stack up on those! Just need to find a decent guide that stacks up kill quests with decent mobs to aoe grind and I’ll be set
---
Yeah I only ever do it against NPCs because their auto attacks are so predictable. If you can chain it real nice you can really obliterate some shit in solo. If *anything* changes though, like multiple mobs or you have someone with you, it really does become a huge liability though.
---
I think the best drop you can get in there is freezing band, but I’ve never had one drop before
---
This... is a good point.
---
A Diablo or Starcraft MMO would make more sense than making a second Warcraft MMO.
---
A good BiS list has alternatives. If whatever you are using lists 'Archivist's Cape of Frost' or any of Incendius' RNG blues as the \*only\* choice, get out.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j58V2vC9EPc
---
Punk is alive and well. Smoko means smoke break if you didn't know.
---
How is that shocking ? The original hunter, Rexxar, is a full-melee fighter.
---
Gunna be so happy!
---
Molten core is tuned for people in greens and blues. The only requirements are decurses dispells and for 8/8, essence quest and fire resist tank. 
---
I dont know how taking DPS averages of people in 4 weeks of MC/Ony gear, and probably alot more preraid bis, how that helps anybody with anything besides what can warrior DPS pull with 4 weeks of raid loot
---
Eye see what you did there.
---
Eh, mages are ezmode as an SL lock. Mages have to be the right spec and play perfectly to even stand a chance.
---
Yeah, I farmed for a week almost with no competition in the mornings 3 week into launch, now there is way to many people for it to be worth it (horde in my case)
---
Kicking people out is not a mistake though. You don't want to get shit on farm then have 30 people fighting over the last 10 raid slots. You certainly don't want the people that made the progression runs losing their farm status spots to the slow levelers either.
---
I play a lot and I haven't gotten shit for PreBiS.  It just doesn't drop for me.  That's not a good metric.
---
The diatrabe is fairly mild.
---
Like 90% of the improvements classes got in BC. Good improvements for the classes still unique.
---
I didn't know that sledgehammer played wow (Yes, that's an obscure 80s reference).
---
also dislike the approach of "fixing" the game when they should just allow for people to find stuff like this and evolve the way we play classic
---
Nope, spawns changed from 11-17 minutes to 5-8.
---
All the stuff from lw you can just buy from the ah anyways, so it’s prob better to do another profession. Skinning is ok, but it doesn’t make too much gold. To make gold best would be mining and herb. Useful wise for end game would probably be engineering. This is pretty much true for all classes
---
absolutely my best video yet! Enjoy guys!
---
Staff, 2h mace, 2haxe. Rockbiter for solo questing windfury for dungeoning. This is the meta.
---
Hey, go fuck yourself :)
---
I think I lucked out with mine. I joined my guild off a world chat recruitment. Great environment, great leader, great officer team, everyone is nice and cordial. DKP system with minor loot council. The only red flag I might see is maybe room for other raiders? Invites for raid go out at X time and raid starts at X:30. If you aren’t around for invite time, your spot is gone unless you specified you were going to be late for whatever reason with an officer beforehand.
---
Our core raid team is pretty much set, but I can understand why some people would (and already have) leave. But not much you can do considering max raid size is 40. Not everyone is willing to be a standby or miss out on a week’s worth of loot. Nor is everyone willing to pug in the event they miss a week.
---
Boe are equal to gold. That’s why some people think it’s fair for the whole team to roll on it. I also follow that idea and so don’t run with pugs that disagree. I consider it greedy if you don’t share the gold between the team that earned it.
---
Fantastic!
---
To be fair, given the monsters are at your level in bfa now, the sandbox is even bigger, you can level up pretty much everywhere you want and stay into a area even waaaay past its original level
---
According to the person who was jaded and lost the roll, they did.
---
How do we know that's true?
---
Pretty sure the only official statement from blizzard, were that medium pop servers are bigger than vanilla high pop servers.
---
Yea I was for the kick. I was saying move on. Maybe you took me saying if It was my guild that I wouldn't have kicked him as me standing against the kick. There is a reason I don't run guilds.
---
So my warrior is 60. I’m thinking about lvl a alt to farm gold for warrior. Among mage, warlock, hunter, which is more efficient at farming gold? I’m not gonna find a group, i will be solo farming.
---
I disagree. He believes he is entitled to roll on something because he has more time to play but the item is in reality equally anyone's. That's why the game was made that way. If the devs wanted people who put more hours into the game to have better rolls, they would have implemented that but they didnt'
---
We have layering but spell batching's in the game smh.
---
Ain't getting Rank 14 playing a mediocre 12 hours a day.
---
As an undead warrior warlocks aren’t usually too rough with all my fear breaks.
---
Nice gl! I can't really recommend any guides cause I just have most things already planned out for what I like to do and grind on. Might not be optimal, but it works well for me.
---
You can grind anywhere really. Just looking for spots that have only melee mobs, a decent amount of spawn and spawn rate, and if they drop greys that sell for a lot that is a bonus. I am farming STV raptors atm. Badlands rock elementals are also good but are usually a bit more camped due to the amount of greys/whites they drop.
---
I mean it still didn’t look great then, but definitely better than on a current gen monitor.
---
Lol! This is gold Jerry!
---
DIVE DIVE DIVE
---
I know a boomkin that raids. People don't mind having 1 for the utility and to absorb druid loot cause no one else wants it.
---
Until you start seeing people as people, rather as cultists for your cult, you should expect them to resist you at every move. 
---
People play to play with friends and to get loot. They want loot. They aren't in your guild because of your illusions of grandeur. They just want loot, and they'll play along with your neurosis until it becomes too much.
---
Just be normal for the sake of good. Just understand that people play for loot, and stop lootshaming. Just be some friends trying to kill bosses and get loot, and take this weird judeo-christian bullshit back to your weird family dinners.
---
The game was never ruined by the changes (only half of it) the rest is purely the fault of the community. They became hateful and envious fighting over everything and with everyone
---
This is a excessively long post to simply say “I lost a roll on some pixels”
---
Boo hoo.
---
Yes. You can drop engineering and level it from 1 again and pick the other.
---
You 100% can
---
You can just kill the demon yourself if you're a hunter and let the person on the quest loot it.
---
How do u do it without dying?
---
I've read about this, as well. I can see why the companies would do it, but it's still misleading and scummy.
---
cherry picking at its finest huh?
---
you know what else is changed? the year
---
They had us in the first half
---
Yeah I feel like I’d spend a bit of time over at stv cause they drop good vendor trash, I’ll feel I’d just find a general guide to give me some insight and just modify it to my playstle and transfer over knowledge to different areas so I’m not constantly fighting contested areas
---
Just deciding what professions I should go with!
---
I don't know both sides of the story, but him quitting shouldn't correlate to his reliability as his reason for quitting is just. Then again, what's Kai's/the rest of the guilds perspective on this situation?
---
The problem here is they rolled for it. That shows a gigantic lack of leadership and it was only a matter of time before it was exposed in a situation such as this.
---
&gt;R14 is going to be in BiS pbe gear
---
Might be true now but that wasn't true in Vanilla.
---
r/niceguyraiders
---
Definantly a lot of competition with minning. I still find veins tho. Just takes commitment and doing an hour or two of minning everyday. Youll catch times when no one has been there in a while its just rare.
---
Isn't it against the rules of the subto include names?
---
It's a serious time investment.

For established guilds? Yes. For pugs/casuals? Hell no. With 1.12 items and talents MC/BWL are expected to be easy. The closer you get to naxx the less overpowered players are compared to the intended difficulty of the content.
---
So I noticed that it holds shift for you when you hover over a piece of gear, but it doesn't show the stat differences
---
Escape Artist trumps Stoneform any day
---
well, there isnt anything wrong w/ contributed hoping for a return
---
members you contribute a lot are valuable, and they should be encouraged w/ rewards when available
---
if there was no such thing as rewarding good behavior, few would be motivated to do anything useful 
---
if I as a GM and I had to pick between 2 people, and one hustled and one didnt, the item is going to the one who hustled
---
The funniest thing is, I just have been mocking you the whole time mimicking the way you act you that you would just now realize as you read this what an insufferable asshole you are
---
That somehow having healthy personal desires and motivations is selfish and sinful, and that you should only ever exist to help others. That's the general guild motto of these types of people when they become GMs or officers.
---
Why do all of the reddit videos have such shitty quality? Mine doesn't even want to load and when it does, it loads at 144p or some bullshit.
---
Paying 500-1000g+ for an item just isn't feasible for a lot of players, especially when people could be saving up for their epic mounts. Also it may not even be on the AH, that can depend heavily on the server. For the people that can't yet purchase those items for themselves but still need them they should get priority in rolls for said item, it's a big like Foror's Compendium on Dragon Slaying, it's a paladin / warrior item, and should be rolled for accordingly, just like the other books are.
---
I think I've seen 3 people total in Darnassus. So if you are Alliance and running on the other continent you are probably in IF or SW to find a group while also in LFG.
---
50 resist of everything is ok for casual pvp-pve with full dmg skills. If you are going for pure pvp, you can raise the ones that you fear. For example natural for root, arcane for poly, shadow for fear etc.
---
What do u mean by auto loot?
---
God damn that is classy
---
Sounds pretty normal. You're in your own head, just keep relearning and you'll be fine.
---
Pfff... mages
---
I was killing trolls in EPL and they turned me into a frog as I dinged 60... it's something
---
hunter is one of the strongest classes for pvp lol, this guy has no idea what he's talking about
---
I'm level 14 with my priest now and still can't decide what to spend my talents on.. i mostly just heal my friend tanking while leveling and hitting with my ward otherwise.
---
There is no talent which screams SKILL ME in the holy tree t1/2 or am i wrong?
---
I’d want everyone doing 300+ dps and all healers exceeding 200hps on all fights and 300hps on heavy aoe fights. 
---
Every single dps class (with correct spec) can sustain 300dps in vanilla MC even without bis.
---
My bad my bad, me rogue, me no need spellies
---
In the same vein, any presumptions about Kai are unsubstantiated and illogical.
---
Both people probably suck, especially if first eye went to a LC member seemingly out of nowhere.
---
Keep trying to tell people that if you need to fury prot in phase 1 because of your “DPS” you’re a terrible tank
---
That water looks cold
---
Is this what happens on the Horde version of this quest?
---
Wheres your source to back that up?
---
BRE proc does nothing as the bosses in classic are reduced to 0 armor easily. Hand of rag will do more dps.
---
&gt; If a warrior is allowed to roll on x3 the amount of gear than me just because their class allows it and they in turn roll on gear that I could use and am ONLY limited to, then I should be able to roll on their plate upgrades as well.
---
Then you should be calling out Resto Druids, Resto Shamans, and Holy Paladins rolling on cloth/leather/mail gear that enhances their role in groups, which is healing. But you'd be laughed out of any half-decent guild for doing so. A Priest may grumble in private that they lost a roll for cloth pants to a Holy Paladin but most would realize that they had a perfectly legitimate claim to the pants. Fury Warrior DPS is no different. If it improves their class role by wearing a lower armor class, then it should be used.
---
Face it man, you're mad you now have competition over leather armor and you retaliated by ninjaing a useful item that you couldn't have used. 99/100 people surveyed would say you're a ninja looter and in the wrong here.

But as it has been said, the people potentially raging are the ones NOT releasing, the ones writing your names, the ones whining for support in chat, the ones taking their lvl 60 main character to camp you.

---
&gt;With the same logic you'd be ok if some bug caused some people to get a mail from Blizzard with 4k gold in it because hey inflation will increase the prices so you can sell things at higher prices and it balances out the money over time
---
Yeah, I would be fine with that actually. I mean, I don't want it to actively happen but I'm not envious enough to hope blizzard takes the gold back. I never got that stance, why does the happiness of others diminish my happiness? Cause they didn't work for it? Gimme a break...
---
Retail has those problems fixed.
---
Just go back to retail :).
---
The part that costs companies thousands is how long it takes to get a clearance. If a company hires you uncleared for a position that requires one, that‘s several months minimum that you can’t do the work you were hired to do. That’s a long time to either pay you for work you can’t fully do, or leave the position empty. Either way reduces productivity
---
If a company can hire someone with a clearance right out the gate they can sidestep the whole dilemma
---
Ah, yep. In our system you earned 2 kinds of DKP. Cross DKP and Class DKP (spent as you'd expect). So same-class collusion was completely useless.
---
Eat more fiber.
---
Piss off ghost!
---
Great video. Little iffy in the middle with two voices being heard on top of each other but a catchy tune nonetheless
---
Do we know if blizzard will offer realm transfers in the future? I only have a couple hours a day at most to play and got fed up with getting ganked so I began again on a normal realm. I love the idea of level 60 world PVP with farming and what not but it didn't feel worth ruining some of my limited available time currently.
---
this is factually false
---
those who contribute more deserve first dibs on stuff, period
---
otherwise no one would ever care to rise above and hustle
---
the only time there should be a roll off is when two people contribute a similar amount and the roll is treated as a tie breaker
---
That's why you should log off on gray screen. If you stay offline through the weekly reset, you get a free res without sickness. That's essential to warrior leveling.
---
How the hell did you oneshot rag if you were 5th with 178 dps?
---
We obviously don’t know the whole story but it doesn’t seem like either the guild nor this member are in the right
---
It took my 3 tries to find a good guild.  My first guild I out leved very quickly. My second guild was a retail guild's classic guild. I out leved that guild as well, and it became clear to me that retail was their focus not classic and I don't play retail so if I wanted to raid I needed to find a different guild. 
---
My third (and current) guild was advertising in gen chat with the amount of 60's it currently had when that sort of thing was a selling point given the amount of 60's that where on our server at the time. I wasn't quite yet 60 (but i was close).  I talked to the GM a bit, their planned raid days/times worked for me so I joined. 
---
Turned out that this was a really great guild.  When we had problems with downing a boss instead of breaking down and throwing a temper tantrum everyone looked at the problem logically and found a solution.  When the guild expressed frustration with the loot council situation we switched to DKP. 
---
Having done a lot of raiding back in vanilla the things to look for in a good guild:
---
 How do people deal with loot and talk about loot outside of a raid? If they are gonna be shitty about loot in a 5/10 man they are gonna be shittier about loot in a 40 man.  
---
Every guild and raid is gonna run into problem and road blocks look at how the leadership responds.  If you are seeing a lot of red flags in MC, shit is gonna hit the god damn fan in BWL. 
---
You don't need to be in a server first guild. You just need to be in a guild with like minded people. Yes it means you get to some content slower but its more important to enjoy spending time with the people in the guild. 
---
I don't know about your server but on mine there are still a lot of guilds that are pugging MC/Ony raids. If I were you I'd start trying to get in on those raids. It would allow you to shop around a bit and find something that fits you. If you are having issues finding a spot as a rogue, perhaps roll an alt in a high demand class that you actually enjoy playing.  Having a lv 60 in good gear means you can twink the shit out of that alt. 
---
It's hard to do this as a dps (believe me I know) but pug as much as you can and try to be a fun guy to group with.  I'm really happy with my current guild but I'm friends with people in other raiding guilds. If things go bad I might not have a raiding spot waiting for me but I will be able to get into a raiding guild easy enough.
---
Remember folks you only get one side of the story and judging by OPs post he seems like a bit of a lootwhore
---
When do humans get the pvp trinket as a racial?
---
You are missing the point.  If everyone only did what THEY NEED none of what OP said would happen.  Yet it does.
---
Well maybe not for you, perhaps try communication
---
Go wand specialization, get a decent wand from the AH and watch as your auto-wand DPS actually does decent damage between DoT's and healing.
---
"Keep the heals up, keep the heals up"
---
Most obnoxious/stupid part of it to me. Like what do you think the healers are even doing there, dude?
---
This is definitely one of those dudes who goes on a LoS spree with all his healers and then rages out whenever he does get healed.
---
\^ Top half
---
Bottom half: coliseum of lust
---
I think he is negative gaming.
---
Yea for real though, it’s easy to get a few Pre-BiS even before 60.
---
There's a big difference between immobilize and stun. I dont think they were trying to belittle you by pointing it out.
---
I have a lock and was wanting a healer and couldn't bring myself to make a priest, personally.
---
They do. About on par with the winterspring furbolgs. I’ve been grinding satyrs and ogres for runecloth/income
---
It worked for a very short time at the start of classic, after which it got patched out.
---
Really does require secondary healer.  Shadow priest, cat/moonkin, or ret pally.
---
We know the size of realms back in vanilla.
---
The census addon showed roughly 50-60k players on full/high pops. You dont break an addon if its inaccurate.
---
Was this on Atiesh?  Coulda sworn i saw this last night before raid.
---
It’s unlikely they’ll ever offer pve to pvp transfers.
---
That was recently hotfixed in. Like a couple of weeks ago.
---
Commander gor farm at BRD, 60k-100K an hour. 
---
In LFG say you’re looking for gor farm/escort farm at BRD.
---
Gesundheit
---
do you pick up the national enquirer and take everything at face value? because believing a post on reddit is the exact same thing, if you actually form opinions with 1 side of the story, i feel very sorry for you.
---
I play a warlock, lol.. working on a rogue though. And if warriors wanna roll on leather they are welcome to do so as far as im concerned. Just like pallies healers can roll on cloth gear
---
that sucks
---
but i feel like you prob should have seen it coming if your guild was acting that way
---
it's tough to deal w/ ninjas and shit
---
if you ever reach a point where you think it is between two people, work it out ahead of time
---
also im surprised no warriors were interested
---
Yup. They solo their way to the chest, kill the king and pop loot. Then you join and go get whatever you wanted.
---
But its still just a post, from someone obviously raging hard so whats reddit do? BELIEVE IT 100%. so again, its pathetic.
---
These are good suggestions.. I can add to it a bit. 
---
The dragons for the Onyxia quest are 60-62 if i recall. (Skull boss level is 63) so they’re VERY close but still require less hit rating.
---
King mosh I believe is 60/61
---
Volchan again, I believe he is 60-62 level wise so not quite boss level but higher than 60
---
Dragons near caverns are 57-60 I think with the exception being the one for the Onyxia attunement which is 60-62
---
I don't care about them. I care about the performance of the 40-man raid as a whole. Insect Swarm and Nature's Swiftness adds more value than 3% crit to 4 DPS (which, by the way, is only active when you are in form - meaning it is NOT active when you are offhealing / decursing - which you should be doing).
---
nope. inaccessible
---
Dude, he **assured** you
---
^^^^^^^/s
---
le woosh
---
Guess I should have put a /s in there.
---
This. I know of many people who abused layering early on to make bank. And I mean BANK. Tens of thousands of gold.
---
thank you. Have come across too many fury warriors that even just leave the party when you ask for sword and board. if 3/4 mobs charge your healer from 1 flash heal you need a different strategy
---
how is this relevant to the thread?
---
It’s not the original from 2004, it’s pretty remastered. Still nice though.

Sounds like the guy who posted this was in the right to be mad.
---
I did have a guild, with several old friends. I never would've joined at all if they hadn't invited me. The problem was that I didn't have enough time to play each week, so they quickly outlevelled me. They all passed 40 while I was still at 15. One of them offered to quest with me a couple times, but it felt like a waste of time for them, and for me it felt like I was cheating. I tried partying with randos too, but it just wasn't the same.
---
The camera and movement controls took a few hours to get used to, but after I adjusted they worked fine. It still annoyed me that walking backwards was slower than walking forwards, though.
---
Ohhh yeah that was rewarding
---
If it'd be dead, you wouldn't be browsing its subreddit.
---
*pimp slaps OP back to retail
---
Can probably spare 1.5 hours to clear MC. There's probably BWL items they want anyways (I don't recall shaman BIS pvp gear but I assume theres a ring or trinket you want over the pvp rewards)
---
I thank god I found my guild who ended up giving me the eye to craft as a ret paladin.
---
Sure, I'll just call Blizzard and get them onto it ASAP
---
Yeah, I also wanted to play Devil's Advocate in this case. Like she's looking at who knows what on the 2nd screen when the tank pulls.
---
But no matter how you look at it, charging in like that and connecting those two groups without a shield is a losing play. If the frost nova came a second or two earlier, the warrior could have been saved with a PW:Shield - and only if he immediately disengaged.
---
No healer could have salvaged this mess on their own.

---
That's not what classic is then man, that's what I mean about draw backs. The changes you are talking about lead to the current state of retail.
---
If the player values his epic mount higher than the 500g boe then it's only fair to allow group mates to roll for those 500g that could be put towards their epic mount imho. Everything else is just selfishness disguesed as the RP value of finding your own gear instead of buying it.
---
Nope, dethroning wasn't added until after Vanilla.
---
Really? Damn. Rerolling.
---
You don't need to though. It's not a raid with extremely geared rogues and warriors pulling aggro constantly. He'd even be better off with a two hander if he refuses to sword/board for doing these 60 dungeons. He'd hold threat far better on packs that way.
---
Depending on your schedule, you'll probably be okay. With you being 3 hours ahead, you might not want to join a late night guild.
---
Like others have said, 27 is low enough where it wouldn't be that bad to reroll.
---
It was a false flag for Blizzard to save money.
---
Fuck is this Runescape 80s kinda shit looking UI?
---
Could go either way.
---
Uses that 2h to help guildies with dungeons, farm mats faster, attunement runs for trials, BRD runs to the Black Forge, etc.  Maybe contributes decent dps as enhance?
---
Why would I play the game oriented more for casuals?
---
No, they're not.
---
"Normal" guilds will also not get far in naxx. Top guilds already demand flasks.
---
Your post makes no sense.
---
I love this site. Anyone knows why cant choose gear from tailoring in my Sets?
---
are you a babyboomer or something? read the fuckin message mate, tells you everything you need to know.
---
It fine to lecture others but me!
---
... to get in groups for the instance?
---
If you have a reliable ret paladin in the raid there is really no better person to take the mace.
---
The National Enquirer is currently in a mess of legal battles over various illegal dealings.  Stating that the aveage redditor is like them is just you proudly proclaiming your ignorance of their reputation.
---
Gutripper + Blazing Emblem
---
For ranged DPS, you really don't need high FR, 74 is fine and you'll get a fair bit more from raid buffs like GoTW.
---
Pre-pop a GFP potion, and pop one mid fight if you are taking fire damage from lava/fireballs and you'll be fine.
---
Ideally you want to kill Rag before the sons spawn, but it's melee that really needs the fire resist in this fight.
---

As a dps, you shouldnt have to sacrifice any dps increase over fire res.
---
He’s got something to be pissed about for sure.. loot was the best and worst part of vanilla and in classic it is no different. I’m with the guy who gquit
---
An enhancement shaman with HoR this early will be lucky to find a tank who can hold off him very well after a WF crit. That being said - yes you might do massive dps with it, but a dead dps still doesnt do as much as a living dps that is under geared. 
---
I agree that having a shaman with it works out - but i think you missed the part that he raids as a healer and enhancement is his OS for pvp. If he heals raids - its not likely he will be dps'ing in attunement runs.

Life pro tips
---
If you are haunted, just jump over some knee high obstacle and the ghost will get stuck and stop following you.
---
That’s it, let it out.
---
LF Tank and g2g
---
Hand of Rag is as much guild promotion as anything, which itself has value. You get a bigger pool of players if you're the top guild. 
---
Besides, top guilds probably have all boes and flasks funded up until AQ already, so throwing money around literally doesn't matter
---
It feels more rewarding in vanilla. In BFA, nothing felt rewarding, even getting a new piece of gear doesn't feel as rewarding as it does in vanilla. Man, I remember getting my first green when classic was released. It felt like 2006 all over again, took me back to when I was 11.
---
Haha I love how he plays it off as if he likes it. Obviously salty about it. Fukin boomer
---
You're quick.
---
Idk, I've found the only really annoying places in Silverpine are the random Sons of Arugal who one shot you, and Fenris Keep. Other than that it's just about killing enough mobs while questing to keep you going. It does kind of suck because you can't really jump immediately into Hillsbrad, I usually need a level or two before it's less than crazy hard.
---
Waiting for MC timer to reset then
---
That was the leaver's assumption.  For all we know, the guild rolls on everything if they haven't previously agreed on who gets the item.  Heck, the only non-subjective claims the OP has made is that Kai is one a few hours per day, that he's on the loot council, and that he only has "a few" pre-BIS items (and "a few" can be anywhere from 3 to all but 3)
---
“Layering” is really easy to blame when you don’t actually understand what is going on.
---
When there are multiple layers, lotuses spawn slower to compensate. There is always the same total amount of spawns. 
---
Source: I have actually farmed lotus and actually know what I am talking about.
---
Uuunless you are a undead rogue
---
Same! What an epic moment to ding too... it's my first time playing any MMORPG, I'm very proud of myself for making it this far!
---
The debuffs are identical according to wowhead except for the name. You may very well be right, but if you could provide some evidence or something to support your claim, it'd be great. Give me a reason to stop farming for bashguuder.
---
He said he has 6 hours of downtime and you jumped all over that lol. So I was just saying in regards to "idk what I want to do yet" that you definitely want to do nothing if that's so appealing. I was just making a joke, I'd want 6 hours of downtime too
---
Kinda hard to get a legendary at level 55.
---
But why all these fury warriors never switch to shield? Thats like the whole point of the build to equip shield for mitigation and equip offhand weapon for damage when needed.
---
I see what you did there.
---
Pop Inner Focus then start casting a spell with cast time and cast an instant cast spell right as the first one is launching, Inner Focus is only "consumed" when you finish a cast and because you're technically finishing 2 casts within a couple milliseconds of each other, they both are seen by the server as having been cast while under the effects of Divine Favor and thus both are free mana cost.
---
Most likely not. Blizzard has been pretty no changes with WoW Classic. The community would be angered by even slight changes. 😞
---
So where does Tegrity Farms fall in your scale of guild names?
---
Put the form change spells on your action bar and assign a key bind to that slot.
---
Gratz on your mount Kai!
---
For me its fishing and netflix.
---
Wow this is so untrue LOL
---
BWL is a bit strange in regards to its difficulty.  The first boss requires coordination unlike anything required from molten core or Onyxia.  The second is a gear check that causes guilds to fall apart.  And then after that point the difficulty drops back down to about molten core level until the last two.  I’m not sure if any other raid has such a steep difficulty hump right at the beginning like BWL does.
---
You ok bud?
---
Dude...no.
---
GCD is 1.5s.
---
fire blast(instant). + 1.5s GCD + frost bolt 2.5s + noGCD (0s)= 4s
---
Frost bolt 2.5s + noGCD (0s) + fire blast(instant) + GCD (1,5s) = 4s
---
Basically, if u were to cast a third spell, it would happen after 4s in both scenarios. Only difference is that both damage instances happen at the earlier in the frost bolt into fire blast order (2,5 vs 4), but thats only because the GCD swaps places.  It does not make it faster in the long run (if more spells are to come).
---
Except for the bombs!
---
Dumbass gnome hahaha good job
---
Last week I started an Undead Rogue and it’s now Lvl 28. I hear that Orc is better for PvE and PvP. Should I roll a new character?
---
In fairness we don’t know whose side OP is on.
---
Seriously getting full preBIS is NOT very hard. If that's true I couldn't see a loot council giving that person eye, and it going over well. Really shows a lack of commitment to the game. Not that everyone needs to have some insane amount of commitment, but for an eye that's different.
---
How the hell is "Well, alright then!" snarky? It's a totally normal and polite response, they're saying it lightheartedly.
---
Well, darnassus isn't near anything either.  I was thinking more like, joining a strath group while you're in ungoro as a DPS.
---
Mythic + and non lfr raids (actual raids) do not have interface buttons to auto build groups or teleport you anywhere. A lot of players get really caught up in the dungeon finder but that hasn't been an actual part of endgame content since 2016.
---
If you find a guild and play with other players you'll still get plenty of social interactions. you wont find that questing in the world however, people doing world quests are just out there to get them done. If you want friends you have to join groups for dungeons and raids until you find people you like playing with, or search for a guild that raids at times you want to play during. If you're not interested in endgame PvE content...retail wow has nothing for you Imho.
---
The equivalent of a chest x-ray...
---
Everyone gets dumpstered by warriors. Warriors are insanely imbalanced as a class in vanilla, and nobody is beating out warrior DPS at any stage of the game except for the one mage who gets the rolling ignite, but that doesn't really count.  
---
When a cat is beating out every single ranged DPS on a fight it's pretty dumb to claim they aren't viable, especially when you compare them to the other Hybrids, who all do worse across the board.

Position is still being left empty then. If it turns out you don’t get your clearance after going through the whole process that’s a lot of time wasted for the company who expected to get an employee at the end of it

Say whaaaaaaaat? You sure?
---
You rushing to get everything done asap does not mean that Blizzard should rush to accommodate you. It's like getting to a party early and being mad that there aren't more people there.

Yeah man. You gotta give it to the pserver hero on disability that dedicates their entire life to a 15 year-old game. Sorry...

New feral druid player here. I've been searching for a powershift macro for cat form for days now with no results. Do you have one you could share?
---
I’ve done this at least 1/2 a dozen times in classic.
---
Warstomp has saved my hide many times, and my groups. Such a clutch juicy stun, makes for good plays.
---
Looks like someone's pissed he lost the roll. 
---
If this is your guild's normal way of distributing loot, and no promises were broken, then honestly, nothing was done wrong. Yeah, it sucks when someone gets an item who maybe won't use it as much as you, but everyone wants the big shinies, and to be the best, regardless of if they play 60hrs/week or 5. Or if they have the spec you want them to have. 
---
I would suggest that whoever wrote the post consider joining a raid guild utilizing DKP or similar instead of a loot council.

Love Horde, but all my buddies rolled Alliance so I got stuck doing that. Every time I try to leave Moonglade, I always instinctively go for the Tauren and am immediately saddened when I remember hes not my flight master anymore. The day I actually remember to go the the Night Elf flight master will be the day I truly join the Alliance, haha.

Wolves are great and all (I used one exclusively from 40-60) but OP was looking for the tankiest pet and wolves are not it

A lot of people are criticizing the choice to roll it out and I don’t get it.

We have 3 people who are equally deserving. HoR has no value to progression, so we’re giving the deserving people an equal shot.
---
I don't like people like you. Calm down.
---
Nope. Classic is infinitely better in every aspect.
---
My thoughts exactly, there are a T O N of poorly skilled rogues in vanilla.. I nearly never lose to the my druid.
---
It's not a treadmill. You actually make progress.

In retail everything you do is obsolete by the next patch.

Haha, I wish you could hear what you sound like to other people.

My pc broke down at level 15, so I played from 15-58 on my Mac before I realised my game textures were rendered in 800x600

I think you can disable the errors being spammed to your screen. Someone mentioned it the other day on this sub but they haven't replied to me about it. I have altoholic as well and have it updated but it still spits errors at me.

You’re hauntee doesn’t have a very good sense of humor

Eww elf warrior
---
This isn't where I parked my car

Just because you level slow doesn’t mean the game should be any more accommodated to you.
---
It’s like having a party but not putting out the horderves until everyone arrives, just lame.
---
In my opinion, roll whatever race you like the most. Racials are just a minor bonus. You will not regret not having certain racials on your maxed toon, but you can regret having to look at that toon for days on end.
---
This is what we call bait
---
or just take things out of the logs that you're not engaged with.
---
I mean they are BiS, no "" about it... for raid dps. You don't wear raid gear to running around in the open world like an idiot.
---
Having said this, warlocks in aforementioned "bis" gear can land 2k+ shadowbolt crits from time to time, which will produce similar effects even on mages wearing stamina.
---
I think boost are great for seasoned players while they are terrible for new players. Seasoned players can pick all that up and function, new players need something like Classic to be trained in.

---
This explains nothing of your reason.
---
But if that helps you, if I remember, the classic servers use the same technology of retail ones.
---
It's just that they porpusefully artificially botched the communications between server and client to emulate old connections.
---
In that case, the time to adjust it is, probably, relatively trivial.
---
i literally just said that it doesn't work like that with mind control, i got done testing it about 30 minutes ago

I'd rather save my limited resources for when they actually matter. I don't care about competing in Molten Core speed runs. I care about clearing all the content.
---
Contested Cruise**

How can you be mad at this guy? He's a total badass.
---
It really isn’t
---
Great idea!! I actually have that trinket too, plus thorns and Nagel of course.
---
10/10
---
There will be other Christmas’s :P
---
TL;DR?
---
The problem with retail is theres no reason to  do those challenging contents.  
---
Also why do high level mythic+ if you can do low level? i mean the rewards dont really change... you just get bigger ilevel, its the same dungeon. Same with raids. Also why get better ilevel gear when in the next patch all your gear will be trash and you  have to do it all over again.  
---
There is no incentive unless you really really like doing mythic+ and raids.   
---
Which i used to do but since the meta revolves around AP grind its not fun anymore... you have to login everyday to farm AP or you will fall behind your guildies and that will make you look bad even if you were amazingly reliable in raids, not dying to stupid stuff and such. Your power creep is slower... eventually youll be last in the meters and a liability.  
---
I preferred the game back when the raid gear was gained from raids only. So to be able to progress in raids you had to raid.... SIMPLE!
---
Actually i think WoD still worked fine... the legendary ring didnt require any special grinding more than  once on a character (it did make it harder to keep alts  viable tho) so just raid and your fine. I never fully finished the tanaan jungle rep grinds either and it didnt affect my raid dps.
---
These are taken my my friend: Tauren named dollarbull and my undead named Gooey Vuitton

NOW FOR YOU, INSECTS! BOLDLY, YOU SOUGHT THE POWER OF RAGNAROS. NOW YOU SHALL SEE IT FIRSTHAND!
---
Can you explain this site to me. I’ve just checked it out. Play Lock and I don’t know how I should set the EP, and don’t understand what it’s asking me to do.
---
Same, Ironforge crashed my PC. I had to physically go to him and log in on his PC in order to get out.
---
Not that long. No downtime because nobody goes afk to pee. Just take the raid bucket if needed.
---
If your guild doesn’t care if you do shit dps stay arms so you don’t have to pay for respec haha.
---
Otherwise you have to go 2H Fury 20/31
---
If I ragequit over something, you're damned sure I'd want to let them know why.
---
Just four sweaty dudes looking to have a good time
---
I haven't managed to sell a 75g lotus yet, but it sure is trending in that direction on Grobbulus.
---
as if any weapon he equipped would be of much use
---
You think they dug up servers from 2005 for this game
---
Socks don't work with all consistencies. Rubber boots are better alternative.
---
I don’t think he meant to be a dick. It sounds pretty normal to me.
---
All I see is an unprepared healer blaming other peoples spec for their lack of ability to react to the situation. The tank could have pulled smarter or had more mitigation but at that point in the dungeon the healer should have known how squishy they were and been quicker with the heals.
---
Raider in a top guild who also sits in the lootcouncil, I can back it up.
---
We were literally like "jesus fuck who do we give this to? No one even has the 4k gold for it, and everyone is farming something else anyway."
---
We even considered giving it to a druid who made a good point by saying he will dedicate all his time into this hammer.
---
We didn't want to give it to our two rets (one of them who was in the lootcouncil) because, well, it might take dibs out of the next OEB or even BRE (and honestly, BRE is better for PvE anyway so... yeah...)
---
In the end we just gave it to one of the palas after doing a roll 2, no one really cares if he'll make it or not.
---
If it drops again, one of our Raidleads said he'll make a video of him looting it, going to IF, vendoring it, logging off to an alt and logging back into the main to show that the rebuy thingie is empty.
---
Preach the truth!
---
Out of curiosity, what’s the name of the guild?
---
Now kiss
---
&gt;  if he wanted the hand that badly he should have been laying out a case for it well before it actually dropped.
---
I think he put too much faith in the LC being able to recognise his guild efforts as "laying out a case" to deserve the Eye.
---
I used to make very decent gold selling copper rods on the AH. It's just kinda funny, really.
---
What about bugs
---
It'll be worth less after phase 3. Shammies get more options
---
Showering ? I don't have this in my spellbook.
---
They keep leaving in the stupid shit that should get fixed and fixing the stuff that makes things slightly more manageable.
---
Because they are bad/lazy.
---
Its under special action button
---
Would be more interesting without it imo.
---
The Undermine Journal dot com is where I go.
---
I multibox 3mages and a priest. Funny how no one wants to mess with me unless they are 10+ levels higher or rolling 5deep.
---
Such a shitty guild you are in where you can buy raid loot
---
pretty sure I saw Venruki with over 4k hp in the dualing tournament. It is almost 2x the hp of your common glassmage.
---
Yeah some people still do it, i'm not sure why in 2019 but i still see people just standing in effects or even after a raid alert has popped up telling someone to move because of a debuff or the like they still stand for ages before reacting.
---
LOL. Thank you :)
---
Sorry another question from me .I hate the horde- alliance imbalance on Stonespine EU and was thinking about moving ... The high population servers I can move to are Bloodfang EU or Earthshaker EU ... anyone has experience with either of these realms ? How is the horde- alliance balance please ?
---
I was not prepared for the feels :/
---
305 will get you essentially 3% crit by reducing the hit cap from 9%-&gt;6%. The next 5 weapon expertise will get you another 1% reduction I think, and you’ll get a steady glancing blow damage increase from 300 -&gt; 310. Everything after from my knowledge isn’t really necessary.
---
I have never played any version of wow before classic, and I noticed this as well! For me it's most obvious on mounts, especially the wolves: zoomed out they look fine, but when you zoom in you can easily see how simple they are after all.
---
I have 7 days played at 60 and I do nothing but run dungeons and raid and I still have 3 greens. Getting full pre raid bis isn't easy for everyone. I've only gotten 2 drops from dungeons, the rest of my gear is crafted, quest reward, or boe. 
---
I still top meters in raids only to watch people who don't break top 10 and only show up on raid night get gear over me.
---
This is wrong, and so easy to test its stupid. If base XP was determined by experience highest level player in party would receive then if you had a 60 in your party, you would never get any XP for mobs below lvl 51. You definitely get XP for mobs that are low level even if the highest level player would receive no XP.
---
But her eyes said "yes".
---
This sounds blatantly melodramatic and greedy "I just want it to go to someone who will give the most back to the guild" sounds exactly like "I want it to go to me" but he has a good point.
---
&gt; Honestly if I got this pissed off about loot I would just stop playing the game... it doesn't sound remotely healthy.
---
That's kinda what he did. He stopped playing for that guild. Obviously is a bit too entrenched in the game, but at least he's not staying there to get taken advantage of again in the future.
---
High Intelligence/Stam; while not needed, I use a spirit set in-between pulls so I spend less time drinking/eating to prioritize moving to the next area
---
You will have a much more enjoyable time leveling your warrior as arms and not protection. You can still tank dungeons just fine as an arms warrior.
---
As a Resto Shammy, do I want to use a waist item with 8mp5 or one with 35 healing increase?
---
Both seem pretty good and I can't decide which one to use. Right now I primarily run dungeons, which means fights are short, so I went with the healing increase. Thanks for any answers!
---
And fuck all of you for downvoting this.  You are the cancer that keeps ruining this fucking game.
---
port to console tomorrow plz
---
No, there's plenty of people who play rogue that aren't complete assholes.
---
&gt;fuck thai hate that fucking trip
---
800x600 crt when i started, after a few weeks though i got an lcd and moved up. I never had fps issues though with my rig.
---
But what other choice do you have other than to land?
---
No chance - you want to dominate PvP to the point of getting rank 14 then the PvP rewards aren’t enough. You need to be raiding as well.
---
Yeah I have no clue what my email and password are.
---
I'm a gnome rogue actually. The only thing that's awful to get is dalrends and HOJ. Instead I got a krol blade + mirah's song and the class trinket. I believe HOJ is better once you hit 14% hit without your class trinket though. HOJ is the only piece that took me fucking eternity to get.
---
I mean... I played it when I was 12.
---
Which is the reason I'm playing it now.
---
Are you the pally from the wow blizzard forum saying that tanks can only sword and board
---
This is why I avoid raising altogether. I just play for fun. Farming decent loot, selling crafted items, helping others etc. Raids are a waste of time, especially with this loot council politics. Franky, the game should have something to deal with that and not leave it to the players
---
But your still just dead at the GY.

Lot of value in having a guild member who won't write a spergy essay and then gquit when the loot doesn't go their way.
---
No need, I just got off the phone with Mr. Blizzard himself and he said he would have it live tomorrow for OP
---
So your dpi was compareavle to a lot of bigscreen 1080p of today
---
His fault for putting all that effort into the wrong guild.
---
The gear hes doin more dps with

And I completely agree with you. I did like 4 runs just because I didn’t want to abandon half done quests.

More like people are just commenting on what’s written. More info comes out you factor it in.

shows it as a charm
---
If this shit was left up to people like you, Naxx would be out early next year and classic would already be wrapping up.
---
There is other stuff to do besides raids, other games to play and Christ knows you could probably do with some time outside.
---
&gt; Tbh Taurens should be the ones with that buff. Big, tanky, the single largest race lore wise, the most sturdy of bois.
---
I see what you're saying, but I believe the reasoning for Orcs to have the resist is that they're formerly unstoppable demon army footsoldiers with demon blood in their veins. It's a magic-based resistance ability, not a physical one.
---
Are we supposed to just accept this post at face value?
---
Cmon now, where's the other side to it?
---
blizzard was also acquired by activision during wrath
---
Because if he’s being truthful the other guy 100% didn’t deserve to roll.
---
I legit came close to gquitting last week when they gave pereditions blade to a rogue who turned up just to kill Rag using half greens and carrot on a stick over me who has been to every single raid kill so far.
---
Yeh sure it’s a team effort, but don’t waste BIS gear on a guy who hasn’t been online since then. 2 only kills and a full MC wince and he hasnt been on for any of them.
---
&gt; If even 50% of what the dude wrote is true
---
lol he lost a roll and gquit, what makes you think *any* of that is true?
---
Haha... only in our dreams.
---
Says who? Are you part of the raid encounters design team? Who's to say the extra level of complexity isn't intentional?
---
Also it's a fight that lasts like 60 seconds or less, who cares?
---
Beautiful video. Here's to competing for server first from &lt;Everest&gt;
---
Even more so on a forum.  People often have unrealistic expectations from a guild and the fact he has gone through three guilds in two months would indicate the issue isn't solely on the guild side.
---
If you want to answer him genuinely, you have to include that aspect of it.  
---
Odd accusation of toxicity honestly.  I didn't insult the guy, I offered him tough advice.  You claim of toxicity and blizzard forums is more toxic than anything I stated.
---
I leveled to 53 on what is basically a dead server and really regret it, so I’ve rerolled on a high pop and it feels so much better. But now I’m only lvl 15 and feel super “behind” everyone. How do I get past this? Or should I just stick it out on the dead server (Anathema)?
---
Yep, I’ve been playing through the Outer Worlds this game is great.
---
Phase 3 is really the sweet spot for Classic and I wouldn’t mind staying on that phase for longer than they intend to, waiting 6 months for the PVP system to be released because people level slow is foolish.
---
How does re-speccing work? Does the cost of the re-spec come down over time if you do not re-spec for a few weeks or months?
---
Maladapted
---
Later phase?
---
If hand of rag would drop by itself, I would agree. As it doesn't, BRE is better, because you don't have to grind your ass off to get it.
---
Ah more willpower than me. I played on some private servers and have done it enough for me to never want to again. 
---
Agreed with your original point tho, it’s a cunt move to leave after finishing your specific quest and not help others in your party.
---
Healing as enhance contributes more to the raid than dpsing as enhance.
---
Every healer in my raid parses that.consequently no one dies and we clear MC quickly.
---
Easy to do in prebis healing gear (+500 healing).

if you like deja mark you should try the addon opie

it lets you assign any skill or mark or item or mount to any number if customizable rings that appear when you hold down a hotkey
---
  Like you said the 5 sword wep skill is w.e, its super min maxy for swords so its nice but I can tell you as someome who has every piece besides acuria on my rogue that I wish I went daggers over swords because it is just way more fun to be daggers for pvp and it would be an even easier pve rotation. 
---
    Dont worry too much about hitting 310 unless its easily possible, 305 gives you 3% hit that you dont need to get, and after that there is DR to the hit you recieve from wep skill.  Just cap out on hit and go from there. Daggers are super fun so enjoy bud.
---
There is no reason you can't use tea when AR is up.

If I got skullflame shield like that there is no way in hell i would give it to a mage. i dont give a fuck if he rolls 101 , i would give it to the warrior pala that rolled the highest

That's how it was. Reset instance and start over

Can we just get a single player story driven Warcraft rpg already

Ah thanks then that’s it

Or you could group with people

So what do you do when there's 2 equally deserving people? Duel it out?

Fuck I'd even take it baldurs gate style
---
I got corpse camped by a 60 war on epic mount yesterday in STV. Why? I'm pretty sure cause I killed his alt rogue that tried ganking me.
---
Could not get away from him for about 15 mins.
---
"once you get capped" thats they key there, sheriff. To even get capped it will take you a looong time and its up to you to decide what cap you even want to reach. All specs have different BiS sets and you aint getting them in a month unless you have the luck of a lottery winner. (a month at max level raiding, not total gametime)  
---
Imagine doing it to multiple classes or specs.... nothing like WoD, not even close.
---
no i'm a priest, i don't think alot of people see the "humor" flair. i'm not claiming Fury prot is bad, i personally love it. but the fact that this tank just charge pulled, didn't go in defensive stance and died in less than 2 second while i was looking away and drinking we found hilarous
---
I've found it's hard to get some drops, it's not that hard though to find close to equivalents for a lot of classes. If you watch the ah long enough some classes can even grab random enchant greens that from a pure dps point are as good.
---
If you really care, just sheep or stun them.
---
Eh if he’s accurate I’d side with him. Legendaries that require guild investment should go to the person who puts the most in to the guild.
---
If there’s another side I’d love to read it.
---
Silk sells for 30-35 silver a stack on my server, worth more to craft it into heavy bandages and vendor it.
---
Those run for like 7g on my server and I'm pretty poor... are they essential and if so, how many do I need?
---
a lil different for a rogue than it is a healer but its less about getting the pre-bis and putting in the effort to farm it for yourself and guildees alike.
---
No set if items are as important as a shield for mitigation.
---
Fury/Prot tanking is fine, better than fine even, as most tanks have 0 points in prot.  The thing is, you don't have to DW to fury tank... 
---
The problem tends to be when people try to fury tank without a shield, or worse, with their dps fury leather on (been in multiple dungeons where a warrior does this, with devilsaur leather, and assorted mail pieces).
---
Yea i was asking the same to ppl in my realm
---
Flying from hinterlands to booty bay last night I brushed my teeth, and took the dog out for a bathroom break walk, by the time I came back inside I was still flying over the last bit of STV.
---
it's true
---
12 days at 60 yeah it's enough time to get pre bis easy.
---
Sounds about right, I do the same thing when I get ganked too much.
---
I have rules though.  If I get killed by someone who isn't red or a skull, then bringing on my alt is not allowed. That's a move for bitches.
---
But if it's a skull then, oh okay time to pick on someone your own size punkass.
---
Healthy imbalance, like dota
---
The problem with that gameplay wise is that you can't have them just be the best at everything physical. Same reason that NE males can be all the same classes as NE females. In the lore, the women were the warriors exclusively. The males were mostly just druids and priests, but never warriors.
---
The nod to taurens being the strongest is the fact that they have a racial bonus to hp. Also, warstomp is literally just them stomping ON THE GROUND but it has the effect of stunning people who are too close.
---
Orcs are just the most used to getting hit in the head because of all the practice they have.
---
Its a loot council, if they really wanted to benefit their friend that would've just awarded to him. Dude's just mad he lost a roll.
---
Wowhead says phase 3 so probably.
---
XD
---
why would you grind ap in the first place
---
I rolled on Kurinax, and had a buddy transfer to Anathema when the did the character transfers.  I didn’t trust it and didn’t follow but started an alt over there that I sort of abandoned.  How is the population over there these days,  it was hard finding low level dungeons even when character transfers were fresh.
---
And oddly a burst of a few invites in a few minutes, then nothing for most of an hour.
---
Still early, it’s worth the time now to level before the pvp phase. Keep strong
---
sounds like he was in the wrong guild anyways. any guild who rolls off legendaries or gives it to a biased loot council instead of giving them to the best/most dedicated player is trash. guy should have done his research before putting in time with them

" This is like posting your having a blast after the first quest in bfa "  
---
Aint that a weird sentence...  people are having a blast 30+ levels into the game as opposed to just one quest.

Id call that an easy win  right there. :)

I had all that in 2014

Went troll female hunter got to 60 fucking hate trolls dont even want to play my hunter cause of it

Alt + f4
---
if you're using flash heal, you need a different strategy
---
are you positive? i have a feeling they have, especially if using rank 2. we're going with rank 1 next week to see if that somehow makes a difference
---
Final lesson. Even if you do all the things and know all the people, you can get fucked pretty easily by just about everything. Prepare for disappointment.
---
Double edge sword tho.
---
Had a NEET officer. He was online all day every day. Unemployed. He had a ton of alts for mooncloth/arcanite CDs and had two accounts so he could reset dungeons for himself. He did a ton of stuff for the guild. Ran the guild bank with spreadsheets, did the RL, did recruiting etc. 
---
One day he decided he did too much and wanted to lead the guild. Our GM is fairly active too but  he has a job and nobody can compete with an NEET when it comes to active. So there was a guild schism. Half raiders left and half stayed. Since he had the guild bank alt he took that as well. All our cores etc went to his new guild.
---
How far can that logic go though, any BoE items that drop could qualify under this idea, same with any patterns, recipies and plans, hell even the books in dire maul and librams would fall into this category, literally anything that can be put on the AH would be an automatic need for everyone in the group. I like to judge it the way the game does, Need for things you actually need to use, and Greed for things you'd want to sell for money, that line is pretty clearly drawn with just those words, no need to complicate things.
---
yea because i dont want to use the authenticator all the time
---
Which is literally the opposite of what drew me to WoW in the first place, coming from traditional MMO's like EQ or DAoC with their super-specialized classes.
---
Really? That's awesome! Glad I could provide this blast to the past.
---
I’ve seen skinning knives with the 30 spell power enchant being used by my guildies. They swear by it.
---
Yeah but if this party was a Fourth of July party (PVP server) and I wanted to pop some smaller fireworks (world PVP) but they won’t go off it’d be kind of lame, you gotta give me the small shows before we get to the big illegal display (battlegrounds).
---
What is that thing in the bottom? Never seen that before.
---
Not in Education, Employment, or Training. Basically they have no real life obligations.

But that’s a Draenei

Honestly 12 days played altogether is enough for pre Bis, let alone 12 at lvl 60...

English is my third language. Thank you for the correction.

Weird flex but okay

Also, he's more dedicated to the spec. Badass mofo breathes enhance, he even heals in it.

THERE ARE 4 LIGHTS!!

FR is good for Ony for the Fireballs, deep breath and P3 molten cracks, but you don't need them to survive at all.
---
I go in with 30-40FR and 2 GFP pots (I chug one if I get hit by a fireball in P2) and I've survived in 3/4 of our encounters. The one time I died is because Ony immediately aggrod me after P2 and no amount of fire resist was going to help me against her melee.
---
I was 18 unemployed and had nothing else to do. Now I have a professional career, family, and other hobbies.

I really can’t attest to warr gear choices I rarely hsve my guildies wear shields in any dungeons below UBRS

If they are they certainly aren’t asking Reddit for help.
---
I'm a rogue too, I dunno some stuff is easy to get like cadaverous armor and mask of the unforgiven but getting stuff like truestrike and baron cape is a real bitch. I need to find a group that will take me hope it drops then win the roll, I've lost rolls on both truestrike and cape :(. HoJ sucks to get too, you'll always have at least one other person to roll against if it even drops, I got lucky and won the second time it dropped though. Dalrends are definitely the worst to get I'd imagine though (I'm daggers and don't really care to grind Felstriker), the groups I see doing Rend runs almost always have Dalrends reserved.
---
Today I got cheetah-dazed multiple times when I clearly activated it after taking a hit. As in, I waited for the hit. Turned on AotC. Became dazed. Batching is fucking ridiculous.

This is what I miss the most in retail. My favorite part of the game is floating between roles as a hybrid (I play a druid).  People getting hung up on meters drives me bugfuck.

That's how I hit 60 too! (except unplanned..)

how is the overall population ? Is it active on server ?

Meanwhile I’ve so far given every orb that’s dropped to friends who need them more.

---
You dont even need Krol Blade, you can enter raids with Thrash Blade and be perfectly fine
---
&gt;There's a reason in dungeons. To clear it faster. Plenty of raiders are still doing strath UD because there is BIS in there that isn't as easy to farm as something like BRD and there is the baron's mount.
---
Yeah and if you're pugging this you should expect you won't have optimal groups. So perhaps don't go in with DW Fury spec on because your favorite streamers are doing it. It's seriously not needed. If you're doing this with friends or guildies thats one thing. But not everyone plays optimally or perfectly as evidence from the video alone.
---
&gt;The priest in the video has raid gear on. Pretty decent raid gear judging from their health and mana pools.
---
I'm talking generally speaking. The priest was obviously not great either.
---
&gt;They have two mages. The optimal strategy is to pull at least two packs and AOE them down. The mages have to drink so there is no reason to go light on the healers mana.
---
Ah the optimal strategy. Were they pugging or were they a group? Because if you're pugging you probably shouldn't take risks like that when you don't know the caliber of your pug. I mean thats exactly why these types of wipes occur. Its amazing to me how it keeps happening now even post leveling scene. When people leveled up they all thought they should do Spellcleave because its optimal, but then they end up pugging with people who don't know what the hell that is so they wipe. You can play optimally when you have friends or guildies. Until then you really shouldnt over estimate the capabilities of your random dungeon mates. It's been like this since 2004. 
---
Except the preferred DPS warrior raid spec is fury. An Arms warrior with a 2H would also have died on that pull. A prot warrior might have just survived but it would be very close because the healer reacted slowly and cast a big slow heal instead of a fast heal.
---
That's great. We can respec. I do it twice a week. You keep referring to this video specifically too when I'm talking in general. Many healers despise having to try to keep up these DW tanks in 5 mans. This is for pugs obviously. I don't care what you do if you're with a guild or friends. But be reasonable and expect the majority of people aren't playing at a hardcore level. Because they're not.

Not in education, employment, or training. (basically all they do is sit at home and play games)
---
You're a small, small insecure man.
---
Man, people shit on MoP so hard, but it was probably my favorite expansion after BC. It was like a brief glimmer of hope sandwiched between Cata and WoD.
---
Tier 2.5 from AQ is covered in it
---
It's The Confrontation from Les Mis, that's how it goes
---
no education, employment, training.
---
no life losers who play classic all day
---
I feel like there's something to be had with a balance druid singing Stars
---
I can only imagine :(
---
rare scanner does this but I don’t know if the guy made a classic version. might just be for BFA.. but you can just look for similar addons
---
Would be nice if the jackass rogue couldn't link DPS numbers every 5 minutes. I'd sacrifice a threat meter for that.
---
Do you have a Guide how to edit faces to speak?
---
there werent two equally deserving people here
---
Oh man, same. I still get crazy nostalgic about the WotLK leveling experience even though I never did any raiding in that expansion. I was just so... atmospheric, you know?
---
And the priest is a blood elf ! 
---
They were not playable but still part of the lore :)
---
I agree,  fuck those cunts (yes please!) and to the pit of doom for Kai
---
Reminds me of Mass Effect
---
it's way quicker too
---
I mean the time it takes to do it doesn't necessarily matter and it doesn't change the core gameplay and systems available. It is objectively worse than WoD in terms of content in the game. The only available gameplay at max level is doing dungeons to get pre-bis, just because it can potentially take a while doesn't make it better than WoD. Right now the content in the game is abysmal and it's pretty undeniable.
---
Not in Employment Education or Training.  
---
basically someone jobless and not looking.
---
This is likely it. Never mention these things if you do them. It happens more than you'd think, but of course I'll spare you all the details.
---
Mind if I ask how long it took from 23 to 27 doing that?
---
Same thing I probably did. Wander around and enjoy the polygons haha. Explore the world of warcraft
---
How is that a weird flex
---
Yeah I have no idea what my password is with LastPass
---
Honestly blizzard should just enforce every item being BoP on need. Done and done, argument over.
---
&gt; freedom of gearing
---
&gt; wearing preraid bis as dictated by every endgame fury guide
---
The problem is most ret paladins don’t play like you and just wanna dps
---
I always thought soul shards disappear on logout like conjured items. I'm a warrior pleb. Forgive me.
---
sorry that's really specious reasoning...
---
they're talking about the best means of pickpocketing and in that context it is not an invalid suggestion
---
Is this /s or is this legit? Im confused
---
Oh no I’m exposed :( I asked reddit for tips.. I got the gold btw :) crafting the Hammer this weekend probably
---
We use "fucker" the same here. Saying "come here you fucker" and hugging someone is good. Saying "you are a real fucker, Steve" is not good
---
Some guilds are going to put in the effort to distribute loot based on merit, others will run casually and distribute loot by rolls. It's okay for both kinds to exist. MC is not hardcore content, just because you're running it doesn't mean you're a serious guild. The fault is on this guy for not realizing what sort of guild he was in.
---
Haha take ur upvote
---
It's not, unfortunately. Playing 40 accounts also means he's paying 40 subs, and Blizzard salivates at the thought of making that much cash off of a single player.
---
That doesnt sound double edged. The NEET did the most work, wasnt rewarded for it so took it to himself to get what he wanted.
---
The Alliance have the best guilds and generally speaking higher quality players.
---
Anybody uses Vuhdo addon for healing? Im trying to figure out a way to manually move certain individuals into their own panel, but I cant find a way to do it. I know main tanks can be grouped, but I just want to do something simple like moving each individual around to where I want
---
Same bruh
---
And you can't activate ToEP + ZHC together anymore, so that's another big nerf.
---
&gt; inb4 the mace is literally never made by Kai.
---
Not OP or in OP's guild but we the idea that a single person should farm the hammer is hilarious to me.
---
That weapon, and Thunderfury as well, is a guild effort.
---
They look very cool indeed! Nice catch!
---
Grats! My guild got our first ragna this tuesday and second on thursday felt so damn good. We got the eye both kills. Prolly wont see it ever again haha.

&gt;Editing your comment to whine about downvotes while calling other people whiny
---
That's what's great about classic :) you can innovate! Problem solve. These things create value within the game by giving you a sense of accomplishment.
---
who said anything about a personal journey dude?
---
This pumpkin is insane-ly well done! Bravo!
---
I have no idea what my info is to actually log in without battle net lmao
---
Warriors can use all weapons except for wands.
