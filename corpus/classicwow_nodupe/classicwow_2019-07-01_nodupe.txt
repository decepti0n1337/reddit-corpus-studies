At the start of the expansion? Really?
---
---
---
Oh boy. Haven't seen this topic 30 times.
---
We really don't know for sure yet. Blizzard was very vague about the itemization post. Basically we know that all items are in their 1.12 state. This means the r14 1handers do 60 dps instead of 50 they start out with. They already said that items will come out when they should be, but they weren't that concrete about it. If this statement is true, then the blue pvp set should be lvl58 on launch as it's a different set than the lvl60, and it should first be released in patch 1.11 along with the various other Rank14 gear like the good caster/healer gear and the melee swiftblade. But we don't know for sure this is the case, but that's what their statements seem to imply. 
---

---
As for getting it before phase 3 well it takes min. 12 weeks and I heard about phase 2 only lasting 2 months, but we'll also have to see about that.
---
Pallies have a lot to do, I don't disagree. And of course theres levels of depth to every single class. But, from an outside perspective of priests, they seem more open ended, in terms of niche abilities. People say mages are just 1 button spams that require no skill. But theres a lot you can do to improve in every aspect of your gameplay to make you better, that makes the class engaging.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So I don't have anything against Paladins. If we get BC, I'm probably rolling one. And also, I know *for sure* that I'm going to have a paladin in Classic... just probably as a lower level to have fun as in pvp/dungeons, maybe even as prot at some point.
---
I'd say you've made the world a better place by not playing an undead rogue... until you said night elf hunter.
---
Nice i was alliance warrior. Deloran. hoping they keep the original server names so i can go back
---
Learn to leeway kite and warrior is alot easier (although not the easiest of course) to level.
---
Enemy cast bars + dot timers.
---
Barrens zone chat. 
---
Magical place to lose your all hope for humanity
---
Yeah being top dps throughout the entire game is pure torture.
---
First off tell me what macro this is please if you’re so knowledgeable about it, secondly how stupid do you have to be to believe that a 1/100 chance is ‘unlikely’.   How many times do you think he has rolled and said “watch me roll a X” and nothing happened?  
---
Just in case you don’t know, he does it all the time, he rolls randomly all the time and has been doing this random shit for the last 8 years he has been streaming.  And he has one clip of him calling a 1% guess and gets it and you think it’s fake lol.  My dude you’re just a fuckin nut, I’m sorry to tell you this.
---
You know that BGs are not in phase 2 right? Only world PVP.
---
I've played a druid on a recent private server, and thats been a great aspect of the druid class. From 1-56, i was feral and tanked mostly, dps'd when asked, and even had a heal set that never let me down as a feral healer. I swapped to resto at 56, and I've done a good number of dungeons. I haven't even hit 60 yet, for a LONG time now, but it's been fun to do a dungeon every now and then as a healer. I especially enjoy having different ranks of Healing Touch that have different speeds and efficiencies, and trying to keep everybody as safe as possible, while not draining my mana pool. Healing gets \*hairy\* very quickly though as a druid in dungeons. You have a handful of oh-shit tools, and it's great when they save the day. But they don't always save the day, and you don't have a resurrect. Not to mention the fact that you're screwed as a (mostly cloth wearing) druid Healer if you pull aggro.
---
And I especially don't want to raid as one. But it's been great experiencing the game as all three roles in every dungeon.
---
Upvote for Lutris.
---
I've successfully run retail and the stress test on my Fedora install; feeling pretty good about Linux gaming lately.
---
No one will get stuck in MC/Bwl. Even with noobs and unoptimal raid compositions, with how easy you can access gear/boss/rotations compared to before, raid will be miles better in average than they were. Yes some guilds might struggle on a few bosses a 1-2 weeks, but unless you wanna be among first of servers, you should just play with them. You'll eventually get to naxx. Zero doubt about it.
---
You have friends IRL?
---
Wow that takes me back.. My first lvl 60 was an undead Rogue.. Good times. Love the art
---
A bunch of times. Its because I can't have everything all at once in one character. I can't be a special healer boy, be good at farming, and destroy fools in 1v1s. 
---
I did a bunch of 1-30 runs on all the classes, and I'm not closer to an answer for my main. I'm back where I started, feel like I may as well just roll a dice
---
«Yayyyy!!!! :3» and «Yaaaaas, fabulous quaaaaan» are both common Alliance warcries.
---
you still need a lot of runecloth for that corpsehorse ;)
---
Did you play warrior tank at any point in WoW yet? I started playing a prot war in BC, and Wrath was fun too. After that, the raid tanking gameplay got really stale for me.

Playing rushing through by Bachelor Thesis project 8h/day to Finish it before Classic Launch
---
I’ve /s ‘This is Brill!’ every time I first enter Brill (altaholic) since 2005. Just before BFA there was a whole load of us marching in Tirisfal and I say ‘This is Brill!’, guy next to me s/ ‘Not for long...’
---
Main? No... Race / faction? About 100 times
---
Yeah, he does it all the time and whenever he wants new subscribers or follows or reddit attention, he presses his macros instead.
---
Google the macro, I'm not doing it for you.
---
Thats great that you're gonna be playing Classic with old friends. Are you gonna be tanking?
---
only a few thousand off, which is easily farmed or bought off the AH.
---
thats my class rotation too, tell me when you settle maybe i can make my mind up too then lol
---
LFR obviously.
---
Aye been mt for a couple of guilds through the years as warrior. But they are just an empty shell these days...
---
Night Elf Male Priest.
---
Jk
---
Is the human racial for swords that big of a thing? Like if I roll dwarf instead of human is it going to put me at a pretty significant "disadvantage" when trying to compete against other rogues in raids?
---
Didn't see that anywhere. And the written guide free as it is.
---
Hahahaha you’re a fucking moron my dude holy shit.  What a way to try and get subs by calling a roll.  “OMG I HAVE TO WATCH THIS GUY HE CALLED A ROLL” -literally no one fucking ever.
---
Btw I did google it, it doesn’t exist, never has.  You’re a fucking nut job.
---
No clue, might as well submit a bug report and see what comes of it.
---
I am still debating between hunter, Warrior, Feral Tank druid, and my old main Shaman.
---
Could you give me a little bit more information on that? Why exactly would I have to go daggers instead of swords?
---
Maybe just try each class. Whenever you want to try one class, play it. If you end up wanting to try something else, just make the toon and play it until you're either bored or want to try something else new.
---
You won't be doing Molten Core on week 1 by any means, but you'll know what you want to play if you level them all.
---
yeah, first aid can wait.
---
do you know if the vendors are available at release? need my kodo too. nothing better than riding a big fat lizard as a female orc
---
Pretty much what people have been saying for ages, make an entire movie with the quality of the cinematics.
---
I'm in the same boat...
---
I'm sure just the knowledge you are able to pass to them will be more than enough. Not to mention every 8-10 levels you can help them knock out all their elite quests which gives a big boost in experience and gear, most of which I at least didn't have access to when I leveled in classic. Add in dungeon runs now and again... what more could your more casual buddies ask for? 
---
That's more than most of us got our first time. If they still aren't hooked, lets face it, these games aren't for everyone.
---
On their website stated they are in process of working with coder to make it an addon. Aiming to have it done by launch. VanillaGuide addon is based heavily off their guide too.
---
Glad to see there are some diehard horde folk in here. We need that 50:50 split!
---
It's 80% farmland. Sure, it's coastal but if the land wasn't fertile they would have deforested Elwyn to support the kingdom. 
---
Lush green grass in westfall is fine.
---
Shout out to original EQ players.
---
gay
---
I did level them all up to 30 lol.
---
How big of a deal is the sword specialization? Will I be at a huge disadvantage if I roll dwarf instead of human in regards to competing against human rogues in the raid?
---
Because it is and some damn elitists here like to promote minmaxing and rejecting people not doing it. Therefore I guess it's a good habit reminding that for the new people that read the sub.
---
[Literally the first result](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=wow+yellow+text+macro).

And he got 3 gifted subs for a single roll... if that was your livelihood, of course you'd macro that shit.

Any chance you try to convert this one?
---
/script if UnitExists("target") then if a==0 then PetAttack(target) a=1 else if UnitExists("pettarget") and UnitIsUnit("target", "pettarget") then PetFollow("CharacterNameHere") a=0 else PetAttack(target) end;end; else PetFollow("CharacterNameHere") a=0 end;
---
First press will attack the target, second press will bring it back to you if you have the same target, if you have a different target it'll attack the other target.
---
Have you considered leveling them all up to 60? All you need is a year off of work and a semi truck full of Mountain Dew to make it happen.
---
Once you get some ret gear paladins can farm lashers if you respec. Personally I'm an advocate of herb farming since paladin is pretty good at it. Hammer into herb during stun or bop are both strong.
---
I'm guessing you make female characters only? Thanks for the tips though!
---
I agree completely. And if he is willing to no life the grind and gets help from his guild with rep, raids, and probably blue shard mats, he could do it.  I don't know of many people that can go from 2-3 hours a day to 12+ for the grind. And maybe he gets most of his guild to help, but it's still a sustained effort that they may not stick with. Casual guilds have great players too, but don't put in a ton of time or effort for different reasons. So it's risky to depend on them to farm carpaces.
---
Sure in theory it's possible, but not as a casual. Which the op identified as. He writes like it's 'just a grind' and from a video thinks it shouldn't be that big of a deal, then agrees with the one comment that semi validates his belief and ignored all the others, even the ones that weren't trolls. Not trying to shit on him, but he should understand the time commitment needed to make scarab lord possible. Otherwise he'll be unprepared.
---
Be interested to watch that, which one is it?
---
Yeah, if you're good at whipping up your own groups, playing a warrior is such an advantage. You can choose what group content you want to do when you're the linchpin in forming a group.
---
Do I need the retail game and all the expansions in order to play classic? or do I just need a subscription?
---
Did you learn your lesson?
---
What exactly is the reward if you get all the pages? I've literally never tried - thought it would've been too much of a pain in the ass.
---
Hey do you happen to know how to read my dude?  Read your articles that you are linking 
---
“These only work on private servers, on live servers you will be instantly disconnected as they are not allowed”
---
Fuck you’re dumb.
---
I'm down to druid (tauren or nelf), priest (troll or nelf), warlock (orc) or mage (undead). I kinda want to play nelf priest because MC from shadowmeld seems quite amusing, and I know the ally questing areas in great detail, but ehhhhhhh. I faction changed in WotLK to forsaken mage, and mained it throughout, so it might be nice to play it as it was in Vanilla. But so many magi!
---
So dark and gloomy. I love it!

---
That sounds about right. If each server has at least 10 layers of 2000-3000 people, you have the equivalent of 30-50 traditional wow servers. I wouldn’t be surprised if blizzard even spins some of these split servers into dedicated realms for Germans, Australians and RP PvPers.
---
Are you able to do another race's 1-6 quests? For example, as a Gnome, could I go quest in Northshire?
---
Just a subscription. Classic, as well as everything I'm retail ending at Legion is included in a subscription. BfA (current expansion) is sold separately.
---
Great video..
---
Reddit once again proving that most of their users have autism by not getting a very obvious joke.

Gotta work on that rigid thinking lads.

The first blue post already stated that the pvp system+rewards will come out in phase 2. And we also know that all items will have 1.12 stats. So how does that not aNswer your QUESTION?
---
Why dwaf over human?
---
Do you think I could do the same thing from my iPhone 10 max? I’m amazed that this could be a possibility.
---
Can't be done with the modern macro system.
---
Be weary of level 60 guides that talk about tanking with a dps spec, or without a shield.  That stuff isn't for the average person, assuming it works at all.
---
fOrTnItE bAd xD
---
I have a sneaking suspicion cloth vendors will be in the game, but without that or AV horde will be blocked into their own racial mounts or the wolves.
---
Dual Spec
---
"Can somebody please come and kill the gankers in Redridge, my wife and her boyfriend keep getting killed."
---
I would be VERY surprised if they split servers up. That would be a fucking nightmare filled with complaints.
---
If they need more servers, they'll open more up and allow free transfers.
---
Is this on the beta or a shitty private server? The warrior leveling experience is pretty different depending on which one it is.
---
my favorite thing to do while waiting for the zeppelin was start up casual in character conversations with other people waiting there
---
"So... nice weather we're having"
---
What's the proper method of getting your professions right for 60? I know engineering is a MUST for pvp (ill be a priest) but i also really want tailoring while I level for the gear and the immersion- is it in any way financially feasible to level engineering without accompanying mining if I only have one toon?
---
He'll learn, And he'll be better for it in the future. Playing on an non optimal input device is only putting him at a bigger disadvantage than having him learn keyboard. 
---
That's my opinion anyways.
---
If you want your wands at the min level 5 &amp; 13 it’s difficult/time consuming to achieve on a new server. I’d take skinning, vendor the mats and use the money to buy the wands off the AH for a few silver.
---
I’d also take enchanting cos you can disenchant items from quests you don’t need or old items your replacing on yourself. Or, leave enchanting till 60 when you’d drop skinning and level tailoring instead. Personal I don’t find tailoring all that useful when leveling but YMMV.
---
come back to this comment in 8 months and I 100% guarantee that it will be the case; times change. The only time most non 'op' classes will be brought is for specific dots. 
---
People are not going to want to run a dungeon with a red-a-din. Why do BRD with somoene who is going to make it take 25% longer?  Why do that when you could just bring a rouge or even a warrior?
---
Don't bring a druid for a healer... if you wipe you can't rez. IN vanilla there are only 2 classes that can rez per faction. You have to have 1 of those 2 in the group if you want rezzers (Inb4 jumper cables) 
---
These are going to be people's very real concearns.
---
rip this is one of the best hunter macros
---
&gt; weird monitor setup.
---
But he has so many, which obviously makes it better...
---
No you’ll need to be at least lv 35 and one of the trainers is in the Uldamann instance too.
---
Ele shaman are reliant on raid gear to get enough burst for wpvp greatness. The good news is most of it is easy to get. Nature mail shoulders from mc, shaman class trinket from bwl, zhc from zg, and malistars/vael shield are fairly easy to get. Lokamir is very powerful, but other healers and spriests will be competing for that
---
More like stupid questions. Decided to play a lock. Friends want to be alliance. Never done that, do I play human? Engineering was best for pvp?, but alongside what, if it is?
---
Thanks
---
The only double druid strat the I can think of off the top of my head is WSG. Typically you want a Druid to be your flag carrier, and if you can have a second druid to follow you and pocket heal it helps a lot. Another Druid is the only one the can effectively keep up speed wise.
---
We have realm-wide Discord and addons for that.
---
The tavern is multiplayer, did you not play the secret level in the campaign with chen? also the founding of durotar was introduced as a free patch after the game had already released.
---
Where did you try Warrior?
---
I’ve tried warrior lvling for the first time on private server this week, and it felt way worse that in the beta stress tests
---
So I don’t think the experience will be that bad in classic as private server suggests
---
‘Garrosh told us spikes were in this year: all the Orcs are wearing them.’
---
I’ve just been in the same situation on my Priest and i leveled in the Badlands not many quests but a lot of mobs to take down per quest and people keen to group up.
---
That would be nice but it won't be the case. 
---
Times change you can't expect millions of players to change their behavious. 
---
LFM BRD 60s only M/R only Ironfoe reserved &lt;---- that will be classic 100%
---
am i dumb or are the districts/harbor incorrectly placed
---
I don't want to be that guy but people have been using it in one form or another, be it sweetfx or reshade since the cata days at least (that's when I was messing around with it) and I've never heard of someone actually getting banned for it. 
---
I agree it's a definitely a grey area though since Blizzard will never confirm nor deny their acceptance for any third party software and I wouldn't personally vouch for its use as a result.
---
thankyou, follow up random question, there is a sale on six month subscription right now, any Idea how long the sale will last?
---
Watch good players, look at what they do and think about why they do it. 
---
Payo, Perplexity, Pikaboo etc watch them with the intent of learning. 
---
Eventually it's all just muscle memory and match up knowledge, you don't play it the same against every class. experience isn't something you're going to get without losing a lot first.
---
&gt; That should have been a brutal and horrific scene where the father watches his screaming son get torn to shreds right in front of his eyes
---
Since my sons were born I can't watch The Patriot anymore.  If that were a scene in that movie (and I had actually seen it), I'd walk out of the theater in disgust.
---
You can downvote me all you want, it would make you look smarter if you just admit you’re wrong bud.   This is how you learn.

re these all confirmed working on the Beta?
---
Which is more fun, orientation week freshman year where youre meeting new people every day and partying with these new people or the middle or senior year where you are putting forth the bare minimum amount of effort to get by and do the exact same thing every week?
---
This. Shamans in vanilla depend too much on some procs, and starve a LOT on mana, too. Not that other classes dont, but lock for instance have if tap, mage can conjure stuff, etc. 
---
Aside from that mage is the meaning of quality of life in vanilla, with portal, great kiting, not being very gear dependent, conjuring shit, high dps, the list goes on and on...
---
Just prepare to be another mage in a sea of them.
---
"oh, it's just a stealthed panther mob."
---
"oh, probably just another stealthed panther, i'm gonna pull the next----"
---
When I leveled my first character (a Warrior) I was ganked, and corpse-camped over and over and over. When I finally hit 60, I then became one of those assholes because of the experience I had leveling up. So in my spare time, I camped Red Ridge and Dark Shore, killed the flight master, killed, ganked and camped any Alliance I saw.. until a bunch of other Level 60 Alliance eventually turned up and were either better than me, or outnumbered me. 
---
That was a regular occurrence on the servers I played on. People looking to create a bit of drama and engage in World PvP by killing town NPCs or ganking / camping lower-level characters to force other people of the opposing faction to come to that zone. Blizzard has previously said "If it's a PvP problem, it has a PvP solution". 
---
Not once was I banned for breaking ToS, nor do I know anybody who was ever banned for participating in World PvP to this extent. The fact that people still try to spread this misinformation is embarrassing. 
---
It is a risk and consequence of playing on a PvP server. Blizzard has PvE servers for people that choose not be a part of it.
---
no
---
You're telling me it's not tristfall glades? Christ I was dumb
---
Isn't the lore for how Shadow is powered post-classic?
---
..and? We're talking about video games here, play something like fire emblem where you regularly have to play around 1% odds fucking your shit up.
---
Needs moar monitors.

[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=338](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=338)
---
Idk where everybody gets these ideas from but they're the same thing. They're all just people and both factions have the same kinds of people. They both end up with annoying spammers and chill individuals. to label either as one thing would be like saying all citizens of the US are X, or all of the UK is Y, etc.
---
I was thinking in just a 1v1 context, in group pvp I think both are annoying and strong vs mages but overall paladins cause more problems in a group setting as a support with defensive cleanse.
---
even taking the "annoying" 100% literally paladins have almost no defenses against a mage.
---
Poly paladin
---
detect magic to see if he is on frost or fire aura
---
use frostbolt or fireball depending on aura
---
scorch while your first spell is in flight
---
arcane missiles because he has no arcane aura
---
fire blast
---
cone of cold
---
blink his HoJ when it happens, then you can immediately blink when it is on cd, then save the third blink for his 2nd HoJ
---
If you aren't geared or he fits in an unexpected flash heal, you may need to tank for 1 AM or spam a couple AE
---
By that point he bubbles after tops 2 judgements and 2 or 3 auto attacks maximum, you've used at least 2 ice barriers and 0-1 mana shields by this point.
---
When he bubbles, you bandage and then sheep for evocation/food
---
Now do this 1 more time and he is dead, whoever has engineering and uses it properly might swing it more in their favor and cause a different outcome, by all things equal the paladin is a straight forward free HK.
---
Shamans can heal themselves more reliably, purge thousands of hp in shields, have independent interrupts like searing totem, grounding totem is nasty, and earth shock is a given. All of those shaman tools are disruptive and cause the mage to lose control of the pacing of the fight, where as with paladin the mage is really forcing the paladin to react.
---
I feel like this is as cut and dry as mage vs warrior, paladin is by far a much easier class to damage with impunity and avoid the cc of, than a shaman.
---
I was able to confirm a few. If someone can test them and let me know that would be great. I don't have beta access. I'm particularly interested in knowinf if the pet control macro works. Should work tho!
---
For me it’s mage or warrior. It depends how many weeks or months between phases. Like if there is plenty of time between first and second phase, I’ll roll mage then warrior. But if the second phase (honor and rank tracking), I’m definitely going warrior cuz I don’t wanna start late on the pvp grind.
---
Updated with link, don't know why it was not showing up
---
Rice PC/10
---
Was gonna go warr/mage, but after levelling a hunter in rogue in beta I'm leaning towards hunter. This shit is easy mode!
---
Honestly that's what's edging me towards female, the only mount orc males don't look oversized on is a kodo.
---
Because the PvP system and rewards coming out ... does not mean that they might not withhold gear that's better an AQ40 (the healing hammer) until Naxx. Which they did in the original game.
---
Similar to how they may have released UBRS, but they aren't planning to release certain blues that didn't exist (in any form) until after the AQ patch -- such as the spell-power shield.
---
So I am trying to figure out where they draw the line on these items that are arguably more powerful than PvP gear.
---
I just see a level of itemization (and potential for odd classes) that... will not have existed at all in origional Classic, or even with that timing on Private Servers, that I feel can drastically change the gameplay experience.
---
There's literally going to be ret paladins with spellpower AND crit/strength gear in a way that didn't exist until AQ40, well before the war-effort comes out. Adding spell-damage two-handers into this likewise makes it pretty scary stuff ... and that stuff didn't exist till Naxx in origional.
---
Which is incredibly rare in Vanilla/Classic.
---
Priest or Hunter. or both.
---
And if people had a way to fake those odds for gifted subs and twitch exposure, people would.
---
Done. You're now being held accountable for all the rage ensued by my windfury 1 shots.
---
It a little exagerated, but on the private server communities is more common to be rejected due to that kind of stuff, it might not be present in Classic release or might be worse, who knows.
---
Sorry, the character was named “Duuke.” :(
---
Are you supposed to die from jumping off? I thought you could walk off and survive with just a little bit of health.
---
I hear trispec priest is pretty solid for pvp, and it doesn't gimp you as much for pve as going full shadow/disc does.
---
Thanks! Was curious how the current leeway mechanic would affect aoe farming.
---
They never claimed it wasnt them, just said it was a mage aoe video with leeway.
---
Go disc priest. 20% more dmg for the ele shaman.
---
I change my mind once a week, at least. LOL
---
There were a ton of race/class combos added in cata. Some were reasonable but others seem absolutely bizarre
---
Dwarf shaman, mage, warlock
---
Gnome Priest
---
Human hunter
---
night elf mage
---
blood elf warrior
---
orc mage
---
tauren paladin/priest
---
troll druid, warlock
---
undead hunter
---
Play gnome, escape artist is great for PvP and some PvE. Extra int while small is nice too. Engi is bis for PvP and PvE. Your other profession would be tailoring for bis PvE chest, you can drop tailoring once you make it. Gathering profession like herbing or mining is good for gold. Alch is nice to make pots and for transmutes.
---
I don't think it's actually a sale, you just get a retail mount included with the sub. This doesn't impact classic as that mount does not carry over.
---
You could team up with an experienced tank that's leveling their dps or farming alt as well. That way you have a tutor while you're learning the tanking role.
---
No problem :)
---
10/10 false dichotomy and failed analogy in one.
---
Depends when you want engineering. If your happy to get 60 first buying all the mats is usually around 100g, on private servers at least. I would just buy. The time you waste mining the exact stuff you need you could more easily be making gold and farming gear at the same time.
---
All of Azeroth would fit inside New York City.  EK + Kalimdor is approximately the size of Brooklyn (not counting JFK airport).
---
I'd say Shaman.
---
Except they don’t, because there isn’t.
---
It's cracking me up that 1/100 is such a big deal to you. I played roulette yesterday and it landed on 1 three times in a row for example
---
Everybody says this, but I'm having serious doubts as to whether my laptop will run classic well
---
Obvious troll is obvious. Go away.
---
You say to stop guessing but yet you gave me a hint. Can I buy a vowel?
---
there's a sale on subscription time itself(the 6 month option), im not subscribed though
---
It gets really good when you hit 30 and get sweeping strikes + whirlwind axe.
---
that is fantastic, amazing that everyone ended up as the "lore" gender for their class somehow. I see why blizz did it but some of the classes not being gated by gender (when lore appropriate) always seemed a bit strange
---
Great guide. Actually confirms I want to play an orc hunter
---
There is a female ne lying in a bed that my friends and I thought was naked in astranaar. I logged in one day really late and saw one of my friends online in ashenvale and he had no business being there so before I could message him to mess with him a little, he logged off lmao
---
Yeah but that’s impossible though.  1:100 never happens my dude.
---
6 year olds should play with toys not games
---
Famous last words
---
Damn that’s kinda fucked lol. It was always like this or not as extreme?
---
Also T1 shoulders. The cardoor shield from Chromaggus is quite rare though and the only real upgrade until AQ/Naxx or possibly ZG.
---
So can this only be done when you way overlevel the mob now?  Is it still even a viable strat then?
---
Congrats? It’s still unlikely that a player could ever pick a number and then /roll that exact number. It doesn’t even become the same odds as a coin flip without 69 rolls.
---
oh thats not so bad price wise. I figure I can also just tailoring enchanting to 60. or i could tailoring mining then drop mining at 60 and use what i picked up along the way, too. thatll be a bag space sucker though. 
---
yeah, buying probably is the easy way.
---
Just stop. What we have seen of layering so far has been in TESTS! Will layers have some issues, I am sure they will. Will layers be as broken as everyone is making them out to be, extremely unlikely.
---
Yes it just obviously takes a while to get over there (usually almost ad long as it takes to get to 6)
---
Yeah it's unlikely but it's not super unlikely in the grand scheme really, imagine an illness that affects 1/100 people, for example.
---
My first character was a warrior and I remember nothing but fun tbh. Sure I only got him to level 54 then switched to hunter (or was it Druid?) but it was a fun 54 levels.
---
If BG's are phase 3 then getting r14 phase 2 is impossible lol.
---
Personally rouge, you get lockpicking which will help you make money and get some items as you level 😁
---
Warrior, Mage, Priest, or maybe paladin? dont want to farm 3 sets of gear though...
---
So why is he allowed to call me an idiot but im not allowed to do the same?
---
Playing on a PvP Server and will level an Orc Rogue to 60 first. Then a Warlock/SPriest alt second, if anyone gives me a hard time leveling (ganking, camping), I'll try discourage them on my Rogue or farm on my Rogue. Stealth gives you options, which is what I want lol
---
how does that compare in your view to instead having a priest? not being able to stay with the druid was one of the problem scenarios i envisioned, although from what i remember that never stopped hpals from following along w/ &amp; spamming freedom on the druid when i played vanilla
---
The fact you’d rather have servers crashing and being unplayable just shows how dumb this post is.
---
Dwarves were created by the titans who also birthed the Light which paladins use, so they are sort of closer connected I guess. Priests don't use the Light I'm fairly sure, it's different for each race, loa, elune etc.
---
From what i understand they implemented leeway back in vanilla to counteract  peoples bad latency/lag. It does seem kind of extreme now when people have good connection.
---
I played mage in vanilla and rerolled Warrior since. After Pandaland I didn't really have a main as I leveled all my favorite classes and geared them up. When I heard Classic is coming out the nostalgia kicked in and with no doubt I knew what I would be playing, and that is what I played back then. Mage :)
---
It’s unlikely. Plain and simple. There’s no use comparing it to something else.
---
No one wants to watch a streamer /roll 458 times on a guessed number. But they’ll make noise if he does it on the first time.
---
He got gifted subs, he got Reddit exposure, yeah... that’s worth a simple macro.
---
I don't believe in tipping rogues for lockboxes.   It's not worth it.  Might as well vendor the thing.
---
You litteraly used underwear versions of the characters. By that logic EVERY race is over sexualized. 
---
In reality they don't lewd the pandaren at all. Pretty much all are modest like Taoshi [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Taoshi](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Taoshi)
---
what im going off of is that hunters are best levelers and among the best at making gold, but rogues are just the better dps class, i dont want to be that person that only cares about DPS meters but it is a thing
---
It's still the usual $12.99 a month in the US at least. The longer sub tiers are always a cheaper monthly rate, that's not a temporary sale thing

There isn't really a comp that is 'good' with 2x druid. Priest/druid are support classes in BGs, and shamans are semi support.  The gameplan for all three classes is really to pick a warrior/warlock/hunter/rogue and follow them around and work around them.
---
I just always feel safer behind a dwarf tank.
---
In my experience and it might differ for classic, its super hard to keep herbing/mining high enough without finding more nodes before you go to a higher level zone so you level slower. Take skinning for easy gold, super easy to level and actually not bad gold while leveling.
---
Her model looks fine in BFA.
---
It's kind of the same I guess, but it's more of you're a dwarf you're in than if you're a human you're out.
---
If there are enough fear wards to go around humans are actually better healers.
---
Nelfs ... Shadow meld is fun I guess
---
tldr: I'd rather the game completely fail, than have layering!!!
---
Ironforge looks fucking impossible to take.
---
I'll come back and see who was right in 2 months :)
---
I actually remember that struggle
---
This art style on wow would be way too legitness.
---
yep!
---
Try and look at some footage of what your class will do at endgame. Yes leveling is a much larger part of the game than in subsequent expansions, but it's still the endgame you'll spend most time on and if you suddenly find out that your class is really boring in raids or PvP then it's really sad to have spent those hundreds of hours to get him there.
---
This is what sucks, everyone just says meme specs arent optimal compared to x spec. Its hard to find quality information if you want to play a meme spec optimally.. even a recent post on this sub about boomkin dps was screwing up a 1 button rotation and made sub optimal gear choices.. because the information regarding the spec isnt readily available. Meme specs need more theorycrafters to push their potential.
---
How so? BGs do not make ranking faster, if anything they make it slower.
---
It can be done on mobs on your level aswell (probably also a bit above your level if you have the mana), just made the video in a zone with many mobs. You do however need to be careful. Most private server guides does not take this into account and they kite too close or runs around the mobs while using arcane explosions. As long as you respect the added range you should be fine.
---
Why do all the games in that magazine look so fun compared to the games today?
---
/u/iamadreakwalker is there a high resolution version of this i can use as a desktop wallpaper?
---
min max for pve then,  since weapon skill doesntt work in pvp. Ill take stoneform over perception anyday
---
do talents that extend the length of a dot add more ticks at the same damage per tick or does it do the same total damage resulting in less damage per tick?
---
Another thing, guilds are usually quite careful with recruiting a big group of irl friends because if one leaves he can drag everyone else with him. 
---
I'd say just make your own guild and help your friends to raids.
---
You plan to raid as ele?

Shamans, tremor totem, earth shock, purge. Have fun.
---
Ha ha, will do brother
---
A week off work? Why? What is the point in racing there and burning yourself out like that
---
Which is why I refuse to open boxes for anyone but friends and guildmates. I loved the days when people would trade me a bunch of them without asking and then get pissed when I just went about my business, keeping them for myself.
---
Also, the contents of locked chests in an instance only belong to those that have the means to open it.
---
They can't release the pvp ranks and have no rewards for them, there would be no point in getting rank 14 if we can't buy the weapons. There is no way around it. And yes, it's going to be somewhat broken. Thats why so many were complaining when they first anounced phase 2.
---
want to roll a shaman again like i did in 2004 but I know how terrible they are so probably warrior or mage
---
I'm thinking of playing a hunter on classic. I've never played vanilla wow before so I'm unfamiliar with all the raids/dungeons. 
---
I've heard that hunters need to kite certain bosses or adds on a boss. Is there any comprehensive guide on all the bosses/adds that require hunter kiting and how to do such a thing? 
---
Thanks.
---
Iv been waiting for such a long time and i cant wait to play the shit out of the game the second it comes out. I can take my vacation days whenever i please and this will genuinely make me happy. Going to level my main professions cooking fishing etc. Iv leveled multiple toons to 60 on private servers and still wasnt burnt out. Some people enjoy different things and there is no right or wrong way to enjoy the free time off that you earned. Different strokes for different folks my dude :)
---
“Griefing” was very much rare while I leveled. Did a gank happen every now and again? Yes. Did it suck? Yes! Was it griefing? No. 
---
There was an addon back in the day that tracked who you killed and who killed you, and how many times. I don’t remember any characters name having more than a number 3 next to it. 
---
If being ganked is extremely bothersome to you, I understand and will not mock you. You have a life and just don’t find joy in a game where someone can kill you freely. I get it. But that’s a far cry from griefing. 
---
PvP happens in PvP servers. Sometimes it isn’t consensual. If that’s an issue for you, maybe a PvP server isn’t for you.
---
They aren’t very good healers
---
The other shitty thing is that it's a timed quest to southshore and I have a quest to do in between where I'd pick that up and go to southshore
---
I’m not so sure speed is a hugely important thing to me, tbh. I’m just gonna enjoy the experience. My schedule changes so much I won’t be able to hardcore raid or anything so I’m just casually gonna enjoy the game. I just don’t wanna get myself caught in a money hole of buying 1- 300 engineering mats is like 10k gold like it is on live
---
&gt; Also, the contents of locked chests in an instance only belong to those that have the means to open it.
---
If you are a douche, I guess.
---
&gt;Log off, try to fight, quest somewhere else
---
lol 2 of your 3 solutions involved not pvping and one involves not playing at all
---
Hunters pets make grinding mobs “easy”  so I guess you can make a lot of money farming, I just never had the Patience. (I think the white gorilla in stv was one of the best pets of I remember)
---
And both have relatively equal survivability if you take into account feign death and vanish.
---
 I personally think that rouges are just better due to the dps they can put out, but hunters  have a depth you dont get with a rouge so, up to you bud
---
More like this please , in same vertical aspect. Great phone backgrounds 
---
GG
---
That’s funny, unless you are stealthing to the locked chest in the instance it took a group to get there. Troll.
---
The play style is still much the same except you are a weaker version. Still want 1-2 in raids and fine to heal all dungeons.
---
Hold it! You cant let them know you have a main! Or else they will want you to hop onto it all the time when they want to run dungeons/ elete quests
---
I love my friends but after after this happens 20 times you kinda take the actual trials of vanilla away from them
---
Oh, I avoid the drama:
---
“Sorry, I don’t have the skill to unlock it. Need to get on that.”
---
Then wait until the instance is over and backtrack.
---
I’m torn between a warrior and rogue. I’m trying to determine which to main at endgame.
---
Original wow had no layering and did quitw the opposite of fail. 
---
Until... they added layering/phasing/sharding and now it is failing... 
---
Sounds more like the activision fan boys just came to the defence.
---
L
---
Meh maybe one or two decently close frienss the rest just acquaintances
---
99% of the time it's not even worth going back to steal it....  Just wasting your time to be a dick.
---
There was an addon back in vanilla that would put your effective heal amount on-top of the spell icon in your taskbar, I dont remember what it was called though.  I dont remember if it had HPS or HPM options though.
---
Beta is over, no? No one plays it
---
Exactly you burn the bubble early. Which causes you to win.
---
Engineering + gnome + warrior is the best. Expensive to level though.
---
How many fucking times do you need explained to you that there is no macro that does this?  Are you actually brain damaged?
---
Ok then so drop tailoring till 60, keep all the cloth but. Level as mining and skinning. Best of both worlds. Dump all the cloth and mining stuff on level 1 alts till you need it.
---
Yeah, because of blood craze you want to get crit, heals you and gives you enrage. Makes you kill faster, otherwise you would be wasting talents the whole time.
---
If you are good at tanking you can tank 5 mans at 60 as arms/fury you don't need to be prot to tank dungeons.
---
Right their with you
---
Why? Layering is effectively separate servers.
---
since my focus in PvP, i don't plan on respeccing full resto to heal raids, no.
---
Just heal in pve/dps in pve. Shadow feels so good in classic. Also healing in pve is a lot more fun then u think.
---
Genius.
---
Played alot of both ark and conan an i must say both are really good but conan was far too easy when compared with ark. Could literally speed lvl from discovering the entire map an nothing could even kill me cause i just outran it. On ark if u agro anything early game your straight up fucking dead...
---
gotchya thanks!
---
Just pick whatever class you think is coolest, don’t worry about roles/meta.
---
Yeah why it's such a hard decision for me, i think both rogue and hunter are really cool classes imo, while one might out perform the other in pure DPS situations i cant help to think i would also enjoy the other just as much or not more.. i just dont know
---
Thank. God.
---
Maybe not "simple" but...how useful are infernals/doomguards to warlocks? I hear alot of conflicting info on this.
---
Why would they bubble a sheep? Not like your going to 1 hit them. Most keep bubble to allow them to fully heal. What causes you to win is they have zero gap closer just keep them in combat during freedom.
---
No they aren't. You can be on separate layers than your guildmates, your friends, your future guildmates, your future friends. All the Layers share an Auction House, raid lockouts, etc.
---
So Blizzard wouldn't just be able to split the Layers into separate servers without consent. And that's just opening up new severs and allowing free transfers.
---
The only thing that changed was from alliance to horde. So i went from going Nelf warrior to Orc warrior. When i truly wanted to play Orc anyways so it is honestly a win win anyways.
---
&gt;This is worse than waiting in log queue for a week.
---
I'd just like to formally laugh at this before the thread gets locked. What a meme.
---
Be a druid, you can do everything! :D
---
That's the kind of post that I'm looking for. Had a lot of those in the works, but you got this to another level, thank you. Great work man, gonna keep those close for the launch!
---
Tiniest addition: "/cast [@cursor] !Eagle eye" for scouting.
---
Yea, wow... that instant transmission by the enemies was strange tho. Never experienced that.
---
"I'm on my way from Southshore to the Scarlet Monastery and if i get too close to this tower i'm going to die."
---
Wonder if they’ll adjust it. This gives warriors vs mages a bit of hope.
---
Not really, was on the fence between Mage, Priest and Lock, ultimately have decided on a Lock
---
Either pally or priest.
---
I’m leaning priest because shadow spec has a special place in my heart. The dilemma is, undead spriest or dwarf spriest.
---
As for pally, I don’t know. Female human or male dwarf?
---
I’ll figure it out as soon as I log in August 27th.
---
Do you think the other healers will be cool with you healing with a dps spec?
---
Lol, yea no. I’ll go in a more boring zone, tyvm.
---
hows healing setup usually for example alliance? how many healers focus tank and just tank? does ot have different healers? rest raid? Is it fun to heal to usually?
---
That’s easy to fix.
---
That's gonna be a hard sell.
---
Nope! I will be playing a paladin. I started in TBC and been playing a paladin every expansion since then. I want to experience exactly what it was like to be a paladin in Vanilla and classic is as close as I am going to get to that chance.
---
True but they adjusted XP rates. There are always new exploits tho being found in Conan. I definitely agree that is ark by far the more complete game but I could just never get into it for some reason. It’s not the difficulty that threw me off cuz I love challenging games, I wish I could pinpoint it.
---
Why? just go Prot and grind the fuck out of dungeons.
---
Sheep the paladin and open up on his other player. People keep talking about a 2v1 situation or in PVP just lock the pally down and make him waste bubble while you blow up his heal target.
---
I’ll be honest, I only ever summoned my infernal to clear out the AH. :-/
---
Very good at that function. I’d give it a 10 out of 10 charred remains.
---
Not easier than just letting the servers shake out and opening up new realms if needed.
---
Yeah it sounds crazy haha. I actually wanted to say "waiting in log queues for the first week", not literally waiting a WHOLE week in a queue.
---
Groups of five 30s with BiS gear and, if I recall correctly, stacking hunters because they are far, far better than any other class at doing damage to much higher level mobs.
---
No random group of 30s in levelling greens is going to beat SM Cath, and I very much doubt they can beat 5+ level 38 mobs either.
---
It's barely worth your time to go back to steal it.   You are just wasting your time to be a dick.
---
At this point I have three - I just need to decide who to main, and which alt to focus on first. It will probably come down to synergy with regards to professions.
---
&gt; The Alliance 
---
The Alliance was yet to be formed, ya green doofus, that happened 5+ years after the fall of Stormwind.
---
Lol I think most ppl are doing this. I know I am. Mage for nostalgia, warrior cause I loved tanking in TBC, or Druid because that's been my main since WotLK or warlock cause Staysafe makes it look fun.
---
Duo druid FC team in WSG is REALLY hard to shut down.
---
I think it is post classic. 
---
I know it is void powered during legion. Idk if that was the case pre legion.
---
Some quick google led me to this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/8g6k9s/kiting_bossfights/
---
http://www.orcisharmyknife.com/2010/03/hunter-basics-kiting-part-2.html
---
It's not a really big part of 5man/raid content.  It's really just snaring the target and then running away with aspect of cheetah.
---
Took a pit stop when biking and was surprised to see this. Leslie Street Spit in Toronto.
---
Omg i forgot about the custom comments ! I think there was a feature like this on cartographer. Not only it was useful but also funny af
---
Make a twink
---
Same damage per tick.  Technically over X unit of time it does the same amount of damage, but it's more mana efficient.
---
oh yeah, nice addition. And thanks, I really appreciate it man! I've been looking all over for this kind of stuff too
---
Already planning on it gonna have a 19 twink priest and a 29 rogue as well
---
They're really fucking cool flavor spells but for the most part you'll pretty much never use them.
---
It's usually worth 2-3 gold at least, with a chance at much more. As long as it takes less than 3 minutes to get to the chest, it's worth it.
---
Is it safe, if you have mature content switched to OFF, I hate rule 34
---
Was implemented after all classes had deadzone removed. The first deadzone removed was Hunter in 2.3
---
So it's not a Vanilla mechanic, no.
---
Except their are plenty of other roller coasters in the theme park, and they also have a 1-2 hour wait time.   It's not a 4 hour wait time like the new one, but it's more than popular.
---
We're talking about it because it's special...because it IS a one-of.
---
&gt;Medivh never turns into a demon either
---
I think Sargeras himself started possessing Medivh right before Khadgar finishes him off.
---
I came around to Tirisfal Glades when I took the time to read the quest text. They did an amazing job setting the scene and ambiance through the characters that you meet talking about life before and after the invasion.
---
Teldrassil on the other hand... It's still the worst in my opinion, but I can see its character.
---
Lok'tar Ogar!
---
So it’s overall less DPS? But more damage per mana?
---
Humans of Stormwind / The Alliance / whatever. The movie still made it look like they somewhat won. And in the movie, the Alliance was "formed" in Stormwind right after Blackhand's death, who died after King Llane in the movie, which is totally wrong.
---
My only problem with the undead zones is that pre cata silver pine Forest was under developed.
---
It really only makes a difference in the most min-max scenario. You'll do a trivial amount more in dps vs having an extra "oh shit" button that clears DoTs and bumps armor.
---
Gnome is the proper min/max choice but it's not a gamebreaking decision if you decide to go human. I'd probably go human as a caster over gnome just because I want to actually see my gear. Yes engineering was the best for pvp. Not really much else did anything in pvp. I guess if you had alchemy or herbalism you could get pots for pvp easier.
---
To be an offtank you need both sets of gear. Usually MT and OT are designated for a bit more hardcore ppl since they kind of get priority on gear and are necessary every raid. 
---
As to tanking 60 dungeons. For the most part Protection tree doesntt have any major must haves damage mitigation or agro talents so you can be fine in Arms/Furry with the correct gear of course. 
---
My suggestion if you are planing to play casually pick a DPS class or a healer class (with the intent to heal) and focus on maxing it out. Keep in mind Warrior can also be a DPS class if you are not trying to be the main offtank.
---
Right, because it's normally only 2-3 minutes away from the final boss, and with no mobs protecting it.
---
I'm sticking to my guns.  I really considered Orc for those sweet, sweet racials.  I just love Tauren Warrior too much.  Edgemasters it is I guess...
---
???
---
Had a guild that rotated LC from a pool of officers and class leads rolling at the start of the raid. Probably one of the fairest LC implementations I’ve seen.
---
I get it. I'm new to the game but refuse to boost. As tempting as the new content is. I want to feel like I earned my rank and level and gear.
---
Left retail?
---
PVE or PVP server?
---
Are you planning to mostly PVE or PVP? 
---
Both of the above make a HUGE difference in how enjoyable you play is going to be with either class.
---
Oh I get to see a linking idiot in the wild.
---
"I wIn InTeRnEt arGuMenTs wItH Gud LinKs"
---
You sure owned him with your "facts" and "logic".
---
Maybe ppl want to play a certain role and don't know class/race to pick to enjoy PVP or PVE?
---
Just needs a gif of a group of horde jumping off onto the roof and then off to UC.
---
I don't like this argument, because it can be flipped to justify them being broken.   Which I think is a terrible justification.
---
10/10!
---
Alliance start to learn about the plague in howling fjord,
---
That’s cool af, especially if your for the horde!
---
I didnt know I needed this until now.
---
Its my guild, the Hell do I care. and going full doesn't doesn't help nearly as much as buffs/consumes will.
---
i left because i dont recognise my class every expansion lul
---
It will work if your willing to farm. A popular approach I hear is to go double resource gathering, like mining and skinning and then drop skinning at 60. You will have more money through your leveling experience. I’m thinking that’s what I’m going to do, although during classic I leveled mining/engineering and it was fun to mess around with the gadgets you made. I never got past 40 though because I was too addicted to Ultima Online.
---
&gt;Shamans are considerably cooler than Paladins.
---
You know, cooler, that subjective thing you use when you can't prove its objective superiority.
---
Cmon you know you would enjoy making a Shammy tank.
---
Womannn be shoppinnn
---
I've generally like tanking in MMOs. I like being out front and leading. I like taking hits and dictating placement. So naturally in WoW, I've almost always played a Warrior. But recently in a nameless pserver I rolled a Druid alt (with the intention of messing around as a bear) and ended up healing and man -- what a change.
---
- no worrying about pacing
---
- no scrambling for aggro on multiple mobs
---
- no rage starvation 
---
- no stance dancing
---
- no worrying about pats 
---
- able to ignore many mechanics
---
- significantly lower stress levels
---
Got to 60, but I only did dungeons, so I cant speak for raiding but healing dungeons was super chill. If the tank was good, I barely needed to heal sometimes. I'd just jump up and down, melee sometimes, and generally just try and weave in DPS when I could. 
---
As much as I want to play a Warrior again, I think I am gonna go Dwarf Priest this time and relax a little.
---
No, in the true lore, Khadgar, Garona, and Lothar find the inverse of Karazhan, trigger a trap unleashing a bunch of demons, then confront Medivh at the "bottom" of Karazhan. That's when Medivh/Sargeras admits his true nature and plans. Garona gets trapped, Khadgar stabs Medivh with a sword, and when they realize Sargeras is trying to come out, Lothar decapitates Medivh.
---
In the movie, Lothar fights a clay golem infused with fel while Medivh is in some sort of spell trance and then turns into a full demon, eventually getting crushed by the golem.
---
Horde or Alliance ??
---
PVP or PVE Server?
---
Thank you I am going hunter for classic, screenshotted all these macros for the use thank you again :)
---
Honestly you might have a hard time getting a group because tanks are usually warriors and warrior tanks might not want anyone else in the group rolling on weapons and strength gear. But warriors are strong dps and they can offtank which is valuable in 5 man's because mobs often go wild.
---
Can I buy the tirisfal print anywhere?! WTB

I really think they would have been far better doing a HBO series with Dreamworks or Pixar.   They never should've done a live action film, a film is never long enough to establish the character and story of something like Warcraft and the live-action just detracts from what makes Warcraft and WoW so darn good, exaggerated cartoon artistic design and the longevity that comes with it.
---
Live action with CGI doesn't age well compared to Cartoon.  The 1960's Jungle Book with the recent CGI remake is a perfect example imho.  WoW should be 3d animation or cartoon, never live-action.
---
Did he even answer the question?  Looked like he just rambled on about grinding spots.    Also, don't you kind of need the rep?
---
That was when they first learned the plague was completed.
---
It was really obvious undead were trying to make a plague since Vanilla.
---
I don't need to sell myself to get into a raid, so no problem there.
---
Planning on raiding but also would like to pvp
---
Lots of stuff is broken in vanilla.  No one is going to be playing it because of its balance lol.
---
You get the group to kill the mobs, obviously. And yeah, it's not that far.
---
Undead mage - very immersive since irl I'm a Wizzard and feel dead
---
This is good stuff. I'd add a \[@mouseover\] condition to basically everything here, but anyone who's been following my macro posts already knows I've got a fetish for them.
---
Tanking 5 mans is harder than raids IMO.
---
They don’t want to open up any more servers, they know from ten years of development that opening more servers is a bad idea if they can help it.
---
I am only playing, because I am hoping TBC comes out next.  TBC &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Vanilla.
---
Shadow excels in 1v1 once shadowform becomes available. Before that, disc is considered very strong (a disc priest won 4th place on the 1v1 level 30 Beta tournament, eventually losing to a warlock after a long fight).  Disc really excels at survivability at those levels. Shadow is formidable as well since they have imp fear, silence, and mind flay. Check out Kala’s videos if you want to go shadow. 
---
In group pvp, disc/holy will still be more valued than shadow because of the utility and dedicated healing they bring to the table. BGs typically don’t have many healers so you’d make a difference if you’re coming in as a support role.
---
So your solution to that is to split servers without player consent? How is that any different? It's actually much worse.
---
I'm for them in some capacity. I think the generic ones for killing bosses or exploring zones should stay out, but stuff like Salty, Loremaster, The Insane, Bloodsail Admiral, I think those are all pretty cool. Some of the PvP ones are fun too. Ironman, Wrecking Ball, the BG specific ones. I'd also like to retain the ones for the world events.
---
I get some people saying "your character is your achievement", but honestly, a pre-implemented set of targets with fun things to do doesn't hurt anything.
---
I was able to get one on my old 39 twink but that was only by doing the additional cloth turn ins. Also had xp off so I didnt go over.
---
Start by running to the starter zone or getting to 10 then go over and start doing all the quests for rep. Should be able to get there before 60 so save a little gold and get it when you get exulted. 
---
Good luck!
---
See? It's the alliance who are aggressive. That's what I meant ; )
---
We often had our offtank in zerker stance ready to berserker rage and then go def and taunt so the MT doesn't have to take chance of taking heavy damage by stance dancing.
---
Looking to be a Blacksmith in Classic. Is there a "best" specialization or is it all preference in what you want to make?
---
You could check out these videos or do a search for weapon skill in classic, but in short hitting 310 weapon skill (which you will do with talents and racial) results in a very significant increase in damage due to an equivalent gain of 3% and more hit and an increase in your glancing blow damage (which is a large part of your dmg output). That frees up a lot of room for more other stat gear choices and flexibility.

---
when the choice is more desirable people are willing to wait longer to get it.  the more people a single realm can hold, the more desirable it is to play on that realm and the longer people are willing to wait to get in.
---
otherwise there wouldn't be high, medium, and low, there would be 3 medium.  but people have preference, and most people want to play where everybody else is playing.
---
&gt; What do Alliance players even yell in chat? 
---
Their next strategical move, over party chat preferably. What tactical advantage does yelling even bring to the battlefield?  
---
Also all my horde characters have been undead, I'd rather yell *'Power to the Forsaken!'* since to them the Horde is merely a tool.
---
&gt;  except to the Horde. 
---
I hope it's to the NPCs because a huge chunk of the horde post-vanilla have always been blood elves that just rolled horde because of memes and insecurity ('oh jeez I hope they notice I'm with the cool kids'). Hell even lore-wise the forsaken "hold no real loyalty to the horde".
---
I played prot pally for the majority of wow retail and raided top 50 US In legion. I know a thing or two about tanking but no as much in vanilla
---
My issue is tailoring is 100% gonna be one of my two because I love it. Probably gonna end up tailoring mining or tailoring enchanting and just dropping enchanting at 60 then using my essence money to buy engineering mats
---
Same dps for the dot, but the spell doesn't have to be cast as often, so it's overall a dps increase since you can refresh less often and fill the extra globals with another spell.
---
Alliance pvp
---
Thanks for the answer and clarification!
---
For the ORC
---
To be fair, it's not very hard to make a macro that does this. I'm not saying it is one, but don't pretend like that's impossible.
---
nah, warriors, paladins whatever. They did use fishing rods to help avoid misses though, which was clever.  
---
I am almost certain you're wrong but guess we'll find out in 8 weeks!
---
Only the strong will survive.
---
For purely PVP Druid and Shamy dont have that much synergy. The Windfury totem, both have poison removal but no magic removal (huge in Vanilla). Druid has mobility and stealth, shamy has no mobility at all. No CC except the roots (weakest CC in the game since only "works" on melee classes.) 
---
Shamy Priest there is some overlap in offensive dispels but you are getting into better synergy if shamy goes ele resto and priest goes shadow, still can pop out and heal but insanely dangerous if left unchecked. Curse is only debuff that you cannot remove but only warlocks have it and is not that big of a deal.
---
Really need to find out what do you want out of the game so we can try helping you with the class .... how set is your friend on the shammy?
---
No matter what happened with my main I knew I could come back to playing a rogue and it was always gonna be the same at its core as it was before. Then Legion turned them into pirates...
---
I always just downloaded it elsewhere for free.
---
Dwarf all the way
---
Totally, I'm torn between Mage, Shaman, Warrior and Rogue.
---
I'm not sure about Rogue, it's usually not my style but I love melee DPS and they are strong.
---
Warrior because I played a lot of Warrior in retail but I'm not sure if I'm going to like the leveling.
---
Mage because of all the utility and the fun spells.
---
Shaman because they are cool as fuck, I'm leaning towards it but it isn't strong as DPS at max LvL. Also I keep going back and forth between Orc and Troll with Shamans. I like them both visually but for different reasons and I know Orc is stronger for PvP and Trolls are stronger for PvE but I'm not sure what I want to do.
---
Also I want to roll a Druid just to try it out. I don't care much for the rest of the classes.
---
Human warlock is incredibly disadvantaged in PVP.
---
Be aware, WOTF is incredibly prevalent and with the addition to shamans grounding/sheer/purge lock is countered unbelievably hard.
---
Don’t listen to people who say “ it’s a 2 minute cd”
---
In a BG it will feel like everyone always has the Cd up and shamans counter warlocks so incredibly hard.
---
Horde warlocks are S tier, because paladins get destroyed by geared locks.
---
I was r12 in vanilla and nearly hit rank 13 on a reputable Pserver.
---
I urge you to realize how gimped alliance locks are.
---
they can just close the door i feel like lol
---
They are not good because they are good in 1v1 , but not 1vx where it matters in wpvp due to the fact that they are reactive class with no hard cc like poly. Unless you can sneak behind a tree and get 2 casts off before they know what is going on then u can kill 1v3 for sure but if they see u coming gl u will lose.
---
Although Nelfs have a beautiful starting area, the male Nelfs have the most unco attack animations. Breaks the immersion for me :(
---
Lol no, unless they pay a guild an inordinate amount of cash to do it for them.
---
You have to grind literal thousands of drops from elite mobs in Silithis (no, it cannot be soloed), and perform a bunch of involved raid quests. The bug part grind is the main bottleneck, it’s such a massive grind that it takes an entire guild to do it for one person, and that is probably not going to be some casual minor raider who gets that attention.
---
"Hey Bleu can you cast mana tide for your group"  
---
"Sorry I'm 30/0/21, no mana tide here"  
---
"...."
---
I'm going to level up a ret paladin just like I did all those years ago when I didn't know it wasn't very viable.
---
Classic is going to be a nostalgia trip for me and I can't wait to auto-attack my way to 60 :)
---
um if i have a succubus out, she'll be invisible, and will seduce you the moment you gank me, between seducing and fearing,  i don't need to run, you will die. But while you are stunlocked it would be very easy to escape if i so choose.  If i have a vw out sacrifice and get a shield, plus can instant summon a new one and sacrifice again for another shield or bring in a succy or felhunter depending on whether i'm facing melee or caster. I also may or may not have soul link.  Trust me we 'locks have many ways to survive a gank, running is not what we do, we devour.  But for those that choose to, there are ways for that too. Why would you though?
---
My friends and I have decided we aren't going to rush levelling and that we will help each other with class quests. Hence I think I will get the whirlwind axe just for the fun of it.
---
Want to play RestoShaman.. but friends want to play Alliance.
---
Decide to play HolyPaladin.. but worried solo farming/leveling might be hard.
---
Then thought RestoDruid might be good with stealth and all.. but then realize its Classic and Druids are probably the worse of the healers outside of PvP.  
---
Finally decide on Priest.. but really do not want to play priest.
---
%$#&amp;W$%#(#$^#%$
---
He sent me a high res couple time after I posted this one, I can send you when I'm home
---
23 talents in the tree have absolutely no impact beyond melee range. it was clearly designed around the idea of a hybrid meele hunter, it just failed spectacularly in that regard. 
---
I certainly never saw any survival hunters that actually played like a normal hunter, why go into such a melee heavy tree to play ranged when marks exists?
---
It is dead because there is a lack of content now.  If they up the level cap, more people will play.
---
Can you open a ticket if a player is trolling?
---
Work Work
---
I know some of your statements are not 100% serious, but...
---
1. That's the flat out truth.
---
2. Stockades over RFC any day. RFC is so early you end up switching 90% of the gear you dropped there the next day, whereas Stockades is more relevant since it's around level 20. That plus the fact that it has a simple layout, not really hard to get lost like say, wailing caverns, and it has lots of melee mobs. I saw mages aoeing that shit down for ph4t l00t and XP (with a decent group ofc).
---
3. Gonna burst your bubble on this one. Paladins are the ultimate healers of pvp. Divine shield is OP. You can (and should) put yourself in a really 'bad' situation, healing aggressively, and unless people throw all their cc and shit on you, you're  gonna last. And heal. And your ~~clothie liquifier~~  warrior will make the other team say "Das Leben ist kein Ponyhof ". If you're a shammy (and by no means I'm saying that they are bad, tremor totem, earth shock, purges, you name it, they rip casters apart) and you're put on a situation where you have to face a zergy skirmish, well. GL with that.
---
4. True. But escape artist's 1.5 cast time is like cc'ing yourself for that time. Having to stop moving to remove a debuff that is not letting you move? Hmm... And aside from that, lots of slows in the game are too easy to reapply anyways, first coming to my mind being crippling poison.
---
5. YES! Plus DRUMS on Org soundtrack, makes me want to stomp those hideous gnomes. 
---
6. Lol, didn't know Eminem was called Marshall.
---
7. Gnomes are shit.
---
  
---
###
---
&gt; If you’re Alliance you can skip it and get Thermaplugg's Left Arm
---
Fixed that for ya. Bonebiter is a late-30s weapon, since it comes from the SM quest which requires you to clear Cathedral.
---
Thermaplugg's on the other hand, you can get at level 30-32 in gnomer.
---
I have been pretty set on playing hunter for a while now, but paladin is looking more tempting every day (that's what I played on release). 
---
One of the biggest upsides of hunter, for me anyways, was the gold farming. What kind of options do paladins have at max for gold making? I always enjoyed playing the AH on retail, so I can resort to that if needed, but is there anyways decent for paladins in terms of farming?
---
That's the downside! However, I've seen quite a few posts and guides saying that mana tide isn't necessary in non-hardcore environments--especially ones that will leave you in a melee group--and above all that it isn't necessary in T1/T2. I, however, wanted to verify this =)
---
nah I wanted to be this 
---
https://cdn-wow.mmoui.com/preview/pvw7041.jpg
---
But it was all downhill once they gave us mail just to fix loot tablets and avoid fixing the class properly. Ahh now all the disappointment is coming back to me
---
The artist is incredible. Although, I did laugh at the Jaina with the almost crotch tattoo. Not something I ever thought I’d see
---
Path of Exile and TfT. 
---
PoE is perfect because it’s a great league, it’s super grindy/rewarding and after the league is over I’m done with the character... or until I die since I’m on HC.
---
The helm from Armory is actually BIS until level 60. No other helm has crit on it other than Fury Visor which you should never get under any circumstances because Diamond Flask is infinitely better.
---
ya, no.
---

Like, I don't know what your seeing but, hourglass body, long big feminine eyes, giant breast, these three things alone amplify everything else of the whole awful. The models literally look like the concept art
---
I mean, they both play a human warrior and they're both balding. Dadmongold is that you?
---
I'm brand new to macros but really want to get into it for Druid as I heard they can help a lot. I have no idea where to begin with this stuff, can anyone point me in the right direction for good Druid macros for classic?
---
That is a weird only reason for playing, considering you could just start in TBC and the quest gear is going to replace Naxx gear, rendering vanilla pointless anyways.  Or better yet, just play TBC private servers.
---
I agree... Cause i know as soon as im gonna see mobs and friends dissapear out of blue air the immersion into the game is gone for me. And spending time jumping layers just feel like searching a hollow world.   
---
I am with you on all of your points. even if i wont be able to log in the first week i'd rather log in after and actually know that im on the same server as my friends.
---
&gt; Humans of Stormwind / The Alliance / whatever.
---
That's actually kind of relevant when refering to humans pre-fall of Lordaeron. Imagine thinking Alterac was loyal to said alliance.
---
Anyways, yeah I never said the movie didn't butcher the whole story.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6mt68/followup_to_10_button_or_less_a_casestudy_with_my/ I don't play druid, but this looks promising.

Does anyone care?
---
Baron/Cstrike discord can probably help you out too.
---
i don't believe there was any mention of Void in classic, or at least not in relation to shadow priests. they were simply stated to be using Shadow or Dark magic, which was the opposite side of Light. it was definitely pretty vague compared to what we have now, not sure if that is a good thing or not, but the description of shadow priests in classic fits fine for undead and of course they even have their own group for it (cult of the forgotten shadow)
---
It’s gonna be so forced this time around that it’s gonna be cringe as fuck. Get ready for MAGA spam constantly.
---
You obviously don't understand the math involved. If everyone is getting honor at a slower rate, then everyone climbs rank at the same rate, because it's a scaling pyramid.
---
No they don’t. If your feeling attracted to them and like they are sexualized that’s on you, I don’t see anything sexual or sexualized about that panda.
---
MIGHTY. MAN.
---
20% drop rate? Hope you like Gnomeregan.
---
I don't want to play unauthentic pirated servers
---
I am not saying that they aren't going to have grand marshal weapons.
---
I am saying that they released TWO DIFFERENT groupings of grand marshal weapons. Some of the second batch which had been considered to be *stronger* than the first patch -- such as the faster off-hands.
---
You do realize that most blues in dungeons have drop rates around 20-30%, yes?
---
It's no different than any other boss with 4 items on its loot table.
---
you are dumb
---
Sitting in queue for an overpopulated realm is not desirable to me, or anyone I know.
---
Thank you! I’ve really enjoyed the tank role in the past, so I’m thinking I’ll enjoy warrior even if all I end up doing is 5 mans. That’s perfect if I can do those without respeccing back and forth since I’m unlikely to raid outside of a random MC when I have more free time on a weekend.
---
As Alliance on PVP server Warlocks are at he biggest disadvantage over any other.  30-35% of your enemies are undead and have a fear/charm break and a 5 sec immunity plus the trinket and any class abilities. The only benefit it makes it very challenging to level and do other daily activities you will have little competition getting into raids, but your damage will be low and gear competition will be tough from mages and a shadow priest.
---
As a Rogue on alliance Dwarf is arguably got best race since you can remove poisons and bleeds ..... so can restealth while fighting a warrior and can break blind. Human rogues do have higher DPS in raids but it only matters in high end guilds. 
---
So if you want challenge, and I mean real challenge, roll Gnome Warlock (human are just sooooo much worse.
---
If you want to surprise warriors with ZOMG restealth while rended and break blind to blind the other Rogue while he is waiting for energy regen I would roll dwarf rogue.
---
Still playing a Horde Warlock the decision is more of Orc or Undead.  I've played Undead primarily but Orc for vanilla looks enticing for PvP.
---
See, this is totally different than what the other people are saying in this same thread. And they're saying the same thing you're saying.
---
I want to know what post YOU'RE talking about, since almost nobody is linking actual threads, and you and several others seem to have differing opinions on this topic and THAT is the point of this entire thread.
---
I've been looking into pally too, and this was one of my concerns. From what I've been able to find, with enough points into prot you can [aoe farm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-roQzMyTTNw) quite effectively.
---
You do realize some items have more of a chance to drop than others, yes? 
---
So it’s very different. FTFY.
---
shadow wasn't explicitly associated with the void in classic.
---
Bold to assume everyone left / hate retail
---
just choose Mage. and get engineering so you can teleport anywhere in the world for easy access to cities and zones
---
Tremor relies on skill and cannot be used while feared so the Mortal Coil into fear or charm is a thing. plus it ticks so you can actually fear and kill the totem with the pet at the same time.....
---
In the same boat. With less free time for wow, play what you like, IMO, and enjoy it more.
---
If you do end up with warrior, make some pally friends to level with. They’ll probably be grateful to have someone along that can kill at a decent pace.
---
you gonna gate keep tools now ya tool....
---
its not like you were born with the knowledge of them
---
I'm proud that I earned a dictionary website and click and got you to learn a new word. Enjoy
---
I knew the word, I just wanted to provide the definition because you clearly didn't.
---
Teaching two labs, finishing up my thesis, and taking classes of my own! Time to work on my time management skills
---
I'd rather fight paladins than shamans as a mage in any xpac
---
Hopefully the bullshit macro that has pets automatically kill the totem doesn't work.
---
Why are you trolling? Should I report you?
---
my issue is i dont want to have to farm more than 2 sets of gear.  but yeh druid is chill otherwise
---
red is my favorite color too.
---
It is impossible.  There is a macro that does this and when you use it you get disconnected instantly because it’s not allowed.  So yes, it is impossible to do what he is suggesting he did on blizzard servers
---
 red is my favorite color too.
---
What’s your point? My point is that you can sit there and cry, or you can be productive.
---
What should I put the points into then?
---
How is this a troll?  Knowing what class performs the best in TBC can help determine which class to main in tbc.
---
I can't decide so i'm rolling both depending on the class.
---
Yeah I am a bit on the fence for this one. NOCHANGE and all. It does trivialize totem killing for some classes.
---
That's not beta. That's a pre download that everyone has already.
---
Don't forget that token supply is limited, and by having multiple accounts you wish to pay for in gold - you increase demand and cost of said token.
---
Also "gathering gold" relies on economy of your server. Also this whole idea of multiboxing to farm to pay for multiboxing is a bit idiotic, considering amount of time you'll have to spend just to farm that crap.
---
I'll also note that I haven't tried logging in yet, but will update this comment after the download has finished!
---
oh... well nevermind then, thanks
---
I found this: https://www.redbubble.com/shop/vanilla+wow+t-shirts
---
Sad face
---
Paladin can tank. Especially 5 mans, they aren’t just as strong as warrior, but they can do 5 mans. So can druids
---
&gt;because you clearly didn't.
---
Most people don't define simple English words as they type comments...
---
You don't even know how, if, when TBC is coming out. The most likely outcome it will be a separate server with either new characters or transfer of existing ones. Vanilla will only either stay vanilla or go 1.13+
---
We had no clue back in Vanilla that this was the case.  Both spells did shadow damage and that was all we knew lore wise.
---
Now Sally is someone I can rally behind FUR DA HERD
---
I'm sad cause I couldn't find any either
---
Tell that to the folks who got Bindings before people knew what Thunderfury was.
---
Best Buy owned Future Shop (The Canadian Version) and when I worked for them years ago they would have flyers with not only PC's but HDTVs with Blizzard games on the screen. (SC2 and WoW Expansions)
---
I believed they had some sort of a partnership.
---
Hunter is easier straight out the gate. With rogues it helps to have a main that can send gear.
---
Trash dps, can’t tank, but great, efficient healers with awesome utility.
---
For the Horde&lt;3
---
I just jumped back onto retail... Can it be turned off?
---
Mostly herbalism and disenchanting if I remember correctly. Lots of running around Azshara looking for Dreamfoil for flasks and selling the extra. There was no guild bank back then and everyone was expected to bring their own flasks. I played alot at the time, and likely wouldn't be able to keep that up again if I was going to roll another shaman.
---
I'm glad I still have my "Molten Core" shirt in the style of the Motley Crue logo.
---
They may have mistaken it for a new WoW Expansion.
---
&gt;it's 2 tanks per 40-man raid.
---
Naxxarams: Oh you sweet summer child.
---
I prefer the musical.
---
I was going to add a exception for that. But that's the last phase of WoW, like 2 years down the line. Shouldn't have to think 2 years ahead.
---
Well I suppose that's just a different way of playing. I know I wouldn't want any progression to be any harder because of fun specs. In my eyes, everyone should be optimal until the content is confirmed on farm mode. I totally get what you're saying about the theory crafting and it's absolutely true...that just means the time to get content on farm status will be far shorter than it was.
---
You should have enough gold by 40 to get your mount if you're being mindful about making gold. I skipped over that and addressed the real grind for 60 mount
---
What rogue in their right mind is fighting a Prot Warrior to begin with.
---
They lose that fight 9/10 times.
---
Ah I get ya
---
If you're VW sacrificing, I would think it would be better to just use hellfire rather than rain of fire.
---
So you've listed all the pros, whats the negatives? 
---
**You are stronger in wpvp than you should be** \- Blizzard has made classic like BfA, blowing 1 guy up isn't possible, its more for PvE reasons.  
---
**you are farming more gold than people who just pay a sub** \- Solo hunters seem to be the most profitable and thats all solo, instanced, uncontested gold that the game generates.
---
 **you are clearing content solo that you shouldnt be able too**: Like hunters who can solo DM:N? oh true  
---
**you are skipping the whole rolling for loot mechanic because everything that drops is for you :** Losing a roll to a retard who doesn't deserve the item in the first place, hard pass! 
---
**you ruin other peoples immersion when they see you out in the world with your little bots following you** : If you aren't on an RP realm, who gives a fuck about immersion 
---
  **you are skipping game mechanics completely like the social aspect of the game** : Boxing allows easy gearing to help my friends who cannot play as much, in any roll that they might need me and allows me to have multiple alts and play less, less time playing gives me more social time IRL which is much more important. 
---
You can argue until you are blue in face about it being cheating or not but since there are 0 bans handed out to boxers who don't bot, we know what it really is. Just like in real life, people with more money have better opportunities, thats life.
---
Ah that's right. This is what I was thinking about
---
I was just a friendly human adventurer, exploring the beautiful landscapes of Redridge Mountains, helping villagers in need.  Then suddenly my vision went black, but I could hear the sound of a terrifyingly quick monster behind me.  
---
How was this possible? I was very perceptive and ensured no monsters where nearby.  Then I heard it. The sound of nightmares. An unholy gurgling of rocks grinding bones.  It was laughter, but filled with malice and evil intent.
---
My vision returned.  I stared into a pair of yellow orbs, radiating with the misery inflicted on other poor souls. The creature, though humanoid in stature, went without flesh. Clutched in each hand was a slender dagger, covered in a sickly green oil. 
---
My stomach churned with revulsion but it mattered not. The lightning quick abomination ran me through with his silver. The pain was brief, fortunately, but I awoke in a strange spirit realm. My surroundings were familiar and I was able to return to my body.
---
All was well and I readied myself for more adventuring but, alas, my misery had just began. I began to make for the nearest murloc pool and, once again, my vision went black, followed by that wretched noise.  This happened for every instance in which I returned from the spirit realm.
---
It was here, in this moment, my hatred was born.  A hatred that burned so hot it changed me in my core.  Azeroth was infested by a vile disease known, collectively, as The Horde.  Thousands will die by my sword but the bloodlust will NEVER be satiated!
---
Also, this is all in good fun.  Hope you have a good time in classic, even if it is as a dirty horde player ;)
---
Wow, they advertise PC’s by using pictures of games!!!
---
I just watched it, found it on Hulu live, if you have that.  I quite enjoyed it.
---
As someone who's just trying to remember all the  Warrior macros from Vanilla how would a noob at macros get into some of these graphical enchanments. I just got a nice gaming laptop and looking to push it more on WoW.
---
Because I reckon when they pull that rabbit out of the hat, players just won’t care.
---
Being realistic isn’t pessimism.
---
Yes play tauren and level together!
---
Some people are saying this isn't viable in Classic because something about patrols and something else with disables you from doing that route.
---
What is this tri-spec you speak of?
---
Blood Elf Warrior.
---
You are addicted to the arcane but your pride won't let you bother to rely on it in battle. Your body is the weapon, not magic. You are a weapon.

Hey guys. Any feedback would be appreciated a lot! So here's the thing. I actually started playing wow very very late, only on warlords of draenor (yes I know lol), and played through most of legion content too, and ended up unsubbing for a number of reasons. I don't really know how classic wow works, so I'd like to list what I do not like about current wow and I'd really love if you guys could tell me how classic is different (or not) in that regard.  
---
1. Leveling sucks.  And I hate that. Leveling now is just a way to get really fast to 120 where everything you made before basically means nothing. In other games I've played when you're either level 63 or 87 or whatever it actually means something. In wow it means nothing. It's either 0 or 120. It's not a fun game AT ALL when you're anywhere in between these two. Leveling the first time is nice because everything is new, but leveling an alt is hell and you have to do it all alone because everybody bought boosts for their alts.  
---
2.  Gear/loot means everything and nothing at the same time. Your Ilvl doesn't mean shit about your actual skill, but you don't get into dungeons and raids if your Ilvl isn't high enough. Now there's even a 'raider score' thing that gets things even worse. It's not that easy in my experience to find a nice guild on demand and this creaters a huge barrier between you, the content you want to play (dungeons, m+, raids, etc) and the content you need to play in order to get to the content you want.   
---
and last,   
---
3; Basically getting your character ready to do a single normal raid can be a huge fucking pain in the ass. This makes the game not fun because you want to challenge yourself by doing challenging content but it's too damn hard to make it there without a lot of friends online. Are the normal dungeons in classic at least challenging? Or do you need a score addon and networking to even get invited to a fun dungeon (like a mythic +8 and onwards) or raid (heroic at least)? I mean, if I end up liking t  game I might as well search for a guild, but my question is: after you're level 60 do you have any fun and challenging content to play if you're in a guild or even, hell, if there's not enough people you know online?  
---
There's a lot more, but that's the core of it. There's obviously a lot of things I love about this game too, that's why I'm here. I like the progression, I love learning and optmizing my rotation, I love tanking and learning pulls, etc etc.
---
You can infernal drop on a flag in AB and have a paladin DI it.  The aoe ticking aura breaks flag capping.  Granted, I'll have to see if this is in classic, it was in vanilla but supposedly not in most private servers.

You need a strong weapon as warrior its almost required

If you take Healing Way you're doing it wrong.

shaman is 100% set on shaman, druid 100% on druid. you mention shadow/ele synergy but the one thing i know for sure is i don’t want to go pure dps. hybrid is ok, although in that case my general preference leans towards the “healer” end of the spectrum. 
---
we (me, shaman, druid) know we want to go for rank 12. that’s seems like a ton of work, while still potentially being doable. we aren’t deluding ourselves that we’ll get higher, although i suppose you never know. the hunter/mage/lock will be there as well to some extent, but i can’t say w/ 100% certainty they will have the same level of commitment. 
---
so as far as what we “want out of the game,” that’s our goal - but i don’t know enough to have a definitive idea of the best way to do that. presumably BGs, but as far as whether that means AB or AV or warsong, no clue. 
---
i definitely like playing druid. it’s my favorite healing class on retail, which means it’s my favorite class, because i only like playing healers. the forms + stealth + random bells and whistles give it a lot of depth that you miss out on with other classes. but my experience with them in retail is also misleading, in that modern rdruid is a full on main healer like MW or disc or anything else. from what i understand (having only played warrior in vanilla) that won’t be the case in classic. and i usually place great emphasis on class synergy - my first priority in arena, for example, is not making sure to use a known comp, but rather just that each person has at least one cc that doesn’t overlap DR, which is why the lack of a magic dispel w/o a priest jumps out at me. 
---
but again, no clue how necessary that will be in practice, because no clue what we will realistically be doing most of the time in order to try for rank 12. if i knew for sure that we’d be spending 90% of our time in warsong, that would go a long way towards figuring things out. but i don’t. 
---
hopefully that lengthy screed answers some of your questions, lol. thanks for the response

I really wouldn't bother with Feline Swiftness at all, [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/hunter/-5105103051-005025051030315) is my preferred build.
---
For super casual play I'd say Warlock. You can complete some "elite" quests solo thanks to your Voidwalker and other class abilities. A Mage is fine too, but is definitely a glass canon, and while they give you enough tools to survive most things, it requires a lot of practice to really get it down as instinct.
---
The solution is simple, level an alt and use it for farming. You will have plenty of downtime between phases to level a second character. Mages in particular take very little maintenance and have decent solo-farming capability even without much gear. Hunters require a bit more maintenance (ammo + pet food) but have a fast and smooth leveling experience while also being capable farmers with little to no gear.
---
I wish I could play the Beta to change my mind!!
---
not when you're grinding and killing mobs towards your next direction. If you are not killing anything that can give you XP on the way there, you're doing it wrong.
---
This is how speed levelers break away from the pact, we kill everything on site if it gives us ANY XP. If you find a nice empty quiet spot with 20 tigers and you only need to kill 5, im going to kill all 15. let's assume simple math here, tiger death nets me 100xp, skipping on 15 means I walked away from 1500 which is a quest XP. Now obviously this number is low cause higher level, these mobs are going to be 200-350 xp each
---
Protection warrior
---
Depending on what your definition of "spec that is meant for healing" but i would go with druid.
---
Warrior :)
---
Paladin becomes best healer with right gear, in both pve and pvp.
---
Yeah I got burned out on overwatch a year ago.
---
Good insights, thanks!
---
If not Hunter, then Warlock.
---
If not Warlock, then Mage.
---
If not Mage, then Rogue.
---
If not Rogue, then Druid.
---
If not Druid, then Priest.
---
If not Priest, then Paladin/Shaman.
---
If not them, then Warrior.
---
Accurate
---
That list is GREAT! Thank you so much for the effort.  
---
I wish you a healthy Broken Tooth on your first journey to Badlands.
---
that grind needs to be done with help or youll never do it in time
---
thanks for the tool :)
---
curious, what class do you play?
---
Rogue, if nothing else because it's the only class that can pick locks.
---
Stealth lets you go where you're not supposed to go and comfortably AFK almost wherever.
---
Sap lets you easily take on groups of 2-3 mobs.
---
You have tons of abilities to run if things go wrong(Gouge, Evasion, Sprint, Blind, etc.)
---
Relying on dodge rather than high HP pool means you have little downtime compared to Warriors.
---
Pickpocketing humanoids is fun in itself and can be quite profitable.
---
High burst potential makes it easy to take on single tough mobs.
---
This is false.  They certainly weren't that viable during the early phases of the game but once you get t2 or especially 2.5 you can burst anyone down at anytime and still be the best healer in a raid when you swap just a few pieces of gear.  Though I will admit it's not the most mana efficient (shockadin offensively that is)
---
I would say every criticism you have of the current WoW would be non-existent in Classic WoW. Classic WoW is every bit different and every bit better than it is in current retail WoW for every single point you mentioned. I would expect you to enjoy Classic WoW a lot more, given your complaints about current WoW.
---
Shadow priest
---
Cause you only ready the first sentence. Until Naxx, only 2 tanks needed per 40-man raid.
---
Go commit Forsaken
---
Yeah the decision is tough. Played more rogue than anything over the years, and it's near and dear to my heart (first char back in the day, etc.) but these days healing is usually more fun for me so i feel like i should roll pally or priest. Shaman would be the choice but all my friends are rolling alliance, RIP. Also, there's going to be so so many rogues.
---
BUT, you spend a ton of time out in the world in vanilla, so being a healer could suck for all that. Which makes me reconsider dps. Either rogue or warlock. Warlock looks really fun once you get gear, but seems rough for the first little while. Also there's a bit less warlocks on the alliance side. So I have the hipster value there.
---
BUT i love healing. lol. Druid is a dark horse but I don't know if I am man enough.
---
Bump!!
---
Let’s find these profiles !
---
What can I say. Iam a teaser. You really want to buy vowel ?
---
Technically I should have worded it as "Mostly 5-man".
---
If the sequel is about a better story, like Arthas, it would certainly be more successful. There are some movies where the original is decent and did alright and the second movie is the best one in the series.
---
The fact people keep trying to move the goalpost to somehow favor paladins is a pretty damn clear indication shamans are the much bigger threat to mages.
---
This is not true, 20 is all you need and you can still be a top 3 healer.
---
Shaman for sure. As long as you're not in the caster group you can use 30/0/21 spec and continue to melt faces.
---
Druids also the Heart of The Wild spec they can use in raids without sacrificing a lot of PvP potential.
---
Heard so much about this piece of shit so I slaved away at getting it solo level 30. Wasted so many hours and ended up completing it at 35... Which was really cool because at 38 I got rockbiter and vendored it.
---
Get it on a decked out alt, don't get it on fresh or first toon on a server
---
Disc' Priest.   
---
The trick is not to play as a "poor man's Shadow Priest." But rather lean into Holy Damage (Holy Spec, Divine Fury, Searing Light, etc). You are, to some degree, trying to "outlast" your opponent but while still hitting hard enough so they have to mitigate/avoid it rather than just beating on you. You'd still use Shadow Word: Pain, but also renew (cannot be interrupted/works during stun), and PW:S when the Holy tree is locked.   
---
Inner Focus and PI give you a little burst. I like Holy Reach with the ZG/Confessor's Raiment set bonus too, makes you one of the longest range casters in the game.
---
Seems about right.
---
Love me a crit chicken though.
---
Haha! I would gladly accept such a blessing. Glad I could help!

I see now what you meant. Yeah i definitely experienced this a bit on my last private server. Leveled a warrior slowly with a friend when he could log on, so once I hit max level the guilds/etc. were already established.. easy to run 5 mans all day as a tank, but getting anything more than a minor OT role in a guild was hard.. guilds just don't need that many tanks on the regular.

I like the video! I play Alliance myself, so it won't be able to use the info, but it's still cool!
---
If I may ask, what software do you use to record? I love your voice, and something that might help is if you do a small amount of bass boost on your audio, and run it through an equalizer. I'm sure that you already did a noise remover at least, since your audio is so clean.
---
I'd also advise playing some music in the background of your video. Something quiet, maybe just the soundtrack from WoW itself. It would help a lot to make your soundscape more interesting, and would compliment the informational tone you are giving off.
---
That's just my opinion, so take it with a bunch of salt.

I look forward to seeing more content!

---
I like priest but the leveling, yuck
---
You go and kill the mobs that drop reagents for healer consumes = easy money
---
You have no idea how long phase 2 is out. So how can you say it's impossible?
---
That’s a crazy spec haha
---
How do you know? From private servers where the servers have a ton more players? I knew people that hit R11+ back in Vanilla while working 8+ hours a day.
---
Both are fine. If you want to split hairs, Warlock is probably the most casual friendly class. Pets allow you to solo a lot of content that other classes can't at that level. 
---
Warlock has significantly less downtime compared to a Mage. They get a free mount at 40, and a level 60 mount at a significantly reduced price saving you a lot of time farming gold.
---
That's why you go for exalted Darnassus rep and get a tiger mount. The biggest benefit to gnome is all their mounts get scaled up in size. Stuff like the Brewfest Kodo are huge on a gnome.
---
watching porn on all those screens must be crazy
---
Seems like you dodged a bullet.
---
People who are literal in-game racists are not gonna be people that you'd want to spend time running dungeons with.
---
What race did you pick?
---
I have done quite a few on private servers, and I have quickly realized..... how uneven the experience is.
---
Human is really easy, as your class quest is literally "fight a guy in the same bar you met the quest giver in", followed by a kill and lookt quest of 3 mobs in a nice open area where it's easy to see what's going on and leash the adds, and you don't have to kill your way to it or wait for respawns.
---
Tauren is a complete faceroll. I don't even remember what my defensive stance quest was, but I do remember starting with 2 handed weapons and 28 strength, giving you like 7dps at level 2 with no money invested. You also start with an interrupt at level 1 and a LOT of health.   
---
Dwarf is very doable, but the zone has some hard quests, but gnome is a complete bitch. 
---
You are doing the same quests as dwarf, only you have 40 less health than a dwarf, you have dagger proficiency instead of 2 handed axe proficiency, you cannot use 1 handed axes at all, and you also have an entire dps less. 
---
Then you get to those frostmane shadowcasters, and they give you a -5 damage per hit debuff that lasts 2 minutes... and that's another 2.2 dps debuff when you consider that you will have a 2.3 speed weapon at that point (gladius). That's a TWO MINUTE debuff, and you have no interrupt. 
---
Then you cannot hamstring kite, as you cannot use the quest axe, because you would have to pay 10 silver for axe proficiency. 
---
Oh yeah, and there is no shield salesman in kharanos. You cannot buy a shield with more than like 50 block, until you don't need one any more. 
---
I have never leveled undead, but I suspect they are pretty hard, just because I have moved over to the undead starting area at level 8 and done the warrior quest, and it's a total gong show, with it happening inside a crypt. The crypt has too many mobs out front to leash anything without clearing. Most of the pulls on the private servers I play were double pulls. Even once you did get down, you have to clear basically the entire crypt to get to the 4 quest objectives, and then you have to deal with shit spawning on top of you. It's by miles the worst level 10 weapon quest. 
---
Though I THINK undead might? start with 2 handed sword proficiency? 
---
TLDR: don't just roll a tauren or human warrior and say "oh, this is easy". They are by no means evenly balanced.
---
Also, you have to know what's coming. 
---
If you just know what the gnome experience is going to be like, and you take alchemy (0.5 extra dps from elixir of lion's strength is a hell of a big deal when you do like 5 dps at level 8), and buy a full suit of light mail (Because you know you cannot buy a shield), and buy your gladius, and carry a ton of food? sure, gnome is not that hard.
---
But if you just run into the frostmane troll cave, and get faerie fire and the curse of weakness on you at the same time (which is not hard, one lasts for 60 seconds and the other for 2 minutes, and then try to fight a single level 10 troll at level 8? with like 10% of your armor reduction gone and 2 dps missing?
---
you gonna die.
---
Home slice that is way too much give me a tldr. But I rolled gnome and again I’m not saying it isn’t harder I’m saying it isn’t INSANELY harder
---
Just my personal opinion with comparisons from what you said and other things I’ve heard since I don’t play current retail wow: 
---
1. I leveled up various characters in vanilla buts it’s been a long while so take my rose colored glasses with a grain of salt. I loved the leveling experience. I tried to do a different race each alt to change it up and it felt really immersive. You can go the speed leveling route if you want and that can be its own fun/challenge if you’re into that. While max level (60) opens up a lot of content, I really enjoyed the lower level content as well which can be challenging with a less than full compliment of spells/abilities. every new talent point spent or new spell learned feels like it means something as you move zone to zone and encounter new things.
---
2. I haven’t played retail since wrath of the lich king so I can’t really answer with a direct comparison but I feel like gear can still define raid content in vanilla. From what I’ve heard I think vanilla makes you be more social than retail which leads to people helping each other to get gear more. Or at least I hope that happens in classic.
---
3. I thought 5-man dungeons could be very challenging. Obviously as more people you know and play with get more/better gear they get easier but you still have to work together instead of everyone just doing whatever, whenever they want. I don’t think classic will have structured type hard modes but I’m sure you can find ways to make content you’ve outgeared more fun. You do have to put yourself out there more to make friends since there isn’t a LFG tool but that’s part of the fun.
---
yeah i know but this is a p server
---
Priests definitely can against anything without any sustain. Their probably the most fun healer to pvp with too.
---
It is, this is explained both in the YouTube clip and in the “How it works!” window: The recommendation is not purely based on HpME, it also factors in HpS. The function that is maximized is HpME^x * ln(HpS)^y, where default for X and Y is 1, but you can change that by dragging the slider. If you want to see only the HpME breakpoint, and disregard HpS completely, drag the slider all the way to the left.
---
The same thing can be seen in the line chart for HpME over Healing Power. There you can see that for Healing Touch, with healing talents, The HpME for rank 4 over takes rank 10 at 208 healing power.
---
They really have "small" Keyboards?
---
Yeah only 2 classes can stealth, but many can bleed/disease/poison
---
Didn't know that was even a thing, I'll look into that if it actually is
---
Hunter
---
Doesn’t get easier. Simple and casual. Bring ammo and pet food!
---
Yes and I've pretty much resigned to the fact that I will need to level several characters up to at least 15 to really decide. I just can't choose between Warrior, Paladin, or Mage.
---
Aww :(
---
Well thanks for checking!
---
Nice, when you have kids and they have their own set of interests, and you try to mandate what they can do for fun, thats on you. That's not how I raise my kids. One likes games like me, the other doesn't. I don't pressure either of them, I support whatever my kids like to do as long as it isn't affecting their well being (which it isn't, he's actually a genius for his age -- which gaming probably helped).
---
He said they want to get phase 2 out right away and then beyond that it's going to be completely based on how the community has progressed. No where in here does it give a phase 3 release time frame.
---
Or Warrior. Does it get any more immersive than that?
---
Threat is a much bigger issue. Kill order is much more important with far fewer sources of AoE threat. I quit after WotLK but it seemed to me that threat was a thing of the past when I left.
---
 They aren’t even the best flag carriers either
---
Once. Friend said he is going priest, so I thought warrior. Then I looked into it. A lot. Warriors take a lot of time, and are very weapon dependent for damage. After a lot of investigation, current top theorycrafters are putting druid tanking as somewhere between viable and just as good as warriors (for sufficiently geared groups) if your goal is to PvE without a guild. So going to start feral. If they do hit like wet noodles in PvP, and we do end up PvPing a lot, I will roll a lock.
---
Lol. I guess I'll do my best to feed some fish to my demons and all shadowbolts arrows to honor this post.
---
Cataclysm or aftermath. Neither are great but better than intensity.
---
1) Leveling is definitely much more rewarding in Vanilla/Classic due to it actually being challenging. You can no longer face smash a keyboard against 3+ mobs solo and remotely think you'll come out alive. Gear definitely can give power boosts, and progresses with you as you level up to 60. 
---
2) Most raiding guilds will expect you to put in effort to obtain pre MC BIS, but without ilvl guilds put a lot more weight on skill, preparation, and attendance. If you can excel at those 3 things, guilds will gladly take you in over less than optimal gear. 
---
3) Unfortunately this is a pain point for the most part on classic too. Classic is a much more social dependent game than retail, and thus a lot of the content post 5man dungeons and pug BGs are guild dependent. Therefore guilds are very important and the key social ecosystems of classic. Normal dungeons are challenging, but definitely no where close to that of raids. Because of this you will then have to put in a bit of effort to be prepared for raids. However, if you're in a casual guild, they won't expect nearly as much preparation as progression guilds would. 
---
I definitely think you should try out Classic as it's very different than retail due to the challenge; however, do realize outside of leveling, end game is pretty reliant on being social and joining a guild.
---
Wrong.
---
&gt; If you were going to ask me to just ballpark a random number i would say for the first couple [phases] probably around a couple of months.
---
And then he goes on to talk about how if people are still working their way through BWL and ZG, he doesn't want to release AQ too soon.
---
This is the best one yet. The bulge is back!
---
For many classes you should keep more than two different ranks on your bars for each main healing spell, and use them as the situation requires. As explained in the video, and on the site, this recommendation is NOT to be interpreted as “Always use this rank”, but rather to help players make and informed decision when it comes to downranking, without having to do all the math on a piece of paper every time they change gear, talents or spec.
---
No because regardless of how many thanks are required per raid, they're still needed for other content and are always in high demand.
---
Everyone telling you it's impossible to get to R13/14  before BWL is pulling data/numbers out of their asses. There's been nothing to indicate the release date of phase 3. Phase 2 could last 4-6+ months. We have no idea and neither does Blizzard from interviews.
---
Oh, okay, thanks for letting me know
---
I have the same, might roll a pally or priest. But the leveling I won't like as much
---
Snape kills Emporer Palpatine. Who could forget that?
---
Nice drawing! Do one with a proper spec next time!

The true advantage of capitalism.

Theres everything for everyone.
---
I thought statements beginning with “if” became completely off limits after a couple expansions (for obvious reasons, you could make a complicated framework of if/then statements to play for you basically). 
---
Do those ones work?
---
So much wasted points you won’t be using regrow the or rejuv, u didn’t even put points in natures grasp??

Gnome monk was hilarious
---
Mage sounds super convenient with being able to teleport your self anywhere and having food and water with out really having to worry all that much.  It sounds pretty nice and they have great utility. 
---
Warlock though has a pet which is awesome for soloing and seems like some eat class quests ❤️ I’d say go mage 😅😁
---
Oooooof bro, that -100 lmfao I can't lie I was on of them
---
ITS DM
---
Listen to what he says after that..
---
&gt;"Phase 1 to phase 2 will be one of the faster progressions. We want to get Dire Maul out there, get the PvP system, couple of world bosses, and then beyond that it's going to just be watching how players are dealing with the content"
---
This always happens. Just know that perhaps none of them will make the cut. I would not suggest making an alt. Try hard, be their one carrying the torch further. The ones who catch up to 60 are the ones who are worthy.
---
expect to see lesser for 25s until more sellers arrive and it dwindles down to 10s
---
expect to see greater wand to sell for 50-75s until more sellers arrive and slowly dwindle down to 20-35s
---
Because posts like this are fucking dumb. This can be boiled down to “there’s pvp on a pvp server”. No shit.
---
wow, amazing lol. Thank you, that might solve all of our problems and then some
---
Yes, he did.
---
Can I ask how this is relevant to Classic? If you actually meant classic: 
---
Tanking - Warriors are the optimal tanks period. You can tank leveling as druid/pally, but they're heavily gimped late game and you'll very rarely see them in raids. 
---
DPS - Fury Warrior and mages rain supreme in dps charts. Especially when mages get to go fire in AQ 40. 
---
Healing - Paladins for tank healing and priests for raid both single and raid healing.
---

you have it right sir. The if statements no longer work. We just use conditions in [] instead now.
---
First off i'm gay, second off theres a reason you type "female panda world of warcraft" and the entire first page is various furry fan art. Not only do i feel its overly sexualized, but lots of horny yiffers agree to
---
You said that you “never always lowered the rank of heal...”, which is a little confusing since I don’t know if you never did it, or always did it. But I am assuming always from the rest of the context.
---
You are correct, efficiency isn’t the only factor, HpS is also important. Which is why the recommendation also considers HpS, this is explained both in the video, and in the “How it works!”-window on the site.
---
I tend to play Priest, but consider rolling Druid for Classic.
---
I do, but I do for most things. The problem I have is all classes are interesting in their own way and have good reasons to be them. Thrall is one of my favorite Characters though, + Ragnaros is a dope villian imo, so I like the idea of enhancement Shaman to work well with that... but I love raiding and we all know the problem with that. I never healed in past WoW, but have in retail and I enjoy it, so I might just heal raids and enhance pvp.
---
Outside of that, warlock, warrior, paladin, and priest are also incredibly interesting to me.
---
Amazing post.
---
&gt;Arguably +5 axes is worth far more.  The problem is that there aren't that many good 1h axes.
---
Exactly. So berserking it is
---
Okay he said **ballpark** which means an extremely rough estimate. 
---
This statement he refers to Phase 3. You can't just cherry pick the sentences you want from an interview to prove a point.
---
lol.... so much wrong.
---
priest here, first 24 hours I can get to level 27-28. Long run, only hunters/lock surpasses me because of pet and mage with AOE.
---
I will be about 6-7 hours behind the mage/hunter/lock speed leveling to 60 as a priest. We don't sit down to drink or spend more than 40% mana. Know your route, kill all on sight and profit.
---
He *still* definitely said his estimate for Phase 2 to Phase 3 was "a couple of months".
---
Holy Reckoning Paladin 25/26/0, you lose your holy shock and 5% crit but get Blessing of Sanctuary for your tanks and Reckoning which destroys melee classes, it is the best spec for solo queueing in bg’s.
---
Paladins will be your most efficient tank healers due to down ranking flash of light and being very Mana efficient. Druids and priests will focus on the rest of the raid most of the time; however, will help out on tank healing when raid dmg is to a minimum.
---
i dont understand how anyone would know that yet
---
When developing this tool I actually looked at some of the source code for TheoryCraft just to see how it worked. It was an amazing feat of work that addon, and I hope someone keeps it updated for the Classic client.
---
You r just wrong
---
I'm ready for the utter tranquility of a Normal server, for the first time in years.
---
Dynamic respawn wouldn’t be effective with that many people.
---
Blizzard hasn't actually said they don't plan to implement dynamic respawns. They were in Vanilla. We could be seeing both.
---
I'M AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS OWL FOR 12 TO 14 SECONDS
---
lemme try from memory... 
---
1,4,6,8,10,11,14,16,18,20,21,24,25,26,27 ?
---
Omg this had me in tears hahaha. I love these memes involving classic wow.
---
Glad i'm not alone!
---
Funny I'm going in super casual in terms of time played per week but I'm going Warrior 100%.
---
Tanking can get me friends and always ensure I'm not sitting around waiting during my speratic playtime.
---
It will help me pick a class for classic.
---
Loving the people downvoting you for letting them know what people did in vanilla and why. wow, crazy..
---
They could be instant in extreme cases for all I care. Still beats layering
---
They /yell p mo fe
---
I never did STV, maybe I should give it a go this time.
---
This isn't a ranking of most casual to least casual, it's a ranking of best solo to worst solo. There really isn't one class that has a lower casual cap than another. All classes get played by all types of players.
---
nah dude healers beat dps in classic duels all the time even super speced ones. The standard raid spec disc/holy priest is a tough one to beat if they know how to play. holy paladins used to spec "shockadin" for PvP and were pretty good in duels too, rogues have an especially hard time with them. druids super survivability can outlast a lot of people and shaman is a good dueler too. Honestly well played healers can be very hard to beat in classic
---
how fast during launch you think an enchanter can get to lesser mystic? 12 hours?
---
You can learn anything you put your mind to
---
I’m developing adventure basics classes for a variety of learners who are humans important to me.
---
Priest and Shaman are both really well rounded and can win most 1v1 matchups. That said, Priest and Shaman both struggle against skilled Prep/CB Rogues and Warlocks.
---
Those two matchups usually come down to consumable usage.
---
Simply wrong, learn a bit of the lore around westfall before making an uneducated opinion.
---
Just a quick Google search will give you the correct description and reasoning for its arid landscape. Including the yellowed grass.
---
You said Phase 2 will only last 49 days. This would mean phase 1 would last longer than phase 2 which isn't going to be the case. Ion himself said that they're going to give players time and don't want people to feel rushed.
---
My only problem with prot farming is that the respec costs will add up, but it might be the only option.
---
Haha you win good sir!
---
No, it really doesn't. We know that to have a sustainable population after Phase 2 or 3 and beyond, the server needs to begin with 2, 3, or even 4 times the number of players on launch.
---
That's 10,000 to 20,000 players, at least. That amount of Dynamic Respawning is what PServers do and it gets abused a ton to level boost players.
---
I don't have to explain anything to a pigheaded trash can. Stay bad for all I care.
---
With how shit GOT ended the last seasons I don't want that.
---
I always struggle with macros ,
---
Would I just be able to copy paste these into the macros system and be good to go or do I need to alter them
---
So from my limited Vanilla experience PVE is important if you want to be successful in PVP as it offers the best gear to be able to kill or heal pplz. 
---
If you are planning to farm WSG Druid is the best FC but since you are Horde, priest is the only dispelling class to remove paladin HOJ, Death Coil, fear. (non warrior), silence, counterspel. Without a priest in WSG group druid has no chances as he will die in a single paladin stun.
---
I am sry.  teach me
---
Tauren it is.
---
Why is your outro 1/4 of the entire video?
---
Thanks a lot for the answer, I really appreciate it. Just to clarify the social aspect, I actually don't mind being social and joining a guild at all. When I want to challenge myself and rely solely on my own abilities I just play some Tekken. The problem is I actually find it pretty hard to make friends on retail as it stands. I made some along the way, joined a guild and so on, but it was always overshadowed by what I actually consider a very anti-social aspect of the currents game design, which is that friendship and socializing doesn't actually matter if you're not picking the flavor-of-the-patch class and spec, if you don't have guildies to help you get good raider scores so you won't be denied at every dungeon even regardless of your ilvl, and I could go on and on. It seems the game offers very little opportunity to returning players or beginners to actually progress because once you're done with the easy stuff you kinda hit a brick wall where you either try your luck in PUG hell or find a guild that is very probably not looking for your class and spec at the moment. It may be my own personal experience, or my server, or whatever, but my problem is not with being social and joining guilds, it's just that it seems harder to find a spot in a raid than it is to be good enough to deserve that spot.
---
Playing Paladin, I plan on going Engineering for end game use but until then I was thinking either leveling with Mining and Skinning or just going Mining and Blacksmithing. I’m not sure how feasible/good things like the Arcanite Champion is though it seems pretty cool, and not sure how feasible it would be to make something like the Sulfuron Hammer to eventually get myself Hand of Rag (for pvp which I plan to do a good bit of). I’m aware I’d only be able to make one of these cause of the BS specializations and such. 
---
Just looking for insight into the feasibility of this plan and the best course of action to take.
---
Its 24 seconds and thats because thats what is required for the end screen where my latest video pops up, if I don't have an outro for that long it would just block the actual part of the video.
---
I have always rolled horde and was planning on ally until my guild adamantly expressed that they will not be rolling ally, so I will be playing horde and create an alt on Alliance this time around.
---
I’d say go for it if you’re alone. Worst that will happen is you hate it around level 20 and you can always re-roll.
---
Differences of factions:
---
1. Alliance is very much fairy tale story, while the Horde strikes me as a Mad Max thriller. Most of the locations for Horde (outside of Tauren) are destroyed, shit huts that someone crapped out and forgot about. Alliance will have everything perfect with great engineering and architecture. I love mud huts, so Horde is clearly my favorite.
---
2. The Horde is INVESTED in the war, while the Alliance treats the war like Afghanistan. Every NPC on the Horde side references the war in some form of fashion. The Alliance is like, “hmm...all the troops are gone and I can’t quite put my fingers on it.”
---
3. Orgrimmar - I know they have Iron Forge, but holy shit is Org a fucking national treasure.
---
4. Alliance is generally better at PvE and runs many more pre-mades for PvP, so if you can get yourself in a good guild you should be able to wreck face in both PvE and PvP.
---
5. I don’t have stats, but I think Alliance is usually the first choice for new players also. So, naturally you’ll have more new players around you. So this means less elitist pricks......
---
6. Everyone says the racials of Horde are OP, but the Alliance racials are stupid good: Escape artist, Human Spirit, Fear Ward, Sword/Mace Spec, Expansive Mind, etc.
---
I’d recommend to jump over and try it out. If you hate it, then you can always go back to Horde.
---
Dynamic re-spawn is very bad. People literally find the exact spawn point of 1-2 mobs and stay in one spot killing them over and over and over as it is the most effective way to level.... yes 2-3-4 levels sometimes hours. 
---
People exploit AOE grinding, the economy goes out of wack because farming is easy. There are multiple other problems ..... Layering is actually a lesser evil by a mile.
---
Apart from Raid, 5-man, World Boss, please list the other contents tanks are in high demand for.  
---
All polls indicate Warrior is going to be the most played class, though I find that questionable. Even so, supply will not be a problem.
---
It's not what I believe, it's the information we've been given by the director of the game.
---
Four months between every raid release seems very reasonable.
---
We simply don't need 4 months of Dire Maul and 2 World Bosses.
---
Phase 1 has MC (August 27)
---
Phase 3 has BWL (December 10)
---
Phase 4 has ZG (March 31)
---
Phase 5 has AQ (July 21)
---
Phase 6 has Naxx (November 10).
---
TBC or whatever Classic/Retail hybrid they're planning on March 2nd 2021.
---
So now one bad season takes precedence over all the other stuff they've produce over the years? Have you watched their latest mini-series Chernobyl by chance?
---
Hard modes of low level dungeons for max level players. If classic is all about nostalgia, what’s more nostalgic than rerunning a challenging version of RFC or Deadmines as a lvl 60 group? It would open up more content to casual non-raider players as well which is why I think blizz did it in the first place with the expansions.
---
You said raids. You just listed two other contents. 
---
Warriors have ALWAYS been the most played class, yet tanks have ALWAYS been in short supply.
---
Nothing's magically changing about that. More than half of all those Warriors are not going to have any interest in tanking. They like thier DPS.
---
&gt; It's not what I believe, it's the information we've been given by the director of the game.
---
I just gave you a quote from the director of the game where he says they have no idea when Phase 3 will be released and it's completely dependant on how players are progressing in the content.
---
All your dates are **extreme** guesses based on a statement where he contradicts himself later in the interview.
---
As a super casual player you need world mobility since you will only have couple of hours per week and you want to spend them leveling/exploring instead of travelling. 
---
I would recommend either a mage for portals or Druid for level 21 talented cat for with 30% speed increase and a travel form at level 30. 
---
Either of those will have easy time killing stuffs and Mage will not have enough time to get boring.
---
It was not just one bad, you clearly noticed when they ran out of source material and the quality went down in a spiral :/. Chernobyl is based on a fantasy book written by a none Russian so its not really accurate, more like propaganda but still might watch it :)
---
/need
---
Always one
---
Rogue? Nah, tried out at 60 - rotation made me snooze.
---
Warrior? Yeah, seems like fun! Engaging, can tank and DPS etc. Definitely playing warrior!
---
.. but healing is fun, priest? Fuck.
---
* 3% parry over Humanoid Slaying
---
* Not putting a point in Trap Mastery to hitcap on traps
---
* Not putting points in entrapment
---
* Unironically going LR for PVP
---
For someone who's anal about 1 point in imp HM, this is impressive.
---
As stated earlier any healer have a decent chance in 1v1 but if you want to do supplementary dps un bgs shaman is the way to go. The shaman pvp spec is purely made for it. You get close to mage level burst and still keep most of your healing capacity. And shamans are really good 1v1 struggling slightly vs locks and early on rouges
---
If we already created a character on NA Server, and want to create another character on EU Server, Do we need to make 2nd Subscription for EU Server?
---
Are players allowed to have characters in 2 or 3 Regions/Continents with 1 single Account Subscription?
---
Paladins have a Holy build with Reckoning and they also have the Shockadin build.
---
Paladins are hard to kill in PvP and generally outlast most of their opponents
---
Most bosses are immune to taunt
---
Gonna make my way to Tanaris instead of Burning Man this year. Could hardly wait.
---
Oh nice. Priest here too.
---
Druid is very different from Priest, but I'm sure you know that lol. My straightforward priest brain got overwhelmed pretty quickly by the druid i was levelling on a private server. PvP encounters routinely devolved into me going "oh god what do I do."
---
But when it comes to class fantasy, and options while levelling, nothing beats druid.
---
You're deluded. I won't be arguing with you.
---
Dynamic spawns have crashed the economies of many Private Servers. Blizz is already implementing fixes to make layering more palpable.
---
If it is best solo to worst solo, you've got druids and rogues flipped.  
---
For casual play druids are the second best leveler in the game. No downtime and high move speed for travelling, two things that are very important for someone with limited play time. Easy access to dungeon groups too.
---
I don't think druid is that great for herbing if i recall prior to flying, mounts are faster than travel form.
---
But where did you hide the tissues and lotion?!?! haha. Looks cool! Will you actually be able to use all the monitors? Would be cool if you could assign different in game views to a separate monitor and be able to see what's behind you with a glance!
---
"massive shoulders and arms from hauling 300 lbs of water everywhere" dying
---
I think you're interpreting his statements as contradictions when they're not.
---
1. The first 2 phases will be around a couple of months.
---
2. We don't want to release phase 4 too early.
---
3. The first phase will be quick and after that we'll see.
---
He can still estimate a couple of months for Phase 2 to Phase 3 and say *we'll see*. People aren't going to need more than 4 months to feel done with MC + Onyxia.
---
&gt; You actually can't use the totems unless you do the quest, even if you already learned the skill. 
---
haHAAA, the fucking totem ITEMS you have to hold in your bags. 
---
I'd forgotten about that until just now, four bag slots is not insignificant in Vanilla/classic
---
Fair enough, I suppose you're right about the target demographic
---
What is 5-8 and rupture. Prot is a joke for rogues unless they legit just stand in melee attacking.
---
When you say leeway is a problem. Is it harder to use abilities on beta or something?
---
Oh yeah I know!
---
As classic wow goes I have only played druid up to lvl 40 on a Private server. But I used to main druid in TBC, WoLK and Cata, and I loved the diversity and utility that druid brings to the table. Just as you mentioned about PvP, the toolset is huge for druids, and it takes real skill to master them all. I kind of like that challenge ;)
---
1v1 is not PVP, its a duel with rules and boundaries ......
---
Best PVP healer is a Druid as it can simply run away from anyone and keep kiting and picking at them. All other healer lack mobility and need to fight the DPS. 
---
Paladin has zero chances of killing anyone ...... and cant really run away. Their best move is bubble hearth.
---
Shaman has some kick but needs DPS gear. The biggest problem is lighting and heals are nature spell so if one gets interrupted they are all locked. 
---
Priest has some good options with insta fear, insta bubble, some shadow spells, mind control paired with engineering I would say priest is the most dangerous one ..... unless a good rogue opens up on you ...... GG.
---
Leveling speed really doesn't have anything to do with "best solo" and easy access to dungeon groups definitely doesn't. OP has no interest in end-game, so getting to 60 sooner doesn't matter at all.
---
Because I felt GOT quality went down or because I'm not thrilled watching an inaccurate depiction? Both of these things are factually true tho.
---
Paladin in full T2 can stack considerable amount of shadow resistance, which completely counters any shadow spell, making them almost unvulnerable to priests and warlocks, if im not mistaken
---
No way. It's not like Reddit karma is important.
---
Explain [this](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/446277065?t=03h13m55s) then. Inb4 you say that the hunter also had the addon, and the custom /roll also popped up on his client.
---
/r/nothingeverhappens
---
As long as you understand how to use them, they should work great if you just copy paste. I kept them as simple as possible!
---
hoooly shit. This is brilliant
---
EveClassics list is spot on for you. 
---
Warrior is the worst to lvl and EVERYONE will outpace you. That and your too casual to duo level with some one, which is a godsend for Pallies and warriors. You want something that solo levels well wince your schedule will get in the way of questing with others.
---
Finally some proof. Yay! Good job. I was completely wrong. Thank you.
---
Some people don't have anything better to do than start pointless arguments on reddit.
---
[Here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/446277065?t=03h13m55s)'s the POV of the hunter in his group. So much for "muh client-side addon for the twitch bucks" argument.
---
Whisperwind??? Pretty sure we had a Brojangles on there. Or is that a more common name? lol
---
noice lol
---
Getting camped by skull levels isn't time lost? You seem delusional.
---
Will there be realm transfers? And if so, can you transfer freely between PvP and PvE realms? Asking because i want to introduce my sister to PvP realms, we are playing together om alts but if it gets too much for her we can just gtfo and lvl together on a PvE server.
---
I wouldn't base your pick in classic on TBC performance due to the developers haven't committed to even releasing TBC or just adding more lvl 60 content. However, with that said, TBC made most classes have more viable specs and paladin tanks were heavily in demand in TBC. All healers were good with Paladins being the best tank healers and shaman the best raid healers. All classes had a viable DPS spec in TBC.
---
Why?
---
You obviously didn't play the game as a teen..
---
PvE servers are for the players that value their time.
---
the massive shoulders and arms was the funniest joke there with the meta joke layered in xD.
---
The priest putting PI on the shaman will almost always guarantee atleast one kill in a teamfight.
---
Priests &gt; double druid.  Dispell and aoe fear are bigbois
---
Which is why I emphasize their high demand will mostly come from 5-man contents.  
---
While that's good for the tanks for a while, I doubt they'd wanting to be doing 5-man forever, as their end goal should be 40-man. And that's where they hit a problem.  
---
40-man is the equivalent of only needing 2 tanks for a 8 party.
---
I personally always liked ancestral knowledge in the enhancement tree for 5 points when going dedicated healer
---
wow man you shouldn't bother with classic content - have you considered doing standup instead? like really dude this is top notch stuff. subscriber for life.
---
I think WC3 The Frozen Throne was the last midnight release I ever purchased. Plus, if I remember correctly, that game was like $80 in Canada... crazy expensive for a kid to get but damn it was so exciting to get it, unwrap the plastic, and smell the fresh smell of paper while looking through the game manual at all the cool new units.
---
No of course not, but  in a situation like this it's a telltale sign of whether your impression is shared by others of the community (which are the people you're communicating with when abbreviating DM)
---
If people aren't on the same page, communication breaks down. Then we're stuck wasting time defining acronyms that were meant to save time lol
---
Well, you can't *see* him type enter, but yes, thanks to /u/asc__ , we have proof.
---
You seem to miss the point of playing a RPG. Maybe another genre fits you better.
---
Who hurt you
---
Ele &gt; spriest when geared but priest mind control is sexy
---
I stand by that when I was running deadmines first it was called VC. Uther realm, one of the first realms.
---
Moonkin bulge monkaW
---
I never played vanilla so I don't know if it was much different than BC, but one of the things I loved about wow more than any other MMO was the pvp server. Granted I was an undead rogue and had a better chance of not being ganked but just the fact that I could sneak around and had to watch where I was going made the world real to me. Sure I got pissed off and was camped countless times but it just made it real. In real life your enemy would kill you. You had to get strategic. You had to wait it out sometimes. If I wanted to play a game where everyone was friends and had no worries I would play guild wars. It's also why flying mounts killed it for me. Nobody was on the ground running around.
---
I always felt like they did that more to entice more people to play a warlock as opposed to a mage.
---
I dont know man, i have tried to level one as well, since everyone were saying how hard they are and i wanted to know. I was kindly surprised, since it was nowhere as hard as other people were saying. Matter of subjective opinion. The main problem with warrior is, miss stepping is much more punishable. If you avoid it, the leveling is quite enjoyable with proper gear, which you should have no problem to get, if you dont skip dungeons during leveling process
---
"has a macro which foces innvervate to self-cast"
---
gold
---
Yeah I have never called a dungeon by its last boss' initials . 
---
Not saying you didn't call it that, I can't dispute what you did or did not do. all I know is what I experienced.
---
If u are gona raid shaman or priest but if u are only gona pvp id go spriest since they dont need raid gear to melt people
---
ok dude i get it, you dont have to tell me all these weird PvP rape fantasies you think about at night before bed. i was just explaining that warlocks do not have ESCAPE MECHANISMS like every other class does. our "escape plan" is fear and run. otherwise its a fight to the death, either the warlock or the other guy.
---
I find that if you quest as a party it actually works out to be better with the 1 at a time pick ups. Mind you that you get less exp while grinding in a group that the shitty and unbearable low drop chance makes up for it.
---
Yah.   0/5/46 is another spec I used.
---
Mage &gt; Warlock &gt; Druid &gt; Everything else &gt; Warrior
---
Mage has better utility for leveling, while Warlock is more suitable for group environment.  
---
I put Druid high because they can dps, heal and tank while leveling.
---
it's way overblown, they die a few more times, classic is easier than private servers apparently. It's going to be fine.
---
IIRC they're the same price as a normal mount, but require rank 13 to purchase.
---
The difference is GoT ran out of source material and that's when it began its descent to being dogshit. The Warcraft/WoW universe has loads more source material.
---
Chadkin
---
&gt; it wasn't a success financially
---
sadly it was. The gold farming chinese players went crazy for it
---
It was a really bad movie but give it some better writers and it could be fun (also didnt care much for the subject of the movie) 
---
Cinematography was amazing tho
---
I said this in a later comment as well :)
---
I'm in the same boat, but the other way around!
---
I mained a holy priest since TBC and enjoying it. What I dislike at priest is its combat style.i hate caster damage. My main reason for going pally is that levelling will be the main part and I enjoy melee combat. Also plate gear looks so cool ;)
---
This, every time
---
Yes it did well in China
---
But all in all, it might not even have made a profit. It had the biggest drop in ticket sales in the history of cinema. It flopped HARD, and we're not ever getting a sequel (at least not with a budget large enough for the CGI orcs or even a proper war scene)
---
I think I bought the collectors edition of that. I had a job in high school and really nothing but weed to spend my money on at the time. Bought it because I loved star craft and diablo, first time ever really seeing anything Warcraft. I played it, didn’t finish it. However I’m looking very forward to the remastered version. Can’t wait to delve into the lore again, hope it comes out before classic.
---
You can smelt ore to level up your mining.
---
My warrior died like 5 times doing the centaur warplans quest. You LITERALLY cannot fight 2 mobs at the same time unless you funnel them gear. And when you get jumped by even one mob as soon as you rezz you might even die then too. 
---
You listed half the available classes under the strong category. Warriors are “ok” in the sense that you can level, but they’re easily the worst by a large margin. You require head on a swivel awareness and sometimes luck, quite a difference from other classes that have minimal downtime(aside from drinking).
---
It may not be as bad as the private server, but they’re no cakewalk either.
---
It might not even have made a profit.
---
is 4700 exp a lot for.... um...... how do I say this... classes that aren't mage?
---
21/21/9 is my favorite. Having both the BM stun and scatter is really good.
---
Because there’s literally no reason to go prot until 60.
---
Thats so fking dumb, really hope they fix it before beta ends
---
No it was not. It was a huge flop. It *might* have made a profit, but it might [not](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/07/13/box-office-warcraft-is-a-430-million-flop/#277dc28633f3).
---
I meant like the AV exalted ram
---
Excitement from playing new class always fades off sooner or later. Unless you are completely burned out with your main class, i would stick with it
---
Thanks a lot for the response. So then, i guess i shouldnt main it since everyone finds it boring and useless. Really sad
---
True. And I do smelt all the ores but the thing is I run out of copper ores while leveling, the surrounding area suddenly gets filled with tin deposits which I cant mine nor I can find copper to skill up
---
A sequel would be about the second war, not the third war. The movie was a flop - quite objectively - considering the cost of marketing it, it might have *lost* money.
---
Any hybrid class aka shaman, pally or druid. The ability to take some hits while still being able to heal helps a lot in the wild.
---
He meant LAPs and FAPs. Living action and Free action potions.
---
So it's basically the original release of the game?
---
Yeah, but then he can't Prospect it for gems!
---
Dont worry, when all the warriors in the server reach level 30 everyone else (except pallys) will be level 45 by then LMAO
---
So what I noticed during post-launch private servers, starting zones quests mob can have up to 5-15 players camping spawn (yes, that many players after even post-launch, I don't want to imagine launch).  
---
Why are they not in a party? Because if they were, they'd have to leave their spot to loot mobs killed elsewhere by party. Someone else will take their spot. A lot more walking around for roughly the same reward.  
---
It gets better towards the 15-20 zones, and should be resolved by 20-30 zones. But the 1-15 zone during launch is going to be brutal.
---
This fucker literally reuploaded my entire YouTube channel. [Check it out here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCArpkO2EHTfYLL9Gzxt-HFg?view_as=subscriber) if you want.

Are there any in game leveling addons? One like conslegion and the bfa one. 
---
I know Joana is making one, but he says there's a decent chance the starting areas will be available for the launch, doesn't sound like it will be complete for launch.
---
That's the fault of the GoT writers and directors - not HBO
---
If Duncan Jones stays as far away from it as possible, it could be good
---
You no longer need to macro stuff like dash and dive into these macros. The previous patch on the beta fixed pet A.I. so now pets will use dash and dive intelligently. When pursuing a mob far away they will use it, but they WONT use it if it comes off of cooldown and they are in melee range of whatever they are fighting (like on many private servers).
---
This is a big relief as now you can just leave Dash/Dive on Autocast and the A.I. uses it ONLY when it makes sense to be used.
---
Yea, basically a re-release of the start of WoW, since most people consider what it was back then and what it is on the retail version completely different games, for many different reasons.
---
Rogue is fun, but can be tough early on with groups of mine. Hunter is much better solo. If you're NE, you can still stealth AFK.
---
You'll need to kite Drakisath (last boss) in UBRS back while your group kills his adds. I can't think of anything else you *need* to kite in dungeons every single run, but keep in mind that a need to kite trash mobs might arise if the group can't handle a pack or if someone asspulls another pack.
---
As for raids, there's a lot of ways to cheese the boss fights by kiting adds. In MC, you might want to have 2 hunters kite 2 of Majordomo's melee adds to alleviate the pressure off the group. This is pretty straightforward. Stand near on the edge of the platform, Distracting Shot your add and then drop down to the ramp and start running. You can pop some more Distracting Shots/Serpent Stings to keep aggro on the mob.
---
In BWL, you might want to have hunters kite the dragons that spawn during Razorgore's fight. You want to kite around like what is done in [this video](https://youtu.be/AVtdX2rOeLI?t=294). I generally did a Distracting Shot to snap aggro on myself and then applied a Serpent Sting, maybe add another Distracting Shot. You really don't want your dragons to end up on the healers because of healing aggro.
---
Take note of a few things:
---
* No Aspect of the Cheetah, because getting hit by the arcane explosions of the mage would result in you getting dazed and then caught
---
* Zanza of Swiftness (20% movement speed increase) for an easier time kiting
---
* Jumping off of the platforms to create more distance from the mobs, as you can jump off but they are forced to path around
---
In both cases, if your raid's DPS/competence is high enough, you won't need to kite those mobs.
---
Keep in mind that kiting is useful (and pretty much mandatory for stuff like UBRS and overall being a decent hunter), but you'll also need to know how to pull. In raids, you'll be frequently doing the tank's job of pulling for them. You have 41 yards range versus your warriors' 30 yards range, and you can pull while on the move and without delay while they need to stand still and have a "cast time" of about a full second.
---
Hunter pulling is useful in MC to snag those Lava Surgers before they get too far and mandatory for the Suppression Room in BWL. It's also useful in a number of specific boss strats and trash pulls as well.
---
This is an underrated meme
---
I disagree slightly tbh. The game shouldn't be focused about progression. Classic wow is about having fun in the world, and if pvp scares you then yeah, roll pve. I just find it silly that people feel the need to be progressing all the time. Just my 2 cents.
---
That's the one.
---
My wife is definitely playing priest. I’m torn between mage, warrior, hunter, and rogue. Part of me knows warrior/priest would be a great dungeon combo but I want to DPS endgame and I don’t want to respec a lot. Does anyone know if DPS warriors can tank endgame dungeons with prot gear but DPS spec okay?
---
1. You often don't want to continuously cast heals because it breaks the 5s mana regen rule. If you're in a situation where you don't want to break the 5sr, any talent points you put into HWay are completely wasted since you're actively avoiding keeping the stacks up.
---
2. Healing Wave is a big heal. The two most common uses for big heals is when someone unexpectedly drops low and you NS HW them quickly back up to prevent death, or the target you're healing is taking big, predictable damage which usually translates to tank healing which you don't want a Shaman to do.
---
3. You don't want Shamans on tank healing because they can't regen mana while casting, Chain Heal is the only smart heal in the game, and ever since 2007 when TBC was released guilds expect Shamans to do totem twisting.
---
If you ever needed a reliable tank healer there's three other healing classes to choose from who are all much better equipped to do the job and Druids in particular are most well suited for the job because their casts are so slow that they naturally fit the pre-casting style of healing that comes with the job of healing the tank.
---
What countermeasures have been taken against exploits such as:
---
* Layer jumping
---
* Hunter solo farming Dire Maul Tribute
---
* Mafia-like groups hoarding black lotus
---
Very good, but maybe not as good as mages. 1-40 above average, 40-60 near top tier. 
---
Grounding totem at 38 is a big power spike, chain lightning at 32 + lightning/elemental mastery/eye of the storm are also very big power spikes. Before these you basically will not be able to use lightning bolt at all in world pvp. 
---
You lack hard cc, and have no mobility, this makes it much harder to deal with multiple enemies compared to a mage. This also makes it much more difficult when you are the one being engaged on. 
---
That said, ele shamans have one of the strongest kits out there for world pvp. Short cd interrupt and primary damage ability, on demand immunity to one or more spells, high burst damage with good range. Poison cleansing vs rogues can cause immunity to blinds and crippling poison. Aoe slows, potential for a well timed fear dispel, renewable ranged slow. You have great 1v1 potential and can contribute more to a group fight than probably any other class.
---
&gt; OC's page is NSFW. (That might actually bring more viewers)
---
ngl I wouldn't even click otherwise
---
Makes sense. thanks for the reply &amp; the guide!
---
If you are on a pserver that’s why. Classic has different spawns than what pservers have shown to have. You won’t run into this issue in classic.
---
Holy shit, you don't have a flipping clue wtf  u r talking about.
---
That depends on if you like tanking. Personally If I am going to tank I want it done right. Not with some half ass squishy wannabe.
---
&gt; go on discord and bribe the ganker
---
Bribe the ganker? Have some dignity.
---
You can stealth but you can't move so it's of very limited use.
---
I am going to roll a druid and probably horde.  But the reason I'd consider ally is pallies alone.  As mentioned they are way better than shammies.  Then on top of that alliance have dwarf priests for pvp.  Who needs racial when you have a buff that just makes you immune to fear?
---
 No paladins are running around in shadowgear in world PvP.
---
Everyone knows locks counter them lol
---
Were you jerking off while you filmed this?"
---
Wow that is good news. Good to know. I'll test this out the moment i get my hands on it for sure. I'll still need to test all scenarios, but this would be very helpful for focus as you say.
---
Then I gotta melee for Mana Regen!
---
The dynamic respawns that were in vanilla functioned a lot differently than the ones in BC or even on private servers.
---
In vanilla it was based on all the mobs being dead and it would speed up the respawn. BC and later as well as pservers it’s based on people in the area. So yeah you could call it dynamic respawns (Kevin Jordan did) but they are vastly different in function.
---
Warlock is top tier if you want class flavor quests. Quests for voidwalker, succubus, fel hunter, infernal, doomguard and then mount at level 60 (technically level 40 mount is a quest as well but that is just go see someone to train it).  
---
The higher the level, the more intricate and long the quests get.
---
I know that when I face a complicated technical problem, feel is the most important consideration.
---
Lolz. In the meantime you won’t get tactical mastery until your 40s, because that’s how you actually do tanking right.
---
I took my girlfriend to see that movie in cinema. She does not play WoW, barely knows what it is (thought once I play WoW when I was playing Dota, lol). We both did enjoy that movie. It is really shame that pretty certain we are not getting more. I mean there is a lot worse movies which get sequels.
---
My first maxed out character. Nostalgia
---
Want to get agility enchants? Hope your enchanter has grinded Timbermaw reputation.
---
Want to get that sweet FR tank gear or Nightfall? Hope your guild blacksmith has farmed up that Thorium Brotherhood reputation.
---
Want to clear Molten Core? You need people that are at least honored with Onyxian Waterlords.
---
Want to get some PVE BiS as well as some good non-raid epics? Get exalted with AV rep.
---
You need people to grind the hell out of insects in order to get Brood of Nozdormu reputation if you want to see the gates of AQ opened. AQ40 trash and bosses give Brood rep, and you need that if you want to get AQ40 tier gear and for that sweet rep ring as well.
---
Want those BiS CC rep items like Earthstrike of Rockfury Bracers? Grind up that Cenarion Circle reputation. By the way, you'll also need that reputation in order to turn in the AQ20 gear tokens. Did I mention NR gear? NR gear recipes are also locked behind CC rep.
---
Want to step in Naxxramas? You need to be at the very least honored with Argent Dawn, but you'll want to be Revered if you don't want the attunement to cost you an arm.
---
Want to use another race's mount? You'll need to be exalted with them.
---
Think zygor is making one
---
Wow isnt a singleplayer game.
---
Well, thankfully in classic that wont be possible. Can only have one faction per pvp server :)
---
Gotta work that virtual money maker, [**iYKwIM**](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=iYKwIM)
---
But if you’re using it to go AFK it’s perfect.
---
Also pickpocketing is showing to not be as lucrative as pservers. Rogue diaries sell for a fraction of the price on classic compared to pservers.
---
Since when has that stopped people from making claims around here?
---
What? Druids are by far one of the best herbalists.
---
Root, hibernate, travel form, self heals, cat prowl.
---
AH magnate.
---
Id love to roll enha but all redditors tell me it isnt good. What do you guys suggest me?
---
1hr cd so it's not super useful
---
Tauren Druid. Because back in 2006 it was my first character I created and still my main 13 years later. I have played almost every single class on max level content but I always return to play druid. And when ever we try new MMO I always Google first "what class is like wow druid". I just have fallen in love with that class.
---
Sounds fun. I'll check it out!
---
Here, look at my comment. Pretty sick right.
---
Spent weeks deciding what race for Shaman.  After probably months of tedious deliberation my old wow guildie said hes coming back...and hes playing alliance exactly like he did before.  Now I dont have to go and do the same...but I do....  
---
So Human Warrior it is
---
Yes there are.
---
Yes. Pick something new.
---
I don't understand the if nil then, I am clueless in Lua but doesn't that mean that the first condition would never be interpreted?
---
Mage/rogue perform well with minimal time investment.
---
I was so hyped about playing enh shaman but literally every reddit elitist tells me to roll anything else. What do you guys thing, will i really not be able to find myself a guild and be in a raid team as an enh sham? Im so hyped about it and now im kinda sad everyone tells me to reroll, i love the immersion and the fantasy that spec brings
---
&gt; Layer jumping
---
Timer on hopping layers.
---
&gt; Hunter solo farming Dire Maul Tribute
---
Not an exploit.
---
&gt; Mafia-like groups hoarding black lotus
---
Not an exploit. Potentially x-faction collusion though.
---
I think he's referring more to percentage drop quests. If you played horde, you might recall there's a quest in shimmering flats where you had to kill scorpions for their tail or something like that. Now you only needed 8 I believe, but the best bit? The drop chance barely scraped 1%. I had the luck of finishing it in 3 hours, my friend took 9.
---
Alliance player rates drop to 0% after reading this.
---
I have the opposite problem. All my wow-playing friends are hardcore to the point of taking long vacations to play wow. 
---
Making plans on how to keep up with them by choosing easier classes/builds, but you know.... real life is kinda fun too :(
---
What you talking about, rogues don’t attack warriors
---
Looks like Zygor's will be coming out soon, nice!
---
In the video it states that the closer to level 20 you learn the pre-20 spells the less the spell power penalty will be. Does that mean that if you wait to level these spells until after level 20 there is no penalty?
---
You jelly?
---
No, it’s the level that they become available that counts. You are not the first to comment on this, so maybe the phrasing in the video isn’t optimal. But the level that you actually train the rank has no effect on how it scales, only the level when you CAN train it.
---
I played priest in a pretty hardcore raiding guild back in the day, from early vanilla to end of wrath.  I’m not sure why or how, but I never really down rankled my spells as I didn’t see the need to; rarely have I ran out of mana, and I’m always one of the lowest in terms of overhealing.
---
Luckily Horde this is pretty easy. Our plan (we have all races in our group) is to first level to starting zones and after that's done we all meet at crossroads. All Horde races have very easy way to get there (compared to that night elf running hahah).
---
They are not going to let anyone get rank 14 without having to actually play battlegrounds, that won't be vanilla like, classic would be a complete joke.
---
The attack range is huge tho =/
---
WoW is a timeless game.
---
I miss the old WoW T-shirts, my favorite was a silhouette of male orc warrior with a dozen arrows in him  
---
"Tanks..  
---
..  
---
You're Welcome"
---
Then all I can say is well played! If you managed to keep your raid alive, top healing meters and keep low overhealing without any form of downranking you did a great job!
---
Just poppin in to say this is whack
---
Now That’s What I Call Bad Advice
---
I don't know why but my friend had character named "Madmoose" back in Vanilla and he was forced to change his name..
---
I just bought Final Fantasy VII from Steam sales. That will keep me busy for a while.
---
Maybe all my memory stemmed from when I was geared enough not to bother too much about mana. I guess I could use some tips early on.
---
Hmmm I don’t remember pulling a rogue
---
Filthy greenskins
---
You can mine bloodstone's up to 75
---
My battle station is setup, but im most happy is i have my sons Battle station for his bday ready at the office. he will be getting it in early september for his 11th birthday im going to journey through azeroth on an alt.
---
It changes a lot with gear, how big your mana pool is and how good the raid dps is. With amazing dps, the fights never last long enough to make mana an issue.
---
[Totem twist chain healer](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMZVcxkmxa) - needs a bit of mp5 before it works

Umm if they wanted free advertising they would've invited more people too... What if they actually invited the amount of people they needed for testing purposes and threw in a couple dozen streamers for the advertising? I know, such a mind blowing concept.
---
Or you could try something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Keyboard-Portable-Professional-Industrial-Computer/dp/B071ZZ5G5Q)?
---
I am, i will be leveling multiple alts to 35 plus if they go higher im not going to complain ill use them for my friends.  Main account is going to have a warrior main, druid alt. 2nd account will have a mage and hunter all going to 35 by phase 3.
---
Unless they are in T2, than i cant find better class to counter warlocks
---
the simple equation for downranking;
---
choose the lowest rank spell that still shares the same cast time as your highest rank spell.
---
ie;
---
lightning bolt rank 1 cast time is much quicker than the final rank.
---
alternatively, rank 4 all the things.
---
Yeah I warned my wife... She didn't take it too well. Lol
---
Hey guys I'm looking to duo with my sister as a warrior and her running paladin. I'm expecting to have more play time than her so I'm curious how being a few levels higher will impact our experience leveling. Should I just work on professions if she's not online? Would it be worth it to level a farming alt?
---
These specs suck
---
Yes
---
That is the vanilla equivalent of #showtooltip. That line tricks the addon Super Macro into showing that spell instead. It never actually casts that spell. I have more info on it if you check out my YT channel.
---
You are afk anyway
---
Oh okay. But the classic wow will have the newest UI ami won't it?
---
Yep! Anything in italics is for Vanilla only, no need to worry about it in classic
---
Aasnt that far off if I recollect and the gotta know making a Arthas trilogy would sell like hot cakes in comparison to the story they picked
---
Can't wait to go back to playing on these old zones restored to their former glory before they got ruined in Cataclysm.
---
You being gay doesn’t mater in this situation. And I googled Female Pandaren and found mostly transmogs. The rest being screenshots, NPCs, and the rare transmog.
---
And the porn community doesn’t mater. If it did NES and Draenei alone would make WoW rated AO.
---
I'm pretty sure you can have enemy cast bars in classic. There was an option for them during the stress test.
---
I’m gonna have to disagree and say it’s da best
---
That is a good rule of thumb, but it is not true for all spells. 
---
In terms of DpS that won’t be very effective since the max rank will always do more damage. You should rarely downrank damage spells, unless its the spell effect you are after (slow, stun, etc), you are OOM or you just want to finish a low hp mob off.
---
Strange to rate Druid, Shaman and Paladin so low IMO. If you're a casual who wants to solo with minimal hassle, the self-healing hybrids are all awesome.
---
OP is fine with lock or mage though.
---
You need to FT attitude boyo. Your le’reddit is spilling out all over the place
---
Would rather an enhance or elemental shaman than a ret paladin. 
---
Even if one does find a raid spot, they'd probably unironically use sanctity aura.
---
They're in Classic.
---
&gt; that thingy next to your map that tells if you completed all the questlines in your area 
---
Never heard of this, so I'm fairly certain the answer is no.
---
Vanilla STV questing with a Thunderfury and Drac Def, sounds like this guy played during Vanilla for sure.
---
Travel form is only 40% move speed so slow... Someone did the math and it was something like if you take less than 25 steps then travel form is better.
---
Thank you for making such a great meme! Keep them coming!
---
Tree form, was it in classic?
---
The only class Druid might beat in solo play, is Rogue. Paladin and Shaman can't really solo a lot of content.
---
If you’re not ahead of the pack then it won’t be that viable.
---
1. any idea of what the timer is ? 5 min. would be way too short etc.
---
2. i beg to differ, it does affect server economy negatively afterall, disabling it after release would be an issue but disabling this "exploit" prior to release would only serve to stabilize it.
---
3. actually its an exploit to the extent where it made blizzard rethink herbalism for TBC... Fel Lotus in its first form before official release was a herb by itself but it was reflected upon based on the black lotus and thus was made rng drop from other herbs instead...
---
private servers fixed this issue by taking the 1 hour static spawn and the scarce amount of spawn spots and simply gave it alternating rng spawn timer for example roll between 40 to 80 min. after being looted and multiply the spawn spots. This would prevent both spawn logging and the desire to layer jump for it, even if it has a timer people will try to layerjump for lotuses.
---
Lol
---
Joanna gonna make bank on his guides on launch.
---
Totem Twisting without Totemic Focus seems rough.
---
Well I'm sharing this to all the discords I'm in. Thank you for this!
---
adding heroic modes/hard modes of existing dungeons is not “more content”
---
Pretty much
---
I have no idea what content you're talking about that priests and rogues can solo that paladins and shamans can't. They're not hunter/warlock/mage tier but being able to heal yourself alone is enough to be able to solo quite a lot of Elite quests.
---
&gt; story
---
in Vanilla? What's that?
---
Isn't shadow a good farm char by itself?
---
Hi a quick question. Should you ever downrank priest bubble? Assuming the damage is always the reason it expires and not the time length.
---
I’m not sure if I missed it in the guide, if you covered it sorry to make you repeat yourself. Very informative stuff for the virgin vanilla healer.
---
(Was that in Classic? Think that's a TBC thing)
---
Welcome to modern raiding bud
---
Doesn't it also only affect base healing?
---
A shadow priest is a much better solo PVPer than Paladin or Shaman, they can kite a lot of elites.
---
And a rogue can solo A LOT of content that neither of those classes can. For one example, Plugger Spazzring.
---
Considering you get 5 weapon skill from combat tree, how great is it for rogues with going human? I was wondering because I think I read that skillcap was changed from pservers, but I've might be wrong. Is the 305-310 that humans get aswell a huge damage boost?
---
Excellent observation buddy.
---
Imma be so far behind the pack itll be possible for me though
---
Agreed
---
You can tank without issues up to the endgame dungeons (Scholo, Strst, Ubrs..). I guess you might even tank there with a good group, but PuGs usually expect a properly skilled tank at that point. It's more important to have the proper gear (a nice Shield and a 1h weapon that is properly trained (!)).
---
I spent a good hour trying to wall climb my way along those coastal cliffs as a ghost with no success. So I let the ghost die to fatigue in the water closest to the edge of Winterspring, spent another 30 minutes running my 2nd ghost back to that fatigued corpse location, rezzed, then drowned and was teleported to The Crossroads graveyard of all places. So, no luck on an easier way into Winterspring.
---
Yes level an alt. She might only want to play half or less as much as you so you'll probably quickly max out professions. Your 'alt' might even be higher level than your main.
---
Yep, it's garbage.
---
Fake undead
---
Thats why you gotta go hard so you can aoe.
---
I would not recommend downranking Powerword: Shield, that spell is one of the spells that has its own coefficient, if I remember correctly it is around 2% which means that lower ranks never catch up in neither protection value or mana efficiency. Besides, PW:S cannot overheal, (unless it expires to time) and thus doesn’t need downranking.
---
To be honest, PW: S is a VERY situational spell, which is rarely used in PvE, except when you know that the target is about to take massive damage. It is also very expensive in relation to how much damage it absorbs.
---
Not only are they in Classic, but they're in the Beta, which means they'll be available at launch.
---
Why would I be jelly of this mess?
---
We don't know yet but probably, and probably won't be restricted.
---
You've listed basically all the reasons why I love PvP Servers. World PvP adds a random element to my gaming experience I really enjoy.
---
I know I'll find myself putting more time into World PvP than any other aspect of the game. I've even stopped leveling for a week once because I kept having so much fun in Hillsbrad Foothills killing people.
---
There's definitely something to say when you and some friends have spent hours dominating a specific open world zone because you basically have secured it for your faction for a short time and it provides a sense of investment and pride that battlegrounds don't provide.
---
Warlock’s are monsters in TBC raiding for dps, I think hunters were second. 
---
Mages were not on the same level.
---
Warriors were no longer the only real choice for tanking, Druids and Pallys were much more viable, I think pallys were great for aoe tanking? Idk
---
I don’t know on healers, I think shamans were the most coveted.
---
I didn't really change my mind as much as that a friend also decided to join me.     
---
My solo main didn't change and will be Hunter (as it always has been). But I 'changed' my main for duoing to a holy paladin.
---
I duno but this is actually a "misplay" if you wanna be super nerdy and technical (for pvp at least). Because you can't change direction for your blink until you land.
---
That’s not how that works
---
Played warlock back in 2005, but I played Shadow priest/Rogue/Pala and even feral on private 1.12 projects.
---
I do believe I will roll warrior/tank for this time, not sure why I want to stab myself in the eye and to fk myself over but yeah, looking forward to it.
---
I've been certain on shadow priest for about a month. I still don't know if I'll remain shadow at 60 or respec for heals. I still don't really know what my goals for classic are tbh. I guess I'll just play and see what happens as time goes by. That's if I even make it to max level haha.
---
I played warrior back in retail classic, have tried it on a private server too but not endgame. I could be wrong but it seems to me that the whole thing with warrior being such a huge pain to level is somewhat overstated.
---
 Today in 2019 we know a lot more about the game than back in the day. If you plan out your leveling, how to keep your weapon up to date it should be fine. Stuff like running Deadmines pretty early for Smite's Mighty Hammer or Staff of Westfall( which is a guaranteed quest reward and have extremely high damage for its level). Having either of those weapons early will actually make you very strong in PvE for quite a while. 
---
There is a gap in the mid 20:s where those weapons will start being outdated. This is where you can switch to running some dungeons, SFK, BFD, RFK, Gnomeregan. No difference if you are a hunter in a dungeon or a warrior, same leveling speed. Sure it will be some traveling time but being a tank you are not going to have trouble finding a group. From the info I have seen mobs in dungeons on the classic beta hits a lot less hard than on private servers as well. So can probably run the dungeons earlier than you think. Less exp than solo questing but you will get exp and practice tanking, getting to know people and building a friend list. Fine in my book. Some great gear as well in those dungeons if you have a little luck and get something like Strike of the Hydra or Corpsemaker you are OP again and can solo quest fast if you wish. 
---
Also I would have a bank alt and every now and then log in to check AH for cheap health potions etc. 
---
 Personally I am flip flopping a bit between warrior and warlock. Was first deadset on warrior, then warlock but now I'm not sure again. The supposed leveling difficulty of warriors isn't even a factor, something I take in consideration.
---
Imp WF totem seems like it's way less than 20 dps per melee.  it's 90 additional AP on WF attacks.  90 AP works out to 6.5 DPS if you applied the 90 AP 100% of the time.  But it only applies on those WF hits which would already be at +300ish AP.
---
Just curious, Mr. Galaxy Brain Skeptic Intellectual Fedora Lord (\*tm)

Not trying to ad-hom, I just never looked out of my window and saw your brain towering over the clouds and flowing out into space. Does the lunar cycle give you a headache whenever the moon is closest to earth and bumps into your cranium? Hey hope to hear back from you, have a rest after slaying /u/EveClassic with his philistine perceptions of controllers and keyboards(obviously he's not an atheist who appreciates intellectual fortitude), that troglodyte lacks NuAnCe and cLaSs.
---
As an unrelated note, if you can keybind a controller it would be fine for relaxing and leveling, probably a lot of people prefer it, and 6 year olds would probably benefit from using a controller more.
---
That's at best idiots trying to pad the meters, and hurting the raids dps in the process.
---
I mean, server first through fifth mages will aoe grind, after that it will turn into a shitshow that will take months to get better.

I hope that most of these people talking abou t

I’m resto druid and half of it is true :-)
---
Hunter/Warlock are the main dps classes. I don't know about healing/tanking sorry. I 'think' warrior is the best tank and all the healers are pretty good but I'm not that sure. You'll get a lot of advice if you ask at /r/wowservers because there's a very active TBC server atm.
---
I wouldn’t change the race you would be playing for MONTHS over a couple of crowded days. Just get ahead of the pack and once you get in the 10+ range if done fast enough you will be fine
---
Druid is by far the most formidable healer in 1v1, plus you can jump into WSG and be the star of the show.
---
It’s pretty much irrelevant. Past 10 you just go where you want anyway
---
There are no enemy cast bars in Classic. There was no option for it in the stress test.
---
Night elfs 100%
---
He asked which classes are easiest and hassle-free for leveling, not which classes have the strongest solo potential. Your list is useless for someone who isn't interested in fear-kiting elites, AOE farming or using stealth and CC so snipe 5-man bosses.
---
I think the threshold for using any aoe spell the mage has is 3 targets, hit 3 targets and it's more efficient that single target dps. The first mages to get ahead of the pack will probably be the first to hit 60 on their servers, but if you are behind you probably don't get to aoe grind very much.
---
Wat?
---
They were added with AQ but in Classic they'll be there from the start.
---
Yes, I played TBC. Why would I argue about this topic, if I didn't even play it? 
---
To me, the tbc heroics are the pinnacle with cata coming 2nd in 4.0, with 4.1 cata heroics were ruined. I don't agree, that tbc heroics were dull, I had a lot of fun there as the trash was already qutie itneresting and the bosses had decent mechanics. Granted, this may be nostalgia speaking. But I feel, the cata dungeons jsut don't quite reach that, they feel duller and the bosses despite more mechanics are much easier. I did quickly switch to doing the glory-achievements with cata heroics instead of just getting thorugh. In tbc and vanilla I enjoyed just getting through the dungeon (though of course there weren't any glory achievements). Wrath comes last, as doing the glory achievements was the only thing resembling a challenge there. I can'T say anything about MoP and later dungeons as I stopped playing in cata 4.1
---
Well, 2 and 3 aren't exploits by its definition but yeah, they're quite tricky for the economy to balance.
---
He has 4 monitors, one which is virtually useless because he wants to see the glowy parts of his PC. There are some conclusions about his intelligence that can be drawn from that, so I wouldn't expect him to know what determinism means.
---
Night Elf.
---
Rogue
---
Here's a [survey](https://i.redd.it/inis00ztt2o21.png/) that shows % of race/class combos. There was only 10k responses so it might vary a bunch when Classic actually releases but it gives us an idea.
---
Human - 43.13% of Alliance
---
Dwarf/Gnome - 33.71%
---
Night Elf - 23.17%
---
xDDD
---
warlock has longer downtime than mage?
---
It kinda is. If you're only lvl 15 after a month it's going to be fairly quiet zones. Obviously there's a few stragglers/rerollers/alts but it won't be packed at all.
---
Thats a good thing.
---
I think what he asked is up for interpretation, and I gave my interpretation.
---
Yea that’s just wrong lol
---
I agree, and I think your solution to realm "death" sounds fairly good as well.
---
PCT damages realm integrity. Each realm should be a discrete world.
---
Yet another layering topic. I am sure that Blizzard have determined the way that they're going to go, even if they are still tuning the fine detail.
---
Ofc, but that's what the totem weaving is for. You place the windfury totem =&gt; buff for 9 seconds =&gt; in this 9 seconds switch the windfury totem with the agi totem =&gt; just before the 9 seconds end, switch to the windfury totem =&gt; repeat
---
With this you and your group get windfury AND the agi buff most of the time
---
how much btc we talkin?
---
Human Warlock, PvP server, fuck meta, fuck racial abils, fuck everything. I want to be a badass dark mage who melt faces. Fear immunity?I'll Make a build to compensate that. Problems with PvP? I'll get alchemy and cooking to be stronger. Still problems? Coop with some rogue to pwn horde together. What am I saying... numbers are boring. Go agains odds, have challange, have fun. Being the most meta pick is boring and useless, if you not having fun. 
---
Be who you want to be. Overwhelm, dominate. Just like a real warlock would have. Seriously, you want to be some silly gnome? Play who you want.
---
Mobs spawning every few seconds is the lesser evil?
---
Thanks for that link. It pretty much answers my question!
---
true, but if they where solved it would mean a more overall stability for the servers economy and especially if we consider the layering which would add a lot more entries to the auction. The existence of the hunters "exploit" would lead to rising prices while the existence of the black lotus as long as their cd is static and predictable would mean manipulation of the prices.
---
There's little to no solo content at 60 cap in vanilla.
---
Yeah that rogue is dead against a TF warrior with tier gear
---
* How do you offer that rig :(
---
Wait, was it common for people to actually have enough for mount when they dinged 40? I guess I'm bad with money too. When I hit 40, I went to Tanaris and killed scorpions and hyenas for hours right outside Gadgetzan, just to sell the trash/BoEs that dropped to a vendor for gold. I think I had hit level 43 from doing nothing but that grind before I had enough to get my mount lol.
---
I did that quest and the raptor one at 30 cap...fucking awful finding those panthers
---
I believe it's much easier to make friends in classic than retail, for the simple reason that you do so much better if you cooperate than you would on your own. Also a lot of classes can depend on others and excel from it.
---
oh ok, sounds like youll go oom very fast lol
---
0.000091
---
Compete by who can press shadow bolt better?
---
Yes, I changed my mind.
---
I am a heavely rogue fanboy, and I am still questioning myself if I really am doing myself good by changing main.
---
I am planning to play warlock instead. It will still be the same race as I love the undead atmosphere and lore.
---
I was searching some information about vanilla locks and found many ways to build "your" character, many ways to be strong in both pve and pvp. Having a burning mount that many others will not have is a plus.
---
The only thing that frightens me is the soulshards. But I might be able to mix this when I go farm for mats.
---
I'd argue that rogues are the hardest to level.
---
And blizzard let a tv series go with game of thrones....
---
I might be wrong but I think a big part of why it won’t be worth doing is because you can’t relog and respawn at the entrance of the dungeon in Classic as opposed to private servers. Meaning you have to die and spirit run back every time you’ve killed the 4 lasher packs. The graveyard for Dire Maul isn’t that close to the entrance.
---
the movie was really cheesy but i still enjoyed it, especially the fx
---
5-8 isn't gonna work in classic if they don't fix the extendo range on melee from moving.
---
Isn't prospecting jewwlcrafting. So something that is not in classic
---
you make sense more than the rest love it
---
/r/woooosh
---
Kind of. It doesn't activate when the rogue is back pedaling which he will be in 5-8. It will work okay, but not perfectly.
---
Remind me August 22
---
Yup. Warrior or Warlock. The sad thing is I think I would second guess my choice no matter what I rolled. Warrior is so rewarding to gear up and also you get to build up a friend list for dungeons quicker playing as one. Tanks are always in demand for dungeon running. Nice to tank yourself as well so you can set the pace and you feel more involved, it's a more rewarding role. Also if you get into a good raiding guild the dream is of course to get some crazy gear which will feel amazing. Getting a new weapon on a caster don't compare to getting one on a melee class.
---
 Warlock on the other hand, better for world PvP, easier to find a raiding guild, for me the most fun caster class, very involved with tons of keybinds and having a pet brings another aspect. The downside is dungeon running being a dps having no control when running dungeons, frustrating if the tank is a newer player or an ass. Also if you get into a good raid guild once you see something like BRE, Dark Edge of Insanity etc I would probably wish I was playing a warrior and had a chance to get it.
---
I was trying to be extremely generous with that estimate.   WF will also proc on special abilities as well.  A combat rogue for instance is probably hitting a boss with his main hand about every.. what GCD?  
---
94.5 AP/14 AP/dps * 2.4 sec = 16.2 dmg
---
WF proc is 20%.  
---
1/5 * 16.2 dmg / 1.5 sec = 2.16 dps
---
Hmmm...  did I do something wrong?  It's been awhile.   But this is 10x worse than I thought, lol.
---
Cool my first woosh
---
/r/thatHappened
---
Help them 5man with all those purps
---
M'lady
---
just because your camera is 4k doesnt mean the game is bro. what retard takes pic with his phone?
---
Hunter, rogue, pally in that order
---
All depends on if you have guild help
---
Ive levelled a few warriors (5 or so), the sweetspot is level 30 indeed. Sweeping strikes and zerker stance is godlike. 36 it gets better and 40 onwards is the most fun class (imo) :)
---
whats that supposed to mean??
---
Except thats borderline impossible without fuckoff Disney money. Shit takes wayyy to long and is too expensive at that quality.
---
Oh by the way you mentioned throughput at some point. If you haven't played classic before it's natural to assume that healing works similarly to modern WoW but that's not the case.
---
Throughput isn't a big focus in classic unless you're a Druid because all your healing spells are way overtuned, so you actually need to down rank to avoid overhealing people.
---
Unless you're a Druid there's just no point in piling on more scaling because you don't need it.
---
And regarding what to do without imp. HW, in 40 man raids you cast LHW. A lot. LHW ranks 4 and 6 plus CH rank 1 make up probably 90% of your casts in 40 man raids.
---
I'm not sure that's right.  
---
You're converting the 6.75 dps to damage per hit, then relying on the ICD and 20% proc rate, but that relies on having an instant attack every GCD to use, which isn't the case for rogues and may not be the case for warriors.  It also ignores the fact that auto attacks can also proc it.  
---
I think it's easier to just say you're getting 94.5 AP on 20% of your attacks, which is basically what's happening compared to just having untalented WF up.  Working out to 18.9 AP on average per attack gained.
---
I have to be that guy, but can I give some feedback? The blurry background game play is distracting. It feels like I forgot my glasses or have something in my eye.
---
Hardcore guilds will. And it also depends on your personal preference to aesthetics and performance.
---
People will give you stories about how in vanilla it wasn't the case, but the simple reason for that is, that priest racials and the overall effect of racials wasn't discovered until several months in. I don't even know how long it took to discover that the weapon skill racials are extremely strong on melees. On character creation people only had, what was written and didn't know how useful that all would be. Priest racials aren't seen at all at character creation. So, most people just picked the race they found most aesthetically pleasing, which means dwarves are at the lower end of the spectrum. By the time it was discovered that only dwarves had fear ward and how useful it would be in raids, characters were already 60 and raided a bit. Levelling up the same class again just for the a racial is not something any but the most hardcore would consider and it would take a while. So, most people just rolled with what they've got.
---
This is different now. Everybody, who spends some time with classic before creating a character will know that dwarves are the best priest race and night elves are the worst. Everybody who wants to play melee on alliance will know that humans are the best race and every horde warrior will know orcs are the best race. It's fair for hardcore guilds to expect people to take those advantages instead of the aesthetics of another race they prefer. It's also fair for people to specifically choose a race, because of the racial bonus.
---
So, yes, if you wnat to raid hardcore, expect to be a dwarf. But, the story here still makes no sense, as less hardcore guilds will happily take laong any priest, no matter the race. In the end, it's your decision, whether you dislike the dwarf looks so much, that you'd accept losing a very important ability or dislike the human looks so much, that you'd accept losing 3% hit chance.
---
People also always bring the argument, that you only need 1-2 dwarf priests in the raid. True, but more fear wards don't hurt and it's also a question of, do you want to be one the priests who can't bring a fear ward?
---
Although i wouldnt count on a level 30 ww axe in classic. There wont be level 60 friends to help out ;)
---
&gt;  It also ignores the fact that auto attacks can also proc it. 
---
I am not ignoring that.   I am saying on avg specials + autos is about 1 per second.
---
You are clearly just the alt of the other idiot that doesn't have a clue wtf they are talking about.
---
I dont think you could go from a PvP to PvE server and vice versa in vanilla, as doing that i s a bit unfair to PvP server players.
---
Also realm transfers will likely exist but possibly only from later on.
---
better yet, check which intel graphics you have and there is likely youtube videos with gameplay on those integrated graphics. Looks like you may be good. Mine looked worse than the video w/ the same integrated graphics for some reason. I think it's because I have an i3.

---
It’s definitely not faster. Uploading a photo on reddit takes about ~10 seconds with my phone. Print screen requires me to crop the picture since it captures all 3 of my monitors, and then go to the right reddit sub, ...
---
I'm planning to level with a good friend of mine. Good player, but I'm not sure he will go as hardcore as me on the leveling/gearing phase. 
---
So I will just create a second character I can play with whenever!
---
Thanks for the info, but that's so sad :(
---
I think they're useful for raids, just not engaging to play in raids. Innervate-bots, brez, moonkin aura (if they're daring enough to spec into it), etc. are all great to have but don't really scale with gear. Meaning even when you get better gear, it's not like you're contributing anymore to the group as a druid. Which also means you're less likely to receive gear in the first place when it could be going to a priest, paladin, etc.
---
Clearcasting was in classic, yeah.
---
It's not like there's going to be many servers to choose from.
---
I’m literally watching an asmongold reacts video right now. Fml.
---
Me too
---
I have that one! I think I got it from J!NX
---
I would punch his annoying face for no reason and I'm not even a violent person. Get this cringe outta my face please
---
You should expect a higher consumable cost for yourself as a warrior later on as you will need rage potions &amp; other things as well as a mount which she will gain a massive discount at.
---
I would recommend proffesion focus if not an alt.
---
the only relevant metric. player participation.
---
on RP-PvP servers you'll have plenty of PvPers who have no real interest in RP at all.  
---
you will also get people who will enjoy ruining others RP experience.
---
the rare occasion of real PvP battles and flawless execution of RP events does not outweight the rest.  
---
blizzard agrees as it seems.
---
don't be mad at me. it was not my choice to make.
---
But ya boy knows what's up though
---
Are you 100% sure, we'll get the old system instead of the 1.12.1 riding skill system?
---
I should edit it, the ability to open the launcher for Classic but not a invite when i launch it say no servers available.
---
[More like](https://imgur.com/b8thZWc)

Most people do that. Just do it before lvl40
---
Excellent! I'll see you in Azeroth
---
True, but I suggest the youtube comments, I just found the video.
---
yup. Power infusion spec + holy nova and some holy boosting talents would do it. You'd have to sit around and wait after every pull because PI has a 3 minute cooldown.
---
Seems like it on retail.
---
Undead scum.
---
Most warriors won’t roll tanks. People tanking 5-mans often have no interest in tanking raids. They usually go dps by then.
---
I bet you will have a much better time running around with your bear that you like and want to play as.. than a human prot warrior you dont find intresting.. You might end up bearly being able to find motivation playing the warrior.. imagine every druid loot drop that you couldve had but wont since youre not playing bear.
---
ps Im going fury/prot warrior. dont take my loot, go bear 😊
---
Hating that mich someone you don't even know. You must have a wonderful life! :)
---
I think pictures of dollar signs would be more accurate.
---
Agree. Moon was an excellent surprise to me, but he didn't write it.
---
I still in doubt, is this was the right thing to choose a "cartoonish" style in modern WoW. I never considered WoW a game for kids back then, it got pretty pointy models and all that, but it felt good, models was bad, but bad at some sertain point to not be a problem. Visual effects were colorfull, juicy and grotesque but realy pretty and simple. It felt right for some reason. 
---
Today I go to Nazjatar and I see a pixar cartoon. Yeah, it is good looking and pretty, but something is wrong. It feels not right for some reason. I look at shadow bolt and instead of silly flying scull I see just some spell with purple and green dots. Instead of priests shadowform I see some purple smoke around character. Yeah, there is sertain improvements, for exanple, water elemental is super awesome and looks exactky like it should, but other ones... voidwalker with abs. Why? Why it looks so distant from the original? Why they chose to change his eyes to look different?
---
Bah, I dont know... not all nee models are better. They got more polygons, beter textures, but some spells and models are too far from their original desighn phylosophy.
---
You're the bomb!!!
---
Even if he doesn't, why are you rubbing his nose in it?
---
It's as i said. If you are in a decent guild the professions will sort themselves naturally. It all stems from min maxing. Casters going tailoring for truefaith/bloodvine/archmage etc. Enchanting is the only hard one as it usually boils down to priests foregoing engineering and losing out on sapper/chicken/nade/reflector/dragonling etc because its the least impactful out of the raiders.
---
There is no "Spell power" in classic, only from wrath. In classic there are only spell damage and spell healing.
---
Do you plan on twinking your druid or something? You don't really need to grind pummelers if you're just leveling up to 60, you will eventually replace it later on its only BiS for a while.
---
I didn't understand the joke where lothar pretends to help up khadgar in karazhan, is that british humor or something?  It just made him seem like an asshole
---
It's a bit worse most of the time but 'incredibly disadvantaged' is pushing it.
---
In bgs you try to mostly fear the non-undead when possible, play with the group more etc. You also have paladins and fear ward on your side. In premades you are actually better off as alliance if anything.
---
So you, like everyone else can install ”Classic”. Not ”Beta:Classic” 
---
Too many people are being bamboozled by being able to install the game already.
---
beautiful quote :)
---
Your answer interests me. Which spec for pally?
---
I too don't have the time I had 15 years ago to fully raid. I want to pick up a class and stick with it. I love paladins (never had one in classic) and I love healing.
---
My plan is to have a paladin, solo quests, heal in 5 man, get the class dungeon set, play the AH.
---
You think a 31p holy paladin with the rest in Ret should do the trick? Or should I go for just a more hybrid specc?
---
Would love to do some non serious raiding if I ever had the time.
---
I remember you couldn't transfer from a PvE server to a PvP server for obvious reasons but I think it was possible to transfer from PvP to PvE.
---
as a warrior? i doubt :D
---
No need to throw personal insults around.
---
Which is why they should not have strayed from the lore. The original story was great from the get go, and the movie could have let the horse win rather than go towards the ‘cliche’ route of good guys always win. That would have made the story in itself unique and stand out against other movies out there. 
---
The movie should have ended with remnants of stormwind reaching the shores of Lordaeron, with castle just on the horizon. The sequel could have started off the story of Arthas.
---
The story was just directionless. I usually cannot forgive movies who stray too much from source material, but this one really takes the cake.
---
Yes I have. It's only very recently that I've managed to make up my mind (atleast for the time being). I'd like to try a new class so I will be maining a ret paladin trying to make it work and hopefully playing with chill people. Alt will be a night elf hunter, because I love night elves and I have to have atleast one nelf character.
---
Lets just say this: if a raid group could, they would take only fury warriors as dps.
---
thx
---
their*
---
Just get vanquisher blade and sword of omen. Sure whirlwind axe is neat but what good is 3.8 attack speed when you miss, parry, dodge DIE. id rather hit five times as fast and miss two attacks than to experience that shit show again.
---
If you are going to end with engineering I would suggest not leveling blacksmithing. It is very expensive so you will end up draining your resources while leveling up on blacksmithing and then need to spend a ton of time and money to do engineering later.
---
Also unless you are in a guild that is going to prioritize you getting hand of rag it is unlikely you will get it as a pally. Most of the time warriors will get priority. The drop rate from rag is very low so it isn't like it will drop each week. Best of luck.
---
It's just to make sure your auto shot starts even when you press those abilities on cooldown. But yes! Those two do normally start your auto shot. You might be right tho, I'll need to test this!
---
I was thinking a lot about troll hunter.
---
Then I realized I wanted to go melee and also played hunter before.
---
But then I realized I want easily access to raids and stuff - so  shaman. Can level as dps and go healer in raid.
---
But then I saw how boring enhancement was. 
---
I started checking out Tauren Warrior. Picking flowers and being a big Tauren tank.
---
But my friends suddenly wanna go alliance.
---
So I started to check out female dwarf warrior.
---
But nah, I dont want to run around as an ally warrior.
---
So maybe druid - read up on druid and all talents/abilities. Seems best at running away. I wanna fight head on. And if I go horde I dont want to go tauren druid.
---
I've played so much mage and rogue. But they have so much potensial, and look so awesome... Also I love priest, but done Vanilla and TBC as priest main.
---
And now... now Im just - whatever. Ill find out 27. August.
---
Lol, this makes me want to roll ne priest, what a bunch of losers

---
Looking for members to join for 5-man dungeon levelling. We already have two warriors, a mage and a shaman. Looking for a priest or warlock however any class should apply and we can discuss how we can make the group work.
---
Our plan is to commence levelling on launch and progress quickly in the first week of the server using dungeon levelling to maximise speed and avoid the large number of players in the open world. We consider this an interesting challenge and I’d love to chat with anyone who would like to do the same.
---
Because it's a terrible idea. I played on a few servers that had dynamic respawns and it totally destroys the game. It's impossible to solo a quest that is in a cave for example. When you're attacking a mob suddenly three mobs spawn behind you after 1 min and you're totally dead.
---
Destroys the economy since you can stand in one point and gather ore/herb and just tab in and out every 30 sec.

Layering cuts costs better.

Murder Everything is a guild returning to WoW Classic with people who played throughout Vanilla up to Cata on unofficial servers. We will be primarily PvE focused initially moving to a balanced PvE/PvP focus with the release of Battlegrounds. While all our current members are experienced, we welcome players new to WoW or transitioning from Retail to Classic.
---
Launch Plans
---
Several members have taken time off from work to experience the launch of Classic and intend on levelling quickly as a personal challenge. Other members are taking it slower and will likely takes weeks or months to reach 60.
---
If you are interested in power levelling a character during the first week of the server with experienced players send me a message. Especially if you would like to try dungeon cleave grinding from lvl 20. 
---
Progression Plans
---
Upon reaching 60 our progression plans are to clear through content with a dedicated raid team before opening raid lockouts to more casual players and alts. During progression our intent is to use loot council in order to improve the speed with which the guild is able to clear content. Once progression is complete, we plan on switching to a Suicide Kings system to help the more casual or time-poor players improve their gear.
---
PvP Plans
---
Our PvP plans are not developed at this stage. While we do have a member who spent two weeks at rank 14 in Vanilla it’s unlikely any of us will repeat this due to time constraints. That said, we will run organised BG groups once these are released and if you like the rest of what you’ve read and would like to manage a more hardcore PvP group within the guild I’d love to chat with you about it.
---
Guild Culture
---
Please note that guild chat and any guild comms will remain friendly, helpful and accepting of people regardless of difference. I’m here to play video games and will not be drawn into refereeing personal disagreements.
---
That's not how texturing in games works. You don't just make every texture in the game 4k resolution for 4k monitors.
---
In any decent raiding guild you won't see a shaman with mana tide totem. If you have enough shamans to cover melee then you might have 1 for the healer group but that's about it. Mana tide is a 2004 talent and imp wf totem is just the way to go now.
---
If you're struggling with mana just farm more demonic runes and come prepared. You'll do just fine.
---
if you intend to reach exalted with a faction to gain their mount i heavily recommend moving to their starting zone right away to level and aim for quests related to them since at higher level they will only grant a fraction of the rep. Cloth can then be used at the end.
---
blizzard replied in a comment that leeway works as intended, a while back, right? anyone have a link to that comment?
---
Whats the rotation? never played one in Vanilla
---
Anything but warrior.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
It's funny because a few months back people were saying the game would fail because of layering/sharding.
---
Amazing! I wish this in ultrawide resolution so I can set a background
---
I keep going back and forth between Priest and Shaman. I feel unstoppable as a shadow priest in WPvP, but had like 20g for my mount fund at level 40. At least with Shaman, I get ghost wolf form, and swinging a 2h axe sounds fun and appealing to me. Also being stuck with Benediction/Anathema for basically the entire game as a priest sounds unappealing to me. I might main a Shaman, then make a 49 Shadow Priest twink, but I'll probably change my mind again in a week.
---
This is my warrior Ieatrogues
---
I remember trying a Orc Warrior back in vanilla WoW. Said fuck that shit about 12 or so levels.
---
uhh it really didn't have anything to do with how good the tanks were, tank threat just didn't scale as easily as dps, you always needed to give the tank a couple of globals before you went ham regardless of how good a warrior was
---
You deserve a hug right now : )
---
In a dps context, yes. As for Mana efficiency, you really want 4+

Well, having played Druid and Rogue to 60 in both Vanilla and PServers, I disagree. But that's okay.

BC would be plenty challenging and fun with flying/dailies and other warts BC had.  BC had some issues but I preferred it over vanilla due to better class balance and smaller raid sizes.
---
Exactly. Some people seem to be wondering what PvE content should be added to classic to retain players while I know I will do wild pvp 90% of my 60 play time because it's such and endless content generator !
---
Also, you can organize PvP events such as duel tournaments and RP-PvP adventures, while the same with PvE isn't really possible.
---
Yea sure, but this was the case in vanilla as well, and I happily AOE leveled my alt mage. So unless the server caps are massively increased (or I guess, layer size.. bleh) I dont see why it would be different.
---
&gt; Paladin ... can't really solo a lot of content.
---
They have plate and three life bars, not to mention HoJ/Flash Heal. For levelling purposes they are great soloers.
---
the WW weapons are effectively a level 35 blue.  
---
getting tham at 30 means they are like an epic to you.
---
if you have good weapons for a 30 you can skip the quest until later and do it once you reached the appropriate level to solo the stuff except Cyclonian.
---
if you are a lucky and get a nice 32-37 blue drop, random or instanced, you don't even need it at all.
---
You shouldn't. But still impressive.
---
Warlock is almost as good as Hunter for leveling with pets to tank and fear to cc and drain life.
---
Druid is good because you can hot and bear form and you can stealth to avoid shit.
---
Paladin is slow but easy.
---
Mage is complicated but good at soloing stuff after you get aoe and kiting down.
---
My first play session will be with friends, after that its just too bothersome trying to match up playtimes without waiting on each other too much. If we are online at the same time and roughly around the same level Ill totally play with them though.
---
Savage
---
&gt; For levelling purposes they are great soloers.
---
Not when it comes to kiting.
---
Damn dude, do you even enjoy the game at all?
---
this hamstring kiting is not worth it while dual wielding. more so since retail has leeway and getting far away enought do dodge hits almost takes as long as your swingtimer anyways.
---
You got issues man, deal with them before it’s too late.
---
any healer can you just need to play the attrition game and outladt them. The higher level you get the harder itll get.
---
They'd have to increase the people working on the classic team by a lot if they're going to start making big changes to the world and the content. Right now it's a small team ticking off checkboxes.
---
The sad thing is how different tanking is in 5 mans and raids.  I love tanking 5 mans and having to be more aware of what's going on with multiple mobs.  Tanking in raids is mostly gear, then single target threat generation.
---
!remindme 90
---
the forumla for mobs does not work this way. 
---
raid dps warriors put 3/5 into demo since their demo would then lower boss damage by arround 16%. thats huge.
---
Why would they "fix" an intended feature, listen to yourself man.
---
someone mentioned that, if you have your farmer and an alt in the same group (have a guildy invite you characters), you can reset the dungeon from your alt and you get put at the entrance
---
Well let's hope the layers have been turned off by a month! :D
---
But anyways, I think when people speak of AoE levelling, they imagine having 0 competition at all for the most efficient mobs. This simply won't be the case unless you're one of the first ones to level to 60. There will always be times where someone swings by and have to tag some of your mobs. So either you have to go to other spots that are less efficient, or you have to deal with a little bit of competition. Both options still allow you to AoE farm, however it's not the idea of "AoE farming" that most people have, to my knowledge.
---
I never said not to take Arms up to tactical mastery, and improved charge. That puts you starting Prot at Lvl 22.
---
Even still you can just charge&gt;thunderclap&gt;change stances if you are facing melee.
---
This... You learn how to play a tank, by actually doing it and having someone help you figure what you're doing right/wrong.
---
I mean i've always advocated for the genocide (Really, is killing undead genocide when you think about it?)  of the undead, i've legitimately never seen a convincing reason that horde would accept the forsaken into their midst in the first place- would you really be down with being friends with the same creatures that nearly ended existence only a few years previous in the wc3 story?
---
You sound too weak for the internet...
---
Shaman can solo almost every elite quest up to late 50s with earthbind totem kiting and searing totem dps, plus rank 1 frost shocks if needed
---
Eg you can solo the giant ape in STV or the elites in 1k needles
---
Drop that autistic twitch chat bullshit here please.

---
“The bulge is back” my be my favorite quote to date
---
But i plan on pveing :( i will just casually pvp
---
This is just, to ensure your autohits start regardless of the ability beeing off cooldown or not. If you use one of those macros as your opener, you don't want to stand around doing nothing while waiting for the actual ability to be ready.
---
Also judgement of wisdom for alliance. Wanding/Auto-atk for manas cause balance.
---
Hell yeah, I'd probably play classic on a controller for the most part too. I'm not pretending that my argument isn't a "well technically" because it totally is. Of witch the dude could have easily said but instead insisted that "well technically" they were accurate. 
---
It's reddit, people see a reply and ride for war and that doesn't make me unreasonable, it makes the person replying to me defensive. On a side note though, thank you for building my shitty argument that 22 button not as many button as possible button as some epitome of neck beard, it's an amusing take.

Once you get to STV it becomes clear that rogue is a top pick. Hunters get savaged out there lol rogue has evasion gouge poisons sprint and vanish (if you don't just straight murder whoever fights you). 
---
Basically it's not possible to die if you're a decent player.
---
 Í'm currently thinking of rolling Warrior, Rogue or Mage.
---
In Vanilla I rolled a warrior because I wanted to be a tank. I didn't know how to get the most out of the class and had some bad tank experiences. In TBC I mained a Mage and stuck with it as main as of today. Rogue is the one class I never leveled.
---
So for classic I'm rolling Alliance, because I always played Horde and want to experience the story from a different perspective.
---
I don't know whether to stick with the class i know (Mage). Or to try tanking again (Warrior) or to go for the complete new experience by leveling a class I didn't level before (Rogue).
---
In endgame I would like to do some casual random BGs, tank/dps in 5-man dungeons and now and then dps in a raid.
---
For Mage I like the ability to grind and make money more easily than the other classes, also the mobility is a great bonus. I only don't like the armor sets in classic for a mage at all.
---
For Rogue I like the stealth ability and world pvp, also the pickpocketing and lockpicking is a great way to make some extra cash. I'm not sure if gearing up in endgame will be a struggle, since you have to compete with other Rogues/fury warriors for loot.
---
For warrior I like the tanking part in 5mans, getting into groups more easily and the gear looks much better then rogues/mages armor sets in my opinion. I don't mind the leveling grind. I'm worried about getting decent gear in endgame, competing with a lot of other warriors/rogues.
---
Any advice, or things I didn't think of?:)
---
The ones worth thinking about are engi (battle chicken squawk, sapper, cables, teleport, pvp stuff) blacksmithing if you plan to main tank there's an anti fear trinket (huge for horde since no fear ward) gathering its between mining and herb. Herb tends to be the most profitable but mining can occasionally beat due to less competition.
---
&gt;Legendary used to have an app where you could plug it into VR and fly on a gryphon 360. It was awesome

---
Stealth and invisibility are separate mechanics.
---
I am using my brain, have only 10 finger tho.
---
and btw marcos don't do any "thinking", are you high?
---
Why did we try to kill queen azshara? I know she was an older character in the lore but I can't remember what she did
---
I played Horde in Vanilla, Alliance in TBC, and Horde in WotLK
---
My guild is rolling Horde, many of my friends are rolling Alliance, so I'm torn.
---
But from a lore perspective, I really don't want to roll Alliance.
---
Sounds like you should go priest.  They have a decent tool kit even if you go healing spec.  You can do decent damage, dispel and heal.
---
First off, these situations are completely different.  Second, this is a good example of correlation does not imply causation.
---
I was horde for Vanilla....
---
 Think the majority of my RL friends are playing Alliance so I’m going to make the switch. 
---
“For the Alliance” just doesn’t have the same ring to it though 🤦‍♂️
---
If you're roguing correctly you're never in your right mind.
---
Is there an easy way to switch profession specialization? As in armorsmithing to weaponsmithing.
---
I remember the Darkmoon Fair npc being a thing but don't recall what patch it was added
---
These pets are sometime rebellious if you don’t give them heals. Some are pretty vulgar too.
---
Give us proof from these "groupers" then because I've seen multiple private server guild players on beta(including Ahmpy who is currently doing a 1-40 in 1 sit, who is 39 in 33 hours as hunter) saying outside of solo hunter and AOE mage, grinding instances will be utilized by every slower leveling class to hit their week 1 goals....
---
That's why you shouldn't go full AP as Enhancement Shaman, mind a bit of Spirit and MP5. Besides that, Mana consumables are really helpful.
---
There was a guide posted here like two days ago for enhancement shaman. It didn’t focus on DPS, but instead a hybrid of utility, capability of healing when shit hits the fan, and DPs. 
---
I wouldn’t expect to be doing AQ40 or Naxx as enhance, but I wouldn’t write it off if you can find a relaxed but talented guild. You will need to go above and beyond to make it work.
---
Irrelevant, but agreed.
---
Awesome! I use OBS as well, but I'm broke and use Shotcut for my editing.
---
I use Audacity for my audio, and then sync the video and audio together when editing. I find it's a lot easier to edit the audio and make it sound decent when I'm using Audacity, since it's designed specifically for audio editing.
---
If you can write a macro for something that normally requires you to make a choice and through that macro you eliminate the need to make that choice the macro is trivializing a situation where you would normally have to use your brain. That's not allowed.
---
chad vs virgin is probably my favourite ever meme format
---
You mean dwarfs then :)
---
Just shut it down.
---
This beta had too much success and people are calling the game dead because everyone stopped playing a friggin beta server. It's only doing harm at this point.
---
:( so not so casual friendly i guess. Im not that hardcore monster who farms 24/7 and a lot of people say that enh requires a lot of so called dedication which for them means 60 hours of bis farming per week. Im just sad that this community does not accept hybrids at all
---
Did he tho?
---
It’s slow but it doesn’t feel ‘hard’ or ‘torturous’
---
Thank you so much for this list. I have a probably stupid question: Do the Marcos for e.g. Aimed Shot work for all ranks or do I need to add the rank of those abilities to the macro?
---
Warrior is the closest.
---
&gt;Classic wow is about having fun in the world
---
Well, fun is relative, what if people don't find it fun to be ganked while questing? 
---
You can still pvp on pve servers aswell, in fact it might be a better experience because BGs at least almost always ensure its equal numbered teams.
---
I guess i just will never understand the need to put ppl down just because they roll on a pve server.
---
The front page of this site says; "World of Warcraft: Classic will be launching August 30th, 2019"
---
Did I really mess up my leave dates or do these dudes not know what they're talking about?
---
Drop that autistic twitch chat bullshit here, please
---
I'm pretty sure they'd approach it exactly the same way they approached Classic vanilla wow. Pick the most balanced patch and recreate it as close as possible without removing any warts or making perceived improvements.
---
There is a ton of shit in vanilla that is just bad design that could be improved to make the game better. People don't want that though, they want to play the game they fell in love with more than a decade ago and they want all the bugs, spell batching, and general imbalance that came along with it.
---
I'm positive if BC or Wrath comes in the future it'll be warts and all.
---
How is it a problem to have un human priest ? It's literally the best race for priest due to buffed spirit. What do you want, night elf priest so she can stealth ?!
---
Yeah, dwarf have fear guardian but we're talking about raiding ony here
---
Oh yeah for sure. I love helping people with this stuff, i live for it haha. Just comment on my videos or here on reddit and I should see it.
---
RemindMe! 27 Aug 2019
---
Exactly. Nobody cares. In fact, it’s likely you weren’t doing your job to the best of your ability if you were focused on charting instead.
---
I refuse to agree on this. This Bot clearly has a good understanding of quality comments and should be emancipated
---
In the last 1.5 years ive played every character on private servers to around lvl 40 to know which one i would roll when classic wow eventually releases. Sadly this made things more complicated for me cause i like all classes.
---
At first i was debating between a mage or a warlock. But now i am thinking about rolling a druid.
---
Gear overlap wouldn't be an issue for this method as you will be running there dungeons 50+ times each and everyone should get whatever drops they need by then and if not they should be geared well enough from the random green drops along the way.
---
M8 I hate retail and love TBC as it was. I think I’d be one of the people who gets triggered pretty hard and modern wow wouldn’t be a safe space for me. 
---
I am also one of the ‘most’ who wanted the challenge of classic back. You’re drawing a long bow with your sweeping statements. 
---
Think of it this way, would you like the level cap raised to 70 in classic with a dash of flying?
---
I bought a "You think you do, but you don't" shirt. I think that kinda counts. It's on spreadshirt USA
---
You can roll anything, but one of you will have to walk to the other guy if you want to level together.
---
Pick the class you like most thematically. Every class in vanilla brings something special and unique to the table, I found them all to be fun.
---
Yes they work for all ranks! That's actually a perk of having macros in vanilla. You dont worry about forgetting to put the new rank on your bar. I tend to do that a lot...
---
Loyal to Alliance
---
Another pleb that thinks damage vs humanoids is a great talent. Sure let me spend 3 talent points so that my aimed shot does 1030 damage instead of 1000, even less on other abilites.
---
No. Shamans are love, shamans are life.
---
pepehands
---
I thought its BIS because of the +hit? Do I rly need to have tailoring to make it work? Or what would be the better alternative? Netherwind robes doenst look stronger tbh but I could be wrong
---
Titans are connected to Arcane, not Light. Humans taught tenets of the Light to the Dwarves, which resulted in Dwarf Priests and Paladins.
---
Does anyone have a map of Teldrassil that shows the "zones" around each graveyard (Nighthaven, Dolanaar, Darnassus). I want to know where to die to get to each one reliably. :)
---
Wait you guys have friends? D:
---
But for real, I'll play with someone who's a lot more casual so the only thing that makes sense to me is to level a separate character. I mean sure you'll sacrifice server first 60 I guess but you won't miss out on any of the fun while still being able to go hard-core when the rest aren't in the mood to play.
---
Limited Invulnerability Potions and Free Action Potions. I should have left the S’s lower case.
---
That's for the epic
---
when you spend 1k on ram but you still upload a 240p video -.-
---
i've got some rgb ram myself but really who wants to look at it?....
---
If we are talking other than solo, you can also duo DM jump runs with a warrior for good gold.
---
Too bad you can’t play an Ogre.
---
Hi definitely rolling hunter. 
---
or warlock.. shaman looks fun too... or maybe mage....
---
definitely one of those four, unless i pick a druid...., I'm dad.
---
I gotta ask, because I'll never understand this new fad with having as many monitors as you can have. Why do you need 4 monitors?! I get that you can multi task easier, but damn, more than 2 is nuts.
---
lvl 40 is like 10g, iirc
---
if we get tbc/wotlk we will get them just as we are getting classic as it was.
---
Personally i think there is almost a zero chance of them adding new content to classic
---
Wow! 😍 Looks sick!
---
inject this into my veins 😩
---
12am is midnight :), 12pm is midday
---
No I mean getting camped by skull levels, getting help from your friends and guildies and starting a full pvp brawl isn't time lost. It's a social game remember.
---
Neither of these issues would be present with a properly implemented dynamic respawn. Dynamic does not mean it has to be instant, and even with hundreds of players in the same place I don’t think the respawn time should ever become instant or near instant. Furthermore, they could have the dynamic system be based off of the amount of players in a very specific area; so if there’s only one person killing many things quickly (aoe mage) this won’t trigger dynamic respawn. 
---
All dynamic means is that depending on the circumstance, respawn times don’t always have to be a full 5 minutes. Maybe it’d only be implemented lightly, where the fastest a mob can spawn (Outside of starting zones) is 3.5 minutes assuming there are 50+ standing within 30 yards or so, instead of 5 minutes. 
---
I like the idea of micro adjustments that make tagging mobs not absolutely cancerous on launch.
---
Check out Camelot Unchained. Leading it’s production is Mark Jacobs who was a former designer for DaoC. Some are saying it’s DaoC v2 but with some significant differences.
---
There’s also some DoaC private servers just FYI ;).
---
that isnt always true when it comes to the vanilla client since scorch stacks for example.
---
OP was actually very specific with the question.
---
I think you getting this idea wrong. All your friends and guildmates and rivals and community would be restricted to one layer. 
---
The difference is say maybe asmongold was on a different layer and one time you was able to visit him but then blizzard says his layer is full and you can’t switch to it, so you get use to not visiting his layer. It’s only then does that layer disappear altogether.
---
I have an unnatural addiction to dirty woman’s underwear. The color, the stains, the scent, the discharge, and mucus amplify and heighten my senses. I feel a tingling sensation all over my body as I’m fueled with anxiety and excitation of indulging in taboo acts.
---
I know it’s wrong. I know my mom would hit or disown me after realizing what I do. I was a sexually frustrated 13 year old, and it was the closest opportunity I had to experience anything sexual.
---
I still remember the first pair that I saw. I just looked at it from afar in the laundry basket: pink and blue stripes with a yellow stain. I got excited, and I touched myself in the bathroom. A week later, no one was at home, and I finally succumbed to my dirty thoughts; I hand one hand holding her panties up my nose/tongue and another down my pants.
---
Ever since, I have infrequently indulged on my urges whenever the opportunity arises. Once that line was crossed, I’ve had a hard time returning to my former innocent state.
---
Absolutely no chance.
---
&gt; I think most of the dev's and community agree's flying ruined WoW 
---
Baseless.
---
There is much higher chance of creating classic+ content, than doing nothing
---
Umm, a dwarf, because of fear ward? Which is by far better than a handful of points of spirit.

Dead set on shaman until I read this thread, now I'm think maybe I'd go alliance mage/warlock
---
Ah those cactus looking water drops!
---
&gt;Paladins can just walk up to otherwise problematic mobs or pulls and smash them with a hammer until they fall over.
---
Thank you for the giggles. If you had said "smash them in the face..." the it might have been a spit-take and you would have owed me a new keyboard. :D

---
Yes and no. Playing Paladin again so same main but new faction and I never played vanilla
---
I am kind of new to reddit, so I hope each of you get a notifications of this message. Thank you so much for your advice! I am going to roll a gnome lock and I think I will like it a lot :D The advice was very helpful! 
---
I think that pally will be a good fit for a friend of mine, he likes the more tactical and thinking what to do approach.
---
One more question. I am new and will only play 10-15h a week. On another thread I saw some huge cons being mentioned about pvp servers about griefing by speedlevelers, faction inbalance and just scummy players. I like the idea of pvp with meeting Horde players of the same level and duking it out some times or just helping them quest. But this whole 'survival of the fittest' power players ruining my playtime is less attractive. What so you guys suggest I do? 
---
Is it not too bad and just some people with sour experiences or should I just roll on a PvE server and keep pvp to BGs?
---
Again, thank you so much! And if Warlock does not work, I'll reroll a dwarf rogue :p
---
My first level 60. Yeah!
---
So sad Engineering is the best profession in vanilla, and LW doesn't do that much.
---
Here's the thing. Warrior is a super important class in end-game, especially with them being main tanking class. So having a painful and difficult leveling journey means those who DO make it to the end are much more likely to be good.
---
One of issues current iteration of Retail WoW has is its very easy to hit max level on a class without knowing how to play it. I have a max level monk, i have no idea how to play a monk. I just facetanked dungeons until i got to max level.
---
Is being a warrior impossibly hard? No. I got it to max in vanilla and i was a total noob back then. Is it harder than other classes? Yes. And that's a good thing.
---
8000 people will roll warriors, 6000 will make it to level 30, 2000 will make it to 50, 1000 to 60, and 300 of these will actively raid. Im okay with that.
---
If you dont want to play a hunter then the easiest other class will prob be a lock For my final decision though I'm gonna go with the best class fitting your requirements is the one that you find the most fun to play.
---
I met some of my best friends online, and they are now IRL Friends ! Don't give up and make real good friends online :)
---
If you are only playing a few hours you should consider not only what is good for solo but what moves quickly and is self-sustainable.  Mages have a lot of down time, paladins kill very slow.  Your best bet is lock as their health and mana gimmicks reduce down time.  Hunters still need to resupply a bit (pet food, water, ammo).  Druid wouldn't be bad but personally I think the warlock gameplay was more fun.

I think its fairly likely that arena pvp will come at some point. No reason not to add it really.
---
nothing of this has anything to do with "testing" the actual game.  
---
you are supposed to find bugs in a beta, not find new metas or do TCing. 
---
get real please.
---
time is money friend
---
Will be rolling a new class as Alliance. Probably a nelf hunter or druid. 
---
Absolutely loved horde and undead priest. And vanilla wow as such, were the most fun I ever had with wow. I get why people want to relive those good times, but I just can’t. It isnt the same; I did it and those great memories really cant be recreated - nor really do I want to.
---
Looking forward to a new experience with a new faction and class.
---
If you can find other 39 ppl that are okay with you being handicap and not being able to pull your own weight - go for it. Ofc, if you feel okay with being basically a worse everything compared to resto shaman or actual DPS class too.
---
What lore specifically are you referring to?
---
**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed/Thu/Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore |Point-based Loot Council
---
**TL;DR**:  Hardcore experienced, established guild seeks non-toxic, dedicated, competent raiders for Classic dominance starting with test realm practice &amp; preparation now. We most need Resto Shamans atm, but accept all great people who are willing to work to be their best.
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed Naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
**Raiding plans**: For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We are running two competitive raid teams both lead by experienced leadership and tanked by experienced main tanks.  
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed/Thu/Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops and early nights where possible. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Loot System**:  We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient).  The loot council is focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.

**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We expect competence and literacy with computers, google spread sheets, balancing individual schedules, and team communication.  We expect effort during, before, and after raids.  We expect serious practice on a guild hosted test server.  
---
We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
**In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.**
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  
---
We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
**Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.**
---
**Looking for**: We are seeking a few more Resto Shamans atm, but great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply.  Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within Epoch please send let us know and we’ll chat.
---
**Current Activity**:  The guild is practicing on our own test server to get the group reoriented to the old content and shaking the rust off.  We use the test raids for providing feedback, polishing raid skills, and determining and bolstering roster weakness.  
---
Currently, a sizeable portion of the guild is practicing leveling runs on pservers while a few are raiding hardcore.  We also have guild Jackbox party nights for fun while we wait for classic.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot our Guildmaster a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up our assistant GM on **discord:  XvK#7740**

Not as big of an issue as you would think. There is enough gear dropping to gear a full plate group if you grind instances. I am tesing this on beta right now. Obviously the first run-through of deadmines won't be enough to give everyone a smite's hammer, but overall your gear will be more up to date than if you where soloing.
---
You will be downvoted but I somewhat agree in some ways.
---
Flying I did not like (exciting at the time but that was the start of the backslide for me, even if the golden age of wow came towards the end of tbc and wrath). However the class balance is much better, too many DPS started getting self heals though as well. Having more raiding under 40 people was good too, and dungeon difficulty with how later dungeons matched to early dungeon heroics etc, all good.
---
If I could I would take the dungeon quality, class balance, and raiding options and mesh it into the vanilla game. Not sure what that frankengame would be but if play the shit out of it.
---
Ok, I see your point.
---
Dwarf Female Rogue gonna be my first char.
---
The "bounciness" of the dwarf female makes me happy.
---
The irony of a 12 year old kid with the username "manly_support".
---
Don't worry, kids like this will quit classic after a week or two and head back to Fortnite.
---
It’s ridiculous really. The humans of lordaeron literally rounded the orcs up and put them into concentration camps. 
---
It’s the equivalent of Israel taking in the Nazis because they had leprosy.
---
yeah, they announced they were going with the old one, since the new one was added to integrate flying into a unified system. Since flying will never happen in classic, they're sticking with the old system.
---
Let's be fair, we all hate layering, but they have to face the release and the unavoidable loss of players that is to follow.  
---
For the economy, it makes up for a very strange economy, but is it something that is going to be that painful really? If you have 4 layers, you have 4 times the resources, but also 4 times the players, so what is the deal with it?  
---
Of course different layers, different people, different scenarios, it might be that one layer is more dominant in devilsaur production, another with some herb stuff, but in the end of the day, is it really going to be that big of a difference?   
---
And it is just for 1 stage (hopefully).  
---
If it is taken away even on release, I would be super happy, the sh\*tstorm start is fun (even if just for a while), I would like to experience it.  
---
But am I gonna be mad if I have to survive some time with layers? I don't believe so.
---
Should be alright with like impale tank spec as that still gets deep prot. Long as you get your 1/3 shield block I think people should be alright.
---
Definitely agree with telling people to keep the shield on until they are really into it.
---
Definitely the array of skills. It helps they have shadow and holy spells so that you can still cast something while one school is kicked. Fear is a powerful peel, and they have several instant casts to make it harder to interrupt.
---
Adult bad twichrage.

I'd rather have other characters pop out of view than never getting in to view my own character in the first place.
---
Skinning &amp; Fishing, at 40 getting Herbalism or Mining and gathering with a mount. Vendor the skins, AH the fish/food. Level 60 drop Skinning for Engineering or anything you enjoy.
---
Pressing your buttons as a DPS (especially most vanilla DPS when they have so few to press) is certainly easier than tanking.
---
Now I'm not saying tanking is super hard, anyone could do it if they had the confidence to fuck up in front of people while learning, but it is definitely harder than DPS. 
---
It's basically, hold threat, and herd cats. But threat isn't as easy back then anyway, sometimes even levelling you have gear disparity issues to overcome. You are expected to have leadership qualities and more game knowledge too, generally. Ton of fun though.
---
I'm healing this time round as my main but I've already got agreement on guild that my alt can main tank alt raids as I will absolutely miss tanking if I didn't have my alt. I love it.
---
I think I just got seizure.
---
they probably have enough work on their hands already.  
---
the most important part is to get rid of the most glaring or impactful bugs.
---
less severe bugs can be uncovered and solved when the games is live. 
---
beta surved its purpose. its not there to entertain you/us/anyone.
---
How many have you tried?
---
Been playing balance druid on the beta and really enjoying it. Can't wait to grow feathers!
---
Having one month of beta knowledge is not enough for this guy to make any bold statement like that. The economy will still balance out as ah prices always vary. Making any prediction off of the layering in beta with the fraction of the community even playing is dumb.
---
Those warcries have been adopted by the Horde AKA "Blood Elves and friends" ever since TBC.
---
Thank Thrall's balls for Classic. Time to hit the nuke button and have a full Horde reset.
---
the Frostwolf/Battle Ram are slightly cheaper than normal, they around 600 or so, vs the 1000 (or 800 with discount) of a normal fast mount. The ranked Mounts are only like 100 gold.
---
I loved them in cata PvP for those reasons, only really renew and PWS in vanilla though! I guess holy nova too actually.
---
Absolutely keeps the fun up if you get kicked being able to not stand there like a lemon though , and sometimes (going off cata experience here) if you go aggressive on a DPS that jumps you they can panic and kick your shadow spells whilst you laugh back to full health :)
---
200gs +
---
Hey there.  
---
I'm going to Classic it up with a few IRL friends (so far 4-5 ppl from Denmark) on an EU Horde PVP realm.
---
Short term: We all want to race to final ding, playing together when possible. However, our schedules probably wont align all the time, so there will also be some soloing. We don't expect to get to 60 at the same time, but have calculated leveling to be somewhere between 3-5 weeks.
---
Long term: Most of us are experienced endgame raiders from vanilla, but we wont be going poop sock hardcore in Classic. I guess what we are looking for is a group of players or a guild with an intent to progress, but at a casual speed, probably 1-2 days of raiding pr. week preferably on weekends.  
---
Most of us played Horde together in vanilla on Stormscale EU in a mainly Scandinavian guild. It was a great envirnment and atmosphere, and I think that this is what we are trying to get back into. So what we are looking for is an english speak group of ppl or a guild preferably from Scandinavia and/or western Europe.
---
Yah what?!
---
Unless you know what that multiplier is for non elite regular mobs the entire argument is flawed.
---
It's completely feasible that the multiplier for regular non elites is 1. Which would make improved demo shout even worse on those mobs than it would be using the player formula.
---
Almost everything is better than unbridled wrath for levelling. It's awful. You're going to be levelling two handed, a 40% chance to get a single point of rage for **five** points of investment is horrific.
---
This is before I even mention that in the BETA you can't reliable self proc enrage/blood craze so there's absolutely no reason you'd even go down the fury tree beyond cruelty early on anyway.
---
My group have a similar scenario and even though one of my m8s knows how to raid etc. he just hasnt got the time anymore to do so.
---
Best thing is (even if you roll an alt to play with them) is be upfront about that you want to raid and see endgame content.
---
Nobody can't hold it against you if you want to see everything a game has to offer.
---
Just make sure you got time to play with your friends aswell and its not 100% you just always being "busy" for raiding/preperations
---
Nope. Get this orange monkey outta here
---
You guys don't get it. Let's say we all stop bitching. We will get classic but oh my what's this? They gave paladins crusader strike? We complain cause we know blizzard is a big old stubborn ox that needs a shove push and a knee in the stomach to get moving in the right direction. I'm gonna assume you're the same people that say "It's just alpha relax" followed by "It's just beta relax" "It's just the first patch week relax" "They will fix it next expansion" rinse and repeat.
---
Dynamic respawn only affect crowded zones while layering affect every zone no matter how many are in that zone.
---
&gt;A shadow priest is a much better solo PVPer than Paladin or Shaman, they can kite a lot of elites.
---
These are your exact words in a post above

# &lt;Informal&gt; [NA][A][PvE][Semi-Hardcore]  MORNING EST
---
**INTRO:** This is a brand new Semi-Hardcore guild being made from the ground up. I am looking for dedicated people who want to get in and clear content. It does not matter if you are new to classic or a veteran, All I want are dedicated players willing to do what it takes to down bosses. If you can do this, I want you on the team.
---
**GOAL:**
---
\-week 3/4 MC clear
---
\-Clear all content quickly and efficiently
---
(example: phase 1 should be 1 raid night, except for off day ONY)
---
\-Clear Naxx, full T3 guild before BC release
---
**EXPECTATIONS:** I value maturity and honesty above all else when it comes to my members. I expect everyone to set an example for our server on how quality players should behave. I want everyone on and ready 15 minutes before raid begins. During progression I expect full consumables to help us get the kills we need. 
---
**LOOT:** Council and roll decay. Some loot is too important to be simply bought or rolled for. Others are not so much. So we will be using a mix of these 2 systems.
---
**SCHEDULE:**
---
**RAID TIMES** \- EST, MORNING
---
7:00-10:00 AM EST
---
**RAID DAYS** \- MON / WED / THUR  
---
**CURRENT CLASS NEEDS**
---
Warrior tank (low) (MT closed)
---
Warrior dps (low)
---
Rogue (medium)
---
Priest (low)
---
Druid (low)
---
Hunter (medium)

---
Too bad the movie was complete trash
---
If you wanna tank in naxx it pays to think 2 years ahead... Rolling them stonescales every raid without having prepared for it kills the bank
---
And suddenly you’re the Jaime Lannister or Arthur Dayne of Azeroth
---
A few weeks of layering is going to mean that there will be a group/guild of hardcore people sitting of months supplies of black lotuses, and could potentionally controll the entire flask market right of the bat. But HEY 1 guild owning 50% of the servers gold isnt a problem right? :D   
---
Layering should only be in the first "uncondested zones" ATLEAST on pvp servers. not on all zones through out the entire game. Vanilla should be cluster right of the bat, it breathes competition and I'm not going to swallow the "the servers can't handle it" argument because thats pure bullshit.
---
he's one of the biggest bfa and blizzard critics. really not accurate
---
OwO
---
no if the pop dies off enough they may just leave classic as it is.
---
new content would require it to be designed, art team, music, gear/itemization made for it etc. Lots of staff/investment required.
---
Where as tbc and wrath can be fed into the new client like vanilla was for barely any investment
---
I'd say Kevin Jordan is entitled to make any statement about vanilla wow as he pleases.
---
I've made a list of names that haven't been used for western servers before, are in line with earlier naming conventions and have strong ties to Warcraft lore:  
---
Archaedas
---
Razormane
---
Southshore
---
Arugal
---
Moonfeather
---
Durnholde
---
Benediction
---
Hammerfall
---
Mephistroth
---
Fordring
---
Theramore
---
Menethil
---
Bloodsail
---
Shadowprey
---
Nethergarde
---
Sapphiron
---
Wastewander  
---
Therazane
---
Bladewind
---
Naralex  
---
Sandfury
---
Stormpike
---
Darkshire
---
it will take about 6 months to hit 60, then about 4-5 days a week of 5 hour raids to down lucifron.  Probably best to just farm MC trash for BOE's to gear your raid up enough to work on him.
---
Hi, /u/OfficialDemiLovato

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7qui3/if_your_favorite_harry_potter_character_played/). 
---
This makes me super hopeful! Do you know what kind of FPS you were getting? I’m trying/hoping to push my 2018 MacBook Pro all the way (ultra) while hoping to maintain 50-60 FPS. Don’t know if that will be possible but then again the games graphics aren’t tolling however it’s the Legion base client that changes my thinking.
---
What kind of FPS were you seeing? Thanks!
---
Not only is daughter an atrocious name prone to be misunderstood (to say the least), you also feel the need to make a reddit post about it?
---
These numbers are absolutely ridiculous. We raided 9 days per week
---
Yes but each layer is a 100% authentic vanilla server so the gameplay is unaltered, going through the zones will feel exactly like it did 14 years ago. That's not possible with dynamic respawns. #nochanges
---
once horde always horde. also i love the undead starting experience
---
Why do streamers get so much hate? I can see a lot of people seem to dislike them. Are they generally egotistical or something?
---
Blizzard have stated layering will be implemented for 2-3weeks max. You think that too guilds can level all the way to 60 and control the market in this time? 
---
I don’t know the figures off the top of my head but it’s well documented that private servers have black lotus spawns very wrong. I think In the 1-2 weeks that tops guilds will be 60 they will be able to farm very little black lotus.
---
Thinks his reaction is dramatic.
---
Second this. As the "first experience" of alliance you need to do this. 
---
Get rolled by murlocs you never wanted to pull and hogger introducing you to the spirit healer is a rite of passage.
---
&gt; A few weeks of layering is going to mean that there will be a group/guild of hardcore people sitting of months supplies of black lotuses, and could potentionally controll the entire flask market right of the bat. But HEY 1 guild owning 50% of the servers gold isnt a problem right? :D
---
And why would that not happen on normal non-layered server? Obviously you would have less Black Lotus spawns, but you would also obviously have less people who can farm/use that Black Lotus, so what's the difference?
---
**&lt;Addicted&gt; - EU – Horde - PvP Server – Hardcore PvP/Raiding Guild - English**
---

---
Addicted is a serious but friendly guild which is looking for outstanding players in order to rush the content when the game comes out. We will both rush PvE and PvP content. The members come from different background but we all have in common the passion for what the game used to be. Most of our players played on retail (2004-2006) and then on and off private servers. We are currently around 40 members (casual and hardcore). \*\*If you know your worth and want to show that underdogs can win it all this guild is for you.\*\*

Yup, anyone who thinks that they'll be mage aoeing better be prepared to nosleep or account share so they're ahead of the pack else they aint getting any aoe spots.
---
Only whatever few mages are ahead and stay ahead will be able to aoe grind, everyone else will need to quest or dungeon.  Dungeon aoe farming looks to be a thing though at least in SM graveyard n shit with like 3mage groups.
---
dude was obviously joking
---
it will take about 6 months to hit 60, then about 4-5 days a week of 5 hour raids to down lucifron. Probably best to just farm MC trash for BOE's to gear your raid up enough to work on him.
---
If you are playing in a min/max grp: human is the only choise. The 5+ sword/mace skill is just to GOOD!
---
305 weapon skill compared to 300 weapon skill will improve your hit chace by 3% and reduce your glancing blow dmg by alot!   They build more threat than any other class! (alliance)
---
REMEMBER: this is just min/max... If you wanna be a dwarf, be a dwarf, becous you will be more unique than a human tank (peiple will remenber you better) xD
---
Sure, I hear ya, as long as you're not saying all of the "nature classes" are native american.
---
Go out of your way to read this: https://docs.google.com/document/d/142QiLyH5L0Dx9XnWBNKhBF5LTmOW-vnzb5S-mMDTVcw/edit
---
This will help you figure out if Druids are what you're expecting, or if another class might appeal to you
---
This is the real problem when discussing the options, you can't say dwarf start is just a generic fantasy book then say horde has "I'm gonna climb a mountain adventure" thats literally dwarf start too.
---
There's pros and cons to both sides but don't try and tint things with your preference that heavily, it isn't helpful to the OP.
---
Sharding makes mmos feel empty and disconnected. Sharding helped kill wow, deal with it.
---
There's still gonna be shitloads of people sharing your zone if ur level 15 1 month in man.  In order to get what you're asking for you prolly have to be 6+ months in at level 15.  Even then I dunno because if your server is popular there will be people rerolling on it, rolling alts, etc.
---
&gt; Everyone is talking about a decrease in players after some time. Well i dont know but i remember wow as the most addicting game on earth where thousands got hooked and even more followed.
---
And it still has not gained players after launch since Wrath, and that's the same on vanilla private servers too. You have a lot of people around launch and then they slowly drop off. That's how every game release works nowadays.
---
1.12 client was late 2006 though, not 2004.
---
Farming 2 gear sets is easier than levelling another char and then farming a new gear set anyway!
---
They don’t do fine. It’s much harder to do Nefarion as Horde or the three bugs in AQ. You have to stance dance like mad - even with Tremor Totem as backup.
---
.png - how dare you ?! ALWAYS eps!
---
Wasn't really a wooosh though. He just made a bad a joke then tried to cover it up with a wooosh.
---
&gt; and not the money they obviously safe from it
---
How do they save money? 
---
&gt;why not just limiting names to a continent (eu servers etc.) Still vanilla, no cons except limited names and all bad excuses are gone.
---
It's not about names, it's about loosing the sense of server community.
---
I do know what inflation is and I am not sure how does it fit in this conversation? The conversation is affect of layer on economy. What is the difference between having 12k people on 4 differetn servers, and having 12000 on different layers? People can hop inbetween the layers to steal some things, but others can jump on their layer too so... I don't see your point at all.  
---
For your second point, how does that second part inflict socializing? Layer is pretty much standalone server, you do dungeons with people on your server, you meet the same people. If you really meet people who are layer hoppers, you would meet them frequently anyway and eventually they would be part of your whole server.  
---
For your third point. The idea is not that it will die out soon, but that you have to be ready that some pople will just try it out and leave. As a marketing expert you would be thinking "how to keep the actual player base hooked and not down after the "visitors" leave after the release. Because New release is time when you have most amout of people, that is how it is with all games.  
---
And if these "hipsters" don't leave (as they should as that is a thing with all games), then that means that classic wow is a huge success and we have completly different conversations. I will be honest, I don't think they will have 12 000 pop servers (even if it would be epic), so I don't have any other answer than.. I wish we would have this problem to expect.  
---
As for your last point, of course it is about money. If money was not problem there is no problem with layering, just havign more servers and using more money for easier merges
---
people will reach 60 in sub 4 days, leveling herbalism wont take more then a half day (max) people have probably already maximized. Regardless of how black lotuses spawn these people will find a way to control it. Trust me I've been one of them, there is nothing in this game that can't be abused. But giving them the perfect tools to do it seems foolish. But I can say with 100% certainty when the layering phase is over. It will have caused **WAY** more harm then it did any good.
---
we aren’t specifically planning to focus on WSG - are AV or AB viable alternatives? my question about the advantages of each comp — having a priest vs double shaman or double druid — that’s including any form of pvp that could realistically be a vehicle for getting us to higher ranks. if there’s a special strength to running 2 shamans in AB, for instance, and there’s enough cp involved that it’s not a waste of time, i’m all ears.
---
fine but my question still remains and it is directed towards those playing classic if my above title wasnt obvious.
---
furthermore i want to know at what range a stealthed target is visible when detection reaches sertain stages. 
---
Felhunter grants 30 detection while 5 levels of stealth on rogue grants 25, how much does a difference of 5 provide ? furthermore what if that warlock is human and utilizes the +30 human temporary buff along with cats eye then he would reach 45 stealth detect above the stealthed target. what range can the rogue in such case be spotted at.
---
Haha I always prefer .eps but I know some people struggle with it (esp with certain LaTeX compilers that can't convert image formats for some reason?!) Notice how I skipped .jpg cuz that shit should just burn in a fire.
---
He just mixed the concepts' names.
---
It must be hard for them to make the right decision when all these bfa activision fan boys think every idea they have is perfect.
---
Layering has fucked up so many wow clones. Now even wow is going too fuck up their own clone.
---
Paladin: HolyDiver
---
A couple thoughts. First is that vanilla WoW was all about building your notoriety through your accomplishments. People would recognize your guild or name and see your mount or sick helmet or shoulders and know you were a badass and worked hard for your stature. Streamers have built-in notoriety and a fan club following them everywhere and tons of help to get the items they want, so people will be jealous that they get a “free” ride.  
---
Second, because they have fans following them they’ll impact the pvp servers. They’ll have a huge advantage when it comes to calling in for backup when they encounter adversity out in the world that normal people won’t have without a lot of work to build guild friendships.
---
&gt;If you have 4 layers, you have 4 times the resources, but also 4 times the players, so what is the deal with it?
---
I've seen this argument time and time again, and it is simply wrong because the people that create the layers and the people that abuse the layers are not the same people. Layering is specifically meant to compensate for possibility of many people quitting early, but exactly *those* people, while playing in the first few weeks and creating layers for a handful of people to abuse, are also those that quit before ever coming close to endgame and using those resources creating indirectly by them through the layers. 
---
For example, let's say that on the first weekend, a server has enough players for 5 layers (some servers will probably have 10+ in the first week). Obviously 99% of the people won't be 60 at that time, but a handful of hardcore players will be. Now, those players have access to 5 times as many high level resources, specifically Black Lotus. Not only do they have not a lot of competition because they leveled so fast, they now also have many times more available resource per time invested than those that come a few weeks later. When the tourists stop playing and the layers are removed, those hardcore players will have enough Black Lotus and other high end resources for the whole of classic, which translates into enormous economic power. That's why layering in its current state has the very real potential of ruining the experience for many people, and that's why many people criticize the system.
---
Yeah except that not every single player is equal, like in actual economy btw. 
---
But now explain to me how those thousand years of economy are wrong and how you are right.
---
Supply and demand ratios are mostly everything but linear, especially mats in wow..
---
&gt;-Unlike retail it is more likely that people need to buy a small and precise quantity of items each time.
---
Which is precisely why a smart (yet unethical) strategy is to only sell in stacks of more.
---
"Is there something requiring 5x ores for a quest? Sell it in stacks of 8. They have to buy more from you, or buy from someone else for more expensive price"
---
But in all seriousness, people who want a "bulk" will often skip smaller stacks in favor of larger ones purely for convenience. Hence by putting larger stacks you might lose a "just need X" customers, but you will gain "Okay, i need 120 bars, lets go" customers.
---
Sub 4 days to 60? Isn’t the world record 4 days 20 hours? And thats on a test server where’s there’s 0 competition for anything? Don’t know where your getting your information from dude?
---
Thanks a bunch, can you do/share elwyn forest?
---
Bro.... you just posted cringe
---
And Does shadowguard scale with spell dmg?
---
Work hard, not smart.
---
Daddy
---
Exactly, and layering only uncontested zones is an even worse idea. Besides the integrity of the world being harmed tremendously more, you would have multiple servers worth of population in each contested zone.
---
You should say geared guilds not hardcore, and its gona take months for 40 people to get the gear before their able to clear that fast
---
In a normal non-layered server 0.1% of the population would only be able to farm x1 time the resources.
---
In this scenario 0.1% of the population are going to be able to farm xlayer time the resources wether that is 3 or 4 or 5 is going to matter alot. Then later the layering will be removed but not the farmed resources so the market is going to be heavily inflated right of the bat. And no one else can take advantage of it, only those who were super quick to reach 60. 
---
Is this a hard concept to understand?

Omen Of Clarity

I still don’t see myself living in mud huts so...
---
**Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
​**Intended raid/play times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings (CET Timezone). More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
**Aditional info:**
---
\- While the guild will be very active on the PvP scene, &lt;Hate&gt; will remain a raiding guild at it’s core. 
---
\- Regarding the loot system, we intend to implement our own DKP system, however Loot Council is still not off the table yet. 
---
**Bottom line:**
---
​So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/) ​ or check our Discord here [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK ](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
​P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.

---
Well they share ah together?
---
Inflation and deflation are the two death sentences to every economy
---
Is global chat reduced to your layer?
---
If not them the socializing will be heavily impacted if not, well then it might work out.
---
Is layering a bug or something people just don’t like because it’s not the “norm”.  Do you really think they’d build a game to fail?
---
Did I say that I think "**everyone**" as you put it would reach 60 under 4 hours of 20 minutes? No I didn't.  
---
Will 10-20 people on each server/faction beat this record? Yeah easily, Leveling is most likely going to be easier then it was on P-servers and they beat the record there so..
---
The layers are dynamic I believe? So the amount scales back down with the amount of players.
---
&gt; Obviously 99% of the people won't be 60 at that time, but a handful of hardcore players will be.
---
This handful would be 5x larger than a non-layered server in your example.
---
Yeah layering is bad but it is what it is. They need to do something, can't have 20k players or whatever on one server on launch day.
---
 The suggestions I have seen are that they should have a server being hacked up into layers and you choose which one to join during character creation. So you join Emerald Dream layer 1, Emerald Dream layer 2, Emerald Dream  layer 3 during character creation and can never leave it. Then when less people are playing Blizzard merges the layers incrementally. This seems like a great suggestion in my eyes.
---
 Other option is that they remove the layers in higher level zones. Should be possible I would think, most players are not going to level very fast. They have tons of people working for them, they should be able to come up with something.
---
harder to kite melee classes.  they can hit you a lot further away.  perplexity has done some illustrations of how leeway is working somewhere  in his streams.  it is a bit  complex initially.
---
I've played horde plenty, and we literally never had a warrior fail their stance dance on Nefarian.
---
Wat
---
alchemy or tailoring/enchanting
---
I just don't see how anyone could use a keybind that sends the pet to attack and start auto shot... What if the mob is near a pack and sending a pet would pull more mobs? Do I have to keybind separately auto shot and attack pet? If yes then what the fuck was the point of this macro, I can just use ctrl 1 and my auto attack keybind.
---
Things like these just don't make sense and who actually ever uses them, makes you have to have 100 keybinds of the same function eventually. I didn't really get past the 1st macro because fuck reading through all that
---
DAE think BFA sucks? Upvotes to the left! ECKS Dee
---
Hey man, look on the bright side.. Well, shit.
---
well 0,1% out 3k is another value than 0,1% out of 15k
---
Dude honestly, that record was done my Joana. Even the most serious speed levellers won’t come close. I would estimate it will take the average hardcore speed leveller circa 6-7 days played. So with sleep, food, toilet built into that, you looking at 10 days into release before these guilds are 60
---
its just that when I played druid on private server, I can't say I was hard to kill. 
---
yes, sure...I could always run away and not get killed, but that also meant I couldn't help anyone. and shifting costed a lot of mana, to the point that it made sense not to run away and just try to outheal the damage in human form. of course I only got him to 30, but not sure if getting to 60 would have made a difference. when I played my original shaman back in classic, I remember I could always outheal the damage and help the allies.
---
I wish paladins were with horde before TBC =)
---
Don't hate him, hate how youtube keeps suggesting his videos even though i click "Not interested"
---
Also "Humor" tag is stretching it lol, this meme probably been done 100 times by now (by fans)
---
How about death to the horde.
---
Not every single player is equal? How does player equality change with layers?   
---
What do you even mean? You can't just say "economy", "Inflation, deflation", "Supply and demand" and consider that an argument.
---
You kill someone in 10 seconds and then you are Out of mana.
---
Just long enough to end a marriage.
---
I’m aware he said that hit to think more than a handful of people will beat that record is naive I think.
---
We will have to agree to disagree. We will see
---
&gt; To keep a server running thats half empty because it "might" get filled costs alot. When you just can create layers that adjust with the playerbase you will save that money. Imagine running a whole server for just 500 guys instead of 3k, 6 times less money for it.
---
All their servers are cloud based. They don't assign more resources to a realm than is needed. Sure, having all the background processes (mob/resource respawn and such) run all the time on nearly empty servers does cost some power, but most of the server performance is used on players, if you have 5000 players split across 10 realms or 5000 players on 1 realm it is going to require a similar amount of server power.
---
&gt;This handful would be 5x larger than a non-layered server in your example.
---
That's simply not the case, and that's the whole point of the argument that it doesn't scale in a linear fashion because the playerbase is not homogenous. 
---
I'm just making up numbers to illustrate the point: 
---
First few weeks, 100 hardcore players, 2900 "normal" players, 12000 tourists on one server, 5 layers. As long as the tourists are on the server and create layers, the 100 hardcore players have access to resources equivalent to 5 vanilla servers. The tourists will probably quit playing when the average "normal" player, those that will continue to play the game for a long time, have reached max level, maybe slightly sooner. Then, the layers are gone, but the 100 hardcore players had a few weeks to gather resources equivalent to 5 servers. 
---
The 100 hardcore players and the 2900 "normal" players will play the game no matter what, and more "tourists" playing the game (and creating even more layers) will not increase the amount of hardcore players at all. The layering system specifically exists *because* they assume that there will be those people that quit without ever reaching 60, but the number of those players doesn't affect the number of people that would have played and reached 60 anyway.
---
The problem is you encourage stacked realms a bit... I.e., all shamans roll on wind fury
---
No worries, that's understandable :)
---
In that case good luck - and i recommend you also check out Classic Guild Recruitment discords:

Imagine criticizing other people for putting layering into your game after putting instances into your own game yourself.

Nobody asked.
---
ironic but world of roguecraft 2 shows felhunter detection impact during vanilla wow.  I think having the felhunter out gave the lock about 0.7 second additional warning of approaching rogue.  worth looking up.
---
No, fortnite imo is toxic to kids. We play other games, and I'm not taking it away from him, but I'd like him to try something new. You're some sad ass bitch who will never have kids anyways because you're ugly as fuck. Move along
---
They said the HOPE for 2-3 weeks. Max can he the entirety of phase 1
---
Read the reply I gave to your neanderthal friend below.
---
I agree completely.  It's a very downvoted sentiment but macros like these are a crutch that lower the skill ceiling and trivialize gameplay.  Pulling off a feign death trap in combat consistently was a marker of skill and required knowledge of timing and awareness of incoming damage.  But instead every mouth breathing hunter is never going to miss one throughout the entirety of classic.
---
well real life economics is fundamental wrong and flawed. exponential growth? exponential interests? how the fuck should that work?
---
the real world engages in war over resources and in the process reduces resources and demand(dead people cant buy shit) so the economics can survive for another 50-100years after reseting.
---
not going to look for a discussion, just a statement correction
---
Economy "works" but aint "right"
---
See, the problem is that no one knows how long layering will last and how many layers will there be, including Blizzard.
---
Thanks again. I'll make sure to give it a look.
---
Loktar ogar!
---
No, my favorite has always been a priest. And I will stay that
---
Love it, lol.  A lot of people told me you pretty much gotta take up alchemy as a moonkin.
---
I was thinking of playing one in classic, but maybe not as my first char.  This is making me debate that already.  XD
---
Yeah seems like the boomkin is the virgin as they blow their load in 12 seconds
---
6 months to hit 60 lmao ok.
---
So your point is, if you level fast enough 1% hit 60, they get the 4 times the resoruces? But all 5 layers you mention would have these 60. Let¨s say each layer has 30 level 60s. If they all hop layrs, then you have 150 level 60s.  
---
So you either have 1x resoruces and 30 players or 5x resoruces and 150 players. What is the difference?
---
&gt; it will take about 6 months to hit 60, then about 4-5 days a week of 5 hour raids to down lucifron. Probably best to just farm MC trash for BOE's to gear your raid up enough to work on him.
---
Weird, I always remember selling stacks same as any other time...
---
it is a pretty big issue.  iirc a 'no--fly zone' concept was in play around HFC? already so it isn't impossible to  simple apply that almost everywhere except the fly-only destination areas.
---
now if blizz would  do this?  totally different issue.
---
In the end this is all just your opinion. You have nothing to back it up. Classic isn't going to be a pserver. You say only one guild will do it as if you know what's going to happen. You don't, so relax up a bit. There is potential for sure, but don't start spouting it off like fact. Every server will be different.
---
I am of the opinion that it should have been a three parter.
---
One för the orcs (we learned nothing about them or their reason for invading), one for the humans. And then a final movie with the confrontation.
---
There are a two main reasons why posting smaller quanitity stacks is done:
---
* Larger quantities are usually sold at a discount, thus selling each piece seperately will get you more gold per item
---
* Some mats were found in chests or similar, thus there is no way to farm more of the item and whatever quantity they have gets sold
---
Anyone who wants to buy larger quantities will go for bigger stacks for convenience (and because they are cheaper per unit) and most sellers will want to get their stock sold as quickly as possible, which is why they will post at large quantities (at a discount).
---
Well, I‘d undercut your shit with the 3 ore by 1 copper so I still just pay for 5.
---
I think they will have a revolt on there hands if it lasts any longer.
---
Counter point - original Vanilla WoW was in development for YEARS. You could just as well say everybody who could possibly be interested in WoW knew about it when it launched, so no new subscribers were available to be gained.
---
Funnily, past Blizzard agreed with this reasoning. They HOPED for WoW to reach 500k subscribers and stay around that amount. They considered anything over 100k to be a sucess. 
---
But the subscriber number exceeded 500k in WEEKS and never stopped growing for 6 years. 
---
The decisions of Blizzard that followed, with WotLK and especially Cata, proved they had no idea what made their own game so appealing. For them, it was a miracle. 
---
If you are old enough, you surely remember that WoW was considered the most addicting game of all time at some point. While no-lifes surely existed before WoW, they never existed in such numbers and never had they gained such admiration from other players. 
---
I too many years ago logged into WoW the first time, and while all previous games I treated purely as low-level entertainment , something to relax to or kill boredom, WoW was the first game I felt the need to invest in, and treat it seriously. My story is the common one between those that started in the early days.
---
Promotion of Classic is nonexistent. If somebody severed all ties with retail years ago, it is likely he hasn't heard about Classic still. Others might have heard of it, but don't believe it will be anything like the "old days". But if Classic really recreates the original experience, these people will hear of it. And they will come back.
---
It's possible that subscriber number will only start rising after the launch, like it did years ago.
---
The reverse assumption is only based on this weird presumption that modern playerbase is somehow completely different than the one from 15 years ago, and will hate the game that was once loved, after trying it for a short time.
---
Yeah, that is if you are efficient and play for 12 hours a day, every day.
---
I'm just gonna wait until they turn off layering for good before I start playing.
---
Good to check some videos on the class you want to do.
---
In PVP druid kinda dot up and then run away and heal then dot up again. They have low damage but it is quite hard to kill them because of their mobility and healing.
---
In raids you will most likely have to heal (druid is not optimal as a tank, they are not that great as dps, there is usually a lack of healers). Although because of how druid works you might be able to help with damage when healing isn't needed.
---
It will be a win-win. You get rid of those ugly lights and get one extra monitor !
---
I’m looking at the cables
---
What are you trying to say? The sentence makes no sense to me. Why do you pay for 5 if you undercut? Are you a buyer or a seller? In your scenario you seem to be both.
---
wut
---
Yeah, the word he was looking for was probably determination ?
---
And if that wasn't enough, bear form gains the strength to tank 5 (FIVE) gorillas.
---
Very cool.  Why play the game as it was designed when you can trivialize every mechanic of your class and complain about the game being easy.
---
I got Corpsemaker on first run. On an Enhancement Shaman. On a PVE server. Shower me with salt.
---
He said he post‘s required ores in stacks of 8 while you need 5, so I buy the 8 ores and take 3 of them to undercut his stacks of 8.
---
I love how you (correctly) assumed that everyone will be playing mage.
---
Lok'tar!
---
&gt;For example, let's say that on the first weekend, a server has enough players for 5 layers (some servers will probably have 10+ in the first week). Obviously 99% of the people won't be 60 at that time, but a handful of hardcore players will be.
---
Funnily enough sharding would actually be better then as high level zones would have very few shards of those zones because there are so few high level players.

\*\*&lt;Tempest&gt;\*\* \[NA\] \[Hardcore\] \[Alliance\] \[PvP Server - US EAST\] 
---
Introduction:
---
Tempest is a guild dedicated to high raiding efficiency and strong game knowledge with proactive community members. Our mission is to complete all available content and compete in the top echelon of the server. To ensure our success, and fulfill the guild vision, many individual aspects will be sacrificed for the overall benefit of the guild. Coordination centered on concepts such as: reputation, recipes, gear, and world events require necessary amounts of teamwork at the potential cost of individual gain. While raid times will not be moved for server firsts, it is the leadership’s expectation that all content (with the exception of MC), be cleared the first day/week of release. Furthermore, raid members will be expected to min/max to the best of their abilities to properly contribute to raids. Members that demonstrate they are not able to play their characters to the highest potential will see limited gear acquisition and raid invitations. 
---
Our current members are private vanilla raiders with experience in all available content of raiding, pvp, world bosses, and farming. Over the years we have learned to prioritize collaboration, professionalism, dedication, and competitiveness.
---
Raid Schedule: 9 PM – 12 AM EST (6 – 9 PM PST) Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
---
Loot: Loot council decision.
---
Expectations: All aspiring raiders will be expected to attend at least 90% of the raids and min/max their classes and professions.
---
Potential applicants should have a hardcore mindset and experience min/maxing in some WoW expansion, with detailed classic knowledge preferred. If you are interested in being a part of this guild, regardless of your background and experience with the current leadership, you are expected to fill out the following application: &lt;[https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA](https://forms.gle/11UVtbgguU8AExWYA)\&gt;

---
I agree priest/shaman overall however a properly specced pvp holy paladin is basically impossible for melee to kill.  Can easily have 2 rogues on you and no risk of dying, and the rogues will slowly die to reactive damage.
---
This is one of the reasons why pally healers were so popular in original vanilla, back when 50% of the server seemed to be undead rogue.
---
but wouldn't you have 100 players spread in different layers? That would be still ok, as in like 5 layers, you have 5 times resoruces, so 20 people per 1x resource. But if you would split it in different servers, the ratio would not change.  
---
Yes however, if you think that one layer will be very dominant to others and have people there leveled much faster with 1-2 days to grab all layers for 1 layer. That can happen, but we are really running into scenarios that are extreme and will last for only a few days.  
---
But yes in that sense you would be correct.
---
It made me sad. :(
---
ironic but world of roguecraft 2 shows felhunter detection impact during vanilla wow.  I think having the felhunter out gave the lock about 0.7 second additional warning of approaching rogue.  worth looking up.  this would need to be tested in beta, of course, but it would also be fairly simple to do, I would think, if it hasn't been done already.
---
My warlock ears cannot handle this...2 more months til Classic. I'm already planning a week off work for this in August!!!
---
iirc average /played to level to 60 is 10 days. So if you average about 1.5 hours per day, it would take about 6 months.
---
Zep for TB to org was Wrath my dude. 
---
It's literally the only change I would absolutely love because damn that ride was beautiful.
---
You literally just solved the issue, 1 or two guilds with 5-10x more resources than they should have? Anomalies? Ban the fuck out of them. 
---
I’m sure blizzard can craft a system that tracks how often you hop layers, and flag your character for investigation. If the specified character is hopping layers and accumulating large amounts of materials, there you go. 
---
Have the system combined, hopping layers very often by joining groups? Yes, gaining large amounts of materials or more than what should normally be possible based on respawn rates of material? Yes. Flag for investigation and ban the player. 
---
Problem solved.
---
You people act like this is that big a deal, but if properly enforced and made apparent that is AGAINST the rules to abuse/exploit layering (which can be seen as economy manipulation) the most likely to exploit it won’t.
---
And no if they create the system I suggested, Mark over there who happened to join his friends part and pick a second herb where he was standing shouldn’t get in trouble.
---
Was I'll present then? I think it's just the required level of the item gave X and y mats with weapons giving more shards and armour more dust?
---
Could be wrong though but I do believe a list you are searching for would be level req based.
---
Fresh Silver Hand server had a server first mage get to 60 with just over 2days /played 
---
Just gotta get ahead of the zerg. 
---
And thats without layering.
---
Just google PoE MMO.
---
It has same gameplay like retail WoW.
---
So either both of them are MMOs or non of them.
---
what?
---
It would happen on a non-layered server. But not to the same extent.
---
If we say that 1% of each entire server are the most hardcore players, level 60 in a week, farming mats 16 hours a day for the following 3 weeks. Okay, of course those people will exist on every server. Yes they will have a huge lead on gold, materials, everything. But now give them 5+ layers to hop together, and they get 5x or more resources. Remember, the layers themselves don't regulate who goes to which one. So if a guild plays it smart, splits their hardcore farmers into 4 layers and farm the same zones, they just made 4x the amount they could if they shared the same layer.
---
super long
---
What? Complete nonsense. The weapon speed neds to be faster than 2.5 for SoR to be worth it without any spelldmg gear.
---
This is just wrong. Good healers can outlast many people in duels and that is their strength. That doesn't mean they're unkillable and they have their own weaknesses. Healers in 1v1 fights are actually fairly strong if you can't burst them down fast enough.
---
God forbid you face a decked out paladin/shaman as a melee class. You'll just be wasting your time.
---
no PoE lacks a consistent world..... 
---
dont be silly
---
*Laughs in Mana*
---
I've decided a while ago that I want a 35 druid alt with leatherworking and tailoring. (funnel it cloth/leather, and thread is used by both professions!)     
---
Could go alchemy, but I'll be skinning on my main and leatheworking is a way to increase the vendor value of the raw leather (I think rugged leather pants doubles the vendor value of leather, after taking into account thread).   
---
I decided on druid mainly for the moonglade port for easy moonwell access. I think the fishing is fairly high level there as well compared to fishing in cities.  So I think "might as well fish a little" while I'm in moonglade, I really enjoy fishing so leveling it up on deviates fist wouldn't be too hard, if it'd make fishign in moonglade more  rewarding. I teleport to moonglade, transmute mooncloth and do a little fishing while I'm there. Perfect.  
---
I'm picking alchemy on a character I actually want to play at 60, so I can potentially get the flask recipes. Combined with herbalism since black lotus is BOP on launch. Thinking tauren shaman for that +15 herbalism &amp; ghostwolf, if it lets you herb in wolf form.   
---
Leatherworking has a transmute (with saltshaker) but not nearly as good as alchemy, right?  
---
I get to make kodo hide bags early on with leatherworking,  and get more vendor value from leather stacks. Can drop it any time and level up alchemy if it's worth having just for the transmute

Semper Danica (SD) is a 100% pure danish speaking MMO guild. Our members are all 18+ and are expected to behave mature and respectful, but still with plenty of room to have fun.SD is a multi-mmo guild, which means we also offer activities in other mmo games. We were founded back in 2002 and have been active in several MMORPGS through out the years. We have always had a strong presence in WoW since vanilla and plan on keep this going forward. We are trying something new with Classic since we in this game will be going Alliance as opposed to our normal Horde tendencies.  
---
**What we offer:**
---
* Downing content in a timely manner.
---
* Laughs and good times, but in a respectful environment.
---
* A good mix of classes and specs, with room for some of the more niche specs provided they add sufficient utility/flavor to the raid; a Feral druid with option to OT and provide crit buffs, a shadow priest that boosts shadow dmg and so on.
---
* Dungeon runs, whilst lvling and afterwards to gear for raids and acquire gold.
---
* Plans for organised Battle grounds.
---
* Spreadsheets/lists with overview of guild professions and guildbank.
---
* Helpful and knowledgeable environment.
---
* Social activities in-game and RL where we have yearly Christmas and summer parties/get togethers and smaller stuff through out the year.
---
* Active in other games.
---
**What we seek:**  
---
We are looking for players that are willing and motivated to participate in raids and the social aspects of the game. We don't just want people who can top the meters. Situational awareness, survivability and most importantly fitting in well with SD both during raids and outside of raids is of great importance to us.

Dwarf Hunter with Engineering and Mining.
---
Grab Fishing and Cooking as well to become a fully self sufficient Dwarf Mountaineer living off the land as you solve problems around the King's lands with your trusty pet.
---
Can someone explain to me what the point of the virigin vs Chad meme's are?
---
Even if you are a super hardcore raiding guild, you don’t need fearward because your tank will be able to manage the stance dance. All it takes is one player to be able to buff anyways, so there will certainly be spots for non-dwarf priests. Humans have the benefit of the free heal that dwarves also have, so you’ll be totally fine.
---
Ah, that's why I only remember it vaguely! :P
---
Those are "quest flight paths" though. Not actual flight paths. If you do not have quest active, you won't be able to fly there.
---
Like I said just block the people posting the threads and you won't have to see them.
---
I don't think you understand why they're using layering.
---
There are no macros that do this period
---
Dude same, i'll be hardcore grinding levels one day, and having fun with my buds the next! That's what I think this game is all about; being able to play the way you want or feel like.
---
Actually, serious question, why were the options layering and full on sharding? Couldn't they just heavily shard elwynn/durotar etc then tome it back for barrens and westfall and then way back for the next zones then off? I don't think anyone is concerned with an overload of peace loom and copper ore, and why do high levels zones need shard/layered at all
---
&gt; Blizzard adding layering is simply another failure to understand classic MMORPG's and what made them fun. 
---
It's the best solution to a problem of a massive flood of players at release, server stability and avoiding massive amounts of dead realms.
---
It's just straight up maths. It doesn't matter if there are 5000 people on the server or 50,000. The number of super hardcore players doesn't magically increase with the entire population.
---
If a server has 50 "super hardcore" players that hit 60 in under a week, and farm 16 hour days for the following 3 weeks, then the global number has no bearing on anything. The only thing that changes is the fact that those 50 people can farm 5-20x more resources based on these precious layers.
---
You need to look this up. Classic holy paladin into Google will give you so many links and guides for you to see what various tree options there are.
---
This is way too huge a question when there isn't a base to work with.
---
But if you need an answer, go shockadin. 
---
Job done.
---
There is much higher chance, that modern wow dies off quicker than classic, so if that happen, we can as well bury the whole company
---
yeah hes kinda clueless
---
Not really. There is no stability in life, all who pursue it meet only with disappointment, so it's an easy choice.
---
Will Classic release only in Europe and the Americas, or also in Korea and China?
---
the virgin warlock player  vs the chad hunter
---
Forsaken, Sin’dorei, and the Naga should have been a third faction. The horde should have had ogres.
---
35+ is a alt I intend to play until 35 and then just leave as a 2 crafting alt. 
---
With 2 crafting there's no room for the un of engineering, and the character is dead to me.
---
Sure but it's a waste to go back to your trainer at lvl 39, no new spells to learn.
---
no...
---
its not the dinos that you must fear, the the Mafia guarding them lol
---
I know my main, still trying to pick an alt.
---
If there are 4x layers, there will also be 4x hardcore players.
---
Druids in general weren’t great except for situations that needed a lot of flexibility. Which more or less is why they existed. Flexibility. (I’ve mained a dr00d since 2005 so.) #chrisfarleydance
---
Bruh
---
Not only that, there will also be massive queue time on the high pop servers. Layering may not be perfect, but not being able to even play the game is far worse.
---
Yeah that is hilarious. Battlegrounds, raids and dungeons are all instanced. That is a massive portion of the game content.
---
That was with players taking advantage of pserver’s incorrect armor/health values and incorrect pathing on mobs. The beta has shown that mages won’t be quite as fast on the official servers.  A mage could still get server first to 60 if played extremely well, but it isn’t going to be in 2 days /played for sure.
---
A consistent/persistent world is not a requirement for an MMO. Call of Duty is an MMO.
---
You are specifically thinking of an MMORPG
---
Yeah but you can unlock the flight paths while doing the quest so works all the same.
---
thus i am curious you see :)
---
cats eye is a crazy cheap potion and the human racial might have a long cd and a short duration but if a warlock where to know when a rogue is nearby its simply to know when to use the combination, furthermore pets in classic in particular hunter &amp; warlock pets where infamous for ignoring normal stealth once following a target, the only way to shake off a pet was through vanish since simply getting out of combat and using stealth often wasnt enough.
---
I'm deciding between warrior and rogue
---
Since you played both back on the day, care to share some pros / cons for each?
---
You say that now, but when the disparity between the rich, poor and middle wealth players becomes evident 6 months down the track, people will resort to buying gold just like in Vanilla. Only this time thanks to layering, the richest players will be even further ahead.
---
Boom there it is
---
How did you steal my meme so fast? Haha
---
haha perfect.  enjoyed seeing this meme before mods deleted it cos "omfg not relevant to classic wow, no fun allowed"
---
no call of duty is a FPS
---
PvP focused player who shows up to all the raids regardless looking for a EU guild for progression + bg premades.
---
If horde Im playing shaman, if alliance I can choose between mage, lock, and priest. Can adjust pick and spec based on what guild needs. 
---
Raidtimes: Week evenings are best, can adjust.
---
Expect to worse case scenario hit 60 by the end of month 1. I can cut that down to 2 weeks (take a bit of time off work) if required.
---
Raided up to BWL in original vanilla, want to go further faster now. Can tryhard and bring consumables if required. I like to help guildies, etc.
---
to ruin the game of course, because that is the only possible outcome of it. I liked sharding idea better at only the starting zone. 
---
its been tested on every fresh server of any pserver release, and the first HOUR of launch, people go outside the starting area, group up, and grind by killing level 7 boars at level 1, until they make it to level 6 or 7 and that is when you are capable of picking up quests. After that, it gets so spread out, that the high population does not seem to make a difference of your leveling. This is with 10,000 people on a single server by the way. 
---
They just need to keep their hands off of layering
---
then play without them, screenshot your victory, and gloat about it on reddit forums then
---
im sure people will care
---
I never liked Un‘goro. I never was a big dinosaurs fan. This time I will prob go for hunter so it‘s kind of my duty to farm there. I hope for some intense world pvp
---
Problem with that suggestion is that, what if ED 1, ED 2, ED 3 are all full, and when the merge comes around there are still too many active players?
---
I'm pretty sure it's because most of them were invited to the beta first.  People aren't happy with the bias.  I understand why blizzard did that though, they want to build hype and if that gets more people playing then I'm all for it too. Most of the streamers are very nice people just trying to make a living out of their passion.
---
So is Doom
---
Very nice!
---
Devilsaur!
---
Ohhhh I hated him in Classic. As soon as I got high enough level, you KNOW I went back there and killed his ass. I think I have screenshot story of that somewhere - me taunting him and then killing him and standing over his corpse gloating. 
---
Ah, good times.
---
Maybe because they've seen the game they created fall so far from what it once was? Much easier to decipher when you see the growth AND decline.
---
Azuregos is not in phase 1
---
Ok i see what you did there
---
sorry I dident get the joke the first time
---
ilvl is clvl+5 and is used for items from quest rewards and such.
---
Another layering fanboy who won't last 2 weeks in Classic.
---
Thanks for your detailed post and advice I really appreciate it. 👍🏽 You are right, I would‘ve never considered the Staff of Westfall as a warrior weapon but learned it during the beta. It makes things much smoother during early leveling. Leveling on a PvP server is what make me think as well because you are basically fodder for the other faction.
---
A lot of people will tell you warlock but looking at it this way , if you're only playing a few hours a week then for a good chunk of the next several months you'll be in the leveling phase, which is a journey on it's own I know.
---
So now you gotta ask yourself this, what do you want to be doing within those few hours alongside leveling? do you enjoy wpvp more or would you rather do dungeons etc?
---
For example, a druid is great in the open world and can fill any role in dungeons using only their leveling spec.
---
If your desired playstyle is more caster oriented both mage and lock are good options as mage can aoe farm very well and you can also solo melee type elites just as good as locks, so long as they aren't higher level than you obviously.
---
Now efficiency aside I feel like there are a lot of decently good options that can solo well , most people will tell you locks because they're fast levelers and self sufficient but that doesn't mean you cannot play a rogue if you prefer some wpvp action on the side for example.
---
Another example of good leveling hybrids is shadow priest , they might be viewed as healers only in classic but shadow is very strong outside raids, you can heal dungeons while leveling as shadow and you're a force to be reckoned with in the open world.
---
Leveling speed does not equate fun, and the casual style of play doesn't mean you must always choose the fastest levelers because they might not fit your favored playstyle.
---
Hope this helps.
---
How would you even hop layers? Just have different people invite you to there group?
---
Nah. People were clearing MC in greens with level 58s and 59s in an hour and a half on private servers. MC was probably overtuned on private servers too. Not to mention items aren’t progressive in classic, so getting a fire resist set is going to be incredibly easy.
---
Tears and Ben&amp;Jerry
---
That you mail things to and use to store things in its bank, while it sits in Orgrimar. You ca nput all the effort you want into your bank alt and have it remain a bank alt, even if it raids sometimes. From a lvl 1 bank alt that can't even disenchant, to a lvl35 bank alt with enchanting and a max crafting profession.       
---
As long as it hearths back to the bank after raiding, ready to accept mail and fulfil the duties of a bank alt, it's a bank alt. A bak alt that ca process cloth/leather you send it without having to mail it to a crafting character and then to bank alt seems more convenient.
---
Priests for horde are important since they are the only dispels. As to gearing you said it right, all depends on a server. There are no particular advantages with double shammy or druid. I mean in wsg double druid is good but you will have to hope for a pug priest
---
I always sell in full stacks because it saves me time posting crap all the time. I'd only sell a broken stack if I wasn't going to obtain more of said item.
---
you're autistic. They wont ban anyone for playing the game's mechanics like they are given to them.
---
4 hours of raiding once a week should be enough for the first 2 phases.
---
Why everyone thinks layering will stay for few weeks? I keep hearing this thing but all blizzard said is that they will remove it on phase 2... So we will have it for at least 3-4 months in my mind
---
Ah, there's that edgy reddit homophobia
---
i thought this sub was clear of you type.
---
Waaait, wait. I had people report that you do get FP to your capital automatically so Orc Starterzone -&gt; Shaman path -&gt;Ratchet -&gt; Fly to Org would work for bank-alts.
---
I think using questie along with Joana's web guide is the best we got atm.
---
Druid is actually a better solo class than rogues, this ain't 2004 people ! druids are one of the most fun classes to play in classic imho and I'm not even a druid main.
---
&gt; hunter pets are beasts
---
Well, yeah.
---
Hardcore guilds with world buffs and full cons, but no one is going to do that on the regular.
---
In practice they’re either going to do bindings runs or full clears selling loot or gearing alts, taking at least an hour, but probably closer to 1:30.
---
We had a gnome main tank named Kevin.  
---
I miss kevin :(
---
it is on pservers
---
HIGH STAKES INTERNET ARGUMENT HOOOOOOOOOO
---
"Only 10k responses"
---
Just fyi: 10k responses is huge for a statistical analysis
---
As long as layering is temporary it's not an issue. If they don't use it the servers are going to be underpopulated. There are so many people who will play for a short time.
---
However I worry that Blizz will may keep using it since it's such an effective population management tool compared to other options.
---
Engineering is your friend. Also afaik Alliance Warlocks in premades usually go for more damage opposed to the controlling role of Horde Warlocks.
---
There is no evidence to suggest that this will be the case, however. It's reasonable to assume so, but equally reasonable to assume the opposite. It's not like 1% of every server will be super hardcore. It could very well be a static number of players. If there are only 60 "super hardcore, 16 hour per day" players on a server, there's a problem.
---
Read a guide on each class would be my advice, you get a feel for what spells they use, rotations, and little extras like how important is downranking to that class and all that jazz.
---
It's very hard for anyone else to answer what you should play. Classic will not be about minmaxxing despite what Reddit currently looks like (it's all us people who can't wait and are planning all that minmaxxing to sate ourselves!) So just find something fun and roll with it.
---
You might even decide by 20-30 you want to try something else, that's ok, do it! Scarlet monastery sort of time you should have a good feel for classes but it does take longer than retail to feel out things for sure.
---
Failing that roll a warrior and be stronk. Bonus points if you are willing to tank 5 man's (don't need prot spec until 55+).
---
calm down virgin
---
I believe this was added in Patch 2.0.3
---
" Blacksmithing/Leatherworking specialization has changed with specialization providing recipes to make powerful items that only you can wear. You can now unlearn a blacksmithing or leatherworking specialization and learn a different one by finding the appropriate NPC, paying the fee to unlearn your old specialization, and then find the new specialist to learn a new one. "
---
 [https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch\_2.0.3#Professions](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.3#Professions)
---
Yes, please.
---
Staying loyal but it has nothing to do with nostalgia or a new experience.
---
&gt;Let me know if I understand correctly. So what you are saying is that maybe one layer is full of elite players who hit 2 days before other layers so they have much and much more resources, is that correct?
---
Not layers but servers. The composition of the layers is irrelevant as long as layer hopping is still possible. And you don't even need many people to pull this off. If we assume that the respawn time of a Black Lotus is one hour, and we take the five zones where it can spawn (Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands, Burning Steppes, Silithus, Blasted Lands), if you have one person per zone, you could as a group effort get a maximum of 5 Black Lotus per hour. If you have 5 layers, this potentially increases to 25. Depending on how many days this can be abused before "normal" players reach 60 and start to bring competition to the zones, this could translate into thousands of Black Lotus in the hands of a handful of people, potentially completely distorting the market for Flasks. As this completely ignores stuff like Thorium Veins (Arcane Crystals etc.) and other high level herbs. 
---
The question is not, will it happen or not. If it is possible to abuse the system, the question is only *who* will abuse it on each respective server.
---
I was like that for months till I found my "hook" on Druid   
---
Tier sets, every last one of them. especially the last one. Then I second guessed myself for a few months took a few classes to 25 shockingly it turns out I like the Druid the best and should have definitely seen that one coming. \*And then I sent the Druid the culmination of the mats and became the exploding/rooting/running scourge of lakes and dens\* All and all it was good time.

**&lt;Nebula&gt;**
---
(EU PVP Alliance)
---
**About Us:**
---
Nebula began as a small group of friends, some of who have lived the vanilla experience given to us in 2004, some of us haven’t. Some of us hardcore, some are not.
---
Yet the main goal for all of us is the same. This is a game we are super excited about launch and simply put can’t wait for the fun times ahead. We are a group of adults, 
---
from each corner of Europe. We love banter and a good atmosphere.
---
Guild reputation is important to us. So, whether your jam is smashing skulls in AV, grinding Timbermaw rep or competing with us in end game content, Nebula would be happy to host your stay. We also foster a very active Discord which has grown steadily along with the build up towards launch in August!
---
Our philosophy is: **For the guild, not a person.**
---
**Our Goals:**
---
Straight up raiding. Our ranks include many highly experienced players who have spent 14 years raiding on wow. Our raiding environment will be serious, yet positive and enthusiastic. 
---
If raiding isn’t your jam, our ranks also include many socials/ pvpers who are here for ride! 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday + Thursday + Sunday 18:45 - 22:30 BST (or 19:45 - 23:30 EU server time). 
---
**Recruitment:**
---
Recruitment has been very positive as we inch towards launch. We still have slots for the following classes:
---
Mage x 3
---
Rogue x 1
---
Holy Priest x 2
---
**Application:**
---
Please apply via this link: https://www.guilded.gg/r/EnNEavPo4j?i=x4oZnqGA.
---
Or contact Shane#2310, Zyepox#1969, Ethario#1412 or Nakkie#3039 on Discord.
---
That's absolutely terrifying
---
Day 1 I'm likely going to be running twink toons to the flight paths they need for the twinkling process, plus the BG entrances.  I figured that might be a more productive use of time than playing frantic "instatag" with mobs against 113 other clicking players in starter zones.
---
You do realize there are no where close to 40% undead. Orc is BiS for PvP for most classes. Alliance aren't bad locks.
---
Interesting, I still remember DE working from whatever the items level req was though so hope that's at least somewhat useful, you could always build your own as you go!
---
Someone will have a sheet somewhere online though I'd imagine.
---
Hehe had a good chuckle on that👍🏽😄. Not to imply I hate being a prot warri. I love to play prot spec, it is just a marginally less desired way to play the game for me.
---
Why oh why would you play this spec in pvp? You have no guardians favor, which is the most essential pvp talent for a paladin and you go deep ret, but have no repentance.
---
20/0/31 or 21/0/30 is a pve healing spec, which allows you to farm as ret. Nothing more. This spec is very subpar for pvp. Though, I'd rather go for 30/0/21 in that case. Vengeance is good, but if raiding is my main objective, I'd rather take the 5% holy crit.
---
If you want to be a pve healer and do pvp healing or pvp offense with one spec, please go reckoning with 25/26/0.
---
Those hybrid specs, which make standard ret workable, while being a decent pve healer simply sacrifice too much. You either stay effective in pve healing and become subpar in pvp with a 20/0/31 build or you can be effective in pvp, but become subpar in pve healing (with 13/7/31 or 14/7/30).
---
I will say this to any paladin, who wants to pvp without at least 7 points in prot. Guardians favor is a must have, if you want to seriously pvp. It increases the uptime of freedom from 50% to 80%, which is absolutely essential.
---
I hope so but time will tell. Some people will level incredibly fast.
---
Ive been asking about this left and right and trying to figure out how bad it is.
---
The consensus by those who've played enough lock is that for bgs it's not bad and for premades you even have the advantage. You really need pallys to be teamplayers and potentially fear wards to counter wotf. 
---
As an alliance non-premade bgs aren't great anyway so it sounds okayish to me. You are worse off in non-organized wpvp, but really how much does that matter?
---
Blizzard has banned people for less, “unintended use of game mechanics” is one they’ve banned people for. And no, if you as a player get people together and work to get one of each in a different layer and purposefully hop the layers to farm materials. THAT is abuse of game mechanics and should be seen as a bannable offense.
---
What people are saying layering will cause (economy manipulation) as far as I remember is a bannable offense.
---
After a couple of clears, with good but casual players: 
---
MC = 45 min from first pull
---
BWL = 1 hr
---
AQ = 2,5 hrs, full clear with optionals
---
AQ can make or break the timer depending on skips/efficiency on trash post Twins.
---
In a real singular server with no layers, lets say there are enough super hardcore farmers who reach 60 asap such that 5 are online at any given time for the first week. Obviously a necessary simplification.
---
Now 5 players can't literally cover the entire endgame. If each sits in an endgame zone, some zones are still left uncontested and the amount farmed per character is limited by their ability to run around the zone and check nodes.
---
Now add layering. Multiple by 5. There are now 25 endgame characters trying to farm asap. Now one character can't farm multiple distinct zones, as above, but they *can* farm 5 layers of a single zone just by alternating through. 25 different players is now enough to put one in each and every endgame zone. Now no endgame zones are left uncontested, and overall resources farmed per player goes up, it does not remain constant.
---
 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**    
---
Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Check [https://www.senilechieftains.com/](https://www.senilechieftains.com/) for more information!
---
indeed
---
I love your username
---
I need a macro that works for classic thatll shoot viper sting on mana classes and serpent sting on all others
---
Yeah. Let me guess, not in first patch?
---
That's the raiding resto spec of choice, so he was probably just dueling without a respec. I'm thinking I'll do similar to gear up for ele in classic, but maybe switch 2 more points into enh for the faster ghost wolf cast.
---
Yes.
---
An undead warrior is in no way a detriment. They are exactly the same as a tauren or orc warrior tank. No one really cares about troll warriors because berserking.... That 1% threat is such an optimization it's negligible. Comparing this to completely ignoring certain boss mechanics is not even close.....
---
Considering none of the other Alliance races get any damage racials that Rogues are interested in, I'd say Humans are the best.
---
For PvP, Gnome or Dwarf are both better, Gnomes have the slight edge imo due to extra trinket from slows/roots(good vs classes that rely on slows/roots like mages or druids). Humans are pretty uncontested for PvE.
---
They’re gonna try for about a week and then reroll viable specs. Lol.
---
Stop saying this.
---
A solution that sacrifices immersion in a game centered around immersion should *never* have been an option at all.
---
You sit there in your arm chair and say “relax guys Layering is the best option” and you don’t know shit about the options, you’re just defending blizzards least expensive move.
---
🤣
---
Yessss... I've gone from Lock, to Spriest, to Hunter, with rogue and mage being honorable considerations. I'm leaning towards Hunter but idk. The damage seems shit.
---
Take skinning for more vendor trash, don't train all your skills, maybe a little grinding but it's all very doable to get the gold pre 40.
---
Then take away layering, problem solved.
---
I plan to abuse it as much as I possibly can, just saying.
---
You can play in a solo world in PoE. It's nothing like an MMO.
---
its not stress tests, its a private server
---
The issue blizzard face isn't JUST population in the initial zones, it's the total realm population at the release, which is expected to massively drop down as tourist players stop playing in the first few weeks/months, layering fixes the issue of making too many realms to support a large temporary playerbase, which will solve the problem of a lot of low pop realms left when they leave.
---
The real issue is this means for each new layer, theres X times more resources, like purple lotus, there's only 25 or so spawns of purple lotus on each server, now there will be 25 or so spawns per layer, it is only temporary, but some people can abuse the layers to collect mass amounts of resources like this and then sell them when the price is high.
---
The avoidance of pvp ganking is a non-issue to me, almost nobody will do that unless you're corpse camping,
---
If you send me a video of sub60 people clearing MC in 30 minutes on the blizzard servers, I will pay for your subscription for a year.
---
Hard labor will do that!
---
Your hunterfriends who will be 40+ when you hit 30 will be able to help you
---
I think P2 will be 2-3 months after release. BWL is released in P3.
---
I would say if you already have a guild in place and plan to push for World First, you would enforce dwarf priest just out of convince. And those members generally joined that type of guild because they want to optimize fractions of a percent. It would be weird for them to not play a dwarf priest imo. But if you're just inviting randoms to a guild and a human priest performs slightly better than your dwarf priest, and for whatever reason you're short on healers, I'd invite the human 90% of the time, unless MAYBE we're super struggling on Nef.
---
RIP shaman
---
Then people will be constantly moved from layer x to layer y as people log on/off. This will be bad as you suddenly phase and end up between questers from enemy faction.
---
Rip shaman

That's exactly what he said...
---
Bang on, it's turning away from the light story as opposed to void or shadow explicitly.
---
Was going Shaman now I lean towards Warrior. Got a group of 35 friends to start a guild and growing by the day. Im one of the senior players and probably a good pick for a maintank. Need a farm alt tho.
---
&gt; Also gearing is a little bit wonky, since PvP pieces are mostly enh gear, plus casters in raids won't hand you over their loot.
---
On the contrary, it's actually easy to get ahead of the curve during MC+BWL due to tier pieces, deep earth shoulders, massive armor shields and the odd Lok'Amir chance.
---
&gt;  If you have 4 layers, you have 4 times the resources, but also 4 times the players, so what is the deal with it?
---
Imagine WoW server with 6k players. This server has essentially one "layer". Everything is normal.
---
Now imagine a WoW server with 6k players, but two layers 3k each. Two layers means twice as many Black Lotuses, twice as many Thorium, twice as many Devilsaurs and - perhaps most importantly - half as much competition.
---
BFA is that way bro
---
have my upvote!
---
Mighty dwarf*
---
Or possibly mighty mouse :P
---
You're right, i read "Funnily enough sharding would actually be better" as layering.
---
&gt;I didn’t say he can’t make any statements he wants... I merely said it’s dumb to make statements based on partial knowledge
---
but the man commenting is literally one of the 3 most important developers of VANILLA WOW.
---
I'd say his opinion is worth A LOT even assuming he's only got partial knowledge.
---
Sulfuras is balance druid weapon!
---
i did not make a post referring to the majority of hunters as mouthbreathers (hostility?). i was simply offering a suggestion on how you could demonstrate your skill expression, since that seems to be something YOU value.
---
have a great day
---
Probably too late but does the large door in BRD (the one you can turn and walk across the top) have a moving animation?
---
For a pure pve healing spec, I'd go 30/21/0, like this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzgRxxGp0Mu
---
* Don't underestimate lasting judgement. Light and wisdom are very powerful judgements and if your raid has no ret or prot, the holies should keep those judgements on the bosses. Lasting judgement makes it easier on the holy paladin to do this.
---
* Blessing of Sanctuary is a very powerful blessing and any pure pve holy paladin going this deep into prot should get it. 
---
* For pvp, you should take redoubt instead of imp devo. Imp devo barely does anything, so it should be only used in a pure pve holy spec, redoubt is very useful in pvp.
---
Leveling an alliance warlock on a PvP server is challenge of its own. Undead racial is huge since every undead has it and it works to break the effect as well unlike fear ward that only dwarf priest can cast and can be dispelled by two classes on horde side. 
---
Horde doest have to worry about fear counters and orcs have +25% stun resist to help via rogue, you nemesis. 
---
A lot of things that are simple for horde is much harder for alliance warlock because of the above.
---
And it takes up more space and letters, a system can easily distinguish 14 and 23 but adding two letters to tell if its am or pm....now that just....american...
---
Enchanting has the most potential as if you drop some rare recipe you can charge lot of gold.
---
Like if you're the first to drop the +30SP or one of the hand enchant from AQ you're going to make hundred if not thousand of gold in a few days.
---
Those don't work anymore. You can't have an "if" modifier
---
I hear you, this sub is toxic as fuck everytime I post something
---
Maybe herb/alchemy for some potions to help during the leveling (especially casual mage) and of course some gold
---
#MooToo
---
No, they just used the world bosses in phase 2 as an example of something that layering would need to be stopped for.  In other words, phase 2 is an upper limit on the lifetime of layering, but it's possible that it will be gone much earlier.
---
&gt;Then people will be constantly moved from layer x to layer y as people log on/off. This will be bad as you suddenly phase and end up between questers from enemy faction.
---
You're right, I should have said "Best case scenario for the economy". Obviously, any amount of layering / sharding / phasing is bad for the user experience and takes them out of the immersion, completely separate from any possible effects on the economy of a server.
---
Mage and lock maimed a mage in vanilla and really liked it and i was always interested in locks. Im leaning mage because I really only enjoyed vanilla and I haven't played since really so I'm not burnt out on it. Lock maybe to try to experience everything somewhat fresh. On pservers I like playing the lock it just feels kind of slow and clunky probably just not knowing the class in and out. The mage however I was able to jump in to wsg in preBiS and kill people in naxx gear which I not going to lie did sway me back to my roots. That being said the locks sets look way better imo than mage gear but to each their own I suppose.
---
Many raidtanks were fury or part fury anyway. it's more a question of player skill than spec.
---
23:00 in Portugal then. Ha, I will be lvl 60 when the rest join in!
---

Me too so he sorts by new and just steals everything
---
on lightshope. sorry forgot about to adress that
---
They would only merge layers as the player count warrants.
---
My meme got 5 upvotes but his got 600
---
Watch out, SJWs are on your ass
---
Leather working can actually generate good afk gold buying stacks to craft and vendor items when prices fall beneath a certain amount.
---
Good whilst waiting for raid to start or in downtime/eating etc.
---
I think WotF is worse than fear ward, longer cd but can't be dispelled and can be used when affected by fear and much more undead than dwarf priests.
---
You can still use grenades and fear to get some time against the fear immune undead, probably best to dot them up for ~2-3 seconds then use a death coil (which works since it is horror not fear) then land a new fear at the end of the death coil.
---
On the other hand, alliance have paladins with blessing of protection and hammer of justice. Both abilities could be used to help keep some undead away from the warlock when they pop WotF then they  can safely be feared or seduced again.
---
Why is hunter solo farming DMT seen as a exploit  and bad for economy, and mage brd or dme farm is fine? 
---
What is the real problem? Ability to solo a 60 dungeon or economy inflation? 
---
And anyway, wherever your answer is, farm methods that have a higher income than the “usual” won’t break the economy....
---
Need warrior and warlock next please :D
---
You're doing gods work.
---
But let's blow it out of proportion while we still can!
---
I want this comment to be this subreddits banner when the servers aren't available on launch week :\^)
---
Roll alliance, generally people like to help more there, obviously not always true but it's a general rule.
---
I think it has nicer zones too to run around and get to know everything (start human, goldshires great) and the cities are amazing.
---
I would say just join a social guild you see advertising. It won't be the best guild ever but it will be newb friendly and you can ask loads of questions.
---
Honestly don't worry about end game, you will probably create multiple characters, get them to the 30s and run some scarlet monastery instances and try new ones out.
---
When you do hit endgame there's a lot of 5 man content to run to get ready for raids (and be stronger in PvP). You can do battlegrounds once they get released but I'd stick to pve to start with as a main focus. Everyone enjoys a bit of side PvP though, fighting horde whilst levelling (if on PvP server, I'd advise it even if it gets frustrating if you get camped, adds to the experience).
---
Mostly just enjoy the adventure. Levelling to max takes a long time in classic, it's really an adventure to enjoy don't just be thinking of endgame, discover the game and it's quirks.
---
They could just merge low pop servers, when they appear. jesus fucking christ. So many problems in wow come from them refusing to resort to this simple natural solution.
---
Cross server bgs came, why? cos low pop server having no queues, LFD (low pop server strugling to find a group, let ppl find stuff cross server), lfr, sharding phasing, cross server fucking everything. ppl, jumping, porting around. and the world is ruined.
---
Mmo requires to have a healthy lively SERVER world population. Instead of merging servers, they resort to all these fucked up layering/phasing/porting/crossrealm technologies that break the feeling of the game.
---
P2 is Dire Maul and world bosses.
---
What will happen is going to depend on statistical analysis of realm populations and what they will stabilize at. If realm pops stabilize too high they'll have to split realms and if they are too low they'll merge them. Having to split realms is far worse than having to merge them but the lower the realm pop cap the more merging they'll have to do.
---
So what they do and when they do it is going to depend on what their data shows. There is no predicting that.
---
In vanilla, Innervate was a resto only talent ability beyond the 20 point mark. A balance Druid with 51 points in balance could not cast innervate.
---
I feel like I need to make a copypasta or something to respond to this. Almost everyone on here believes layering is going to eliminate crowding in the starting zones.
---
Layering does NOT seriously affect population in the starting zone. Layers contain the population of an entire vanilla server - on launch day you will be competing with 3k+ people in the starting areas. Layering was implemented to solve the future problem of server merges, NOT day 1 overcrowding. People who think this are confusing layering with sharding.
---
I'm still not sure I understand. If we had 5 individual servers instead, 20 hardcore players, 600ish normal players, 2400 tourists each, wouldn't the hardcore people gather the same amount of resources on average, effectively benefiting off the 'dead weight' of the tourists?
---
Basically, this seems like a tourist problem to me, and not a layering problem.
---
Great question! Deep wounds is a low-priority debuff, so it won't push off any debuffs that really matter. In short, it can only help with DPS overall. Rogues likely used rupture because split raids do not use the same Debuff priority as a full one.
---
A resonable response to layers? On this sub? Most impressive.
---
In case you don't know: The upper rainbow flag is exactly the gay pride flag.
---
Many of us did.
---
raid tanking is really easy tbh(its mostly pumping out threat), the more mobs you need to control the harder it gets
---
yeah but that doesnt make this meme homophobic lol
---
So 5 french guys can run a Server for 20k in their basement with a 50$ vent cooling the Server but Blizzard can't?
---
No. As to why, several reasons: Warrior is love, warrior is life. Also, my group of friends needs a competent tank, and, well...I'm the only one they have, plus I enjoy bossing them around.
---
its his thing
---
I played a balance Druid in vanilla and was a herbalist/alchemist....
---
Appreciate it. Going to save it because I'll also be starting Orc and I hope to find someone else to no-life the first week.
---
Wotf isn't as big of an issue as people think it is. It's almost always on cooldown in bgs. And it is only 5 seconds, you can kite them easily or death coil. (Horrify)
---
You are correct. Even if people disagree and downvote me to oblivion I still say this:
---
People make layering way too big thing. Relax, it's there just a while. I think there is more important thing to fix that if some people manage to get couple extra devilsaur hides.
---
the whole life of a warrior is a pain
---
Likewise here. Tin was always the kink in progressing Mining and the related production professions.
---
&gt; 5 seconds is something you can manage overcoming.
---
Honestly I think an Alliance lock with engineering is better off in PvP than a Horde lock without engineering.  Toss a grenade right after you fear and odds are they'll WotF just before it lands.
---
foolhardy
---
Oh look.  Another thread on another topic that we have never seen before!
---
Look.  Layering is evil, but a very VERY necessary one.  Most of you sat through 4 hour queues before.  Some of us had to do it for weeks.  Imagine taking a week off for launch and not being able to play.  Or working a full time job (i work 7-530 daily) and getting home and not getting on the server til 9.  
---
Layering IS NEEDED.  The alternatives are :
---
\-  No player caps (hah good luck killing any mobs anywhere.... ever).  Take the struggle of collecting 8 wolf meat as a dwarf in the starting zone and extend that to every quest on the server (no thank you)
---
\-  Dead servers after players quit, and they will quit, in droves probably (no thank you)
---
\-  Loooooooooooooong queues (no fucking thank you)
---
They have put in a cooldown to stop most or extremely hinder the abuse.  I think they need to to go a step further and issue a statement saying that people that abuse the system will be banned or at the very least have their items taken / progess revered / whatever they earned taken away fro said abuse.
---
The fact is, is that no one here knows how it will go once the servers are stacked to the gills with players.  I keep seeing comments like "I wont have people to PvP against".  You don't know that.  You DO know that if they dont do layering, you wont have to worry about playing against anything but the login boss.
---
Sure they could, but then there most likely will be a couple dead servers in a year or earlier once the casuals leave.
---
It was very playable on private Servers that started with way over 10k.
---
You just gotta know what to do and where to go. And thats the Vanilla Spirit.
---
The stronger survives, the weak ones will fight over lvl 1 wolves.
---
Hard to wrap the head around in todays society where everything caters to the weak links, slowing down human development further and further.
---
Casuals/retail crossovers like layering because they think it’s like sharding and it will let them play on day 1. They will ignore your warning now and hand wave anything you say - and then when the economy is ruined they will cry that Blizzard fucked up and should have seen this coming.
---
CONSECRATE
---
&gt; it's 2 tanks per 40-man raid 
---
In bwl you have several places where you typically need more than 2 tanks: the add phase on razorgore, the champion drakes after vaelastrasz , some packs between firemaw and ebonroc, adds on nefarian.
---
In AQ 40: a lot of elite packs require more than 2 tanks, champion packs specifically have 1 tank per mob so that's somewhere between 5-6 tanks.
---
Lacking a bit of pterodactyls and hot springs but that’s the spirit!
---
Play Destruction spec. You'll burst like a mage and won't need fear so much.
---
Okay.
---
K
---
Cool
---
In vanilla my buddy really liked to start over on new servers whenever they were announced (like every 3-4 months a handful opened up).  
---
One time we happened to end up in a great guild with experienced guild leaders and we cleared BWL the 28Th day after the servers start.  
---
This is when it took 10+ days played to level to 60 and you only had Thottbot for information.
---
Righto.
---
Was going to shaman, now going to paladin.
---
I'd follow the friends, I did a similar path to you but inverted (started alliance). You will find another guild.
---
I'm going alliance though, it's where I started and I have friends going both.
---
come again when its 1-60... and even then its been done a countless amount of times by now...
---
That's not how it works. They've stated a new kayer is continent wide.
---
Then let's downvote it
---
Yeah I remember that was one of my favorite parts of DM, a few tin mines to grab while running there. I played on a Private server as well and copper was such a chore, it took me an extra hour of running around grabbing it at level 12ish before continuing because tin was EVERYWHERE
---
Not so funny when it's posted by a catholic.
---
Is your WTF folder read-only? Are you exiting the game properly, or alt+f4?
---
1. There is no point in going elemental if you are going to heal anyway, meaning you're wasting 30 points in your talent tree for spells you're barely going to use.
---
2. When you go 30/0/21 you're missing on talents such as Ancestral Knowledge (enhancement talent), Improved Healing Wave or Tidal Focus (whichever you choose not to include in your talent tree), Ancestral Healing, Healing Wave, Purification and Healing Way. You're going to heal just as fine and the raid will do just as fine without you.
---
so why post this?
---
He stole my meme :(
---
Agreed, they really are though, paladins don't have anything to stop their casts where shaman have two different abilities to prevent them from actions.
---
Thats not how their instancing works.  Did you play Vanilla?  Im not trolling.  Just a serious question.  Kalimdor has its own instance server.  Eastern Kingdomes has its own.  Dungeons has its own.  Raids has its own.  Maybe Dungeons and Raids are together, cannot remember.
---
  Every zone isnt its own instance.  Its not set up to be sharded that way.
---
so what spurred you on to make a post you knew would be both unpopular and utterly pointless ???
---
Dear diary
---
No, because literally the whole point of using layering instead of sharding is so that there is one whole 'layer' of the world that you're in so when you change zones you don't phase.  So your idea is contrary to the essence of the layering system.
---
That changed in 1.11.0:  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Innervate](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Innervate) 
---
Learnable by all druids.
---
Yep :)
---
I think the problem here is that you don't understand the basics of economy.  
---
You always have to compare to money going around to the number of players.  
---
And for sure there will not be only one single player/guild farming all the herbs.   
---
The number of layers will also scale with the number of guilds/hardcore players.
---
Shows a 4k game with a shitty phone picture, what a fucking tard
---
Cool thanks for sharing
---
its ezclap for me cuz my irl friends all nolife fortnite and the latest BR that will imminently fall off.
---
I just chill and grind, roll up a fatty, put on some music and do my thamg while they vigorously point their recticle at  shit.
---
Shamans too
---
Fair one, how about:
---
"Fuck you, you roidrage flubber rejects"
---
You will still be competing with 3k+ players on your layer in your starting zone. Layering does not, and was not intended, to fix day 1 overcrowding.
---
I hate the 12 hour clock system, really wish the world would switch to military time
---
If the server opens at midnight...damn... that's gonna be a loooong night!
---
Im normally a Horde all the way guy
---
but the guild wants to go Alliance for those sweet pally buffs
---
sooooo Alliance it is
---
#LF Horde / PvP / CST or EST / Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP Ranking
---
15 year WoW vet, excited for Classic and looking for a guild.
---
*As a quick disclosure, I will possibly/probably be bringing 2-4 other folks with me. I cannot guarantee their involvement, however. It is likely they will be involved in both PvP and PvE though.*
---
**I am a longtime player, from Vanilla through BFA (Every expansion played, many breaks taken though), that has tanked, healed and DPS'd through various classes and raids. In Vanilla, I made it through roughly half of Naxx prior to TBC release, as a hunter.**
---
I am looking for some pretty specific criteria, to better prepare for Classic launch. This is what I'm looking for:
---
-Raid times ending no later than 11pm CST, running no longer than 3 or 3 1/2 hours nightly and no more than 3 nights a week at most.
---
-No unaltered DKP systems, no pure Loot Council systems. I'm afraid I'm going to be rather adamant here. Would prefer EPGP, an inflation based DKP system, or either one with a touch of loot council decision making. 
---
- Adult-oriented guild. No hardcore PC culture, no hardcore edgelord  culture. I am not joining a guild that is either easily offended, or goes out of it's way to shock and offend at every turn. If your guild has folks who like to complain or act concerned with every comment, please do not send me an invite. The same applies to guilds that think racial slurs are somehow edgey and funny.
---
-Somewhat "established". Thus far it should be evident I'm looking for some structure. So please, have a core or structure in place if interested in me. I'm not interested in joining 5 people with an idea.
---
- Has intentions of entering MC 1 month after release.
---
- May edit this to include more. Short on time currently.
---
**I will likely be rolling Mage. My intention is to level to 60 ASAP, and begin working on crucial reputation grinds for both raiding, and profession needs. I will be rolling with Enchanting and Tailoring. Tailoring will eventually be dropped for Engineering.**
---
*Please DM me here, or on Discord with your guild details. Discord is Relleck#1524
---
Please note I may be able to respond to reddit DMs throughout the day, but wont respond to discord till this evening.
---
&gt; thinking of going holy pala at end game and collecting pieces for retri to pvp
---
FWIW it is not remotely practical to respec every week between raids &amp; downtime for PvP.
---
Is it a sin to be gay?
---
let me know in 3 months
---
Has no one told Kevin Jordan that Vanilla WoW was *literally unplayable* without layering?! Maybe he should talk when he is more knowledgeable about MMO design!
---
You're religion is an inconsistent joke based on a joke of translated texts that have been rewritten numerous times.
---
There is nothing wrong with being gay. There is nothing harmful with being gay. There is a lot of harm done being a part of a religion that has ruined countries through propaganda against contraception and traps families in poverty.
---
Warrior
---
World of Roguecraft wants to know your location
---
I dont actually see an issue with this, in this type of game.
---
This is not dark souls
---
Classic to me in more about time and effort put in, and if you put that in you are reward with a gear advantage 
---
that said skill is still very relevant
---
the epic mount is the expensive one. for the 60% one you basically turn in a quest for some gold and get the mount and riding skill as a reward.
---
good man
---
Sounds like you're a pve player who can't look past moot optimizations on a lackluster healing tree.
---
wotf + pvp trinket = rough. 
---
It isn’t impossible.. and you will have to put in a lot more effort (and sometimes it will probably be hopeless). 
---
Do it if you like alliance and warlocks - and a challenge. Though if you don’t, I would recommend another class.
---
It depends solely on with what kind of people you play. If your raid consists of seasoned veterans or people who have at least (successfuly) played heroic on BfA you are probably easily done with a single raid in an evening of ~3 to 4 hours. The raids in classic till up to Naxx are way easier than they are in BfA (heroic+) due to the simple mechanics.
---
yes if you dig there are some theory craft numbers where single cast could be worth up to 1k damage.
---
So it massively outscales Devouring plague
---
and summon people. and a free mount...join us
---
Incredibly easy?
---
Remember those words...
---
That is very unpopular opinion. Most people think that arena was one of the best ever additions to wow.
---
Why do you think multiboxing is an instaban on most private servers? Because everyone sees it as cheating and they dont get money from you like blizzard. If you feel accomplished doing it then go for it
---
Take a lap around Mulgore. It's never farmed out for copper.

He made pretty much all of the spells in the vanilla. Doesn't mean he knows much about the effect of layering on the wow economy or even how layering will work at launch.
---
which spec are you going to play? is it true healer is the only viable one?
---
Think people are seriously overestimating this.
---
People tryharded the game in 2005 the same way they will in 2019.
---
People who only pve.
---
#1276362828 post of this... 
---
Starting to get a bit old
---
Honestly I think there are thousands of players on here who think layering will let them play the game with minimal difficulty on the 2-3 days they took from world. I totally understand why they favor that, but they need to know that isn’t going to be how it plays out. For those players it might even be better to delay their vacation to start a few days after the initial rush.
---
Exactly.
---
The only reason to go BM as a PvP spec is to get intimidation.
---
For 5 points more you can get Surefooted, more chance for wing clip to immobilize, and the most important, counterattack.
---
BM and MM are mostly pre optimized, there isnt much that you can change to be most efficient. 
---
SV side you can always change between entrapment, Imp wing clip, or survivalist to go down the tree.
---
Rogue is by far most popular and also the strongest arena class in tbc. Human warlock gets stealth detection passive from fel hunter and detection active from human racial. Combined you have very good chance to find the rogue and stop his opener, which is basically auto win.
---
Yeah i super disliked this post
---
i dont like to see ugly homophobia in my wow :(
---
&gt; Layering is evil but necessary 
---
Oh look, another blizzard fanboy who thinks he’s in-the-know about layering!
---
Layering is the cheapest option for Blizzard, and the most shareholder-friendly.
---
Layering is one of the worst options for players, but the better ones were ignored because they cost a little more money.
---
Mate, you’re being so naive with your post thinking layering is necessary or thinking it’s even about you. It’s about shareholders. Blizz is giving players an inferior experience because they don’t think the game will do well and don’t care to spend much money on server merges/management. Simple as that.
---
PLEASE everyone stop acting like Layering is “a necessary evil”
---
I am a committed Christian and i find this baiting offensive and immature.
---
Ignorance and/or lack of other things to complain about.
---
Because they are catholic and hate LGBT people. Inb4 "I don't hate them but they are immoral and being LGBT is wrong.".
---
Err can you explain how it saves money? I assume they are using AWS which is a dynamic cloud service, so it’s not like they would need to buy physical servers or anything? A layer is basically just a virtual server.

Having same-sex attractions is not sinful, same as having heterosexual attractions is not sinful. It is sinful to act on these desires for example pre-martial sex for heterosexuals or any kind of sexual act for homosexuals. But having the attractions themselves is not sinful. Need to fight the temptations like all of us.
---
you have more than enough time to try them on...^(a private server)
---
Telling someone they don't know shit while at the same time saying that layering is more immersion breaking than a literally unplayable launch experience?
---
Your IQ is lower than your vanilla character level.
---
So then we have phase 2 with layers.
---
Yeah for sure. Was mainly thinking how much one would be behind a human. Ie if there are any differences from pservers to classic, that the cap on weapon skill, to reduce glancing blow damage, isen't 315 but 308 ( I have a memory of this but cant find info, maybe im just wrong). If so how much dps would that 3 extra that humans get turn out to be. A non-human race with a maladath would be capped if so, which would even out the field. But maybe im thinking about this all wrong hah :).
---
Why is someone an "SJW" (whatever that is) because they dislike homophobia and tradcath doctrine?
---
There should be only paladin.
---
Wait my friend, you wanna tell me the System they use isnt as good as the ... metric System?! Pathetic, begone you devil!
---
Yeh I literally can’t get the difference? They use a dynamic cloud based server system, there’s no difference between having a new layer and a new server, it’s going to take the exact same amount of ‘computing power’ to operate.
---
&gt; when you say "their vision", "they" arent there anymor
---
I'm confident that the developers Blizzard is currently employing would be perfectly able to faithfully execute the original Vanilla Vision without inevitably slamming into LFR mode.
---
&gt; I dont want current Blizzard to get any foot in the door, I want classic wow, flaws and all.
---
You'll never get that, because that doesn't exist. Melee leeway, for example, changes everything. Back in the day, we had shitty internet and toaster computers, so melee had to get a bit of extra slack. This changes the experience entirely. You cannot get to enjoy "vanilla" if you don't change a single line of code - and besides, Vanilla WoW was a game under constant change. That was known and acknowledged and celebrated. We looked forward to change and updates. 
---
I don't want anything that could be considered major changes to the experience. However, I see zero reason why Blizzard shouldn't, say, add a Horde version of the Winterspring mount rep, or even a cool new zone after Naxx has been out for a year and everyone's decked the hell out. Stuff like that would only benefit the game and keep the population healthy.
---
You cannot and will not ever get Vanilla WoW, "flaws and all". The flaws behaved differently over a decade ago.
---
Yes - you go and tell the guy who helped launch the game in 2004 that the game is unplayable without 2019 technology...
---
No they don't.

I started WoW due to seeing a PVP video of a shadowpriest. I got the game and made an undead priest but had no clue what I was doing. I couldn't take how much I had to drink water so around level 15 or so I made a new character, an undead rogue. About halfway into TBC, I switched back to my priest, got him to 70 and mained a spriest through cata.  
---
I absolutely want that Shadow Priest experience in Classic that I missed out on in Vanilla. This time, however, it seems my group of friends and I will be on Alliance. I did swap to Alliance in MoP and leveled a fresh toon, but it was definitely not the same as classic.  
---
Basically, I am going for a new faction leveling experience and a semi-new class experience.
---
I'm probably going to outlevel my IRL friends quite quickly as well, I plan on joining them on dungeon runs regardless of outleveling it though.
---
Okay, you have now attacked my beliefs without citing any source and also stating falsehoods. I can see that your dislike for the meme is only politically motivated, that you don't care about the WoW class colours rainbow joke and only want to hate on my post because you found out that I'm Catholic...very tolerant of you, I must say. It was my mistake to use the rainbow colours in these meme, I should've used a photo of a real rainbow in the sky and none of this confusion would've happened.
---
search for unbreakable warlord shaman on youtube. it's not BC shaman but it seems like what you're looking for

The irony - wants to make others the butt of the joke.

Cries intolerance when called out on his shitty worldview. FYI the memes don’t hide it, this one was just very blatant.
---
Ok, thanks.
---
The amount of resources available on a server is limited and (presumably) balanced around an active player base of about 3000 players. In your example, the playerbase of the server would end up at around 600 players, so the resources available to the normal players once they reach 60 are about 5 times as many as for people on a "full" server, so even if the hardcore players farmed quite a bit of resources for the first week or so, the "normal" players could catch up by farming themselves later, because the competition isn't there (a 600 player server is more or less dead). In the layering example, normal players who won't abuse layer hopping always have full competition once they reach 60. 
---
Another issue is the fact that competing with players who abuse layer hopping without using it yourself is impossible. Even if you level just as fast as the most hardcore of players, and even if you play a class that could gank those players and deny them resources, in a layered server, they could just hop to one of the different layers. Without abusing the system yourself, you at the most rule over one layer, or even just one zone of one layer, whereas on a single server, one person who is proficient at world pvp and actively tries to hinder those hardcore farmers could heavily impact their operation. 
---
Important in all of this is the fact that the number of those top players, as pointed out by /u/smith5399 in another comment, is more or less fixed regardless of the number of tourists.
---
I think this is interesting to discuss so please allow me to go into further detail. 
---
So let's say I'm one of the early 60's and not only won't face much competition naturally, but will try to exploit the layers to my advantage. My method for changing layer will be by simple messaging lower lvl players/friends to invite me to there layer.
---
So now that I established how, let's put it to work theoretically. So even without layers a farming method would usually consist of a route. A route that would start at one node/resource and then loop around many other different nodes, and by time you complete a full cycle, the nodes have had enough time to respawn(routes cover numerous nodes however not every node will always spawn). Thus one could endlessly farm this route infinitely until competition comes along. 
---
So we can establish that without competition, layering won't really change the outcome of resources per minute via the loop method. And since nodes are random, it's unlikely that changing layers to farm the same node will not save anytime compared to just traveling to the next node since there is no guarantee that the node will be there when you layer.
---
Now let's discuss what happens when competition for resources shows up(another player) and how players will be layering away from that competition to keep infinitely farming their resource on there own layer. This is probably the biggest exploit that I can think of at the moment but I'm not sure if it'll have a major negative impact. 
---
Due to layering away, it seems like it'd be impossible to monopolize a market. Things like the Devilsaur Mafia would be difficult to execute effectively due to having to control all of the existing layers. Maybe that's a good thing, maybe not. It does seem fair to conclude that layering will produce more resources simple due to multiple players infinitely farming numerous layers. So this abundance will most likely drive down prices compare to a system without layers, maybe this is a good thing or maybe no, again I dunno and it prolly varies depending on your view.
---
Now lets consider that some of the most important end-game resources are locked behind ~2 day cooldowns,(Mooncloth, Arcanite Bars, ect). I don't believe we were ever hinder on the production of these resources because we didn't have Felcloth, Arcanite Crystal ,ect. So resources like these won't be affected due to the abundance of the other resources.
---
I did my best to be as non bias as possible to list the outcomes as I could imagine. I'd be interested hearing what other think? Please share any thought if you think I'm overlooking something too. And lastly, what resources do you think can be best exploited by layering if you wanted to make the most of it?
---
Yeah, I imagine there will be very, very few people playing both games in parallel. Not in active, organized guilds over longer periods of time anyway.
---
So if you/your friends have already decided to move back to retail a few months down the line, I get not playing at all instead. Same as me, not starting on a fresh vanilla private server now, with Classic on the horizon. I don't think that's a unreasonable or unpopular opinion at all.
---
That is if you compare 6k server, but the servers are most likely being capped at 3k. That is why I am saying 4 layers and 12k people. Otherwise you would have 4 standard servers, with resources on each. On the other hand, the other option is 4 layers. The amout of resources is the same.  
---
6k player wow server was never brought up and never should be as 3k seems to be the max
---
There was this great addon called Dr. Damage that worked until cata, it was really the best damage calculation addon ever. You could simulate pretty much everything and know exactly what stat would benefit most to any spell. I hope it gets revamped for Classic... :(
---
Yeah yeah yeah you're all hot shit and gonna be lv 60 in the first week. Keep telling yourself that
---
Relax. No one wants $25 monitors. It's 2019. 144hz or bust.
---
Make Layer Switching only happen in a few places. 
---
1.) When you are on a flight path. (This is the easiest place to do it.)
---
2.) When you graveyard Rez.
---
3.) When you hearth.
---
4.) When you log back into the game and the layer you were on is no longer available.
---
5.) When you transition zones.
---
Then pull layering off the game as fast as fucking possible.
---
I agree with you, it is a very unpopular opinion. Dungeon Finder, Main city portals, Raid Finder were all "best ever additions" and now we know they slowly destroyed the game. Same goes for Arena.
---
I saw current professional arena players saying that Arena is what brought down PVP as it forced everything to be balanced around the 3v3 meta and removed any desire to just PVP for fun...... everything became calculated.
---
Not OP, but pretty much yeah.
---
It looks like spell power Ret can be done but it’s one of things that you have to work incredibly hard still not keep up with the good DPS classes. 
---
Holy is more than viable, it’s a great spec.
---

---
What mitigates more depens on how often and for how much you are being hit.
---
The only ones for whom mitigation is really important are tanks. They are the ones who are constantly beaten up for high amounts of damage.
---
Improved Innter Fire is super-niche as in it might be helpful in soloing stuff and in duels against melees.
---
I mean yeah, you'll be soloing quite a bunch in order to level. So if that's what you are asking for, then it might be of some use. But for endgame PvE and PvP (where your positioning should be what prevents you from being hit) this talent has very little usage.
---
Every life tap and life drain is a 'net negative' in terms of total hp/mana.  Also if you're going for no downtime your kill speed is much slower and your pet runs out of mana.  It's actually more efficient as a warlock to kill stuff a bit faster and use just the right amount of downtime.  Especially on a pvp server where you want to keep your hp/mana high and your VW with enough mana to sac.
---
Or they could play together from level one. It's up to them :)
---
People keep using this straw man argument about these ‘elite hardcore 1%’ players that are going to ruin the economy in the first week of the game. Seems like a pretty easy situation for blizzard to ban a handful of people that are abusing a mechanic. And if you say ‘well it’s not just a handful it’s going to be hundreds of them doing it’ is there even going to be a problem in the first place?
---
Games been up for 3 weeks, one player has 200 black lotus which is literally impossible to get without server hopping. Very easy for their automated system to detect...
---
jokes =/= intolerance you fanny.  can't you boring twats just piss off and go demonstrate to everyone just how awesome and virtuous you are in private instead of on public forums?  i'm so sick of this.  the moment anyone starts genuinely being homophobic i'm right there to call them out but it's a god damn meme on a forum about a 15 year old game, it's not the fucking spanish inquisition

---
Why not just fix the exploit before release? Much simpler alternative.
---
This will probably be the case, as I doubt an exploit this huge will be allowed into the live version of the game.
---
You realize that it absolutely does affect the launch experience by actually allowing you to LOG IN TO THE GAME AND NOT SIT IN QUEUE FOR HOURS?
---
Fucking retard.
---
It won’t solve overpopulation in starting zones, but it does let me log in without sitting in a 3 hour queue hopefully. I would actually prefer sharding (if they could do it properly) in the first few zones, say level 20ish so like after redridge/ the barrens, but the technology is shit and it just doesn’t work in retail properly.
---
Lol that guy's gonna be puking and wearing sunglasses for a week. Fuckin' sparked.
---
1. Forcing people to choose layer upon picking server and not allowing layer hopping.
---
2. Earmarking which servers will merge and doing traditional server merges.
---
Both of those result on one seem less world with no immersion issues and no layer farming 60 content
---
Its bad in wpvp: UD rogues/mages/shadow priests will kill you in situations in which you wouldnt have died as a horde warlock. Orc stun resist against nades is annoying as well (alliance-wide issue).
---
In instanced pvp/premades its not a big deal. Paladins and shamans are on the same annoyance level (dispel/blessings vs interrupts/tremor)
---
I was talking about the lvl 40 mount. I've never done it myself. I thought you only had to talk to someone in your capital city and then in Ratchet? Never heard anything about 10g before.

Intro: The foundation of AP is a group of friends that love video games, raunchy banter, and cannot wait for Classic’s release! Welcoming everyone – from the most experienced to ‘I’ve never played WoW before’. While we will be progressive in PvE content, it will be at our pace (we all have lives: careers, families, school, etc.). Will also have scheduled WPvP &amp; BGs events - because who doesn’t enjoy killing gnomes.   
---
Expectations: For any member it is to have fun and enjoy the game! Aimed at those that wish to raid, the expectation is to meet the raid schedule, come prepared with BiS/pots, and know the fights (or at least do some research beforehand).

I just can't be bothered to explain it to people who wont listen anyway. Already saw that there are people who explained why you just can't take the 1% argument. Go read their comments I don't want to inflate the thread with already existing information.
---
Im not sure why you tell me how to play, and i im not sure how you can compare respawning and having your entire world refresh anew on a layerjump. But as said for me it breaks my immesion to a degree.
---
Please, in all your infinite wisdom, tell me how you would fix the problems without layering.  Give it to us bro!
---
As a member of the great cheeseburger freedom land... I had no idea, pretty annoyed we haven’t switched as well.
---
And yeah imperial system sucks, we don’t even know half of it ourselves.
---
Yeah but the severity of it is going to be multiplied by the amounts of layers there are. And then when all tourist players leaves the servers. a very small margain of players are going to own the majority of the servers gold. Its going to be way more extreme then what the private servers had.
---
This isn't correct, the really good guilds when they aren't all out speed running does mc in 45 min, so it would be 90 min for a casual like you since you don't have the time to grind out a fast mc clear. 
---
Bwl can be done in 2 hours

---
They will release TBC because it's much cheaper.
---
I will be and it will be perfectly legal on the only servers still active in 2 months lol
---
Imagine... having 40 Players (no party) staying in Layer 3 in Blackrock... no ppl around...and 1 Scout in Layer 1 and Layer 2.
---
If there is a huge Alliance/Horde raid going for mc/bwl... they just get autoinvited with a macro and switch from Layer 3 to the Layer where the enemy is cming and totally destroy them out of the blue. :D
---
I will roll a gnome warlock and just fear twice :P
---
B-but muh server crashes!!
---
Okay, I assumed that the individual servers would be merged at some point, since a 600 pop realm has more pressing issues than Black Lotus. So we would end up with a single server/layer with 100 hardcore and 2900 normal players competing for a single server worth of resources again.
---
Basically, I don't see how layering makes this worse. I mean, what is the alternative? All I can think of is a highly limited numbers of servers with vanilla population caps and massive queues, maybe with limited play time initially like in the BlizzCon demo. This would probably keep the long-term-player to resources ratio close to vanilla (by scaring away most tourists immediately).
---
I do see the problem with layer hopping though, is that where you draw the line between hardcore and normal players? Because yeah, I imagine layer hopping between 5 layers might be 2x-3x as effective as conventional farming.
---
Vanilla. Classic. ...
---
"just over" = 17h
---
It never took 10+ days to level.
---
Well some of this information is not proven yet, due to level restrictions, but yes,  this information is accurate.
---
That 15 minute CD 3 second stun!!!!!!!  Whatever will we do hahahahahaha!
---
On the contrary, there are 8 shaman in a raid while you only have 2-3 hunters, druids and warlocks...who is going to be ahead of the curve gear wise?
---
Sad to say, but I won’t be playing for very long if layering comes with. I’d rather be forced to wait a couple days for the game to be stable than have a completely f’d up and abusable thing like layering. The thought of being in SW or Org without lagging because of layering is a horrible one. I’d prefer to lag, than to not see anyone.
---
Until you get to 12 AM/PM which a lot of people get confused, myself included

MMO with 6 players max in the "world". Also word being 1 instance of 1 map at a time. lmao

I had no idea, for those downvoting me, I am not the fucker.
---
Force people to choose a layer upon picking served, and do not allow layer hopping.
---
Layer hopping of any kind will ruin the game.
---
Ironforge looks like someone carved a giant dwarf face into the mountain behind it.
---
I quit because....life didn’t allow me to continue raiding. Children are grown so I get to revert back to a child.

&gt; or stop queuing for the day
---
This is embarrassing honestly. Playing only against pugs as a group....... losers.
---
They want to play Classic, not World
---
Of Layer-Hopping.
---
People should be forced to choose layer upon picking server, and layer hopping disabled.
---
I disagree, its gonna be launch. There'll be literal hundreds of paladins doing this quest, not to mention it takes you places you'll _have to go anyway_. Group time should be quick, and the run time is just a necessary cost, you can grab all of Menethil Harbor, Arathi Highlands, South Shore FP. Shit, after completion you can even make the trek to grab Chillwind Camp. Better now than when there'll be higher level Hordies. Plus, dps and damage wise there is nothing that even comes close unless you get a SUPER rare world drop (which you might as well save for later phases then sell) or a super lucky drop in BFD from the last boss.
---
I wouldnt say I hate Asmon, because I havent really watched him much, just that I dont really get it with him. One of those streamers Id strongly prefer not to have face cam though.
---
For Esfand, hes just an idiot and doesnt know WoW very well and presents himself as an expert and people believe him. Ditto for him on recommending him to turn off the face cam,
---
So it jumps from 11pm, to 12am, then back to 1am? What drunk kid even came up with that time system lol
---
Don't understand why the other guy is being downvoted.
---
Yes I understand to want to "future proof" your choice. But why don't you play a class you'd like in Vanilla, and maybe roll another one when they actually announce TBC servers in like 2 years ?
---
This sounds painful.
---
Does anyone get to play it? Never played wow, been playing ESO lately and I like the mmo pieces.
---
&gt; when we met
---
That actually made me kinda sad. I mean you should never look back and regret any decisions but on the other hand you will never know how your live went, if you married her. You could be way happier or way sadder... life is strange. All the best to you!
---
Keep in mind druid got CONSIDERABLY better in TBC.
---
Have you seen that grounding totem?
---
It's freaking annoying!
---
You clearly are not understanding this. 
---
Your experience, including queueing, will be the same with or without layering.
---
Layers are meant to simulate individual servers but one one server so merging is easier down the line. You still have 3k per world, whether you layer or not.
---
Please read a bit before you come in this sub, blindly white knight for Blizz, and display how little you understand this issue
---
The mistake was given equal focus to Stormwind and the Horde. It should have focused on Stormwind and made the horde be the big bad bad guys that they were.
---
Playing on private server atm, due to being unable to contain my hype, and just got to lvl 30 and went to STV.  And goddamn is it a shitshow.  Literally cant kill more than a handful of mobs without being jumped by some alliance dipshit.  And ofc it is always someone way higher level, and they only attack when you are in a fight already with mobs.  It really is a horrible experience.  I never played on PvP realms in vanilla, but thought I would give it a go before Clasic.  
---
And what I learned is that I will deffo be playin on a PvE realm....
---
Its anectodal but yesterday an undead mage 5 levels above my level tried to gank me and I got away as a gnome warlock.  He just got tired of the pursuit.
---
I just waited the 5 secs on wotf,  escape artist nova,  sacrifice when low in health,  healthstone and fear chain when he was getting close.  And i was not engineering.
---
A Queue is perfectly normal for an MMO. If you don't have the time to sit throught the queue, you have no matter on playing fast anyway, so you can start a couple weeks later.
---
RP servers in a nutshell. Or the basement in of the inn in Goldshire.
---
Just stop posting about it. This idea has been suggested many times before, and it’s not a good idea.
---
I think there is some kind of internal cooldown associated with layering.
---
Not sure of the duration, but hopefully it is at least 60 minutes to help combat the issues you have raised.
---
But your interpretation is way off and no where near what he asked?
---
Lots of people on here think layering is meant to alleviate the original rush or somehow act like sharding.
---
Its not. The main goal of Layering is to prevent dead servers after tourists leave.
---
Yeah it is really hard to predict what is going to happen until the one month drop-off can be assessed
---
You still haven’t explained why/how it saves them money, I’m not seeing it?
---
Between warrior and druid for me, friend plans on pocket healing me on his pala though so leaning warrior
---
to be honest, as a resto shammy, I just find the best geared DPSer and stick with them. They Kill and you heal. Perfect, and you mop up tonnes of honor keeping the killing machine alive.
---
Agreed. Fishing and cooking are unique in that it's a profession that doesn't require you to interact with other game systems, nor travel while griding in one spot. You have to move from lake to lake at the major milestones, but you don't have to compete for resources until you're wanting alchemical resources from pools in Azshara or Tanaris.
---
Then inns and cities become areas where people will constantly vanish or appear out of thin air all the time as you walk around. Not very Classic feeling.
---
People want one consistent, seemless world, like actual Classic.
---
Druid or paladin is the best solo casual play classes.
---
Druid have zero downtime and let you do a lot of different stuff. paladin the same.
---
I believe this is correct as long as you have two other people to help. So you could have 2 people go and get summoned back. Then the second set of 2. So everyone but the warlock has gone and come back. Then you summon yourself and hearth, you would have 1:50 if timed perfectly to take care of everything.
---
because there is going to be 1 Million players trying Classic on release week. Instead of having 200 Servers that support 5,000 players. 
---
They can have 20 servers that support 50,000. So when the 900,000 players that were only trying it out leave  they will have 20 servers with 5,000 players as opposed to 200 servers with 500 players.
---
I played a mage in late-vanilla/TBC and was thinking about going priest, so your post got me even more excited.
---
&gt; 2nd most desired class in a group.
---
What's the most desired class? Warrior for tanking?
---
&gt; what is the deal with it?

It's right in the title: Loss of integrity. The very reason a lot of people yearned for Vanilla was because you had one world for everybody; If you went to Winterspring, and somebody you knew, but didn't have on your friend list as went to Winterspring, you could happen across each other without having planned that. 
---
Or to phrase it another way, the world space was *dependable*, in itself consistent: What you see is what is there. That is ostensibly what Jordan means when he says "the world doesn't have integrity". 
---
You can tell me time and time again that yeah, nobody likes layering, but it's the lesser evil. Thing is, a lesser evil still *evil* (or in this case, gravely compromises the game world). I would rather deal with the inconvenience of overcrowded starting zones, if it means the game world stays hale - better to wait out queues for a few days or even weeks than to play in a permanently compromised world.
---
To be honest, this point about dependability and integrity is in fact so important to me that I'll probably not sub for Classic if layering stays in. That's not me "pressuring" Blizzard - I'm sure they would not care if ten thousand people vowed not to play if layering stays in -, it's merely me stating that Classic with layering is too far from Vanilla to be worth it for me.

Layering will kill the Peacebloom market.

Max rank inner fire is 1395 armor so extra 10% will give you 140 armor flat no matter the gear
---
Max rank PowerWord: Shield gives you 942 damage absorbed (including magical and periodic damage) so 5% is roughly 45 damage every 15 sec. I do not remember if it scales with plus healing.
---
In theory if a rogue is attacking you lets say 1 attack per second with all the attacks and offhander. you would need to mitigate 45 damage extra in 15 attacks to be better off.
---
Very rough math:
---
1% 4500 damage done
---
2% 2250
---
4% 1125
---
Now you will have to look to see how much 140 armor give in regards to % reduction and use the table above ..... if 1% or sell the rogue would need to do 4500 damage in 15 sec for the armor to be better. And so on. 
---
This is ideal 100% up time for both so if you get into a long stun lock armor and shield may not be able to refresh.
---
Moonkin should use the metric system fir extra superiority
---
Do you mind if I steal this for karma on /r/copypasta or does someone else have dibs
---
RemindMe! 56 days
---
What are you trying to plan?
---
&gt; 4 layers, you have 4 times the resources, but also 4 times the players, so what is the deal with it?
---
I think there are many issues with this line of thought, first being that population spread on layers and resource acquisition on each layer will not ever be even. You really can't guarantee an even split of population across layers when people NEED to be able to interact cross-layer. If you do it makes layering way worse.
---
Secondly I really think more people active should imply more and more strain on the available resources. The economy shouldn't be price capped or resource controlled, so you don't want resource availability to scale with how many people are around.
---
third and most importantly, Jordan put it brilliantly when he said it ruins the world's integrity. Why should you be able to get that one resource spawn or mob location when its contested in other layers? It cheapens the 'realness' of locations and availability of things.
---
"great Cheeseburger freedom land" topkek
---
Oh 100%. Im mostly saying it as a "If layering has to stay, then this". I would totally prefer there not being any layering.
---
Still allows easy farming of devilsaur which take hours to respawn, or rarespawns to tame or farm things like tidal charm.
---
There’s frankly no reason why layering should apply to 30+ areas. It should stop at stv and beyond
---
Or goblins.
---
Don't worry, I've dueled other warlocks who forget their pet can eat a fear for them every 8s. You'll be fine.
---
I've played it as a tailor/engineer myself for the +spellhit pieces from Zul'Gurub. With the right amount of downrank calculations and farming your dark runes from satyrs, you can tag along on the DPS game.
---
Idk bout that...sure hp is pain in the arse for rogue but 2 rogues stacking poisions faster than you can ever cleanse and having a kick/stun rotation can pretty much down any healer
---
Prot pallies too. Rogue is the only thing they can kill; holy shield and reckoning stacks and the rogue killed themselves. I guess it would work on fury warrior too.
---

Fuckin tell em!
---
How is it inferior to allowing layer hopping at will?
---
u willy wot m8
---
Fear ward is far less essential than you seem to believe. It's really, really not *that* big of a deal.
---
In vanilla, I was not a hardcore raider (only cleared mc/bwl/zg/aq20). Invites began half an hour prior and we were expected to be ready to zone in at raid time. 
---
Logging in at raid time or being in a city at raid time is the equivalent of being late. If a group is first come, first served, and you're competing for spots for your class, you better be on early.
---
To your point, though, yes. Guilds may advertise 7-10pm raid schedule, but when you factor in logging on, getting prepped, and heading to the entrance, 3-5 sounds right. Especially if it's 10pm on a Sunday and you just nearly had Nef.
---
The game's art style is timeless.  It was always beautiful.  
---
Retail is definitely the better looking game, but classic has aged just fine.  Nothing like those very first 3d games.  Go back and try to play Mario 64, FF VII and the like.  It's brutal.  WOW still looks great.
---
Mate you talk like Blizzard have an active player-hunting department, when all recent indications are to the contrary. Blizzard have laid off a ton of the customer service team over the last few years, with complaints and tickets becoming more and more automated to save money.
---
NO WAY will this company pay for people to review whether someone is abusing the layering system. 
---
It also brings in the danger of false positives and banning people who do nothing wrong but are in the wrong place at the wrong time and get phased a lot.
---
Alright, thanks for the numbers
---
Fair point. I’d still prefer a no-layer-hopping solution as well. I think we both agree current version of layering and layer hopping is a total mess
---
Lol, I hope you’re not referring to the video of the guy using beast lore. That has nothing to do with raid mob values.
---
Of course we can. We can translate ºF to ºC, pounds to kg, feet to metres, fluid ounces to mls, we even can understand American dates, we understand weird paper sizes, we realise that your week starts on a different day. Doesn't mean we have to like it.  😀
---
They are already adding a cooldown to swapping layers. Nobody is going to be doing it at will. Problem solved.
---
Nobody wants to get separated from their buddies just because one “layer server” got filled up before they could get in.
---
Your comment is better than a triple-scoop ice cream cone. With sprinkles :)
---
Yes...MC and BWL are cakewalks. The raids don’t start getting difficult until AQ.
---
I’m going through the Beta completing nearly every single Alliance faction quest, including all Darnassus rep quests as well as quests that give spillover Darnassus rep, and I didn’t reach revered until level 33 (I’m level 36 now with 1,500/21,000 revered). Reaching exalted by 40 is not going to be possible, however level 47 may be within reach using Un'Goro Soil/Morrowgrain turn-ins. Completing all quests up until that point will certainly get you closer, so you won’t have to do as many turn-ins to finally reach exalted.
---
Anything which isn't a beast wandering alone with no abilities is a pain for warriors tbh.
---
Absolutely.
---
Right now im just trying to help come up with a "If you have to eat shit, can you at least put some cinnamon on it or something?" kind of solution :P
---
&gt; you aren’t changing shit by arguing it
---
This is how we got the Loot Trading issue changed.
---
Blizz can and does listen to the community. The more we spotlight a bad decision, the more likely they are to change it.
---
No one ever said it wasnt legal
---
30/0/21 is the complete antithesis of terrible
---
They're already like that though. Inns are where people log out and log in.
---
Yeah, but most people have already been to SW before they get to west fall.
---
i think shield gets 10% bonus
---
I would really love to believe that, but its just not true.
---
Assuming the mobs are there (which i think they are on server open) people will be able to farm then within a week. Even MC is up for grabs week 1
---
&gt; I hardly doubt that Blizzard is going to remove layering without a really good reason for them.
---
The main reason to remove layering early is very, *very* simple:
---
- With the current layers, each layer would be underpopulated. Therefore the number of layers is being reduced until it is "1".
---
Which in turn means that as long as there's layering, layering is needed. Layers will vanish along with overpopulation. Overpopulation (that will be countered by layering) will be provoked by limiting the number of servers in order to be as close as possible to the "right" amount of servers once the initial wave of tourists is gone and the people that would eventually find out that classic is not for them after all are gone.
---
The tricky bit is judging how many people will keep playing classic. Blizzard has to make an estimate for this and set up the right amount of servers for that estimated number. Ideally, they will have estimates for various points in time: First weekend, 14 days in and so on. If actual numbers far exceed estimates or if dropping off happens at different rates than expected, they will have to either open more servers or plan for server mergers (of underpopulated servers where layers cave already collapsed to 1 and population is still too low).
---
There is absolutely *zero* reason to not stop layering early if the numbers for more than one layer are not there anymore.
---
Warlock sounds like the best fit for you.
---
Easy to obtain mount, 1 armor type, demon for every situation, and a only 1 role to worry about. They can also appeal to hard core players, but they're great for casual players.
---
Touche, just making sure you knew what google was in case you didn't.
---
That spreadsheet misses AP completely. Your weapon dmg isn't just what it says on the weapon, but it's influenced by your attack power of which you will always have some, even without any strength gear. SoC scales with attack power, SoR doesn't.
---
The fact, that SoC is nearly equal to SoR in your spreadsheet with 0 AP and a fairly fast 3.4 weapon should already speak volumes that SoC outperforms SoR unless you specialize for SoR with a spelladin build.
---
People have stated that Black Lotus is the obvious resource that people will abuse layering to stockpile.
---
Noob hunter here. Awesome macros - but I don't understand, what each one does specifically. Would you be so kind and add a short description to each? Thanks!
---
I know that feel. 
---
I think as long as your main is male, alts can be whatever they like as far as I'm concerned.
---
Damn that's a shame. Are people generally against blizzard trying to change make unviable specs actually usable?
---
Using this as my phone's background and lockscreen.
---
i think shield gets 10% bonus.
---
Not but the internet took 15 years to be in the state that it is right now.
---
&gt; I can't and don't want to raid for 3 or more hours straight anymore.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; Not in a hardcore racing guild but a more relaxed but still in a good progression atmosphere. 
---
This is kinda juxtaposition, hardcore guilds are usually the group of people who want to do the content the fastest, while casual progression is the most time consuming
---
Casual = shaman
---
Hardcore = warrior
---
Lol it's still the same time for everyone
---
Oh hey look a new idea about layering! Just kidding, I lied. Also the post directly below this one is also about - guess what - layering.
---
Just stop.
---
Often when people ask this question, they are actually asking two separate questions. Firstly, how are things while leveling as an ally lock on a pvp server and then how are things at endgame in organized pvp? 
---
To the first, we know from census data that ud rogues are very popular. There’s no easy way around it, locks are vulnerable to rogues while leveling and getting around your cc makes things even more one sided. 
---
At endgame in organized pvp, outside of av I remember neither side was dominant on my server and it came down to who was playing not just a racial. And locks were wrecking balls.
---
So, would things be different if you rolled a horde lock? While leveling, yes, especially if you go orc, like I did. But ultimately you’ll get through leveling and have access to your full toolkit. 
---
In the first couple of weeks most gankers will be around your level, most likely, but in time things will revert to the status quo with the majority of ganks on greys by skull rogues and everyone is equally susceptible to that regardless of faction or race choice,
---
!RemindMe 55 days
---
They dont want emtpy servers in the future
---
I'm playing Balance/Resto on a pserver with the moonglow spec. I can heal dungeons and raids just fine with this spec which is awesome. However, I do encounter issues with being a DPS when it comes to bosses. 
---
Going through trash and drinking in between is not bad at all but you definetly need consumables if you want to not be sitting out during a boss fight while you wait for mana. It has it's perks though. 
---
Just did BWL for the first time and was able to use my brez, innervate, poison dispel, and off heals to save the day multiple times which was very fulfilling, even if it somewhat went unnoticed.
---
It’s funny how I’ve experienced these exact arguments when old school runescape launched. 
---
Like literally word for word - and now it’s a bigger community than their base game.
---
hey if you want to play a pally, play a pally, just saying pally has no taunt...

Your going to multibox anyways, so if you pull multiple mobs and you die, you only have yourself to blame.

bruh
---
It's unlikely to be as bad as on private servers because private servers are *way* more niche than retail classic will be. Private servers, by being an out-of-the-way, illegal affair, attract more hardcore/dedicated (even if only in mindset) players compared to a game readily available from its AAA developer's launcher. Don't believe that this subreddit represents the common opinion of the people who will be playing Classic.
---
Cooldown doesn’t fix 60 resource farming issues and rare spawns
---
That issue was highly unlikely to happen and existed with Classic regular servers anyway. Is that your strongest argument to keep current layering?
---
&lt;Shut Up and Color&gt;[NA][Horde][PvP] We are a semi-hardcore raiding and PvP guild planning on weekend raiding, world PvP, and battleground premades. Our guild is primarily age 30+ adults.
---
Raids: Saturday and Sunday 3pm to 7pm EST / 12pm to 4 pm PST (very likely we won't need this much time once we get some gear until AQ). Optional weeknight raids for 3 and 5 day reset content may also be planned. 
---
Loot: Loot Council consisting of 2 officers and 3 rotating positions filled by raiders. 20 man content and PvP items will be /roll. 
---
Expectations: We want to complete raid content efficiently to not waste people's time. We expect raiders to be on time with appropriate consumables in a PvE raiding spec. We would like to start raiding 1.5-2 months after launch. 
---
Recruiting: We are looking for people interested in any or all of our guild activities, as well as more casual players just looking for some people to run dungeons and bgs with. 
---
Current raid needs (for casual or PvP members we are recruiting any class/spec):
---
Fury warrior: medium
---
Mage: low
---
Resto Shaman: low
---
Other classes/specs: closed
---
If you are interested please contact us on discord.

That is true only if each layer has less than classics max perserver of around 10k, for the economy ofc. As for the swapping layers to avoid pvp, well it's true in case you are getting camped or something, otherwise if the other layer is also full like yours, well there won't be escapping anything.
---
As long as layering doesn't last very long, this could actually make or break classic because they can overflood a server with 30k people if it is removed or it can work a miracle and avoid a dead server due to many quitting mid leveling.
---
The super hardcore guilds that did that was in 2005. These days competitive classic guilds clear much, much faster. We will not see weeks or months of progression. Content, even naxx will be cleared week 1 upon its release.
---
You really think they can have enough data to remove ALL the layers from EVERYTHING just in 2 weeks?
---
Ok
---
Some believe BC was the golden age and yet any time a Private server does the BC thing it dies much faster than vanilla..... 
---
All I can tell you is my opinion that is primarily based on feedback from top level arena PVPers. 
---
Plus keep in mind simply adding arena to vanilla without any balancing would be rough. Remember the changes BC made in order to make PVP "balanced" Dispells for all healing classes, no more faction specific classes, PVP trinkets remove ALL CC effects, diminishing returns categories to avoid infinite CC.
---
All of your comments are telling people to "just stop" which is completely worthless and adds nothing to the discussion. Why don't you provide some reasoning or insight in your comments?

The post below mine is a discussion about an idea that's different than the one I proposed. That's why I created a new thread.
---
Is it just me that thinks he looks like Harvey Weinstein? I mean... I know it's not nice to be compared to a serial molestor in any way, but it's uncanny.
---
You don’t understand MMO economies
---
Also Mob respawn Rate on that server is increased. There where a few bugs in the server that the mage exploited. So in Classic this won't happen.
---
so negligible in our calculation.
---
I want to stay loyal to the Alliance but with the way the Horde tended to dominate realms back in the day, I'm wary lol.
---
"He's immune to my moonfire spam!"

---

---
Agreed !

They realy must remove layering after the initial peak and rush
---
And no more after the lvl20 zones
---
While I occasionally dipped out for a few months, I fully quit in December of this last year (and that was just having poked my head back in for 8.1). Battle for Azeroth was just such a massive disappointment to me--especially because I was in the beta--that included my entire guild falling apart and friends quitting because they were similarly unhappy with the game. I had no one left in the game and the gameplay itself felt super unfulfilling even compared to WoD, so I was done. I've kept an eye on the happenings of the game, but even the stuff in 8.2 that people are claiming is 'saving' BfA I just don't get the appeal of any more.
---
The HoA grind just felt terrible compared to Artifacts (and those were *not* perfect). Raider.io becoming more and more prevalent made me dislike the idea of trying to get back into mythic+, and I haven't really been able to get into raiding for years now due to a health issue. I couldn't even really enjoy roleplaying any more with such a dumb storyline the game was going through. The game really just had nothing left to offer me.
---
You misunderstand layering.
---
Each layer is supposed to represent a regular server population. Not a smaller server. A normal one.
---
Locking layer hopping just locks population to a regular server amount. That’s their goal population anyway
---
That’s why you and 8000 other people feel the need to “create your own thread.” 
---
You just want attention and for people to be like “wow, what a brilliant idea, you are so clever! You fixed it!”
---
We don’t need a new thread for every idea. This also, like I said, is not a new idea.
---
So, back to my original point.
---
Do you have a macro for: autotarget, Hunter's Mark, pet attack, auto attack?
---
There's a new meta being developed and tested on beta. Spell power ret. It's got some potential.
---
If it doesn't work out, I'll be holy again.
---
Honestly if they committed to that, I couldn’t care less what else they do
---
I agree and this could be solved so damn easily. Just make ALL the servers pull from one database regarding the names. BAM, name conflicts will be literally impossible.
---
yeah you really can't rely on private server info, which has already proven to be false
---
For the first few months year, but when they phase out layering it will become a literal nonissue.
---
30/0/21 is not an optimisation, it's a whole different spec.
---
Stopped after leveling 5 levels in WotLK  
---
Returned for a couple of months after the WoW movie.  
---
Now im waiting for classic :D
---
I have quit on and off since Cata but finally quit for good about 8 months ago.  The only content outside of raiding is Islands (let's see how fast we can aoe down these mobs), Mythic+ (let's see how fast we can aoe down these mobs), Warfronts (an activity it is basically impossible to lose) and world quests (same shit, different reps)
---
There's nothing organic to do any more.  It's virtually impossible to die out in the world, except by other players in warmode. Gold has become meaningless as everyone has millions now.  The world has shrunk to a series of portals and/or queues.
---
Classic will be a full hard reset on everything.
---
I stopped playing near the end of TBC because I just got a bit bored of it. Touched a few expansions here and there, but didn’t like the way the game had gone.
---
When I realised they had butchered the talent tree system, that was me out for good.
---
And then they announced classic.....
---
Any resources that have a cooldown longer than the layer cooldown are unaffected by this change. 
---
You didn’t know this fact, probably because you don’t understand the 60 resource economy, or maybe you just couldn’t put two and two together.
---
reddit is literally a platform for creating threads for discussion. I created this thread because I already searched for one discussing an idea similar to mine and couldn't find one.
---
It seems like you should just stop using reddit, because I'm using it for its intended purpose, and you're the only one complaining.
---
That would be with OC, link to contact him on my main comment if you want to show some love and maybe ask your requests! I'd love to see Elwynn as well.

Hey, that would be with OC, link to contact him on my main comment if you want to show some love and maybe ask your requests! I'd love to see Elwynn as well.
---
Enchanting/Tailoring to get ahead of the pack and kick things off, selling low-level wands. 
---
Then drop tailoring for skinning or mining.
---
*Laughs in Hunter*
---
Didn't they say that you will have a 'home' layer, so the first layer you will enter is probably the one you will play on most of the time so you see more familiar faces. This means for me, that we will have a lot of low pop layers after a while?
---
Noted.
---
I'm new to this.
---
I also haven't factored in crit, which reading deeper SoC uses melee rather than spells. Which I found odd, considering its Holy damage. 
---
To sum up, it's probably only going to be 1 handers where SoR is worth it without getting Imp SoR. Which I'd be unlikely to do whilst leveling as it feels more viable to dash down the Ret tree.
---
As much as I want to not have layering in the game, am just trying to be realistic about it and how Blizzard used layering on their main game for too long.
---
But hey, keep dreaming
---
Now your solving a possible issue by making a bigger one!
---
Google how traditional server merges were done. It’s more manpower intensive and more expensive.
---
Yes if you want to have a character that is good in world PvP a warrior is tricky. I am torn between Warlock and Warrior for what to roll myself. One factor against warrior for me is absolutely world PvP. A geared warrior is a god when having healer support but if you are solo it isn't that great. 
---
 For world PvP between your 2 choices, druid or warrior, druid is absolutely the better one unless you are always going to run around with friends. Feral druid is pretty much the most fun for doing world PvP in my opinion. Just an awesome class with so many tools. Last private server I played on I played a feral up until 60. Feral becomes a good tank very quickly, Smoking Heart of the Mountain and Mark of Tyranny for example you can get pretty fast. Just a shame with raids, you can tank but you are going to be very sub optimal compared to a warrior. So most probably you will heal if you raid. If you don't enjoy healing I wouldn't roll a druid.
---
40 people who don't stand in fire, you mean 😎
---
I'm not arguing your points, I just think reality will be very different than 30-min MC and BWL clears.   Maybe after a year, but not quickly.
---
number of layers = number of players active on the server / max server population (~3000)
---
If they know how many players log on to their server they know how many layers they need for the world to feel populated but not overcrowded.
---
So, how many weeks do they need to figure out how many players are logged on to a server? Oh right, they can pull that number from their system at any time in a fraction of a second!
---
No. Server merges also suck because every server has it's own identity and economy. You can't just merge two economies and they'll be the same as before. That's not how it works. At least with layering the whole server economy is shared.
---
It does though, not to mention the person who made the meme is a traditional catholic that spouts “hate the sin not the sinner” bullshit
---
If the cooldown on the resource is longer than the layering cooldown, then this is going to be a non-issue in the first place. 
---
You clearly haven’t put much thought into how layering will work. It isn’t like every player is going to have access to every layer all the time. Not to mention that swapping layers itself will cause...guess what...a cooldown. 
---
You doing the math yet?
---
Oh for sure. 
---
I know I am personally against it. 
---
Sure in a perfect world I’d love a balanced vanilla but the realities of doing that are so difficult that it’s hard to imagine bliz pulling it off.
---
What's the bigger issue?
---
Yeah, but it does mean more than berserking on a tank. Like for onyxia for example it’s very useful.
---
Folks on this sub will say that locks "pay for their mount with their skills" since they are pricey and numerous (including pets). But if you're frugal you can skip a good deal of skills to alleviate some financial strain.
---
You can definitely check [OC's page](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7gv8e/welcome_to_tirisfal_glades/esf18sw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) and contact him regarding that if there is not explicit info!
---
No, but it's a best guess until Wowhead improves. If you don't want to use it, fine.
---
I have no knowledge of the OP's claim, but, in vanilla wow, there were portions of Nef's room that allow you to avoid the transition shadowflame that would normally hit the whole raid (such as the rooms where the drakenoids spawn). So, you can technically get away with only having Cloaks on a minimum amount of tanks required tanks.
---
You are a retard. Please take your retardation elsewhere.

Explain to me then why every sub has rules against reposting and beating a topic to death.
---
Oh yeah, for this very reason. If a thread already exists, just comment on it. That will stop the same shit from popping up over and over again, especially in back to back posts like what just happened.
---
It’s not.
---
The minimum is 3-4 days , that would be insane.
---
**&lt;Singularity&gt;**
---
**About Us:** On the spectrum from Casual Raiders to Hardcore Raiders, we are positioned somewhere in the middle. We will strive to be the most efficient raiding guild on the server to minimize the weekly time commitment for our members. Many of our founding members have been raiding in WoW since 2004. We are also an avid World PVP guild that will plan weekly events to put our hard-earned epics to good use. In terms of server location, we plan to be on a US East PvP server to provide reasonable ping to North American and European members alike.
---
​
---
**Loot System:** Loot Council. With a specific emphasis on rewarding high performing dedicated players to drive rapid progression. Additional measures are in place for fairness and to reward up-and-comers.
---
**Raid Times:** Will be Saturday &amp; Sunday morning from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Eastern Time. Once we have MC &amp; Ony on farm, we will be able to get this down to a single day, two-hour commitment per week.
---
We are currently recruiting all classes with an emphasis on ranged DPS and heals, but all are welcome.

so you want it gone after 2 days? great, me too!
---
When you look at the list of Pros and Cons for Layering and server merges Layering has more positives and less negatives.
---
Historically server merges had entire manifestos written by guilds why it is a bad idea and should be avoided at all costs and now we are designing the system with the planned mergers?? 
---
The economic abuse is real on the server mergers as well. Low pop version will have more materials and higher pop will have much less so during the merger both economies will go to shits..... the communities will be merged, all of a sudden I have 100s of level 60s I know nothing about, never seen, never grouped, never seen them in channels even talking. Even if you have 10 versions of the server human nature suggests most of the ppl will chose either the first of the last server on the list ..... forcing a character creation lock in order to maintain balance..... what if my friend wants to start a week later .... they cant join me on server 1.
---
I can go on and on ..... the only measurable benefit of multiple servers is stable community PRIOR to merge ... so 2-3 months? After that everyone will feel invaded by these other ppl.
---
Damn, how did I not think of this...
---
It's almost like the number of players can't decrease/increase and will stay the same forever!
---
thank you
---
I was mostly joking, but thanks for the info, shit changed so much over the years i didnt remember that.
---
Which is why layering still makes no sense to me. I get that you want to split the game up so people can play in low level zones. But why make as many splits of Deadwind Pass or Blasted Lands as there are of Elwynn Forest?
---
So you're just entitled. Fuck these dead servers because this server is ours.

LF Horde / PvP / UK/EU / Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP Rankings
---
30 year old typical brit, wow player both retail and private, looking for a guild for Classic to play from launch day.
---
Been playing WoW on and off for 14 years.
---
I’m experienced in tanking every 5 man, and raided up to clearing BWL back in the day.
---
I am looking for some likeminded chill people who are preferable UK based but as long as EU not fussed at all, I’m hoping to meet new friends and push for rankings in PvP.
---
I am playing a Shaman at end game both Resto &amp; Elemental (depending on what we need at the time.)
---
My priority in Classic will be as follows
---
•	Level to 60 quickly in phase 1.
---
•	Level engineering &amp; mining for future requirements.
---
•	Acquire epic mount before end of phase 2.
---
•	Respect Resto at 58 to farm 5 mans as an efficient healer until phase 2.
---
•	Farm BG’s once released – Push for rating passed Rank 10 (my highest accomplishment in Vanilla.)
---
•	Form and keep going a steady premade throughout all phases.
---
•	Heal or DPS in raids when possible and convenient for the guild.
---
Please DM me here, or on Discord with your guild details. Discord is Jackson#9199
---
Ayeeeee
---
Its still not being removed from the game, period.  They aren't going to do it.  What they are doing is trying to make it a  pain in the arse for people to abuse it by adding cooldowns and other things like that.  Thats the battle we fight.  We lost the war.
---
classic retailer contribution
---
So, for the first month, the Elemental Plateau will be unreachable, as well as every one of the 3 Tempest Keep dungeons? Yeah, that'll work and not piss off everyone who reaches 70 in the first month. Also, with your 'idea' of increasing the prices - great, so not only are these areas completely unreachable for the first month, after that, all the no-lifers will be able to complete their attunements and farm in peace, while every one who didn't amass 2000 gold is shit out of luck.
---
The community will surely love this, I agree.
---
How about you and OP keep your 'ideas' on how to 'improve' BC to yourselves? BC fans might also want 'NoChanges', you know?
---
Right?
---
They claim the raids will be too east yet refuse to allow "less than viable" specs.
---
&gt; The Black Lotus will be gone in the other layer. 
---
I was farming yesterday and got invited to a group and all of the herbs around me (and mobs) respawned when I joined someone else's group for a dungeon.
---
If Blizz is fixing this and making layers not duplicate herb/mining nodes then I apologize for being behind on the most up-to-date information. 
---
Still, the problem with spawns persists, and I am actually curious how layers will handle respawns with 12-18 hour timers.
---
Just dont sit. You will fall through
---
Did Critten/Journey sleep during his world record private server runs?
---
&gt; on launch day you will be competing with 3k+ people in the starting areas
---
Yes, as opposed to competing with 6k or 9k people in starting zones. Everyone on one layer will still be together, but it prevents multiple layers worth of people from competing with each other.
---
Kinda hard when our sub deletes 90% of posts about layering. It kind of creates an illusion, where it appears as if everybody is fine with layering, when this sub would really be flooded daily with people justifiably upset.
---
I want to be decent in both BGs and endgame PvE without to respec every single time
---
Which class can do it other than SM/Ruin Warlock?
---
Everyone is funny in its own way.
---
You can already download classic.
---
No, I posted this because I searched and couldn't find a thread like this already posted. If the suggestion of having a shared namespace between eventually-merged servers was already posted then I'm sorry for wasting your time.
---
So your concern is the over abundance of resources, correct?
---
No they all merge
---
She summoned Sargeras to the world and tried to sell-out the Night Elves under her to the demons. Then she got corrupted by the Old Gods and starting throwing the Naga out into the world to take it over.
---
Now she's under N'zoth and is trying her best to destroy the Alliance and Horde in her domain as of right now.
---
On the first weekend no one will be 60 lmao. Let’s say 100% won’t be.
---
Can someone tell me the most important macros here ? I'm not huge into macros tbh, so I'd only like to try the essential ones at first
---
do you really not get it? ($£¥¢€)
---
If you compare with vanilla, Its 4x the resources for the same amount of players as before. All youre doing is creating new instances of the world including resources, all pouring onto the same auction houses. Layers dont have different auction houses. Therefore its 4x the economy for the same amount of people on a server as their used to be.
---
&gt;So you are saying only 1 layer will have hardcore players and the rest will have only casuals or?
---
People can change layers.
---
This is what I mean, if you have no idea how the system works maybe you should learn a bit about it before jumping into a discussion on the internet.
---
Yes, but I wasn't!
---
Know of any info explaining all of this? I'm about to max my shit out
---
Why would be bulk items become cheap? There might be 4 times them but there's also 4 times the demand. Prices are dictated by supply and demand. As long as the ratios stay nearly the same then it shouldn't have a big effect. Only thing is that the most hardcore players can probably earn money faster than they normally would (and that's money away from other players, not extra, so it's divided differently).
---
It doesn't have to be balanced nor does it need rewards.
---
Yeah I've served my time on PvP servers, I know it's "part of the experience" but I just don't have time for it in an already time intensive game.
---
The voidwalker helps, but fear+dot is what can really help you take down an elite that would otherwise require a group.
---
I get what you're saying but I think though that macros really only help so much. 
---
I was a hunter guild officer back in wrath. We usually had 2-4 hunters on the regular roster. Part of my job (yes lol) was to help maximize their abilities to push DPS (or utility) I had one guy who could put out really good DPS but he just didn't have the skill to pull of more of the high level utility abilities hunters would bring to a raid. 
---
Perfect example was the lady Deathwhisper right in ICC. The hunters would gather the adds, Misdirect them to the OT and help burn them before switching back to the boss. 
---
We gave him all the tools and the coaching (including the focus macros, MD macros, target swaps) he just couldn't do it. We actually had to pull him off the right side adds completely and do something else to manage those adds. 
---
He was a good hunter in some regards, weak in others. The point I'm making here is that macros here didn't bridge the gap between good and great (not that I'm a great hunter)
---
I don't understand your point. Controlling the AH you can do on every server regardless of the number of players.  
---
It is even easier to control the auction house on a server without layering then on a server with multiple layers because the number of players is lower.
---
Sounds like a terrible raider who would expect 39 other people to sit around and wait for you to go fuck around on the auction house.
---
Only ever since I first played this game like 10-15  years ago
---
NA Alliance PvP - dwarf priest and human warrior duo (good friends) looking for a semi-hardcore raiding guild.  We want to be clearing raid content with competent players in the first couple weeks but don’t expect to be pushing for world firsts and not overly annoying about world buffs for simple content.  
---
Raids Tuesday and Thursday with a hard stop at 11pm eastern.  
---
We both plan to no life it starting the Friday after launch.  Hitting 60 in week 2 and running dungeons with an organized group/groups for pre-bis.  
---
We both have AQ experience and are both avid pvpers.
---
that will really suck if they implement realm transfers from PvE to PvP...
---
:c
---
Good to know you can reach lvl 40 with less than an hour per level in average haha
---
Been raiding for 12 years start time has always meant when we start pulling. 
---
People who login at raid time typically need about 15 minutes to arrive and summons. Etc
---
Rogues can solo a lot... even bosses in BRD that a Paladin can't even reach by themselves.
---
Lol what? Warriors are fine without support. This myth is being thrown around is insane. You can easily close gaps with charge/intercept. The only true class that will fuck you is a mage. And even then, a good war that can spell reflect will do serious damage to the mage.
---
I quit during Cata... But the reason actually was frustration. My guild had cleared Firelands(?) on normal and had started attempting the same on Heroic... with little success. (4 hours of wiping on the 1st boss without any measurable progress throughout the many tries).
---
Our top-DPS was upset with everyone else and wanted to leave for a more competent guild. I was forced to spec DPS as a priest, which I really didn't like and didn't have the gear for. So while my DPS was better than average, it was nowhere near our top-dude... but in order to kill the first boss before the enrage all of our DPS would have to be at his level.
---
So I said: Screw this, I don't enjoy drama, arguing, allegations and frustration! For what? Beating the content we've already beaten just in more difficult?
---
I tried out MoP again. But that's the expansion that introduced LFR... which completely ruined my incentive for raiding. The whole concept of having difficulty-levels for the same content breaks the whole sense of progress and immersion.
---
Also by that point expansions had become such a routine and everytime the game changed completely making everything you accomplished before basically useless.
---
What I liked about classic was it's consistency. Content was either easy or difficult based on the content itself and not the difficulty-level you picked. You knew that your progress meant something and wouldn't be erased by the next patch.
---
What's funny about it?
---
Hmmm /shrug. Maybe it was a thing private servers never added? Who knows. Could be entirely knew, if that's the case this will just open up a whole new barrell of monkeys.
---
I’m still not fond of the “where are you?” “Im by the mailbox.” “No you’re not...”
---
**This** is the hard evidence I was looking for in the first place (regardless of whether I end up using the level 10 quest or not). Thank you.
---
I believe this is roughly 10 hours faster to 40 than Joana's WR run.
---
Yes indeed. I hope I enjoy it as much as I used to, but preferably without being addicted lol.
---
So you just reminded me that we still have over a month to wait.
---
Jesus all these posts are like telling me what time it is every minute while at work.
---
What has autism to do with this? lol
---
*&gt; If my friend is on Argus, I want to be able to play with my friend on Argus, not have to wait a few weeks because my friend is on Argus-4"*
---
 no, you just pick to log onto Argus 4 when you log on. Your character would be locked to Argus but free to join what ever sub server aka layering without instant hopping.
---
Most people take 48+ hours to 1-40.
---
I've been gaming online since 1999 and I've never had an issue with coming up with a unique name, even on websites and games where millions of users share the same namespace. Perhaps my solution is insensitive to people who haven't as many unique names for their characters as I have. Thank you for the feedback!
---
"Ideally, you'd merge two low-pop servers with similar economies, to create one high-pop server." 
---
I though the merger clusters are predetermined for Guild names, character names? Ultimately all servers in a "cluster" would need to merge, right? 
---
Server transfer should be last resort and again you should not have a solution in mind with server transfer later on. I actually think they will have to do a server splits once the dust settles down. But I think server splits are a more voluntary unlike mergers. 
---
The invasion of 1 mil level 1-20 that you can ignore VS 100 level 60s you know here to stay and will be in your face day in and day out. 
---
I don't believe in flaming, I would rather try establish a dialogue.
---
I strafe and turn the camera a bunch during 5-8, would that mess up the Classic range stuff? Don't have backwards bound
---
If the beta is any hint, they are layering all the way to 60, which makes no sense to me. Wish we had sharding in starting zones and could get this shit over with.
---
Yeah and grounding, ele is great against mages
---
Gonna be hard to sleep with how hyped youre gonna be though lol
---
Improved Healing Wave reduces the cast time of Lesser Healing Wave by 33% which is quite critical when you have to react fast and Nature's Swiftness is on cooldown, also tanks aren't the only thing you have to heal.
---
Because the hardcore player : casual player ratio is nonlinear. The top 1-2 guilds will have unlimited resources and will have control of many economies even in just the first few weeks.
---
They could just make black lotuses BoP Until phase 2, some of the problem solved.
---
What if I have friends or alt accounts that abuse it. Say you change the farming method to:
---
Run to first node of loop. 
---
Mine
---
Get invite friend #1
---
Get invite friend #2
---
Get invite friend #3
---
Get invite friend #4
---
Get invite friend #5
---
Move to next node and repeat. 
---
I think this method is where the layer could potential be problematic but I’m ignorant to how it all works so maybe it’s a non-issue.
---
Armchair mmo economist? That's a first I guess.
---
This seems very optimistic. Those times can be pulled by an overgeared hardcore guild, but not by casual/semi-hardcore players.
---
When MC was current content, my guild still needed 2-3h to clear it entirely and we were the #1 guild on the server (albeit a server which never had anything to do with early boss kills).
---
Nope
---
Gurubashi arena can be that now......right? I mean it was designed with that exact idea in mind.
---
I thought 225 is required for level 60 gear DE?
---
If the cooldown to swap layers is shorter than black lotus spawns, and devilsaur spawns, what’s stopping people from abusing the system? A 5 minute cooldown wont cut it.
---
&lt;From The Ashes&gt; are recruiting for classic. We were always a Horde, mediumcore raiding guild on Bladefist EU. However, with Classic. The majority of the core (who quit either Cata or WoD) are back for Classic. And we are 90% sure we will be Alliance this time around. A change of scenery!
---
We plan to raid 1-2 times a week. Have fun. Take our time. We are a majority UK &amp; Dutch, with some Swedish &amp; Danish. 
---
We used to raid twice a week. And did pretty well with it. This time around. We dont have as much time. So likely raid 3 times a fortnight. 
---
Discord will be messy. It will be loud. It will also be fun and full of banter. 
---
We have around 40 the core involved. Hoping to boost that more!
---
Here is a stupid video we did a while back!

stop please i can only get so erect
---
&gt; Roflmao 
---
Thanks for the proof.  
---
I have the feeling that you really have no valid arguments.
---
I suspected as much, thank you! :D
---
Very excited!!
---
Their own idea was better. Shard starting zones as needed. Leave the open world be after that.
---
&gt; phazing as you move around Nazajtar is fucking cancer. 
---
current wow feels like a lobby game, like when you create instances in path of exile or make new diablo 2 farming rooms, awful.
---
A better ping and little to no latency with a much better computer and a very very large monitor.....  Also, eating better while playing, no chips with mountain dew and ramen.
---
I personally never seen or heard of that, it's always raid time and then a second pull time as a goal to have everyone there and ready to pull and go.
---
Im looking forward for your next vid mate, i just thought this one was pretty standard for most levelers.
---
Gurubashi is very limited by time and location. On top of that it can be 10 vs 2 or whatever happens. Arena is good because it is easy to access, rated and fair.
---
Why? If there are instead 4 separate servers, that means you would have less hardcore players on those servers than what you are talking about. So if my assumption is wrong then yours is as well.
---

His runs aren't legit, he exploited on a Pserver.

**&lt;Get Off Our Lawn&gt; \[Casual/Hardcore...ish\] \[US East\]**
---
Why the name? We’re a bunch of working adults with families, coming back to a game we loved. Our guild will be full of moms and dads, and therefore, understanding of the difficulties an MMO presents a responsible adult. That being said, there is no age requirement as long as you are mature. Evening Raids are scheduled after Dinner Time, no pushing for server firsts, etc.
---
**Loot System:** 
---
Modified DKP. The moment something drops, it's checked in loot tables which classes are eligible for it. Then it is checked who out of all these classes has the most DKP. Then this person is asked if he/she wants it. In case of pass, the next person is asked. If at any stage there is more than one person with the same amount of DKP and desire to get the item, these people roll. Then, DKP are deducted from the owner's balance. In case of tanking gear, MT and first OT have priority not even looking into DKP. Items have a static cost, no bidding, no DKP Decay. Priority is the following: Class &gt; Main Spec &gt; BiS &gt; Upgrade &gt; Off spec
---
**Raid Times:** 
---
* Weeknights (Specific Days TBD) 7-10 EST. 10:30 stop time guaranteed. We plan to Raid twice a week, three times if the members of our guild can swing it. 
---
* We are focused on PvE progression, but all of our current members enjoy both BG PvP and World PvP. The focus might be PvE, but there will be plenty of opportunities for PvP, including organized guild events for it.
---
* We want to invite a friendly environment full of people who love Classic WoW. We aren’t interested in drama or the people it attracts. We’re here because we want to be. You should be, too.
---
* As mentioned above, we’re all working adults and have families. We understand if you have to go change a diaper. We get it if Soccer Practice was rescheduled.
---
* DKP is based on Attendance, time spent in the raid, and if we clear the raid. This is a better motivator to show up, than punishment, in our eyes.
---
**What We Provide:**
---
* Experienced leadership. Our guild leaders and officers cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ40/Naxx before Burning Crusade.
---
* A social experience. We love to joke, have fun, and sarcasm is our love language. We encourage people to laugh at themselves.
---
* Helpful members who will join you for Dungeons, help on a difficult quest, or come rushing in like a flood if you’re getting ganked in STV. There’s nothing quite like riding in with 15 guildies to punish some poor Shaman who thought the leveling Priest would be his bitch.
---
* Our discord will be full of pinned messages with resources for leveling, dungeons, raiding, professions, add-ons, etc. This Discord server is live and if you join, you will be added now, so we can get to know each other.
---
**What We Expect From You:**
---
* Racism and Homophobia are offenses deserving of an immediate ban. No second chances.
---
* Attuned by first guild raid.
---
* Discord – this is mandatory. You don’t HAVE to talk all the time, but coordinating in raids requires that you are able to hear the Raid Leader call the shots. All pertinent guild info will be on the Discord. A Website will be created if it is deemed necessary.
---
* Again, we know that life happens. But if you can’t make it for Raid night, please give us as much of a head’s up as possible. If there is a family emergency, it will never be counted against you. I truly, truly, don’t want to have to deal with the possibility of someone abusing this policy. So don’t make me.
---
* There will be a lot of rolling for loot in the early raids. Expect it, and expect to go awhile without getting much. As people get loot, their DKP will be lower than you, effectively pushing you up the list and making the next piece more likely to go to you. Be patient.
---
**Class needs:**
---
* We have a handful (7) of people who are starting this guild. We have our Main Tank. Aside from that, let’s fill our ranks and in the next week or two, I’ll be more descriptive of the class needs we still have.
---
If you are interested, please feel free to message me. I will respond as soon as I can with a link to the application. My Co-GM, Nank, is listed as well. It could take a few hours, as we both work during the day.

It was actually 35 hours 42 mins 14 seconds. Which is pretty decent, but no world record phase. But still really good speedleveling time for sure
---
It's fine. Stop trying to police other people's language.
---
Yeah but that's kind of every class tbh.
---
I tried p99 a couple weeks ago, made a gnome warrior, drowned and then got stuck under the water, so I had to remake him, walked outside and got annihilated by some big foot guy 10/10 best game.
---
We dont know

thats all we really have info wise
---
Whoever develops it has been slower lately, they missed the BFA launch by a little bit but im guess there will be a version
---
I really hope so, its so easy to set up and use compared to others
---
Thanks, i need my alliance friends to turn horde.
---
Congratulations you find something offensive funny. That doesn't make it OK, even when it's at your own expense.
---
That's just the stress test. On mine I have that and Beta: World of Warcraft Classic which says I don't have access to it. Seems blizz is trolling me on that one.

**&lt;Scrutiny - Horde&gt; | NA PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction:**
---
Scrutiny is more than just a WoW guild. We strive to build a community where anyone can thrive. That doesn't mean that we don't like to get shit done, because we do. Yes, it's possible to be fun and effective; don't let the other "hardcore" guildes fool you! We want the player, not the class. However, this doesn't mean you're going to get to reapeatedly die during fights and expect to hold onto a raid spot.
---
**Expectations**
---
Come prepared. We love when people show up ~30 mins early to a raid night decked out with consumables. We are looking for eager, active, skilled, and friendly players that want to help us grow Scrutiny into a powerhouse on whichever server we decide. We don't expect you to be the best, but we want you to try your best.
---
**Classes Needed**
---
Priests - Need
---
Shamans - Need
---
Rogues - Need
---
Warriors - Need
---
Hunters - Need
---
Druids - Need
---
Warlocks - Need
---
Mages - Need
---
We're just now opening up recruitment to the outside, and will gladly consider anyone, and everyone. Be prepared to have an interview on discord, however.
---
**Raid Schedule**
---
Tuesday - 8:00 PM EST - 11:00 PM EST
---
Wednesday - 8:00 PM EST - 11:00 PM EST
---
**Loot Policy**

Loot Council DKP Hybrid.
---
**Interested?**
---
Please join our discord at https://discord.gg/AggAP5b and message Viko to discuss further, and setup an interview. I look forwrad to speaking with and every one of you guys in hopes that we can make Scrutiny the monster I know it can be!
---
**Website**
---
In addition to the guild, we have been working diligently on a tool that hopefully much of Classic WoW will end up using. It isn't a database, but will consist of guides for each class, boss guides, hunter pet information, tier sets, etc. Check it out at https://scrutiny.gg!
---
Herbalism and mining is something you grab on alts once the "horde" of levelers have left the starting zones, you dont want your main toon to have mining or herbalism to start out with.
---
Something like skinning/tailoring or skinning/enchanting or Skinning/leatherworking is probably the best bet early.
---
Or simply Tailoring/enchanting if your a clothy. (You can easily supplement gold through other sources.)
---
You can do all raids besides 20mans in one evening up until naxx
---
Thanks for the reply. It may not be as big of a deal then as people are acting. I think it just gives the community something to talk about while they wait for release. 
---
I didn’t get a beta invite and I didn’t waste time mining on the stress test. I tries out a pserver in the past and I agree starting zones and barrens can be a chore with population. 
---
At the end of the day I don’t have a problem with or without layering.
---
I have a level 60 warlock for both alliance and horde so i am very familiar with the subject.
---
it is rather annoying to have half the players with WOTF but you learn to use fear less as an alliance lock. Despite this I was still a killing machine on the alliance side.  
---
escape artist is a great pvp racial.  it really helped against warriors. i also use engineering trinkets and pop a ton of lips (i did this on horde as well)
---
Ok stop already. Layering for a week or two to make the game playable is not going to be the fucking end of the world.
---
Do you know where can i find a list of all those quests? I'd like to do that same as you.
---
I played in classic, tbc and wotlk then stopped. Have played a couple of private servers since then. Have zero interest in modern WoW so they would never have gotten a subscription from me again if not for Classic.
---
You are reading that wrong. We are discussing how to fix the TEMPORARY fact of laying. It’s assumed everyone with a brain understands layering and any layering type solution is gone by phase 2
---
When I said first pull I meant Lucifron since that's how a website tracked the MC timer on the server I played on. MC is really fast and I expect the playerbase to get to grips with pack-skipping rather quickly.
---
Are gay people not allowed to define homophobia anymore?
---
It's instantly familiar let allows a lot of freedom for the creator to really enhance it!
---
"Just google it bro", is not an answer.
---
No, it isn't fine. Calling everything autistic is the new calling everything gay. It wasn't fine then, and it's not fine now.
---
This isn't 4chan. We can act decently in this subreddit.
---
I dunno if you have a retail sub, but imagine any of the modern bosses, except instead of all of the mechanics, a patch of fire might spawn under your feet every 30 secs. 
---
You have all the time in the world to focus on your rotation. Of course your rotation for most classes is literally 1-2 buttons spammed over and over again. 
---
Maybe you have to glance at the threat meter every now and then to check you're not creeping up.
---
Nice SeaLab reference lol
---
I have yet to see a Con on a PVP server.
---
Sounds like you'd just be better of making a few alts at that point, releveling all your professions takes about the same time it would take you to level an alt if your fast. (And then you can keep all of them)
---
Such a waste to juggle professions like that, especially ones you cannot level up through the auction house or otherwise.
---
/facepalm
---
Didn't they set a cooldown on layering so you can't layer hop anymore?
---
Thanks for the info! I like all types of games in a pretty broad spectrum. Used to play Runescape back in the day and I loved questing and leveling up my skills. Sense of achievement was always worth it!
---
As a healer I'm often the first kill target.
---
This is a terrible troll post.
---
Yes, they're designed to be hopped, you're just not supposed to be able to pick one or know which "number" it is. I know this because the **entire point** is that you can join your friend's layer when invited. That's hopping layers.
---
What you're describing is locking down each layer  and then merging them together, which is absolutely no different from just having servers with a 3k cap which eventually gets auto-merged into a bigger server. In fact, the only difference is it's even more confusing for people ("I'm on Argus layer two" rather than "I'm on Argus"). What you're describing isn't even layering because there would be zero point in having "layers" that can't be moved between in any capacity. When these "layers" merge I would then see people I had *no* chance of seeing before. That's a server merge. You solution is the exact problem they're trying to avoid.
---
I think I'm done with this sub. I haven't seen so much concentrated stupidity since /b/ in the mid 2000s. But yes, continue to arrogantly believe you're the only person who's come up with this ingenious solution that none of the networking wizards at Blizz have even considered.
---
An alternative to making it zone dependent could be to force lvl 50+ characters onto a single set layer and have that be the only layer that spawns rare high level resources.
---
nah, most guilds wont minmax at all, only the most hardcore. the fact that a lot more casual players will understand how to better optimize gear and spec wont have much of an impact, the same old world records will be competetive and for the casual guidls trying to clear MC/BWL asap it'll be pretty much just the same thing. most guidls never get to the point where they split their raid group into 2 to take down multiple bosses at the same time.
---
Thought about that but: Can your lvl 5 alt increase his crafting profession like tailoring past the "first level". Like, is he stuck at 75 ? Or you can be 300 in a crafting profession on a level 5 char ?
---
(I'll level my alt anyway, because I'm rolling war and I need a farming alt, but I'd like to know if I can keep it at lvl 5 for a while)
---
If we are allowed to hop layers for weeks, my guild will be decked in literally thousands - possibly many thousands - of black lotuses, arcane crystals and devilsaur leathers.
---
We will own so much wealth that we will get to control any market we choose.
---
And those resources come with all the other rare herbs and ores as well.
---
You are entitled to you opinion same as everyone else.
---
He said next month indicating more than one.
---
It's more than fine, it's actually hilarious.
---
&lt;Legacy&gt; | US PVE| Alliance | NA |
---
Intro: Legacy is a guild composed of people from varying experiences in classic WoW, ranging from first timers to boss kills in Nax. We are semi hardcore with a twist in that we are open to all dedicated performers of their appropriate role.
---
Who do we want?
---
Just as we are a group of young adults with full time jobs/classes, we understand that WoW doesn’t always come first. With that being said, we play this game to have a fun time while downing bosses at a consistent rate and are looking for fellow passionate players to do the same with. As has already been mentioned, we look on the individual more than the spec you intend to play, if you perform we are happy to have you.
---
What roles are in current demand?
---
At this current time all roles will be considered but we especially have a high demand for dps at the moment, especially warriors/rogues/mages
---
Misc:
---
Raids will begin with the first couple months of server launch, evening weekend (EDT)
---
Again all are welcome, we will be spam farming dungeons to help those interested in farming prebis (even
---
those with little interest in raiding).
---
World PVP groups will be organized as long as there is interest from both factions in doing so, especially in the earlier phases.
---
Loot rules are still to be determined however we are leaning more towards a MS/OS+1 style approach with certain priority items (Absolute BiS trumps over minor upgrades, etc).
---
How to join?
---
https://discord.gg/YSwVxBK . Feel free to ask any questions/contact us either in discord or through this post.
---
It's like you didn't even read my original message.
---
I'll try to clarify I guess. Adding more resources doesn't necessarily increase access to those resources. In fact, it gives incentive to greater competition because the potential for profit is much higher.
---
When you increase resources by 4x, you don't increase the number of players farming the resources from 25 to 100, because the 25 most hardcore players can just as easily force out the other players by playing more, playing more efficiently, beating the competition in PvP and potentially colluding cross-faction, etc. You still have roughly the same amount of people farming the resources, but now they're earning 4x as many resources.
---
Again, we can look at private servers for a real world example. No one cares about competing for copper ore because copper ore is plentiful and has low demand. But let's look at another particularly common resource: devilsaur leather. You have something like 16 devilsaur spawns every hour yet the average player has almost no chance of obtaining the leather themselves because the resource is controlled exclusively by players who specifically go out of their way to control this resource due to the high potential for profit. And for the most part they don't have to worry about surplus because they fix the price and anyone who tries to undercut gets excluded from the group that controls the resource.
---
Lvl 5 wont be able to upgrade profession after 75 (or 150 ?).
---
19 is cap at 150, 29 - 225 etc.
---
Yup. I don’t think there are many people saying, “Fuck everyone on launch. Queues are awesome.” We’re saying the temporary fix for that should not extend beyond anything really after the first little bit, and I agree that level 20 seems reasonable.
---
Strongly disagree, nothing is inherently offensive, things just have different capacities to offend people. In this instance, people use autistic as a shorthand for inability to communicate, lack of social awareness, obsessive thinking and the like. Makes sense to me, why's it offensive?
---
What happens if your friend picked ED layer 3 and you picked layer 2?  You'd still have to allow layer hopping if eventually everyone is going to be merged into the same.  How do you handle auction houses?  Is everything still connected?
---
It’s okay forgive yourself you have vanilla brain syndrome
---
Ya you can't try them. It's hard to break a habit but its usually better. Takes a good 6 months of use to beat out your bad habbits.
---
MY BODY IS READY
---
They would effectively be stand-alone servers, not layers. Just set up in a way that would make potential future merges simple.
---
Dude you should have specified you were talking PvP build, people default to pve otherwise. Oh and I'd still take the bubble as you can keep casting in Mr bubble, extra armor won't help there
---
Of course gear matters. 
---
But more so today than ever before it doesn’t. 
---
For example, I was raiding casual mythics earlier this tier. My ilvl was 10-15 lower than the average in the raid and I was consistently 4th dps. I don’t mean to brag, but there is clearly a skill gulf there. And yet these lower skilled players still get mythic kills—albeit weeks after method and with a higher ilvl than when method first killed the fight. 
---
Even still, if method clears at 400 ilvl and my us 25th guild goes in 4 weeks later and down Jaina my ilvl will be higher than methods, there will be strats filtering through the community (I don’t mean like a fat boss guide, I mean you chat with that spriest in the top 10 world guild you know and feel out any particulars of what he was doing). My us 25 guild will still put in 500 wipes, same as method.
---
Gear matters, but skill trumps gear every time, more so today than ever before.
---
Started in '06 on Vanilla. Played through about 3/4 the way through WOTLK and it was awesome. Stopped because I started getting a little bored of everything and had less time to spend grinding. Came back for a few months in Cata then did the same thing in MoP. Quit both due to how easy everything was and hated that they got rid of talent trees.  
---
Most excited to come back to classic for the vanilla Spriest experience that I missed the first time around. Mained Spriest from TBC through MoP (ish)
---
Made my day, I love your comment thank you stranger

We are an up-and-coming guild quickly filling our ranks. We have extensive goals to be one of the top guilds on the server and will always be current on content. We fully expect to be ready to raid within a month from launch. We're looking for casual players as well has those as hardcore as us alike.

Schedule: Tuesday and Thursday 20:15-00:15 CST (Primary Raid Days)
---
Sunday 20:15-0015 CST (Optional Events, 20-mans)

We're looking for players that can commit to the planned raid schedule. We will not have a "one and done" mindset in regards to missing a raid. But no less than 90% attendance is very much encouraged. And we don't just need a warm body to fill a slot on the roster. We need detail oriented players with situational awareness. And of course, someone that can work and play with a team. We don't just want people that will log in to raid and then be done. We want a community of players that get along both during a raid as well as after.

Why do you have it if it’s colder? Which part of Europe do you mean? Big difference. Europe is slightly bigger the the states so.
---
Seems like a huge waste of resources... or do you not have decent heating systems?

It makes a lot of sense not to have AC in places where you used to need it MAYBE 5-10 days a year if lucky.

Nah his private time is 3 day, 22 hours 7 mins to 60 on private solo realm.

His level 40 is 3 hour slower then this guy aswell

---
Also if you look at the fastest speedlevelers this guy is no where near it. He is still better then 99.99% at speedleveling (i'm talking about the guy in this clip) but in classic speedrunning the diffrence between top 0.01% and the top 5 levelers is really big. We recently saw a 2day 17hr done on private with mage aoe farming (JokerdTV). This wasn't on a fresh realm too. But it won't be possible on release because on beta mage aoe farming is way worse (higher resist, mobs dont spawn at a fixed time)
---
So mage will be slower but still a contender for world first.
---
Then we hvae players like Journey who is just way faster/better hunter then Joana and this guy (better route etc) He can do a bit over 3d /played to 60.
---
Just wanted to give some information here for the people that don't follow every single speedrunning news :D
---
#[NA] [A] [PVP] &lt;Hurricane&gt; is recruiting! Hardcore WPvP, Semi-casual raiding
---
Are you a seasoned player yearning for the old style world PVP experience, and you want a guild designed around that need? Or are you new to Classic, and want a supportive, organized guild to provide you with the friendship, advice and backup you’ll need to survive on a PVP server?
---
**Consider &lt;Hurricane&gt;! Here’s what we do:**
---
* Highly disciplined, scheduled weekly city raids; plus the drills and tiresome lectures necessary to bring newbies up to speed on the do’s-and-don’t’s of zerg vs zerg pvp
---
* Support leveling members and cultivate violence by prioritizing fast response to guildies under attack in the world
---
* PVE to PVP - Don’t want to rank? No problem. Once was enough for me, too.  3 scheduled raids a week, 2 PvE, 1 City, from 7-10pm CST Mon/Tue/Thur. Modified DKP loot system with class-specific sanity checks. (Sorry, Hunters. You can’t roll on the bindings.) DKP is awarded for city raid attendance.
---
**Who is Hurricane?**
---
Seasoned vanilla players returning from the private server circuit. We know what we like, and what we like is a tightly controlled raid, ripping through horde towns. Our culture is strictly old-school - we don’t stand for pettiness, harassment, or the mindless regurgitation of tired memes.
---
Regardless of your experience, we can take you, and teach you: how to assist train Horde raids into the dirt, when to spread out and when to tighten up, what actually constitutes “flanking” in a game without collision detection, and how to fight through crowds of Civilian NPC landmines without detonating your weekly ranking on Dishonorable Kills.
---
**Interested? Here’s what we’re looking for in a member:**
---
* Friendly, non-toxic, patient
---
* Guild oriented: helps others get their pre-raid BiS, and reasonably expects the same in return; willing to sacrifice their personal time to help protect members as they level, when it is both necessary and reasonable to do so
---
* Loves world PvP
---
* Communicative Discord voice chat user
---
* Punctual to whatever scheduled events they commit to
---
&lt;Hurricane&gt; wants to have you - if you’re a grizzled veteran craving that classic feeling that hooked you so many years ago, you’ll be right at home with us. If you’re a curious retailer who is uncertain on how far they intend to go with vanilla - you’re welcome, and you’re wanted, regardless of where your journey takes you.
---
**If you are interested, join our Discord:**
---
https://discord.gg/wc6HudX
---
This is an entry lobby only - please make yourself known, and myself or an officer will get with you as soon as convenient.
---
That was the fastest comment reply I've ever seen
---
Then how can we know ? For such kind of speed running, experience might be a big big factor.  
---
I don't know about others, but this dude seem to have spents so many years doing this that I guess he's got all the shit that is to be figured out, figured out.  
---
We'll see, I'm rooting for him since he's the OG. We'll see if the kids can fuck him up.
---
Wrong again. Gay as a pejorative was harmful because it was being used as a shorthand for bad. Calling someone autistic on the other hand is actually saying that they are displaying the actual traits of autism. It's like calling someone gay for checking out dudes, it actually makes sense.
---
Lol nearly every day.
---
Lock : fun, decent damage, but don't have a lot of gear to gauge it. After about a week it got stale with the lack of mobility.
---
Spriest: fun, I was dead set on rolling shadow for like 2 months. Eventually the talk of how difficult it will be to gear and raid got to me, and realistically I won't play enough to get that one special spot.
---
Rogue: played it in Vanilla, so kinda wanted something new. I also can't go from playing rogue all the way up to BFA, and going back to the incredibly slow stealth.
---
Mage: It's okay, I've never really been a "mage". I think it's the only class I've never actually played to max in any expansion.
---
Hunter: my latest decision, and so far I've liked most aspects except the damage. The damage honestly seems like more RNG than enhancement lol. You can be in a BG, aimed, auto, multishot, auto and if you crit, they probably died on the multishot. If you didn't crit, they probably have 3/4 HP after that full rotation. The damage disparity is just way too huge....
---
In the end, I'm still back to square one. Hunter seems like it's going to be a lot weaker this time around than it was back in the day. Spriest isnt wanted like, anywhere. That leaves Lock, which idk, I feel like it can get stale as fuck. I give up lol
---
Build better houses. You really don’t need an AC for 80s lol
---
Unless Gold can be exploit by layering, then the amount of gold obtain server wide won't change. A counter to this would be by having more than a healthy number of players on one server(which seems like as they plan for "tourist" leaving), then this tourist will generate more gold than normally would be generated on a server.
---
So perhaps a high percentage of this gold could be concentrating in  one guild, it will still be a finite resource. And AH prices will always have a self balances act, as in, I won't pay a ridiculous price for something if I can just farm it for myself. And basically my gold per hour will determine what's affordable versus what will need to be farmed. So, unless some Mafia things start happening over resources that would prevent me from farming it, this unbalance won't happen. And since having many layers will make a Mafia's lockdown very difficult, it might not even be possible.
---
No. It is absolutely not fine. Some day you'll grow up and realize that.
---
Ah
---
because it still gets hot some days lol 
---
and its more about filtering out humidity than heat persay, its very humid here 
---
what do heating systems have to do with AC? im not sure where you are going with that
---
also not sure how its a waste of resources or anything
---
Guilds will just have a bunch of layer alts. And they will set up a keyword invite, so all they have to do is macro `/w layeralt 123` and they will receive an invite to another layer.
---
The cool downs are a step in the right direction but it’s like trying to stuff thousands of holes in a leaking boat.
---
worgen where also a horrible mistake. I'm not really sure how to make the point any clearer though. This is coming down to a preference thing and if you don't think that a animorphic panda with a hourglass figure and big boobs with hair dyes/styles the furry community specifically designs on stuff and generic beauty almond shaped eyes isn't sexual to you then i have to re-evaluate the world
---
Uhhh, without perfectly optimized gear and with the right abilities and spec at the right levels? «Situationally» good. Not a lie and not an over exaggeration.
---
Layering isn’t there for lag though; it’s there for the rapid expansion and deflation of the Classic population.
---
If Blizzard went with strict servers you’d end up with a huge launch population (I would not be surprised if it hit 10mil world wide) and a very rapid decline leaving possibly dozens of dead servers.
---
WoW Classic only really works with a healthy population where you can group up organically, run dungeons organically and eventually raid.
---
If Classic deflates and you’re left with dozens of servers with an exceptionally small server population where virtually no one can play the game organically. (This what originally led to LFD in retail. Players forget that LFD was originally a solution to low level players and small server players never being able to run dungeons.)
---
The alternative to this would be for Blizzard to spin up servers and very aggressively merge them once the population began to deflate.
---
I’d prefer they did this for classic and retail tbh rather than cross server BS but there has to be more drawbacks other than character names and guild issues.
---
Square recently did this with FF14 prior to the Shadowbringers launch and it was fairly controversial due to their cross server linkshells (essentially Guilds) that were broken.
---
Yeah, there are several prominent characters that straight up believe all races but Humans should be exterminated, even their allies. And the whole internment camp thing? Ugh.
---
Pretty much everything bad that's happened to Azeroth is the fault of one Alliance race or another.
---
The Burning Legion? Night Elves
---
The Sundering? Night Elves
---
The Dark Portal? Humans and Night Elves
---
Molten Core? Dwarves
---
Onyxia? Humans
---
Blackwing Lair? Humans
---
Ahn'Qiraj? Night Elves
---
Naxxramas? Humans
---
The Alliance is such a problem that they've had to use the new storylines to attempt to completely shift the scales to make the New Horde seem more evil with Putricide and then Garrosh and now Sylvanas.
---
Yes of course, I don't know anything and it's just my opinion
---
Thanks for this.
---
yeah... most cant afford to build....
---
and if you did AC is a standard feature here anyway lol
---
I don't have time to argue with autistic retards.
---
feeling forced to make a new char from scratch on a server where you dont have any friends from before will quite often result in quitting the game, ending your subscruiption and thus not giving money to blizzard, this whole idea is not realistic.
---
You can easily set timers and know when the nodes spawn. This is pretty common practice for hardcore farmers.
---
I'm going DPS because I can't fully commit to raiding some weeks so I'll be a bit behind the curve, so I want to be able to pvp/farm during my down time. It's between mage and hunter because they can both farm/pvp/raid with 1 spec
---
Played PvP server because the people I played with wanted to, not going to make that mistake again.
---
I just wanna quest and level my professions in peace, no more world PvP for me, I'm too old for that shiet now.
---
If I wanted PvP I'd go into a controlled environment, such as a BG.
---
This time I wont be having anyone to play with so I can play on whatever server I want.
---
PvE for life!
---
You do nothing in this sub but piss and moan about Classic. You've had numerous posts removed for various violations. You're obviously trolling, so why don't you go and find a different community to shit on.
---
Oh fuck this will kill open world pvp.
---
Burning Steppes, Eastern Plaguelands, Winterspring, Silithus. I want one version of *those* zones.
---
I realy doubt that. It made PvP less chaotic and more structured, and forsed sertain balance shifts, for example, healers being immortal gods thingy started in BC. Actualy, a lot of questionable things started in BC, like flying mounts, for example. Yeah, they are convinient, but too much convinience, and immersion is dead. As well as game. And immersion is crusial for MMO.
---
As long as you're selling your in-game goods (whether it'd be mounts, items, or even a boss kill) it's completely in line with the ToS as long as the payment is in Gold, and not in any life currrency. -Know this from years of doing boosting services in Retail. :)
---
I'll never understand people not understanding that they don't need to understand that people have fun in different ways.
---
Layering is stupid. Realms should have login queues to prevent layering form happening.
---
It's so good that no one goes to raid with that spec.
---
Damn people at gamestop...
---
let people make their own choices, and deal with the consequences of those choices
---
It isn't just about people leaving. People will be playing more the first month. It's like parking lots at colleges. The first 2 weeks the lots are always fuller. Then everyone settles into normal routines and schedules.
---
Druids are actually kinda hard to play well though because you have to manage mana especially when shifting, you have no proper CC because roots doesn’t do anything to casters and you can’t use indoors, you have a lot of keybinds and don’t have a pet to tank for you. They’re a good solo class but imo not great for casual play when compared to a lock who can kill mutilple mobs at once and almost never has to worry about dying or going oom.
---
Only bad ones. Prot warriors aren't that hard to bleed and kite to death. Arms warriors are definitely more frightening as a rogue as a good one will deal more damage than you can.
---
 I don't expect him to be first 60 because there will be folks hyped up on energy drinks and Adderall the whole time. He's explained on steam his health can't take that, he'll be taking breaks to sleep
---
Feelsbadman
---
The world was designed around populations of 2000-3000. Not 10k.
---
The "Everything in moderation, even World of Warcraft" load screen tip should do the trick.
---
Yeah It'll take a total of like 6-7 hours tops to get to max skill in whatever skill you're speed leveling after you've hit 60. People will have max gathering professions in less than a week from launch. I would assume by day 5 you'll have a max in each skill, EASY.
---
Vanilla WoW *had* dynamic respawns, mind you. They just weren't as rapid as the dynamic respawns of today, so they were less noticeable as a result. But if you had multiple people in the same area trying to clear the same mobs, those mobs would in fact respawn with progressively shorter timers.
---
You don’t seem to understand what you’re saying, either
---
Private server info is probably mostly accurate. Most of them set rates according to old wowhead/thottbott listed rates, which were quite accurate even then.
---
&gt;People tryharded/min maxed the game in 2005 the same way they will in 2019.
---
Some people did. Not nearly as many people as did after Vanilla tho.
---
But you are saying is wrong. Merging servers does *less* damage to the economy than merging layers would.
---
It’s quite comparable if you break it down to the differences.
---
Where did you read that? The blizzard post says that 3k estimated per layer but I read that high pop classic servers were from 7k to 10k
---
there is the rocket helmet that fires you up.
---
and the flight price would cut down those who amassed too much it could even be multiplied by 10 instead of just 2, just to drain the amount of gold present the first month.
---
Easy questions here: 
---
which servers have more players, PvE or PvP? And which are the biggest in EU? 
---
Thanks!!
---
KKonaW
---
You would NEVER have been playing with 6 or 9k other people, without layering they would just be on different servers. Servers used to be capped at around 3k. It'll still be a clusterfuck at launch but later on when the population drops they can merge the separate layers far more easily than they could merge separate servers.
---
   Christ, so many people in this thread have no understanding of what layerng in, or what its meant to solve.
---
I hate dynamic respawns I hate, hate , *hate* it. I hate it with a passion.
---
But I would take it over this abomination in a heartbeat.
---
Most likely, but probably not as much as you'd see in retail raiding today.
---
We did have a contest for AQ gates.  People would submit stacks of materials and we kept the material quantities secret until the end of the week.  Highest submitted got to go on a Molten Core run.  We ran the overal winner through BWL.  If there was the same class we'd throw second place in with an Onyxia run.

Wasn't really all that hard to do the runs when we got everyone on their main, did MC in less than an hour (and that wasn't world buffed or potted) so they went quick.
---
That being said, I could see there being a bunch of strategies of various guilds running multiple instances and using alts runs to get more attempts at gearing up main characters.  The MC push is going to be interesting.
---
Hunters are literally the only class that can do this. If your guild consists of hunters...
---
literally anything
---
sure
---
...you realise we're on the classic sub here right? It's not really relevant how well you do in tank spec on retail.
---
Almost exactly 2 months actually.
---
All am saying is that I don't think Blizzard will be in a hurry to remove layers before phase 2, due to many reasons.
---
But am glad you know better for me burger gamer
---
So in all honesty, if your with a reallly good guild, probably like 2 hours to 3 at most. If your learning with a new guild, it can last for even 8 hours until people are done with the day. Wiping, Rebuffing, Gathering reagants, summong repair bills, explaining fights, not wanting to murder the one downy guy. Theres a lot of factors though the clowny raids give real fun stories
---
this guy gets it!
---
People are so stupid not to understand this.  And this isn't even the worst part about layering.
---
Shamans are probably the easiest kills possible for Warlocks at 60. They can't dispel magic or curses so Warlocks don't even need to cast, their instant spells are enough to kill them.   
---
Curse of Tonques against Elemental Shamans or Curse of Exhaustion vs Enhancement and outside of pots/engineering to aid them there's no way they will win. It truly messes with them to great degrees.
---
I've gone back and forth on that, too. I think I've decided though.
---
Main warrior and alt druid. I'll alternate between them, trying to maximize rested XP. I'll probably try to keep the druid 10-15 levels ahead of the warrior, though, and send gear and other things to my warrior to make things more comfortable.
---
When I finally get to 60, I'm planning on mostly farming on my druid and mostly playing group content (5 mans and maybe raids) on my warrior.
---
The guy should really try and get a script or something, he stops sometimes in the middle for several seconds, his smacking in his mic throughout the video, he has somewhat weird accent, blurry background.
---
It's just a bit too much.
---
 That is a cool suggestion and would solve a lot of issues( and of course create some new ones but overall I like your idea, best one I have heard so far).
---
 Say Blizzard went for your idea, what would be very important in order to stop an avalanche of complains from the masses then would be that they informed everyone very clearly about how it worked. So for example when you log in, at the loading screen every time you should be met by some text explaining about switching layers at an inn. Also why layering is in the game. Most people don't visit forums so would need to be done via the loading screen or something similar.
---
I think if Classic gets a large, sustained player-base then they might make some QoL changes. As far as new content, I doubt it. I don't think we will see any new raids or dungeons post-Naxx. I hope they add things like the 2nd talent tree tab and maybe some other smaller changes that won't hurt Classic in anyway
---
Some people did on the more populated servers but it was much less common. I imagine it will be far more prevalent now.
---
You didn't miss anything in Mists. I feel like that expansion is when blizzard jumped the shark.

I didn't say it was more or less damaging. I said it would cause damage, which is entirely correct. The question was why don't they just merge servers. I answered why that was also a bad idea. Take a relax
---
I don't understand what's so hard to understand about this.  People talk about layering like it's just randomly there for no reason.  Layering sucks but not being able to get into a server for a week sucks more.

 Big in Stormwind &lt;BiS&gt;, NA PVP-Alliance, CST LF High-End Raiders
---
\[b\]Introduction:\[/b\] BiS is an Alliance guild that is comprised of officership and many raiders with pserver+retail KT clear/ late Naxx and numerous Cutting Edge experience. Our goal is to create a guild culture that focuses on high-end PVE/PVP gameplay and a sense of urgency to progress through content but most importantly a place to call home for all of classic. 
---
\[b\]Ambitions:\[/b\] Server firsts, while we all used to be in 5+ raid days/week we aim to take it a step slower and labeled as semi-hardcore. 
---
\[b\]Schedule: Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays 7pm-10pm CST.\[/b\] Will most likely stick with 1-2 days (Tues/Weds) until AQ40/Naxx but will utilize Thursdays if there were hiccups in clearing the instance. Sundays will also be optional 20-man/alt MC+BWL clears once the aforementioned instances are on farm.
---
\[b\]Loot System:\[/b\] Suicide Kings for class specific items, DKP for everything else

Exactly, it prevents hardcore people to make that choice and force them to level alchemy if they want stuff. (Which costs them more gold when they want to switch etc, its just a small dent for them to work around.)
---
doesnt matter as long as the xp and damage is the same the result is as well, sorry to break it to ya but even back then there where power levelers although rare they existed.
---
Imo the real comparison is improved inner fire versus improved fortitude.
---
If I had my way for PvP id put 3/3 in IF but they’re later talent and it’s not really doable.
---
It helps if you translate it from Latin. 
---
AM: Ante Meridiem
---
PM: Post Meridiem
---
Ante = Before
---
Post = After
---
Meridiem = Midday/noon
---
I’m not saying it’s perfect, but it works for me. 
---
Also fuck the 12-hour clock.
---
Which would fuck over people that don't have a profession tied to it. Ie herb and tailoring.
---
Of course. It would need to be explained in a pop-up message saying "This is how it works". And to swap layers you would need to right click your char frame and choose "Meetup with group leader". Similar to how you have "View leader garrison" for WOD garrisons.
---
It's not an amazing solution or the right one, but it's blizzard and they are lazy beyond any reason so we have to deal with it. We are lucky this is one of the bigger problems,  it could be so so much worse. Who knows what they will add in the future.
---
And pry what is your back up plan? For if your first plan doesn’t work.
---
MM can do both with same spec too
---
It happened in Vanilla. It will happen in Classic.
---
Big guilds will sell MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 runs for sure to help with gold for Naxx. AQ40 and Naxx probably won’t be selling runs for a LONG time.
---
Do you mean went? And do you mean: in my guild* ?
---
As nobody is raiding anything atm lol, but guess what I'm gonna be playing this time around :p
---
Intermittently, yeah, but pvp is a must for me. I personally think dpsing raids is kinda boring in comparison but if I have a guild I’m attached to I’ll absolutely be doing raids if needed.
---
Issue is the raid times stuff I mentioned above. Theoretically I could make half of raid times depending on when raid is. We’re actually voting to switch to permanent shifts right now though which would be huge
---
Friendly bois and gals looking for more friendly bois and gals.
---
Shaman PVP is only really 'viable' as elemental and you need decent gear to make it work.  The shaman PVP gear isn't ideal for elemental, you'll want to get some raid gear with a lot of +sp and ideally a +sp trinket as well. 
---
Enh pvp is kind of fun but you're very vulnerable to CCs.  Your only real choice is to roll orc and hope to get a lot of stun resist procs, but you will still get slowed/kited a lot. 
---
But do what you want.  I haven't PVP'd as a priest but they are annoying to fight!  Heal priests are kind of squishy but as long as you avoid overextending you can be a huge support to your team.  Shadow priests are very strong but OOM quick and are then wet noodles, trying to run away and drink =P
---
&gt;The suggestions I have seen are that they should have a server being hacked up into layers and you choose which one to join during character creation. So you join Emerald Dream layer 1, Emerald Dream layer 2, Emerald Dream layer 3 etc during character creation and can never leave it. Then when less people are playing Blizzard merges the layers incrementally. This seems like a great suggestion in my eyes.
---
This is 100% the best idea.  Almost zero downside.  Layering in it's current iteration is fucking awful and will have terrible, long lasting effects on Classic.
---
I was so sure I was going to roll a Mage on a pve server until I realised, I don't have the same time I used to so I'm not going to take the game seriously at all. Then I decided to roll a rogue on a pvp server.
---
Bout 9 million people possibly
---
What? Not true at all. You’ll see one moonkin in aq40 and Naxx to boost mages ignite damage. Prot is probably the most useless since Druid and Warr can do their job better in every way.
---
 What happens when the layer your friends are on is full? Then you get the login queue issue again.
---
I will upvote you for asking a legitimate question but I will apologize and kindly ask you to google this.
---
You did not read that high pop classic servers were at 10k. You are the one that needs to supply the proof.
---
It is quick and easy to google.
---
Hey, \#Nochanges crowd wouldn't fuzz over it.
---
Its to fuck over the people that abuse, they would be forced to level alchemy and it would deterr a lot of them. (Since it costs them precious time and gold)
---
And its only for the first few weeks/months when layering is active, obviously.
---
MISLEADING!!!  
---
It's the end of next month and we just started this month.  
---
Oh well, it's good to have a glass is half full guy now and then.
---
This is what I've been saying since Classic was announced.
---
Layering, dynamic respawn, etc....they have to do SOMETHING to mitigate the massive influx of players, or the game will be unplayable for 2+ weeks after launch. I've been through enough private server launches to know this; having 1000+ people all in the same zone competing for the same resources just doesn't work.
---
your friends can start from scratch, too.
---
It is still unclear what happens one or two years into classic, no official strategy how to deal with dead realms (which will eventually happen even with layering etc), fresh realms, new content... so by then, people end their subscriptions too
---
Why would the percentage hardcore vs. "normal" vs. tourists change if 5 layers worth of people are instead spread out over 5 seperate servers? 
---
To take your example, if there was no layering, these 100 hardcore and 2900 normal players would instead be spread out over 5 servers meaning you have dead servers after all the tourists leave. You could then have server merges but those 100 hardcore and 2900 normal players have enjoyed the fruits of 5 seperate servers worth of resources before the merge: so there is no difference with the layered situation.
---
You need to be level 35 to get 300 in a skill.
---
you say that, but i think bestial wrath is significantly better for some pvp situations than scatter is. Granted, at t2 and t3, your pet will be mediocre and wont scale, so not for the long run, but for 1-60, I feel like BM stands pretty strong especially vs mages and fear classes.
---
Druids are super nice to have in UBRS if you group is fresh and ungeared
---
&gt;Hey, \#Nochanges crowd wouldn't fuzz over it.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Its to fuck over the people that abuse, they would be forced to level alchemy and it would deterr a lot of them. (Since it costs them precious time and gold)
---
&gt;And its only for the first few weeks/months when layering is active, obviously.
---
The no changes crowd would fuzz over it. It would completely shift the economy to non nerfed professions that generate money.
---
You don’t bring a moonkin in to beat another pure dps class lol, they boost overall damage and can even heal if needed, battle Rez, keep faerie fire up etc. Druid’s don’t even top healing meters when full resto so I’ll assume you have never really even played one. If Druid’s were brought for their performance they wouldn’t even heal in raids by your logic
---
Yeah I saw some stuff with fast weapons, shadow oil, life stealing and caster gear lol. I don't know if I believe the 1600 dps, but I believe the better than what was possible before.
---
Lifestealing has a 100% spell coefficient. Shadow oil is literally shadow bolt rank 3 so \~85%. and maybe even some things like that fire damage necklace could be added in, but that might well get fixed even though it was broken in vanilla, but no one noticed until WotLK.
---
Originally, they literally stopped selling the game to control the inflow of players. This options sounds worse for the consumer than layering.
---
explain how to make it better and why you think this
---
Guys, don't do this. It's extremely unhealthy for you.
---
If you're insisting to do this, at least take regular short breaks and have proper food ready.
---
Don't forget nobody is going to be giving him any enhancement gear if he's pretending to be resto, either.
---
Thanks, i didnt know where else to put that filler talent, this helps a lot!
---
&gt; worthless in 40mans
---
!=
---
&gt;worst spec in the game
---
That's not the same thing, bub. I played boomkin in classic (then again on Nost) and they fucking owned 1v1 PvP. While any Druid is going to be a pain in the ass 1v1, boomkins were *especially* efficient at murdering other players.
---
You can two-shot clothies if you stack all +Arcane damage gear, then run if you get targetted.
---
That is an understatement. You need to have done it a lot of times and perhaps even practiced it to hit 40 under two days played.
---
Most people will take much much longer than 48 hours `/played` to hit 40.
---
you could try the 30/0/21 hybrid build, you wont be the best healer buy you can get by, and its a solid PVP build
---
35 hours in one sitting? casual -_-
---
I ground crocks in Duskwallow.
---
\&gt; it only affects Healing wave.
---
You are right. It's still not a minus compared to spending 30 points in talents you won't be using.
---
\&gt; This is definitely true, which in essence devalues the armor buff even further 
---
Up until naxx fury warriors and rogues hold the highest DPS in raids.
---
\&gt; in exchange for 2-3 times more dps
---
Which you won't be using anyway, because you're a healer and you will never outdps a mage or a lock, who at least have mechanism to compensate for the mana exhaustion.
---
If your primary dps weapon is a lighting bolt and you have an average of 5000 mana with buffs. You cast 1 LB rank 10 every 2 seconds that costs 238 mana. 5000/238 = 21.008 LBs, which means you will run OOM in 42 seconds. Mana Spring Totem restores 10 mana per 2 seconds. 42/2\*10 = 210, might make it for another LB or two, if you have other mp5 gear. Making you OOM in total of 46 seconds. What will you do for the rest of the boss fight?
---
They simply do not understand.  Let's be real though, they never did. "You think you do, but you don't".  Same people.  They're being forced to make this game they don't want and don't understand.
---
I was also thinking that, but honestly for me personally, i feel i do multishot a lot for dps purposes and itll benefit me more having it increased by a solid 15%, especially on a crit
---
Shaman 30/0/21 can raid as heal and is also the best shaman PvP spec.
---
Started late in Vanilla so never raided past MC, then went 'hardcore' and cleared all TBC and WOTLK content. Quit very early in Cata, never played since that.   
---
Few friends of mine are on the same boat and we are all coming back to have some fun in Classic. Not going to rush levels  since there's not much point.
---
&gt; There's so much to enjoy in this game.
---
Yeah, like raiding!
---
&gt;What's the point of getting leveled up that fast?
---
To get to the good stuff.
---
I never saw it that high - but my guild sold one run for 250g and you rolled for every item against  the other players being carried (items within reason usually) with the exception on bindings. 
---
I saw a few instances where someone paid 250g and for like 7-8 items. 
---
Other times someone paid and got nothing lol
---
Ok sure, i'll be more specific. Worst spec in the game for 40mans. I do not pvp so i will admit I'm ignorant regarding their pvp value.
---
You will be in the same guild and because of this the same layer.
---
Bad advice, unless you want to gear two chars meaning having to raid twice as much.
---
You mean vendoring crafted items; I'm sorry but I'm not a native english speaker.  
---
That means, sending mats to the crafting alt -&gt; craft something -&gt; sell it to a vendor (as in VENDORing) or put it on the AH (when vendoring just means "selling" in a broader sense) ?
---
You are wrong.  If you have four times the players, you have four times the exploiters exploiting the four layers.  You can't just have one time the number of exploiters in a population that is big enough to spawn another four layers.  I can't prove that only one person will exploit layer hopping, but I can ensure you that there is more than one person that knows it exists on your server and every other server.  You are cherry picking facts that if you looked at the whole argument, they are contrary to each other.  
---
You are wrong, in that if you have large enough populace, you will have large enough criminals to compete with each other.  It won't just be one single criminal, but multiple ones.  There will be too many people trying to advance their own interests and they will not be able to form a collusion ring.  In a few days, you will actually have the economy of the rare items drop in price, and if the time investment to reward drops low enough, they will find medium rarity items that are more profitable.  All in all, if there are enough people on a realm to spawn more layers, there will be enough people to consume the resources gathered.
---
&gt;Oh and I'd still take the bubble as you can keep casting in Mr bubble, extra armor won't help there
---
The mitigation from armour is still applied when calculating how much damage is dealt/absorbed, so you still benefit from it in shield against physical damage. You don't lose IF charges from absorbs either iirc
---
If we are worried about the economic impact, then all it requires is a organized group of players to reap the same economic benefits using that system as the current proposed system. Blizzard has announced there will be a cooldown on layer hopping.
---
Skinning tailoring!!! Bags bags bags bags!!! Make your own and sell them! Vendor/ah the leather
---
Yes, it's being used as an insult, but unlike gay it's an insult with a point as opposed to simply going gay = bad.
---
That’s so incredibly wasteful to have AC as a standard feature . Not to mention AC in general is this shit. Always gives me neck cramps and whatnot. Nasty machines but guess you can’t help it.
---
Granted it is, but its a choice between 3% parry or 3% dmg increase on all attacks + another 3% on crits. I figure id take a minor dmg buff than a parry ill never have a need for, since raptor strike is based on dodge, while as counterattack is parry and i dont have it
---
depends on the time you have I guess
---
They could - it would be called sharding. The reason they most likely won’t is because they stated they would be replacing sharding tech with layering for Classic. Theoretically they could create layers with a 500 player cap that would work for this.
---
The issue is though, layering (as I recall) has never been advertised as a solution for Day 1 overpopulation. There is no evidence the goal of layering is to reduce overpopulation. That is entirely a community idea that is repeated in every thread on here about layering. I think anxiety from people who have a limited time off work is driving it. I am open to changing my view on this if Blizzard has made a definitive statement about it, but all I’ve seen is them proposing layering as a solution for server merges.
---
If you stick with a mage you'll be pretty well off as BiS pairing. Int buff, water, and the best peels in the game. Otherwise, it is very difficult. Priest goes OOM pretty quickly and is very squishy and is very frustrating in small BGs, and amazing in AV. Viper sting and poly are going to be what you deal with the most besides just getting flat out choo choo trained by melee.
---
There are people who played tens of thousands of hours of wow in the past 15 years on private servers. Hopping from one to the next as they release.
---
Joana is not one of those.
---
He has what it takes but it’s like being Michael Jordan in the Space Jam.
---
\*contains two gems\*
---
Harsh way to phrase that.  Roughly 2 months away though, my enjoyment of other games is even suffering.  While I try to fill, I just wish I was grinding on classic.
---
Of course it doesn't prevent that. You'd just take alchemy and sell the potions instead.
---
All it does is randomly punish people who don't go alchemy.
---
Everything would be better if more people were like you! : )
---
Okay let put it a different way, unless you can come up with another more suitable backup plan, the default is a returns to layering.
---
You don't understand what you are saying and how backwards it is, and that's sad.
---
With layering, the odds you see the same players with any sort of frequency to form a bond are very low.
---
Where you'd normally have a character interaction with a player at different times throughout the game, that won't happen because odds are you'll be in different layers at least a few of those times.
---
Lol AC uses insane amount of electricity dude that’s why it’s wasteful. I figured maybe you used the ac as heating as well which is why I mentioned it.
---
Remember to consult your doctor if it lasts longer than 4 hours. :)
---
Hunter or Warlock but I can't decide.
---
I would always jump and lay a trap so it didnt have the animation and just stand there and wait. I dunno if I am gonna go hunter again, I was pretty solid when I played then but I don't remember kiting being as bothersome as it seems on streams with melee leeway. Could just be my memory, so much has changed over the years.
---
No longer possible in Classic sadly. If Weak Auras work in Classic, the best you could do it create a weak aura to show you which Sting to cast.
---
Yeah...not playing the the game is objectively worse than playing the game, it's the opposite of an opinion actually.
---
It's actually not just an opinion though.  If you seriously think more people will quit because of the minor issues that a casual player won't even notice vs issues like not being able to log in or even find a mob to kill due to overpopulation you are crazy.  You can't even try to argue that's true.  Over half the player population won't even know what layering is.
---
People that can make money with other professions we're already going to make money with those professions regardless, I dont know what your point it exactly.
---
The blacklotus BoP would prevent abusers to sell it on the auction house for 100g each and exploit the market and have a monopoly.
---
They would have to:
---
1: Level herbalism and alchemy. (Costs a lot of extra gold and time)
---
2: They would have to keep these professions for as long as black lotus is BoP.
---
3: They would have to grind dungeons for the flask recipes. (Which within the timeframe of it being BoP could be nigh impossible)
---
4: Everything goes back to normal after phase 1 is done. (When layering it officially gone.)
---
There is no fuzz, people make gold regardless, if that's their purpose it doesn't matter what it is.
---
and casuals dont care. (Since it doesn't affect them in the slighest sense.)
---
I have been building one in my garage to make it easier for me to actually go to. Gotta look like my orc war when release happens haha
---
But, there will be at least N layers worth of people that are there ready to purchase the N layers producing devilsaur leather with the money they made from their XYZ tradeskill or gathering farm.  If they only have one layer of devilsaur leather for many layers of players, the scarcity will be too high and demand too high, which is a real problem.
---
it's bad because those who abuse layering and stockpile it then cannot monopolize the market and sell them at absurd prices. /s

I’d say, base your decision on which race you’d want to play. 
---
If you want Orc, then go shaman. 
---
If you want UD, then go priest. 
---
If you want Troll, grab a coin and flip for it.
---
&gt;	But since all these runs are done on Pserv, we can't know 100% for sure how they will translate on official servers.
---
We have a pretty good idea because there are many great players that can now play on pservers an on beta and compare both to estimate the bias you are referring to.
---
3/3 Humanoid Slaying is actually an extra 100 damage on a 1000 base crit.
---
Without it:
---
    1000 * 2.3 = 2300
---
With it:
---
    (1000 * 1.03) * 2.33 = 2399.9
---
you must have encountered something wrong AC should not give you craps... its actually cleaner as its been filtered 
---
nothing saying you cant have Good insulation and quality construction and AC
---
why is it wasteful no one seems to be able to answer that
---
Ill stay comfortable in the summer, you can sweat if thats your thing
---
Private servers aren't even close to the population Classic will have on launch
---
So is the pvp system, BGs and drops for the priest quest. There’s no reason to progressively unlock non-endgame content.
---
can't be in the same guild unless she can get to my layer in the first place for an invite.
---
Or are you suggesting the 'no switching' has an exemption for guild invites after you pick 2 different layers?
---
Normally I'd agree but fast leveling is normalized now.
---
I'm in a semi-hardcore guild that requires all raiders hit 60 in less than 6 weeks or you're gone. Similar guilds require 2-4 weeks. Rag will be dead on the first week.
---
The normal pace is 3 months. Casual is 5 months. MC lasts a long time; there's no rational reason to rush.
---
Leveling is one of the best parts of vanilla but it's also labor-intensive. It requires breaks, some rest exp here and there, profession work on the side.
---
IMO the game should be enjoyed like sipping a cold beer, not shot down like cheap whiskey.
---
counter attack is honestly kinda trash for what it does. 
---
Chances of getting parryed are already low, on top of a spell that waste so much mana for a measly 40 damage.   To get it, you would have to either lose scatter shot or beastial swiftness, both which are significantly more important.

**&lt;ThunderCats&gt;**
---
NA | PvP | Alliance 
---
**Main Raid Schedule:**
---
Tuesday: 9-12 EST
---
Wednesday: 9-12 EST
---
ThunderCats is a group of Vanilla veterans aiming to compete with the best raiding guilds in Vanilla.  While we are first and foremost a progression-focused raiding guild, we plan to have fun outside raids with guild premades, open world events, and alts.
---
**Who we are looking for:**
---
* Reliable raiders who can consistently perform at a high level.  This includes preparation such as consumables and enchants.
---
* Players who are willing to accept constructive feedback on performance and make adjustments
---
* Team players who are committed to a fun and productive raiding environment
---
What we offer:
---
* A transparent loot council system based on raider preference and guild needs, with item priorities published ahead of raids in a viewable spreadsheet
---
* Experienced Vanilla leadership and raiding strategies
---
* ThunderCats theme song before raids
---
* A community for vanilla wow beyond raiding
---
**Join us on discord:** https://discord.gg/taSRjnF

No matter what class you pick, if you're going to be super casual, consider rolling on a PVE server. All of the die-hards go to PVP servers and while it does change the feel of the game (by making it much more dangerous) that usually isn't what a casual player wants. No one enjoys trying to quest and getting repeatedly killed by a rogue 20 levels higher than you because they think "it's fun"
---
I believe SH has things that help AOE leveling though specifically-
---
adjusted hp/pathing on some mobs can make it easier
---
dynamic respawn -&gt; quicker respawns -&gt; exponentially quicker AOE pulls
---
But yes in general your point is well taken, there will be a couple mages that get ahead of the pack and get to places like the tanaris pirates or dustwallow murlocs / humans / raptors before anyone else and just clean house!
---
Yeah but who gives a shit about the blood elves
---
Night Elf Druid hands down. I don't want to play one at 60 though, so that's out. Very immersive nonetheless.
---
Bold of you to assume anyone will be able to login before September. This a Blizzard release.
---
basically I would hope to find a weekend raiding guild :)
---
pve casuls lol
---
No, it isn't.
---
Turn off Layering = queues.
---
Queues = people wanting off the realm to one without queues.
---
You never have to turn Layering back on.
---
Sorry dude, Little Timmy already listened to "Top 10 ways layering can get your epic mount NOW" on his youtube suggestions.  Now layering is public to even the people that casually open up a web browser and google, how to make money in classic wow.
---
I used to make money by selling those cockroaches and all other base level companions
---
Kids are dumb
---
Mommmm Hot pocketsssss
---
&gt; PW:S when the Holy tree is locked.
---
I'm preeeeeeetty sure shield is on the holy school. If a flash heal gets kicked, you aren't able to shield. Tree =/= school.
---
I'd be in support of that but I strongly doubt it would ever be implemented as it doesn't make server's able to dynamically scale themselves after overall population, which is what Blizzard is ultimately after. It's not just about starting zones.
---
Feelsrealman
---
Also wtf is a gallon and what is the logic behind this Farenheit thing ?
---
for a mediocre guild who is farming the content:
---
mc/bwl one night 2 hours.
---
aq 40 one night 2.5 hours
---
naxx would take a guild 2-3 nights to clear depending on how long your raid times are and how clean the clear is.  
---
obviously any progression raids will take longer and the better guilds can clear the raids much faster.
---
Can't form a bond when you're in a queue either.
---
Your using pirate servers theories except they have very different playerbases and wildly different mechanics. Pirates ain't Blizzard. Best laugh of the day though
---
I hate when parents push their adult hobbies on kids and try to coat it as "spending time with them". There is an age for that and 6 is not it.
---
um AC cant produce heat... it just cools 
---
and they really dont use that much electricity if you have solid insulation (they are much better than they used to be)
---
its really a wonderful thing for the south, it would never have developed the way it has without it. Up here its more of a convince but I work in real estate and I can tell you selling a house with out it is a bitch lol
---
It depends on your calendar. If using the Gregorian calendar then 7 nights.
---
Ah, so a server has a fixed size, which will get split into layers.
---
I guess we'll have an "early" record, and one even better a few months later.
---
Where ya headed
---
No, I just enjoy watching history repeat itself and seeing the the same types of people freak out over things they don't even know yet.
---
Yes because 12 is the starting point for the turnover from evening to morning, so it switches to AM. But we only count in 12 hour increments so after 12 you start new with 1. 
---
Think of it this way - 1 am is one hour past midnight, so we're counting the hours from the most recent halfway point. So at 1 am, you're 1 hour into the morning. At 1 pm, you're 1 hour into the afternoon. 
---
Makes it really easy to tell time from that perspective, and really easy to figure out what time of day it is. Saying 22:00 is harder for me because I have to do the math in my head to figure out what hour it is.
---
The idea of leveling ret is really really unappealing to me. 
---
Does anyone have a suggestion for ways I could make leveling not ret work?
---
00:00 on August 27th.
---
I like your style : )
---
Maybe he has a VPN to blizzard and can route around the ISP's they use to get directly onto their server network.  Otherwise REALM OFFLINE first week at prime time.
---
Ultimately, you don't need a lot of money to start just raiding and getting gear that way. Being cut off from the elite resources doesn't effect the general playerbase, just the high end progression guilds.
---
So you should be forced to wait hours to play a game that you pay for? Yeah no thanks
---
Everyone who doesn't waste money on the AH, buy unnessecary skills, and grinds a little around 36-40, yes. It's pretty standard
---
Blizzard has said that’s sort of the intent in layering. It’s unclear if it’s a persistent attachment or if it’s only for the login session, but they’ve said the intent it to keep you on the layer you start on.
---
I think it is a fair indication of how the data will be exhibited.
---
There are millions of players on private servers. 
---
It’s far more laughable to deny it without any evidence of your own.
---
I mean - it’s fun because you finally have all the tools. Most classes are have everything they need to feel good by mid 20’s and usually feel great by 30. 
---
But warriors - fuck man I’ve leveled several, one in vanilla and a few on private servers and god damn they feel like shit until 40.
---
The way rage works - it’s such a scaling resource that the class just does not feel good till later on - but god damn does it feel good when you get some gear. Only rogues compare imo.
---
I miss having a laptop....
---
If there's only one spawn on a server with 5 layers, the supply of Black Lotus would be much lower than the demand, and prices would skyrocket. The spawns need to be proportional to the playerbase/amount of layers.
---
&gt;resto druid
---
&gt;running from PvP
---
Lol. Did you never fight a Druid?
---
So far I have always beat the curve personally. But it is usually a bit of a group effort early on.
---
Tagging, infinite scrolling mousewheel, macros all help. And insisting on doing all 1-12 quests is optimistic. You’d have to have a nice early lead for that.
---
Level 10 does take longer indeed. We are talking 3+ hours as opposed to 1 hour. But you find areas that are less crowded and suck it up. You have multiple people pulling and tagging.
---
Once you are ahead of the curve, you begin to snowball.
---
If you have concrete questions, ask ahead.
---
Everyone says this, gets downvoted to oblivion. I linked to an old podcast with another dev talking about something similar, get downvoted to oblivion and called a troll. Dev says this on twitch, now people are finally starting to see. I'm fine with that.
---
Yes and profits of wow are also far above OSRS so we could talk about the scaling here.
---
At the end of the day I’m talking about the community response which is similar. As well as the realization that there’s a bigger demand for a more well paced, “old school” approach to MMO’s than people imagine. Both returning players and new younger players. 
---
I really don’t think it makes sense to develop classic onwards with rehashing expansions like tbc etc. 
---
Classic is classic. Expand on that formula indefinitely and you have something going. Build the groundwork now and it’ll be easy to expand on.
---
Yeah, i was arguing the same thing with some guy a couple weeks ago. He was claiming warlocks can chain pull 5 mobs at a time in vanilla lol. I'm like yes, you can technically pull 5 mobs at a time and sometimes live, but you won't be doing it in rapid succession, and your overall speed will be slower than if you just pulled 1 or 2 at a time.
---
If we we're in 2004-06 and read this post as if it was from a time traveler, we would laugh it off as being too hard to believe. I haven't played since end of cata, and I've no idea what most of what you said is, and I'm glad I don't. That sounds like a dystopian nightmare.
---
That makes you even more entitled for arguing against a theoretical server
---
Theres also guilds that req 3 geared 60s by phase 2 for split runs. Everyone plays different
---
I don't even think that is how it's going to be. IMO the world first 60 is going to come from a team of exploiters/clever use of game mechanics. Working together with other players is the key. Possibly some mob tagging in instances with a team of four underleveled characters. If I had to guess, people have already found an optimal power leveling strategy and are keeping it secret on the beta right now, just as Athene did in the WOTLK beta with Utgarde Keep.
---
Because the distribution of hardcore players is not random across the entire range of servers. Going with the previous number, 100 hardcore players, chances are high that these 100 players are clustered into 3 or 4 groups of 25 to 30 players starting the game with the specific goal of getting server firsts etc, and it is those groups of people monopolizing certain resources that could potentially damage the economy of a server. With layered servers, every single server will have those abusing layer hopping (if it is possible), with other people being forced to either abuse layer hopping themselves if they want to stay competitive or fall behind. With a single non-layered server (and many more servers at launch), not every server will have a group of people being able to monopolize the economy, and layer hopping doesn't exist (so potentially a single person could ruin the whole day of a dedicated Black Lotus farmer by ganking them without the farmer being able to escape to a different layer). 
---
Regarding server merges: To be honest, I'd rather have really full servers (going beyond 3000 players, up to 6k+) during the first few weeks or maybe even months, until it naturally tapers off. That way, there would be more scarcity (because the resources one server can produce per time is limited), more competition (meaning more world pvp, which I fully support), and players would be forced to find clever alternative spots to farm if the common spots are crowded. The world would feel far more alive, you would have an easier time finding a group for dungeons (and dungeon farming would probably become more attractive because of their instanced nature). Obviously, the potentially downsides would be overcrowded quest areas, especially in the starting zones, but that's in my opinion a low price to pay for the upsides, especially since the starting zones are such a small part of the game.
---
we are talking about modern heal bot
---
Yeah when I stayed up for 75 it was equivalent to being very intoxicated. I couldn't walk straight and had to use the walls to brace myself walking to the bed. It was early morning when I went to bed and birds would chirp and I would jump in my seat when they did it after being quiet for a few moments. I couldn't really form coherent thoughts anymore at that point either.
---
Sleep deprivation is pretty serious. My second longest time is about 68 hours and after that my longest was about 48 or so hours. I used to frequently binge play video games as a teenager and would take it as a challenge to do as much as possible in a single sitting while having leveling competitions with friends to goals. 
---
As an adult, I wouldn't ever deprive myself of sleep to play video games. Stay up late sure, but thats it.
---
Mfw, the 12 hour clock was invented back in Egypt in 1500 BC, because of sun dials.
---
If You're OK with not being able to play for weeks, just don't play till they remove layering.
---
I would say the most important are the first 2 macros, as they're all about pet control. After that, maybe raptor strike, wing clip, and freezing trap?
---
Choosing one class over another is not going to solve your insecurities and feelings of being "wanted".
---
A successful player can unlock the usefulness of whatever class they play. A bad player is one who needs to rely on their class. Do you really want to get picked to do a dungeon just because you're a healer and not because you're actually good at the game?
---
You're being a bit obtuse mate, of course you're not going to be dpsing in the raid. 
---
You spec like this so many reasons: so that you're not gimped in solo play,
---
so you can do quest and then heal a dungeon right after and then go to a battleground and actually be able to burst someone on top of healing the team, and then finish the raid at the end of the night.
---
All while only losing manatide and doing 10% less healing and without spending 50 gold everything you want to do something *other* than an instance.
---
Honestly man, you lose next to nothing  in terms of healing potential over a full resto spec while gaining loads of versatility.
---
I wish I could. I mean I might hop on and play for a day or two but knowing that life and work won’t allow it to continue. It ain’t fun if you aren’t raiding.
---
Oh it definitely is wonderful for the south no one will argue that. And I’ve literally used ACs that can produce heat.. guess it was an added function in that case? 
---
I get it people are culturally used to having ACs. Without realizing there’s much more comfortable options of keeping your house cool.
---
i'm wondering if a shaman multibox farming dungeons will be close to the top.
---
Most decent guilds replace raidloggers asap
---
It doesn't matter how many times you tell yourself that, it isn't true.
---
Still not good. Try me- 
---
Edgemere#2503
---
I quit after legion, just lost all the fun for me.
---
After a lot of reflection I just feel like it's soul has gone.
---
Can't wait for  classic and that lived in feel to the world.
---
What a new and innovative idea! And by new and innovative I mean old, repeated, and bad.
---
Ohhhhhhmygosh best game ever love everquest!!
---
short advice for new players in Classic:
---
if you want the same great memories and experience as we had in Classic &gt; don´t do this!
---
Basically your Healing Wave gets a lot worse. You wont take imp healing wave or healing way. This makes a lot of difference if you are healing tanks with Healing Wave, possibly in 40 mans but even more likely in dungeons or 20s. 
---
Otherwise, if you are just using LHW (PvP) or Chain Heal (raid healer), really you only miss out on Purification and so can operate at 90% efficiency. 
---
You also lose out on a lot of mana talents - ancestral knowledge, mana tide/restorative totems, and possibly totemic focus - and also your totem range extension. But for spamming chain heal you'll be fine.
---
Half our raiding guild quit shortly after Panda was announced.  Me and most of those folks are coming back to Classic.
---
He's a pro-layering fool sarcastically trolling.  Doesn't surprise me that you can't recognize that, anyone who thinks layering is a good idea has got to be pretty dull.
---
How could I forget the almighty corn staff
---
At one point, I would have been one of those noobs salivating over your sick epics
---
Congrats on getting beta access!!
---
yeah if you aren't back pedal tapping the melee leeway will activate and they will hit you from further.
---
It will be quite random. There are a few tens or perhaps hundreds of people that possibly got what it takes. For a handful the stars will align.
---
Priest is by far the better leveler.  Shamans have to drink often in comparison.
---
I mean, if you're goal is competitive raiding and trying to get as high ranked as possible on your server, then leveling quickly is a necessity. Even more so when you consider that the raids themselves are a joke, and will pose no actual challenge to top guilds. It's all about how quickly they can get to level and farm all the stuff they need to farm. 
---
For anyone who isn't doing competitive progression raiding... then yeah, I don't know. Vanilla runs out of content pretty fast at 60, especially if you're not raiding. I don't know why people want to rush towards that as quickly as possible. I'm planning on taking my time and enjoying it. It's kind of a shame there won't be BGs on launch to mess around in while leveling.
---
I always wonder how people know they are ignorant on a subject so they create a post on a forum about it - but then argue with everyone as if they are somehow no longer ignorant. 
---
Why ask a question and then argue with people when they give you correct answers?  
---
Based on this post alone - nope. You will not be a scarab lord.
---
Similar to a toxic relationship with an ex, it comes and goes.
---
Played until late TBC, then dropped after being gladiator at S3.
---
Started again at WOTLK, then dropped after killing the Lich King.
---
Started again mid-Cataclysme for Arena, then dropped after realizing how bad the PvP had become.
---
Played the last month of Pandaria before WoD, dropped after a few weeks of WoD.
---
Started again at BFA for a few weeks, dropped.
---
Had some extra marital experiences with ps servers in the middle (TBC for arena, vanilla for the classic feel).
---
what is this more comfortable option you speak of ?
---
Well I went after [this](https://i.redd.it/xpz3z1ly1dy21.png) explanation. As you can see the middle pie has 8k people, while the right one has 3k. Where do the others go? They must have their own server or else you'll have an overpopulated shitshow.

About Us: &lt;No Bedtime&gt; is a guild created with the mindset of completing all content WoW Classic has to offer in a competitive time table. The goal in mind for the guild was to harbor all different players from Casual to Hardcore Raiding, to create a mature community that you would want to be a part of and meet new people with similar goals and aspirations. Having a casual player base creates a healthy balance to keep the spirits high and everyone grounded.  Ideally the goal is to shoot for top 5-10 in terms of PvE progression on the realm of choice. We will be rolling on a non-streamer realm to avoid the plague of immaturity that many of their followers bring.
---
Experience : Personally I've cleared and been a RL for all content until Naxx (AQ 9/9) playing across three different roles. This experience was in the Pserver scene but has provided valuable feedback for progressing forward into Classic. At the same time I was acting as the second in command, where this time I would be acting as GM. Playing on NA ping, and acting as a GM will be a new journey that I'm excited for!
---
Expectations / Closing Statements : If you are looking to join, then I expect you know how to conduct yourself among other humans with a sense of morality and maturity. We are looking for people who are enjoyable to be around but who also have a goal they would want to achieve. There are different ranks among the guild of which you can find your fit intermittently for the time being or a more cemented spot in the Raiding Roster.

If you are interested in joining then you contact me via Discord and/or fill out a guild application or catch me in game; if you are interested in being a pivotal part of our success and joining the officiating ranks of (Class Leader / Council Member) also message me via Discord.

I have a lot of experience with warlocks in vanilla. Here's my answer.
---
In battlegrounds and group PvP, it's not a huge deal. It will turn the tide of a fight every now and then, but overall, group PvP has a lot more going on than one racial. Not worth worrying about if that is what you want.
---
However, in open world PvP / 1v1s, it's pretty powerful. Like, if two players are of equal skill level, it's fight-winning powerful. Be prepared to get frustrated if you roll on a PvP server. You'll lose several 1v1's due to WotF and nothing else.
---
Someone called me 12 on the internet PepeHands
---
There is about a 1% chance that someone will have more than one level 60 in Vanilla.  That's like minimum 350 hours for 2 characters to level 60.
---
True that once they're out, they're out. Also if playing in group I guess it makes the tagging and experience much easier. especially for early levels if you're getting constantly healed etc... 
---
My only concern, for me, is that I'm gonna roll a fury warrior. I rolled one on a pserv to get back into it and get comfortable with the route (using joanna's guide, no idea if it's the best around ?).  
---
And it's a fucking chore at low level. I guess once I hit 20 and can finally dual wield, game will be easier. gotta see that tonight at home !
---
I quit start of Cata as my guild lost 7 core members on LK25 HC and never really became the same. Been back for a couple of months every expansion, but I was not really hooked. Only did a bit of raiding on normal difficulty, the one called heroic (???) now. 
---
My good friend told me that he has 20 friends lined up for release, but it's probably more like 5. They're all trying to convince me to roll horde, but I'm an alliance player since day 1 and that is where my heart belongs lol. I'm gonna roll a druid, though I hated the class until recently. Can't wait!
---
As a mage, I found killing Disc priests to be basically impossible 1v1. I never had issues with Shammies or Druids or pallies.
---
Only if you haven't worn it though. I specifically said "equipped BOE's".  Fact is that you are better off selling most BOE's you aren't going to use, but the ones you do use end up getting vendored unless you can DE them. That was the point I was making.
---
This is the most polite "fuck layering my game is ruined, REEE" post I've seen on this sub in a long time.  My hats off to you man, and may your experience in the game be fun.
---
Nope. Priest, been decided for months.
---
Thanks :-)
---
Yup, exactly what it sounds like. The I want to be carried and bring no consumes and show up late mentality but still demand a spot. Fuck those people. They'll never cut it in an AQ40/Naxx guild much less BWL.
---
I meant when they remove them.
---
that was my guess as well
---
Just to explain it for you, as you seem like a person that needs stuff to be explained out to. 
---
- Its a reference to Eminems song: Cleanin’ out my closet. Maybe your not so cultured as you might think...
---
NElf is the Uber race for busy adults. 
---
Shadowmeld for unexpected AFKing. 
---
Death speed for when you get killed after your baby cries and you’ve inevitably been killed if shadowmeld was on CD
---
STARSHARDS for leveling are awesome and super fun to watch.  They look like arcane middles, but cooler IMO. 
---
Way less busy areas so less fighting over mobs.
---
I agree with you.   
---
I raided mythic myself in the beginning of Legion (EN + ToV) I quit legion when nighthold released, did a run through on heroic and thats it, and I never raided in BfA, i quit 1 week after Uldir.  
---
 But regards to the skill manner, I think we interpret it differently, my personal definition is "Skill" when talking about games has to be player vs player scenarios.  
---
When you're talking about PVE its basically all "knowledge" of the encounter and in the beginning some puzzle/problem solving.  
---
If a player is mechanically skilled that is definitely gonna shoot their DPS up so they can compete with better geared players.
---
We had an undead tank. gg
---
lol wouldn't surprise me
---
I quit because it was too easy.
---
Did you at least not even like seeing places like Ironforge, Blackrock Mountain, etc. on such a large scale?
---
I found that as long as loot and vendor everything and sell random greens you get on the AH and roll a Paladin or Warlock, you can easily get your mount at 40
---
I’m going to play casually around 10-15 hours a week, and am leaning towards PVE since I’ll already be a slow leveler. How long should I wait after launch to ensure a decently populated server? Last time I played was when vanilla was originally released and stopped after BC.
---
This is true, but for point 1 I always thought Alliance had more convenient capital placement? At least for BRD, BRS, MC, and BWL, which is all a significant part of earlyish endgame. Horde does have better placement for leveling dungeons like SM, RFD, Maraudon, and endgame dungeons like Scholo and Strat, and then I suppose Naxx, AQ, and Onyxia are a bit easier for them to reach.
---
In having played on a realm merge in the past, it was really bad having players with their own bank alts joining our server and their server.  The economy was pretty much in the tank for the rest of the xpac.  Players were arms up in the air about having to /w character-realmname, and guilds were a similar problem too.
---
My guild was very late to the raiding party. We cleared Ragnaros midsummer '06. Nefarian was down by September and we got to Huhuran in November. By the time we were farming the first bosses in AQ we already were picking up people who would pay with gold for loot. In the end of the month members would get a cut depending on raid attendance and performance. I can imagine guilds don't ng this for much longer.
---
quit after wotlk ...came back to try the panda one ...things felt easy and empty so quit again.  Coming back for classic for sure.
---
I came here to give this advice.  Just keep two characters the main you play when you're alone and the alt you keep to level the 5 hours a week your friends actually play.
---
Imagine reading all this fucking whining about layering, then coming to the conclusion that a "loud majority" is in favor of layering.
---
With Sm ruin spec using curse of exhaustion you can beat pretty much anyone. Clever use of engineering, escape artist, potions helps a ton. The cherry on the cake is this. If you are an alliance warlock and want to be hardcore like me, buy 2 freezing bands and use a good amount of stam gear and you will do just fine.
---
Top end guilds will breeze through the first couple of phases worth of content because it’s simple. 
---
The “casual player” (according to this subreddit) will not have a problem with the content for the first few phases, it will just take them more time because they aren’t rushing to 60 to beat content from a 15 year old game before other people.
---
Then you’ll have the LFR noobs that prove just because you meet the requirement for entry, doesn’t mean you know what you’re doing. They will be the ones standing in fire, getting blown up by simple mechanics, and then rage quit when they don’t get loot on the first or second boss.  But these people are going to be the minority for the first phase or two (depending on how long phase one lasts).
---
There will also be a small but hopefully growing base of noobs who legitimately want to learn and clear content. But their own dedication and willingness to learn will determine if they are Pro LFR Champs or honest noobs. The honest noobs can graduate to casual or hardcore raider whereas the LFR Champion will just cry that he isn’t getting free epics and expect full invites to progression raiding despite not having completed any of the attunements other than MC (which he only got because someone else mentioned it during his one and only run of BRD).
---
I quit about a month after cataclysm and recently reinstalled to mess around in live until classic.
---
I think you are misinterpreting your own info lol 
---
all layers form the same server merge to one layer onve the population is low enough
---
play a human. Cute &gt; Fear ward.  If you love your character you will keep playing. If you don't you will stop.  A priest who shows up &gt; an abandoned raider spot--- every day
---
There’s only a finite amount of content that can be crammed into old Azeroth though, without making the original content sidelined and obsolete. 
---
I think TBC and Wrath make perfect sense. There’s a lot in those expansions that people still long for, that can’t be satisfied by either modern WoW or Vanilla. Also, it would be a welcome inflation to the sub numbers, and a BC/Wrath replication is much, *much* easier and cost effective than 1.14 content.
---
I changed my mind a few times, but I'm not going with a class I'm used to.  I always knew I'd be Horde.  I'm always Horde and I don't plan on changing that now.  The Barrens is just so much better compared to Westfall, Redridge, and Loch Modan.  Darkshire definitely beats out Stonetalon Mountains and Ashenvale though in that level range and DEFINITELY beats out Hillsbrad Foothills.  But then you get to 1k needles at level 28.5 and don't have to leave until 32 which is a huge stretch at that point.  From then on, most questing zones have to be visited by both factions so it doesn't really matter much.
---
My class and race I'm more up in the air with.  I've decided on Tauren Druid because druids are just so versatile and are really good in 1v1 wPvP.  I was thinking hard about going priest, but decided against it to get the higher versatility as a druid and the move speed bonus at levels 20-21 and 30.
---
So one week? Fat chance
---
yup, tech evolved super fast in the earlier days. Then the ps3 was almost 10 years old before it stopped being relevant!
---
Framerate &gt; resolution as always. Your 1060 will handle WoW at 144hz. Test the beta/stress test client first if you can and get a frame rate output to make sure that's the case, you may have to turn some things down. If you're used to playing at 60hz, 144hz will blow you away.
---
Curved isn't really any better or worse, curved is more for viewing angles which is pretty meaningless at a desktop.

Layer bad
---
Give me up-votes
---
Edit: Thanks for gold kind stranger.
---
How is it a slippery slope? If we get BC, we still have Classic this time.
---
&gt; no one wants to wake up one day and have a server which is 75% people you've never had a chance to encounter before.
---
THAT IS EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH LAYERING.  HOW DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND THIS?!?!?!?
---
That guy you met at level 15 who helped you out?  You think you'll chance in to him again at level 20?  Even with three layers you're three times less likely to run into him in a situation where you normally would have (which might already be a low chance).
---
I don't get how everyone is overlooking this.  The base game already, even on one server, lacks continuity as people are playing at different times, etc.  Forming bonds/ rivalries with players is already awesome but **rare** in ONE SERVER.  Now you later that up, the odds you'll run into a person enough to form a bond are exceedingly low to the point of impossibility.  It's basic fucking probability.
---
Unreal.
---
Private servers don't represent the average playerbase.
---
This is a very good idea. Is it Yours? This can be THE compromise acceptable to both players who don't want layering past starting zones and Blizzard who don't want that development resources they spent on layering to be wasted.
---
 Although maybe not 50 but 40+ or even 30+ since most of the "tourists" won't make it past 20.
---
Top hardcore guilds are capable of doing MC+BWL+AQ40+Naxxramas in one raid day, 4-5 hours.
---
For most casual guilds, they will do every raid on a separate day.
---
AQ gates with layers, lol.

Using and abusing your allies? How very Alliance of you.
---
I already got bunch of quests ready to skip in barrens: Disrupt the Attacks and Southsea Freebooters will be nightmarish.
---
thats not much of an explanation on how to cool ones house, its more like build a better house lol
---
not an option for most 
---
and I dont know why isolating your house would help (I know you meant insulation im just silly lol)
---
Isn't this how sharding works? Implement sharding everywhere, but set maximum number of shards to 1, or maximum number of players per shard to 1 million, for every zone except the desired zones.
---
I feel your pain about Hunter dmg but the thing is, in Vanilla, it's more about spreading Viper Sting than it is about big damage. Viper Sting abuse can turn the tide of a battle.
---
In WotLK they changed it a lot.  There was barely any aggro management, you just have to get their attention in the beginning and that's it.
---
Awesome, i just left there (high school summer field trip) i loved it. Have a great time.
---
well he asked for Maximum 
---
but yeah that is true
---
Just get seal of command. That is pali PvP #1
---
The run speed is also very helpful
---
I went to BWL with a guild in Vanilla, you didn't have to pay but you bid on items in gold. My friend bought a cloak for £30 worth of gold (he'd bought from a goldseller), then replaced it a month later in TBC.
---
A parry negates all damage. Be it 10 or 1000. And it triggers counter attack which you should have specced
---
BC is BC it’s not classic. And this will just lead to inevitable wotlk &gt; cata etc.
---
Realize that for a lot of people wotlk or cata is “classic/old school” to them.
---
People WILL run out of content eventually and WILL demand to move on or activision will lose money on this investment they made in classic wow.
---
Do you want the content to follow the same path again? Or expend on classic gameplay with fresh new content? Keep it classic at its core. 
---
I know what I want.
---
Something that I think gets overlooked is the XP you get just from exploring early on. If you're struggling in the spawn area, you can actually walk between faction cities and get to level 3-4 in the process. By then, you can probably move on to the second quest hub.
---
So for instance, having trouble leveling as an orc because everyone and their dog rolled orc warrior? Walk to Thunderbluff and pick up quests there. By the time you're ready to head back to Durotar maybe it will have calmed down a bit.
---
Of course, this strategy only works from level 1. After that, exploration XP is not really worth it.
---
Bro the Alliance are assholes wtf? No wonder I’ve been Horde this entire time. What do you think about Troll Mages though? Lore wise... I know people say it’s bullshit, but I don’t want to get lost on the undead bandwagon.
---
It’s literally the opposite
---
Honestly the worst part about BFA for me is that it is a clear step down from almost everything they did in Legion. Legion had it's flaws, but it was the biggest step in the right direction that WoW has had in a long time. And in BFA they removed so much of what was good in Legion and either replaced it with something worse, or didn't replace it with anything.
---
The "new" content of BFA, Warfronts and Expeditions are some of the most boring, lazy content Blizz has ever made. I new I was quitting when 8.1 hit and I did the the new Warfront that was somehow more boring and less interactive than the Arathi one.
---
WoW finally seemed like it was headed in a good direction, Legion was by all accounts a big success, and BFA just took a shit on everything and snuffed out any hope.
---
samsies!
---
Considering that layering in bfa is dynamic it's most likely even more resource intensive than running more servers.
---
I was obsessed over the beta. Managed to find other things to obsess about thus backing off on classic obsession.
---
This is a nice reminder. Almost there!
---
I’ve started causing arguments already, I’m hoping she leaves me before the end of August

---
the layering spam.... it never ends
---
I don't get this layering. Is this something new they added? When I played Lich King I don't remember there being a problem with this. Didn't even think layering existed
---
&gt;	using joanna's guide, no idea if it's the best around ?
---
In a vacuum, it is good (but not very good for warriors). Certainly good, though. The issue with it is that it is the most popular guide. People that have the same pace as you will use it. You will notice that and it leads to traffic jams.
---
The key is probably being able to adapt and not tunnel vision on steps of the guide. Then again, some steps you really don’t want to skip because they lead to chains and are the reason why the guide leads you to some areas. You might get into a zone where you should do 7 quests but find yourself only with 1-2! Knowing which can be skipped requires research and/or experience.
---
20 is not easier as a warrior and dual wielding is generally not advised. The rough phase is around lvls 18-30. Once you are 30 you get sweeping strikes and you should absolutely respec into arms at that point. Fury is generally only advised past level 20 if you are able to time a /sit macro properly.
---
Keep in mind that leveling as warrior on classic is much easier and you will have a much easier time than on any of the two relevant pservers. Players would rely on hamstring and they agree it is for the most part no longer needed.
---
A good advise is to try and stick to mobs that are 2 levels below you. Keep it at 0-2 below you at all times!
---
If you struggle early, check what weapons you have. Buy white ones (as Orc Large Axe and Tabar). Your class quest gives you a nice one hander and a shield is underappreciated if you struggle.
---
Hunt your key weapons.
---
The male NE bow animations grew on me. I also like the way they look in gear, and their bows are huge which looks awesome. Female NE hunters are overplayed these days, I feel like males are less popular and have become more refreshing and unique over the years.
---
haha i wish it handled 4k. But then we are talking double the price on everything here X.X
---
I do plan on being in a guild with several friends who are leading it so I'd end up being an officer, so maybe I could get priority on it when it did drop, but I suppose the drop rate is incredibly low. Sounds like the best option would be to go engineering at end game straight away. Would leveling with Mining/Skinning be a good plan? Figure I can make some decent money off skinning and vendoring and the mining could just be saved for engineering at the end. Don't know if there's a better route there, just want to ensure that when I got to 60 I could essentially power level engineering quickly, either buying mats or using the ones I have.
---
But you’ll just lose all your gains when Classic hits anyway
---
yeah 4k is not cheap... yet
---
His argument is entirely from the perspective of a PvE player who's only goal is to entirely optimize PvE raid performance, which is such a trivial thing to literally any other player aka 95% of the Vanilla Players.
---
If you have any interest in doing solo stuff (farming, mat collecting, quests, etc.), instances (healer or dps), world pvp or pvp battle grounds, it is actively detrimental to go full on (0/5/46) healer spec compared to any variant of ele-resto.
---
He is being pedantic on purpose for the sake of raid pve optimization which is the dumbest thing considering raids are not the end all be all of Vanilla/Classic.
---
Ret paladins are still bitches to take down, but outside of reckoning bombs they hit like wet noodles.
---
How?
---
T2 doesn’t offer any bonus to shadow resistance?
---
Correct me if im wrong. Didn't bliz say layering will only be for the first 2-3 weeks and only in the starting zones?
---
Om my server we usually clear mc, ony and bwl im About 3 hours with an organised pug.
---
My guild clears the same and aq40 on an evening of raiding. 
---
Naxx on Another might.
---
thanks for the suggestion :) I have tried out a p server a little yesterday and even at a 60hz display it is beautiful and flawless. I think I might go with a 27 inch 144hz at 1080p and see how that works out. curver is another 100 bucks haha
---
I don't think anyone who ever cared to stop and think about a location in WoW believes it has the normal size or features necessary for the NPCs to live there. Most settlements in WoW don't even have dormitory for all the NPCs in it. (I actually think only SW and IF with their fake housing could take all the NPCs that are shown.
---
The size of a farm in Westfall is almost not big enough to provide food for a single family. lol
---
It would be really amazing if Blizzard or some other company did a WoW 2 with a larger scale(and eventually more players in each zone at the same time). SW being the size of Novigrad would be enough for a believable medieval game capital city.
---
Unfortunately I don't think massive investments will be done in big new MMO game by Blizzard in the near future or maybe ever as they're shifting their creative power to things more aligned with the current mobile market, including strategies that comes from this market in their games.
---
&gt; Except it doesn't need to be before phase 2 because you said what you collected remains BoP into phase 2.
---
It prevents them from selling them at the auction house in phase 1 during layering and afterwards, anything that they collected will be unsellable unless they make them all into flasks. (Again that's a huge investment on their part, and a LOT of time.)
---
Once they get recipes for the flasks, it doesn't matter, other people will have gotten the flasks anyway, and the mount of people that buy flasks and black lotuses straightup from the AH is also in the very minority. (I think you overestimate the amount of people buying this stuff.)
---
They'll be undercutting eachother into oblivion, to see which one can dump the flasks or blacklotus's first, the economy is barely going to be affected by this. (And once the casuals and others get to 60 and 300 herbalism and when layering is gone, its going to stablizile accordingly.)
---
&gt; I think what he asked is up for interpretation
---
Only if you cant read
---
Just shard the starting zones where it is actually needed because of population density, and resources aren't super important to the economy.
---
Now that’s some proper out-of-the-box thinking
---
I played a bit at launch but didn't hit level cap. Picked the game up several years later when some IRL friends started a small guild. We played the last couple months of TBC and into WotlK. Somewhere mid WotlK I lost interest and just stopped logging in. To me getting achievements and doing the dailies grind had nothing to do with the reason I started playing. As such I just burned out on it.
---
At the end my playstyle was to log in, do my daily quests, do my daily dungeons see that my IRL friends were busy (people started having kids) and then I would log off. Since I wasn't get the social interaction with my friends anymore and I didn't find the grind interesting in the slightest that was the end of it for me.
---
I'm not sure what to expect from Classic. I'll probably just solo level to 60 a few hours a week. Depending on how much my friends play. Then eventually cancel my sub again.
---
A vanilla server had a fixed size of 4K because of server technology in 2004, layering is suppose to imitate the 4K. While allowing more than 4K players to play on the same server at the same time, after layering is removed, if more than 4K are still playing on that server there will he login ques.
---
Devilsaur respawn timers are roughly 10 and 20 minutes. Combined with multiple spawns, it would make it way harder to control all layers if there is even 2min CD
---
Oh 100%. Hunters are one of the best PvP classes because of their kit. I just personally like more burst
---
I played Alliance back in the day, then swapped to horde, and swapped 2 more times over the years to be horde still.
---
I'll go Horde in Classic.
---
I may have misunderstood it but afaik you'd have a cd between two layer Switch to prevent abuse and another one to prevent you from being layered while fighting or PvP. The mining stuff was unclear though but i guess it's to prevent abuse toi.
---
 It was a post from Tipsout iirc, i'll try to find the source
---
Sorry for the noob question. But you said "For essentially zero benefit over a lv5 with enchanting skill at 1". Do you not need to level enchanting up a bit to be able to disenchant items over a certain level? I know it works this way in retail.  Like, a level 5 bank alt can't DE a green my main got from a level 40 quest can it?
---
It depends entirely on the guild man. Each guild does things differently. One guild might be "Invites at 7:45, we pull at 8", others might be "Be online and ready for an invite/summon at 8".
---
*xxlegolasxx is already taken* "WTF"
---
-Layering supporters in a nightmare world of cross server name pools, probably
---
I originally quit during 5.2 in MoP I was burnt out, and Old school runescape came back. Quit in July of 2013, didn't come back until May of 2014.
---
I came back off and on until SoO, completed that stayed until the last year of WoD. Played almost all of legion, and finally "quit" during BoA.  Didn't get bored or anything, just went on a few vacations and got back into oldschool runescape.
---
Really looking forward to just seeing the old zones, and doing MC and ect while it's relevant.
---
So just stop eating. Forever.
---
Yeah, there's my problem with this "once the population is low enough". If the population doesn't fall off, will they still keep the same server size, even if it's enormous? Didn't they aim for vanilla like server sizes?
---
it's just exaggerated statements for the sake of humor
---
I played from late-vanilla (2006) to the end of Burning Crusade, resubbing briefly in WotLK to level 70-80 before quitting for good. The prospect of Classic intrigued me, so exactly one year ago today I created a character on a vanilla private server and was hooked. I played 8-9 months on the private server before deeming it a complete waste of time with Classic around the corner.
---
Earlier this week, I resubbed to WoW for the first time since 2008. I'm leveling a new character and basically just killing time until Classic is released I look forward to seeing the zones for all the expansions I missed. I'm also looking forward to the art and such of Legion and BFA, which, despite the consensus state of the game now, seems to be a high point. Leveling in BFA is very different that how it used to be. Sharding, phasing, cross-realm, scaling, etc. I'm casually enjoying BFA but it certainly hasn't hooked me in the same way Classic will. At level 33, I've got a long way to go before 120.
---
Except it hasn't been a good way to get upvotes in a while, talking about a negative of classic wow is like sacrilege around here , fuckin lol
---
Phase 1: MC and ony should take about 2 hours total after they are progressed through.
---
Phase 3: BWL is added. Can be added on to the single raid night from before after you are comfortable with it pushing the total to 3-3.5 hours.
---
Phase 4: ZG. You do this one twice a week so the scheduling gets quite messy here. it's not all too hard so it's a 1-1.5 hour run that you will just have to fit in somewhere.
---
Phase 5&amp;6: At this point it will heavily depend on how much you play. With 2 raid days you can expect to clear AQ40 after some time while keeping the other day for the rest of the raids as mentioned earlier. Naxx will be hard to push into with this schedule.
---
Alliance *needs* more people to roll Warlocks to be able to defend us against Shamans. Without Alliance Warlocks on the battlefield, Horde becomes too powerful because Shamans. CoT abuse on Shamans can absolutely change the outcome of a BG.
---
I die inside every time I read one of these.
---
I’m guessing the beta will likely conclude with this test, but this is pure speculation
---
yea, you have this subreddit glorifying this spec when in vanilla it literally pulls half if not less in dps than top tier dps specs
---
going there at lvl 1 doesnt give you the quest so you cant learn the org flight path ... not the same
---
Right at the launch people won't be pugging raids but gradually over time they'll be speed run by pugs.
---
&gt;But HEY 1 guild owning 50% of the servers gold isnt a problem right?
---
I you think about it, it really isn't. Leaving aside the fact that this will happen with or without layering ... What are they going to do with all that gold that will impact my gameplay? That's right ... nothing. Based on my past experiences most of the shit I care about in Classic can either be accomplished by farming solo or with a group.
---
As far as I'm concerned they can waste their whole life getting all the gold in the world and then melt it and cast into giant gold dildos and shove them up their buts. Once I get my mount I won't give a single flying fuck about any gold past the repair bills and the respec costs. And I really don't get why others care so much about it.
---
Save some skins too to craft all the goggles.
---
Yep, priest main and warlock alt planned for me.
---
Mercy please, I dont think I can take anymore
---
the layering spam its taking over!
---
How is there 4 times the demand LMAO? Who helped you with your math homework. 100 people in a city, the forest has 20 mines, but phases into 4 so 80 mines. Now there’s 80mines worth of ore for a city of 100 demanding ore. Where tf did you get 400 people from?
---
Shield and stamina are way better.
---
Ahh sorry, thought you meant 21 ele/30 resto.
---
Probably viable once they gear up, but I'd think things like Purification and mana spring would be necessary until then.
---
Oh God, that's even worse! Teaching him to be a clicker lol
---
NALP
---
A layering post I can get behind!
---
Who knows. I don't see the beta going up until launch.
---
And I imagine the beta would also conclude before players are able to reserve names the week or two prior to launch. I think you're right in that the beta will likely come to an end around late July.
---
Quit after Cata because honestly the game stinks and I did not like the direction the game was going. Every class is almost the same in regards to their skills/moves. I am back for Classic because a good RPG there is unbalanced aspects and I love the hard counters. Also, world PVP and the community aspect that was so rich in the game until around the end of WoTLK.
---
I highly suggest you to re-check the stats on database
---
I feel like those who get to 60 first have a distinct advantage in gold making early, even more so if layering persists past the first week. Little to no competition means that it’s much easier to dominate the market on gathering mats and crafted goods. Open world farming spots are much less populated which means more uptime than any other time in the game. 
---
These early gold advantages can provide starting capital to invest in cheap items the Zerg puts on the ah while the supply is high/ demand is low. Once the server economy stabilizes, the knowledgeable  early 60s will have a large enough stock of rarer items to grow their fortune exponentially.
---
Depending on the player, they might also want to get started on gearing pre bis and finding other “top tier” players to guild with for hardcore raiding (if they don’t already have a guild from a pserver.)
---
I personally want to bum rush my first character to 60 for several reasons outside of these that I’ve listed. The big one is that while playing with other people while leveling is great, trying to compete with mob spawns for quest mobs against the Zerg of other levelers is aids. (Yes layering can fix that, though I feel that it will cause much more harm than good). 
---
I do intend to take my time on my alt and smell the roses on my second play through though.
---
Easier to multibox than a variety of classes, everyone has a shield/decent cleave, can heal/chain heal the whole stack easily. It's mostly that multiboxing a variety of classes is pretty rough when talking about speed/efficiency
---
The most appealing thing for classic to me is that the world is vast with numerous was to engage without any time-gate(mostly) content like dailys. I can just login and play when I feel like it, and choose what activities I want to do without limitations.
---
Classic is perfect for this save for the weekly raid lockout. At least it's only MC &amp; Ony at first but I may grow tired/get bored by AQ/Naxx. And this has more with not having anything else to do(mostly because I done it with multiple chars by this point) other than login in ~2 days a week just for raids. Wouldn't surprise me if my playtime falls off a lot by then, just like it did in Vanilla, and I'm okay with that :)
---
Disclaimer: posting this from the perspective of a warrior duo leveling with a pocket healer.
---
I will be skipping the whirlwind axe for several reasons. First as you stated, at lauch it is unlikely you'll get the axe at low 30s. I estimate the earliest the axe can reasonably gotten at launch is at 36. The elementals in arathi are 36-39 in level so grinding them without too much time loss should not be really done before 36. Add to that droprate and you'll likely hit 37 after grinding enough elementals for your charms. At that level as alliance you might as well find a party for SM and get bonebiter.
---
Even if you can get enough charms off the AH to get the axe at 30 the time you gain from having the weapon early will be lost at 40 due to you likely not being able to afford your mount immediately.
---
That being said i will be levelling as fury all the way (again, got a pocket healer). Reason for this is 40+. Both horde and alliance will have access to 2 30dps swords, one each from SM and RFD. Then possible upgrades in ZF if you're lucky, otherwise the next big upgrade is available in Maraudon with thrash blade which is good enough to hit 60 with. That means from level 40 upwards you'll have no delays from weapon skill when you switch weapon type since you will only use 1h swords and the key upgrades are all guaranteed since they are quest rewards. 
---
Levelling arms will likely require you to be lucky with blue drops from dungeon bosses (Uldaman polearm and hammer, ZF polearm, Maraudon axe) they are unreliable at best.
---
Quit at the tail end of WotLK not too long after LFR came out. I never really liked flying mounts as I believe they destroyed the immersive danger and adventure. Then when rumor was that you'd soon be able to have flying mounts everywhere, I was out.
---
Later, 4 roommates in university started playing MoP so I joined. It was too simple, unrewarding, and didn't feel like a "World" or a traditional MMORPG, just your typical lobby MMO. Eventually most of us lost interest, I think 1 still plays. All but said 1 are coming back and excited. We haven't really been social with each other in a long time due to good ol' life after school and this is going to bring us all back, online at least.
---
How's your current save going?
---
I'm going to quit the game because some top end players were able to get a few extra mats, but multiple hour wait Qs and no mobs to kill are perfectly fine.
---
We need /r/classicwowlayering.
---
I remember when the new Silithus content with the cultists was first patched in killing a mob only to see it respawning three seconds later. It was actually pretty dangerous.
---
What’s your nameplate addon? Looks like your name part is pink, the green looks different, same with the mana
---
The great cycle continues
---
Play what you like my friend unless your are planing on raiding HC it matters little
---
Yea, I have a feeling there will be literal casualties with Classic's launch the way people are talking about playing.
---
It literally wasn't playable in 2004. For like the first week or so.
---
We all know the person that says "I bet you're fun at parties" is the person who's the most fun at parties.
---
Why start arguments? Just pull her into the game, that's what my boyfriend did. A couple who plays together stays together.
---
Just be picky and join instance groups with warlocks that can summon you.  That's the perk of being a tank!
---
Min maxers and try hards will tell you otherwise man but you can play any class casually and at your own pace. You wanna play warrior, go warrior. Just have fun with it and do your own thing if that's what you want
---
If you want to feel wanted play Warlock and people will lick your feet.
---
lol I like it
---
This is actually quite nuanced and there is a huge array of things I dislike about it. Way too many to cover it in a Reddit comment.
---
So I will have to pick one or two. Implementations vary and the two relevant pservers had some notable problems with tuning it right. It’s difficult to make a formula that actually solves the issue of overpopulation but at the same time offers no room for exploitation. On some of those it was next to necessary to multibox with afk alts to be efficient.
---
The number one contender is having respawns screw you over, though. Sometimes you take on challenging quests. Higher level mobs. Dense caves. Places where it is easy to pull multiple mobs accidentally. Places where you retreat. Dynamic respawns can be like adding a set of super stealthed mobs into those areas that are waiting for the perfect moment to ambush you.
---
It can just be *too* much. And dying to dynamic respawns can feel super awful and unfair. You are kiting, one dynamic respawns unstealths of you. You use your panic abilities. Only to see that your entire escape route has respawned two minutes after you cleared the path.
---
As I said, those are only the tip of the ice berg. And at each stage of your level and the server’s level distribution, those issues show themselves differently. Mathematically this is a multivariate problem and very difficult to “solve”.
---
if you are soloing, unless its an elite, you should be fine with your other ele spells. just dont pull too much. you can even kill lvl 58-60 elites with better raid gear but it takes a long time. you basically end up setting down your dps totems and healing yourself while it dies
---
Pricing will definitely fluctuate based on server economy. Super geared guilds will let people have a pay up option to reserve all class/specific armor drops depending on who's already paid.
---
Never necessary. Only makes it easier. Vanilla is easy. You can also just go 0/0/0
---
Remember that Layering = Phasing; that’s localized to the people in your friends list and guild.
---
It’s as easy to change as a group invite - people WILL be doing it all the time, and will appear/disappear right before your eyes; all while standing in the same place.
---
i would like to play dps for pvp!
---
I was reading a book called The WoW Diary which is about the entire Dev process of "vanilla wow." 
---
One of the biggest design debates they experienced was whether they should instance dungeons. Because on one hand, it does give them control over the experience the player has, but a lot of the devs absolutely hated the idea. Immersion comes from a world's consistency and independence from an observer. The more a world feels like decisions were made to make a "player's" time more fun, the it takes a huge hit to that vibe and feeling.
---
Blizzard has been a company based on compromised integrity for a decade now. This doesn't surprise me. But if they wanted to win my heart back a little bit, they would let their world be "unfun" for 2 days to be faithful to the philosophies of why we're coming back.
---
i will keep this on mind !
---
Had similar when I stayed up.  Was actually starting to see stuff in the corners of my eyes, shadows looked crawling on walls around me.  It's really fucked up stuff and you don't want to do it.
---
If you're interested, there was a radio DJ in the 50's that stayed up for 200 hours for a charity and ended up going insane.

---
I remember seeing this in a documentary a long time ago.  But there was crazy stuff where they tested his brain waves, as far as they tested he was "sleeping" but was 100% coherent and alert talking to them.  Pretty much the dude went into a living dream state and went insane.
---
I figured 5 mages would be better at multibox. Just spam AE and offset frostnovas for easy AOE farming.
---
I am one of the diehard old WoW fans. I was a complete lurker until i heard about sharding/layering making it into the game. At first i figured i'd be able to chill and let Blizzard handle this, surely they know that we really just want Vanilla by now...and if something went wrong, #NOCHANGES would get it right again. But nope. 
---
Ofc something had to threaten even that old game, and it had to be Blizzard themselves with their new sharding/CRZ modern mentality that runs retail WoW, that now seems to get supported by those same type of players who don't know why the old game became so beloved to this day, 15 years later. 
---
There's still time to get it rolling on the right tracks again, but it's running out.. i'm just glad to see people start listening at least to this gem of a Vanilla WoW designer, Kevin Jordan, by now, even if we've been saying a lot of the same things so far. Let's see whats gonna happen.
---
Yeah when I was 12, 13 years old and on summer break I sometimes was able to do stuff like that. If I tried to today my fiance would be bitching about trash not being taken out, dirty dishes, etc. And hell, I used all my vacation time when I went to Alaska.
---
I'll still most likely hit 60 before most and there will be a serious shortage of healers and tanks to group with as other people hit 60. The lack of cross server anything means people are not realizing how difficult groups will be to find for awhile with the exception of those who level a tank or have a friend who is a tank. There isn't a good reason to really rush it.
---
It’s a video game bro.... there will be things you disagree with... maybe you should get a degree in computer sciences and go work for blizzard... then you can make big dick decisions about a games economy... that most people don’t give a shit about...
---
Dat true Vanilla feeling! In Vanilla I had to stealth my way to the computer at night in order not to avoid my dad raging. 15 years later, I’ll have to use stealth not to wake my gf!
---
OK. That gets an upvote. :D
---
You don't need to be tank spec until maybe 50ish.  Everything less you can just roll pvp spec and should be fine in dungeons.
---
I was in the "hardcore use my vacation time" camp until recently. Realized that it would kill the game for me, and I'm way too old to go without sleep. Instead, I'm going to Vegas the weekend before, then leveling with my buddies 4-5 hours/night. It'll take a month or so, but that's nbd when we're all having fun.
---
Nope!  Played the same warrior from the end of Vanilla till the end of Cataclysm.  Warrior for life!
---
Also, I may or may not be a severe masochist.  The rend grind hurts so goooood
---
Ngl you had me in the first half
---
Yeah, the exploration XP is pretty good just for the first level or two.  My thing with being a Horde in Kalimdor is that you have to get the Barrens FPs for Camp T, Xroads, Ratchet anyway and either TB or Org, so you might as well get them out of the way early.  There are barely any mobs along the road in Barrens so you don't die too easily.
---
Valley of Trials is one of the worst starting zones.  It's so compact and the only place to really grind alone is in the back corner near the shaman totem quest trail, but there will still be people packed in to that area on launch day too.  Undead will be packed and there are only a handful of mobs that spawn on cliffs that no one climbs to grind.  Tauren will be the least packed, but they have the worst starting zone hands down.  It's so large to run through. Though, I have a pretty good idea of what mobs won't be on farm there due to them being out of the way or whatever.
---
Humans can kill a couple leftover wolves in the woods, Dwarves/Gnomes can kill some extra boars and troggs, and Night Elves have a good area for farming cause not all of the starting zone is used.
---
Warlock definitely has an advantage, but I can't imagine dying to just instants. If you're using auto+searing for pushback, earth shock whenever they try and cast+refreshing lightning shield you'll be competitive on hp unless you completely fail to get any healing off which is unlikely with grounding to cover a quick heal, warstomp if you're tauren (+you can get a fire nova in the warstomp if you have the mana) and NS.
---
You need shadow reflector and luck to have any chance when it's played properly though.

**Benevolent Elephants**. US, Alliance, PvP Server, PST based Semi-Hardcore Casual Guild.
---
Our Plan:
---
* To raid in a Semi-Hardcore Casual way. What does that mean? Casual number of raid nights and length of raids. But hardcore when inside the raid. Progression is the number one goal.
---
* To build a quality team of like-minded gamers interested in everything Classic WoW.
---
* Progression Raiding, 5 mans, and some optional PvP.
---
* We plan to clear every raid in Classic, including Naxx long term. Given the mixed style of casual and hardcore, we don’t plan on being world/server first, and that is ok!
---
About Us:
---
* Goal-driven mature gamers. 
---
* We love gaming and enjoy accomplishing our goals with friends.
---
* Many of us play nightly while others play casually.
---
* We understand real life/gaming balance and work with all our members to ensure everyone has a place.
---
* We are parents, workers, family members, and of course, gamers.

* Experienced leadership with successful raid experience from vanilla, to current high end Mythic raiding.​
---
Who we want:
---
* Mature gamers driven by a passion to succeed.
---
* Gamers who want to clear content in a timely manner in a non-toxic environment alongside other laid-back adult gamers.

---
* Members who understand real life constraints, yet still desire to clear content.
---
* Members who respect and appreciate other people’s time by being Punctual, Prepared, and Motivated.
---
* Casual Members/PvPers/Non-A team raiders are always welcome. Likely to form a “B Team” more casual raid group.
---
Goals:
---
* Kill all the bosses, with a core group of “A Team” Raiders.
---
* Make new friends.
---
* Make LOTS of new memories and relive some past ones.
---
Secondary Goals:

* Build a successful pvp team during non-raid nights. (Optional)
---
* Build a “B team” raid group that is more casual once inside the raid(think little to no consumes required)
---

Yep, I hail from Burger land and I have no idea how many feet are in a mile, or ounces in a pound. I have to look that shit up all the time.
---
I read everywhere that warriors are super gear depending, so i should do more and more things to really get it worth it to pvp is this right ?
---
Except if they have several hundred black lotuses and control the Price on flasks on AH, they can make sure you can't afford flasks and thus wont be able to feed your tanks titans. Which will pretty much stop you from progression in raiding. If you never want to raid? Then no this is probably not a big problem.
---
No they did it for the force reactive disk and cloak of fire and oil of immolation, but they never did for those.
---
I really don’t get the hype about stress testing.
---
1 layer will be dominated by horde players another layer dominated by alliance. When you want to farm you will just get on on your factions layer and farm as if its a pve server. Same goes for leveling. Good luck questing in STV when you are an alliance on the horde layer.
---
Is it an insult to refer to a child as one?
---
As you get older, you will look back on your "pepehands" period and cringe.
---
Hey, thanks man!
---
&gt;Obviously 99% of the people won't be 60 at that time, but a handful of hardcore players will be. Now, those players have access to 5 times as many high level resources, specifically Black Lotus. Not only do they not have a lot of competition because they leveled so fast, they now also have many times more available resource per time invested than those that come a few weeks later.
---
So?
---
If we are playing wtih say 5x player pop, you will also see 5x the hardcore players farming ressources by themselves, and thus it evens out.
---
Considering a majority of the population never cleared a single 40 man raid boss, I don't really agree there.
---
56days....
---
The point of the new plague is to fight the Lich King, that is made clear in literally the first quests.
---
Killing living things is easy, the Forsaken dont need a new plague for that.
---
This reminds me of a 1940s Soviet experiment involving Nazi POWs.
---
https://www.rbth.com/arts/330133-what-was-russian-sleep-experiment
---
Accurate. This will be the case for many warriors lol. But, no pain no gain. Warriors who stick with it and get geared will be rewarded.
---
Weird... Almost like you're saying there's demand no layering. And if we just experimented with adding more servers... Oh my God... No layering? Oh shit, but dead servers eventually... And then maybe instead of calling the servers different names they were Warsong 1,2,3... And shared the character name database..
---
Holy shit whats happeningggGggghhelp
---
NA ALLIANCE PVP - looking for a raiding guild for a druid and paladin duo. Raid times have to be 9pm+ PST. Little bit of flex on raiding times. Not going to be super hardcore leveling at the start so dont expect me 60 till probably 2nd month.
---
I quit six months after launch.
---
Came back for Wrath and burned through the TBC/Wrath content before quitting again in 2009.
---
After playing some more action orientated games/MMOs, I am looking forward to the more *relaxed* style of play that WoW offers.  The recent stress test had me thinking *'Yeah, this is what I want now.'*
---
Great stuff
---
Yep, and that's the thing, if people think that "7pm raid start" means you can log on and dick around in the AH and take your time, they are mistaken.  Anytime I've seen raid invites, etc.  They would always said raid start X and invites at t-minus some time, usually.
---
All raids take some sort of prep time, whether it's traveling to the insatance.
---
I'd be surprised if that goes live, seems like a bug.  But yeah, another couple yards can't hurt =P
---
I have a tauren sham on pserver though, you get stunned ALL THE DAMN TIME because melee see you as an easy target.  
---
Bring out the 2h -&gt; cheap shot/kidney and unless you have insig you're going to die, 100%.  Even then it's hard, only hope is to kite the rogue away (not easy ofc) and try to get a 1h/shield, poison cleanse totem, warstomp and get some heals off somehow.  The rogue can easily pop evasion to negate basically all your weap damage too
---
lol anyone whos not terrible at money management
---
Wow.
---
I hope you are right!
---
That is not at all how it 'was', though. 
---
Also, don't forget the mechanics don't matter if you don't have the gear (e.g. shadowflame cloaks). 
---
The meta mechanics have cooldowns to slow down progression.   Unless those are changed, you are not going to be doing 30 minute BWL clears until you have downed Ony a couple of dozen times. 
---
Ony attunement, especially Horde side, is time consuming on its own. 
---
Thinking you will be clearing the raids trivally right away is just fooling yourself, in my opinion. 
---
How many hours are you willing to spend farming the Burning Steeps for consumables every week? Do you consider that raiding time? That alone is hours per week. 
---
No life MC raiders were a thing because it was a full time job, outside of raiding, just getting consumables ready. 
---
That was the love/hate of the game and why it ended relationships. 
---
That is how it was. Maybe it will be different this time.
---
Sounds like a lot more work than just keeping layering and letting it do its job.
---
So you will get invited by a group, while on internal cd. What happens is, you wont see your group members even if you are right next to each other. What a rpg experience. I wonder, how blizzard wants to solve this problem
---
&gt;THAT IS EVERY SINGLE DAY WITH LAYERING
---
No, it isn't. Before, I had the *chance* of bumping into that guy. He can still be in my general chat. Someone I play with may invite him to our group. He is still going to have auctions that I can bid on and may buy my stuff. He can still join my guild. With the OP ""solution"" all of the above is literally impossible because it's the exact same thing as having multiple separate servers that merge eventually.
---
How do *you* not understand this?
---
This right here
---
Mage applied
---
For a single MC/BWL back to back run. I saw that as the ask in trade chat from about 2 or 3 naxx level guilds. No idea what they actually "sold" said runs for.
---
I’m just interested in helping blizzard out with this game I love, tbh. They want us to stress their servers, so I shall :O
---
&gt; Most actual progression guilds on Classic will be made up of people with years and years of WoW raiding experience.
---
I mean, you could say similar things about vanilla WoW with most top players coming from DAoC/Everquest/etc. Experience always helps.
---
&gt; Vanilla raiding is much more about time and effort than individual skill, compared to retail raiding. I'm not trying to knock it, it's just the way it is. Blizz got better at class design and boss design, as you'd expect.
---
I think coordination is #1 above all. People still underestimate how difficult it is to coordinate 40 people and get them all working together multiple times a week. 
---
Is the content easier assuming all 40 people are all doing their jobs perfectly? Sure. But good fuckin luck getting that.
---
Back then that might have been true. Classic isnt hard, never was, never will be. With people today having way more information available, everything is easy.
---
Had to save this for when it come out! thx
---
Well yeah lots of people dislike layering but blizzard is dead set against server merges sooooo that's not really an option
---
Well, a quest reward item would be bound to you, so no other character can disenchant it regardless of skill. But your lv 5 bankchar can disenchant all the high level BoE greens you stumble upon no problem.
---
The "essentially no benefit" only accounts for random opportunities, like when someone is looking for a common enchant while you're logged on your bank char anyway.
---
I quit at the start of B4A after we downed heroic Ghuun. I have been subbed to wow for 14 years. I’m playing FF14 ShB right now.
---
It opens up other problems, i wonder why people arent talking about it
---
We need Omar to give a presentation on why layering exists. It seems most folks are hung up on #nochanges and not understanding how servers work. 
---
They aren’t adding layering to attack the game we love, they’re adding it to make it playable.
---
Commence downvotes for truth.
---
I agree, however I would say the crit for Regrowth being so high let's you assume it will almost always crit. I would say you might want to average it's healing between it's normal amount and it's crit amount, as a lot of druids will be considering the crit potential before casting (crit Regrowth can be more mana efficient than Healing Touch)

---
Can downranking help with mana efficiency or does that hurt DPS too much?
---
After scrolling through this post, it clearly states that we either won't see enough healers OR
---
people rolling a healer don't comment in this thread.
---
4,889,007 seconds and counting
---
Dota Underlords is pretty fun, if your into strategy, rng simulators lol.  Only game I’ve been able to play in a while and not think “this sucks, I just want to play classic.”
---
An engineer priest could hold their ground in pvp gear. But the enemy could disengage at any time. Usually the initiator has the advantage vs. a holy/disc priest, though.
---
A druid will likely not be bothered by ganks and can escape almost at will. They also tend to stay in more hybrid specs.
---
All holy Paladins can do is `/clap` and run/hearth. Hope they can stall long enough and someone will save them.
---
A good Shaman will fuck you up. But there are almost no good Shamans.
---
Engineering and having emergency potions (lips, faps) goes a *long* way and is easily the thing that tips the scales. And I am just assuming you use gear sets to optimize for those situations.
---
1v2 is rip but the Shaman might take one with him and the druid might escape.
---
This is every... Single... Fucking... Day....with layering... Hello?
---
Spoilers dude, this will make the starting areas HARDER to level in. Let me explain: In a layered server you will always be in a COMPLETELY FULL RELM because a new layer is not made until the old one is full. What does this mean? The starting areas will have THOUSANDS of players in them. You will be hard locked to the max amount of people that can be on the continent. Everyone will be a noob in the starting zone so we are talking huge starting zone layers. You are deluded if you think this is similar to sharding where each player gets their own little instance with 100 people in it. 
---
&gt;Let's get realistic for a second and realize that your fantasy land of the perfect WoW Classic just isn't possible and this is the best solution we have. 
---
It's a step away from perfection, layering is the main issue at the moment. Besides that, they have been very true to Classic.
---
"once you build fat cells they stay forever"? That is surprising.
---
I'm in agreement, I'd rather there wasn't layering, but servers are going to be a shit show at launch.
---
I need to look up, but I wonder how many people were logging on WoW vanilla release.  The numbers are going to be insanely low compared to what they'd expect people to log in today.
---
People also need to realize that layering is dynamic, they increase layers when populations are high.  So people won't be able to 24/7 farm 10+ layers.  It's likely going to have a high layer count during peak hours on the first few weeks, and then it's going to die down.
---
What about 2 months?
---
The hard part is finding 40 competent people and getting them coordinated multiple times every week.
---
I quit wow because it feels like it's designed by a marketing team and nothing I do makes any difference.
---
I'm coming back for classic if for no other reason than to show support for the idea that games should be designed to be fun adventures and not metrics.
---
uHH....so what if it's lasted for 12 months... asking for a friend
---
I’ll take your word for it. Looks like you’ve done a lot of that yourself. Im sure your life is very cringey LUL
---
Thing about Alliance Warlocks is that they gain the benefit of having access to their #1 best partner for PvP - Paladin. Lock/Paladin is stronger than any horde Lock combos, and is insane in organized PvP.
---
Why do you care though?
---
ModUI🤓
---
He's replying to a literal "actuslly guy" and your other comments I replied to are you being the "actuslly guy" in this thread get some fuckin self awareness dude Holy shit

**&lt;Celestial Born&gt;** \[NA - PvE - A\] is a two night raiding guild recruiting for WoW Classic. Semi-hardcore schedule with hardcore performance expectations and organization: [http://celestialborn.com/](http://celestialborn.com/)
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
*If you...*
---
\-want to experience MC/Ony during Classic Phase 1 (no DM)
---
\-are T3 BiS minded
---
\-seek a work/play balance
---
\-appreciate the idea that every minute of every raid is worth optimizing
---
\-think organized vacation rotation is a wonderful idea
---
\-hope to play with driven, mature, and friendly adults
---
If the above matches your Classic goals, w**e may be the perfect fit for you.**
---
*About Us:*
---
As Celestial Born grows we find ourselves home to many outstanding players with high-end experience from Vanilla, private servers, retail, and every expansion in between. We’ve played many MMO's at all levels of dedication and leadership and look forward to returning to the MMO that has defined our gaming experience. We seek to be driven and friendly, and aim to take advantage of an early-recruitment cycle for Classic to bring like-minded players together who will establish a thriving, competitive, and healthy guild culture.
---
*Purpose:*
---
Celestial Born is being built on the foundation of striking a balance between real life time constraints and completing Vanilla raid experience at a competitive level. Our end game is to achieve guild-wide T3 BiS and establish ourselves as a top guild on our server. In light of this, and out of respect for our playtime, we will run the guild in a serious and highly organized manner.
---
Our initial goal will be to experience MC/Ony in Phase 1 as originally intended. In order to achieve this, we will requiring an average of 34 hours played per week for the first 8-10 weeks to level and prepare for our first raid. Please refer to the Charter at [**https://celestialborn.com/charter/**](https://celestialborn.com/charter/) for the math behind this. We will not require this rate of play beyond the leveling experience so long as raid member expectations are met and we can continue to meet our raiding goals.
---
Our goals are intensive, but we are not necessarily intense or strict in nature. We plan to keep the adventurous and fun spirit of Classic alive in everything we do.
---
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
---
*Raid Schedule:*
---
Tuesdays: 6:00 –10:00 pm. (PST)
---
Wednesdays: 6:00 – 10:00 p.m. (PST)
---
We will eliminate Wednesdays as much as possible, especially during the first few phases. In accordance with our aim to establish a long-term work/play balance we will be implementing an optional rotating raid attendance schedule. With a little bit of planning and personal responsibility this system will allow all of us to take breaks without guilt, eliminate a standby bench, stave off burn out, and provide a degree of roster protection.
---
*Loot:*
---
Pre-designated loot council. All loot for each tier will be planned for prior to the release of each tier with full roster participation in distribution: [https://celestialborn.com/loot/](https://celestialborn.com/loot/)
---
*Recruitment/Open Positions:*
---
We are still recruiting for many positions. Please see our application page for more details: [https://celestialborn.com/apply/](https://celestialborn.com/apply/)
---
Please note that if you resonate with us but are unable to commit to our raid program, we may be open to recruiting you as a non-core member. Such positions remain selective, are held to all of our member expectations, and are not precluded from raiding.
---
If you are interested in becoming a part of what we’re building, please refer to our website at [**http://celestialborn.com/**](http://celestialborn.com/) and read over our Charter. The Charter will answer many questions that are beyond the scope of this post.
---
For any additional questions prior to or after applying, please add FAYRE#0120 on Discord.
---
Thanks for reading. May you find your perfect guild!
---
Rogue solo is not for the casual player... unless you like spending time dead
---
I'm using ModUI. It has different color schemes depending on your class.
---
maybe hes not on public WiFi mom..
---
Started the day when Maraudon was released, played casually till AQ war effort started. PvP only and alts leveling. Then become a hc raider till mid WotLK. Sensed the coming of  catering to the casual masses and couldn't get back to the game enjoying it for longer than a tier or even less each expansion. Then played Legion cuz the lore, made a lot of alts just for artifacts etc. Despite all its flaws and not being a hc /mythic raider anymore I enjoyed till Antorus. Played BfA for 2  or 3 months. Picked it up now only to discover the lore and do some epic bgs.
---
Game is too easy, heavily devalues time invested with every patch unless u are a mythic raider. There is no social interaction between players.
---
Sure, sure, I get that! I just remember that the first stress test had huge latency problems etc etc, and people were crying about not being able to quest. They were literally doing what they were supposed to, stressing the servers. The devs even put in bosses to kill everyone and stress the servers even more. 
---
Some people, unlike you, understand stress tests as beta tests lol.
---
This
---
Player interaction is what made Classic, Classic
---
Forming bonds of love or hate when you encounter players with the same name; at the beginning, middle, and end of the game
---
A bunch of standalone servers is **not** better than layering or we’d be going with that route. It’s laughably worse on every front.
---
I used to do that with porn back in 1998.  Had to go plug the modem into the phone line.  The box was in my dad's bedroom.
---
My favorite Hunter iteration was WOTLK - you have great utility plus amazing burst. If Vanilla Hunter had Chimera Shot it would be a nobrainer for me too :P
---
And yet somehow every time people mention getting rag week 1 or something people say shite like
---
&gt;BuT tHe LeVLIN rEC0RD Is 4DaYS 20hOURS
---
You really don't need a tank spec for anything short of raid content.
---
You can tank things like UBRS just fine with a DPS spec &amp; blue tank gear.
---
I'm hoping I'm level 15 by 12am Eastern US time (launch is at 6pm here) so I can do that while everyone is sleeping the first day.
---
It's more of not realizing they've been grinding the whole time and got to Blasted Lands.
---
STVietnam
---
Loot and vendor everything.  Skin and vendor hides.  Yes, vendor them.  You aren't gonna be making any profit on the AH in the first few days of a fresh server, who has the gold to buy your stuff?  Vendors, and they'll buy it all, and you don't have to waste time posting it, waiting for gold to get mailed to you, no AH cut...
---
Having 100 gold at 40 isn't hard, we've only been practicing for this moment for 15 years.
---
Love getting downvoted for the truth. I know it hurts guys. Go whatever spec you want for zg but not 40mans. If you claim to take raiding seriously, the thought of bringing a moonkin should never cross your mind
---
Ok you do you we do us? None is saying this is way everyone should play
---
Hobss? 
---
You mean Hobbs?
---
The whole point is  to level together. Not get carried by the guy who plays more.
---
Out of curiosity how old is this laptop? Since classic will be using the old textures from 2004 and was capable of being run on a windows 98 operating system I'm sure unless your laptop is a brick from 2000 it should run the game in spades. My old high school lenovo core 2 duo that runs at 1.2 ghz with 3.5gb of ram (32bit windows xp limitation) running its graphics off the cpu was able to play wow on low-medium settings in 2006. I'm sure if your laptop even if its a $120-250 super low end made after 2010 could run the game easily.
---
im going to try a mage maybe since i dont really like playing tank , very thanks for the replies!
---
&gt;5-8 isn't gonna work in classic if they don't fix the extendo range on melee from moving.
---
??? how is that going to be any different from real vanilla where leeway was also in the game
---
Is your opinion based on you progression raiding the content in the past, or your expectations going forward?
---
Essentially, yeah. BfA felt like "Legion but without the shit that made it good." And it stepped down in a way that made all the content feel meaningless.
---
WoD had virtually no content, but I and my friends were desperate to find and do what content it *did* have. In BfA, it has so much content that I just have zero desire to do. So I'm definitely in the camp that BfA is the worst WoW has ever been.
---
This breaks economy, you don't understand the purpose of paying over merging if you think this is a good idea.
---
Haha aye got to excited.. haha
---
One of them has to pull, which can be a death early. Also if one of them dies it's super annoying getting the set up again since you have no res. In a perfect world 5 Mages is really good, but again when looking at speed/efficiency I believe 5 Shamans/5 Paladins would be the easiest since they have shield/res/heals and good enough cleave.
---
He slept like 4-5 hours I believe on the journey one.
---
Same, funnily enough I too swapped my vacation to play the game to spending a week in Orlando/Disney.
---
I've gone back each expansion but typically leave after the first raid cause it didn't seem as involved as more of chores.  BfA i just left after getting 120.
---
The idea is to no life at launch so you are ahead of the pack
---
I feel the same way, but we're probably not as good as that guy.
---
I just lose focus too easily, and I oversleep when I say I want to take a 6 hour break it always turns into 8-10, then having to get back into the groove of grinding.
---
Imagine rerolling from the best class to the worst class.
---
This lol

# NA Horde &lt;Brutality&gt; PVP Server Hardcore Raiding Guild Seeking Members
---
Hey everyone, We are in the early stages of putting together a guild community (on a Horde PVP server) so that come launch time we will have a good solid number of people to group up with, run dungeons very soon, raid with.   **We will be a Raiding focused guild** with a welcoming home for PVPers.
---
As the GM (im 33 years old, Wife and kids) *I have extensive experience in end game vanilla content (9/15 Naxx before BC) as well as years and years of expansion raid experience, Raid Leading Experience, and Guild Management.* Our goal is to build a community of people seeking **fun times**, **phat loots**, and **raid dungeon clears**. We will be building the guild from the ground up*, Guild tabard, exact raid times (Tues, Thurs and Weekends), raid leaders, officers and class leaders will be things we will all be able to decide on together*. 
---
 **I am looking for dedicated and willing to learn people. Experience is not required**. If you have never been in classic, thats ok, I'll teach you. *I will do anything in my power to make you as successful at raiding as i possibly can, I only ask that you meet me halfway.*  
---
***I will not require anyone to play a certain class or spec, if you want to play an enhancement shaman or a feral druid, the by god lets make you the best fucking enhancement shaman or feral druid on the server.*****I want to go to the top boys! Will you come with me?**
---
 Feel free to msg me on Bnet or Discord or directly on here if this is something that interests you and we can go from there!
---
Blizz Tag: Rock501#1114   
---
Discord Tag: Xeoh#3605
---
Far too excited ...
---
If you don't, feel free to not.
---
Sometimes a couple of items that none needed was "on sale" so you could come join the raid and get boosted and if it dropped you paid massively, but that's about it.
---
There are always going to be other problems, but this solves the biggest problems.
---
This is correct. There is not “disc” school. There is just holy and shadow for priest.
---
I was confused by this in the past myself. Because there are three talent specs but just two schools.
---
I feel the urge to get up and stretch after reading this.

---
Howdy Phenotyx, please add or message Tartaglia#9100. I was unable to get your discord information from your app.
---
TO BE FAIR private servers have a way higher population than the servers in real vanilla and in classic will have. Especially if layering is in when you reach STV, there is going to be way less people
---
Personally I would much rather do raids/dungeons as a healer but do literally everything else not as a healer, so given that farming gold to sustain respeccing on a healer sounds horrible - I'm leaning towards mage.
---
Would be great if people did that. Actually use the beta for its purposes. We’ll need the cap raised for people to come back to beta as it is very stale now.
---
why not mage on pvp D:
---
I never ever gave a damn about the factions. Fancion loyalty is non existent to me.
---
That’s strange - I remember pretty vividly that you could not buy your own listings from a different character on the same account. I always had to have a friend do it I think but maybe I’m wrong
---
Same. Shitty move IMO to require a sub to stress test. Insane, really.
---
This is a great idea, and they can also do something like lock your **account** to a layer for 30 minutes after log off to prevent layer switching whether it to be farm a resource node or escape a PvP griefer.
---
Should be perfectly fine for most Shamans in the raid.
---
Almost..!  Restro druid was amazing in pvp.  Healing on the fly super underrated.
---
With a local release of 6pm for me, I'm just going to tie things up to keep my sleep schedule not so out of whack.  Having 6pm start means I need to crew myself in a way the day of, probably stay up late the night before, sleep in as much as I can. 
---
Start playing 6pm, going 8-12 hours puts me at 2-6am.  Not really unreasonable, go to bed and wake up 6-8 hours later at noon and pretty much be on a lazy/sleep in schedule I'd have on weekends anyway.
---
Before they made everything stupid, we had a DKP bonus award for being ready to go on time.
---
I CAN STOP ANYTIME I WANT MAN
---
What's wrong with human priests?
---
You don't have a friend who will grind when you're sleeping so he can carry you through when you wake up?
---
The primary time I remember was you bought an item and you came in for that boss. If it didn't drop you didn't pay and came back next week. If it did, you pay then they give you the item, then you leave. I remember this being quite a good scheme for them, although it sounds like a logistic nightmare to me imo.
---
They've said this again and again, you can't layer zones. Layering applies to the entire server. 
---
Layering is only going to be around for 2-3 weeks MAX. People need to chill out.
---
&gt; Forcing people to choose layer upon picking server and not allowing layer hopping.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Earmarking which servers will merge and doing traditional server merges.
---
&gt; Both of those result on one seemless world with no immersion issues and no layer farming 60 content, and also alleviate dead servers after tourists leaving
---
My wife logged on 10 minutes after me and Doomhammer Layer 1 is now full. So fuck us playing together, I guess?
---
A friend wants to play 2 days later. Nope, fuck that guy too, Doomhammer 1 is full.
---
Trolls have always been able to harness the arcane, [in many ways better than the Elves](https://www.wowhead.com/spell=89890/eerie-smolderthorn-idol), which are descended from Trolls in any case, they just called it different things and used it in different ways. The only reason the Kaldorei (ancestor of all Elves and former Trolls) exist and were able to contain the two major Troll empires is because of the now defunct Well of Eternity. And even with the Sunwell, the High Elves were losing the war against the Trolls and needed help from Arathor.
---
But when The Sundering came, the Elves and their cities got demolished while the Zandalari magic kept their kingdom intact. Today, their scholars are easily on the same level as the Kirin Tor and they have millennia of experience and teachings over them. All but the most primitive Troll tribes have some form of heavy magic wielders today. So it's not a big leap to say that over thousands of years, some of that ability became innate in the Darkspear Tribe as well.
---
The only thing that doesn't really make sense is how identical mages are across the races, but that's an obvious game design choice. It's also pretty easily explained by powerful troll magic users witnessing spells during battles, learning them, and then adding that to their teachings.
---
Can people stop posting these Viagra posts. It's not funny anymore.
---
Gnome mage LF semi hardcore Alliance guild on PvP server
---
I want to raid at least 3 nights a week as well as have a solid group for some PvP/wpvp (nothing to serious, probably no rank 14 push or anything)
---
I was a kid who played some vanilla but got very into wow throughout the years, was more of a PvPer (2200+ arena 2100+ rbg) but did some progression anytime I played
---
I'm a competent player willing to put in time outside of the raids to get finished anything that needs to be done
---
I don't know the classic *raids* super well, but I know the dungeons pretty well and have played a bit of private server since the classic hype set it
---
I plan to raid frost until right around AQ, then go fire
---
I'm 23 and looking to no life hard, also don't love the idea of LC as I'm a solo with no personal ties to anyone who would be on lootcouncil, I'd just prefer to bid on what I want . However, I'm not *completely* against LC and would be open to it if I were convinced it would be fair and in the best interest of the guild 
---
Side note - I plan to be eng / alch or tailoring at 60.
---
I quit shortly after TBC released, got to lvl 62 and that was it.
---
I was 17 about to be 18 and the Marine Corps recruiter got to me haha, spent 4 years in the Corps, Afghanistan twice, got out and been working in the Tx oil fields since.
---
I spend a lot of time away from home working, a lot of the time by myself, I’m excited for classic for the sense of community as after a 12+ hour shift (7days a week for weeks on end) the thought of logging in and getting to quest or dunge with new and some old friends will make life away from home more homey
---
The only reason I can think is economic reasons to lock down resources or corner some market like arcanite, dark iron, devilsaur, etc.
---
Other than that... I can't think of anything in particular especially with the pvp system not even being available in phase 1.  You're just as well pvping and ganking at level 40 in STVam as you are at 60.
---
I quit with wod. Garrisons, fucking up spriest, nixing snapshotting, endless progression mechanics....
---
I am excited to A) A through vanilla endgame again (especially phase 4). And B) play with my friends. 
---
Most of my buddies never really committed to WoW. While it’s easy to hop in and out of WoW, on live I raid mythics—or rather, if I’m not, I’m not having fun. Few of my rl, friends have experience or interest in putting in the time to raid at near that level (develop the skills and knowledge). But classic starts out super easy, classic teaches you the game over 200+ hours. Classic endgame forces you to linearly progress from sunken temple through naxx without skipping any instances. 
---
There is no reason, with time invested, someone can’t go from being a newbie on 8/26/19 to clearing naxx 2 years later. It’s a much different proposition to boot up retail on expansion launch day and participate in relevant mythic tier clears. 
---
Playing classic, you don’t miss any content, If you start late, odds are you’ll join up into a pve guild that’s a bit behind the curve, when the top dogs are on new, you guys are just getting organized to go into mc for the first time. On retail, you just permanently missed progression on that mythic tier—sorry.
---
Not for everyone. For a lot of people, including myself, the goal is to get to 60 faster than people of our class levelling solo. Dungeon grinding is not for everyone, so if that's not your cup of tea, then don't. If dungeon grinding only is your cup of tea, do that. My thread is built for those trying to minimize the time taken to level overall, for instance if you want to get your guild to 60 so you can start competing for Scarab Lord materials or Thorium, or get geared for raiding or whatever faster.
---
played on release day in Nov. 2004.  Played through middle of WotLK religiously then started to slow down a bit (kids).  
---
Came back very briefly to explore Cata.
---
Came back very briefly to explore MoP, really enjoyed the underwater zones, but the game was starting to feel like a different game from the one i loved. 
---
Didn't like the focus on AE pulls.  Game became a face-roll experience.  No skill needed.  No communication needed.  Have not been back since.  
---
Nost drama and cease and desist letter caught my attention back when that was going on.  When they shut down the server, i signed the petition.  
---
Recently re-subbed just to get on the 48 hour beta a few weeks ago.
---
Will play Classic religiously and would love to see BC/WotLK servers eventually.
---
Played very briefly on ND (maybe to level 40).  Quit Pservers altogether when Classic was announced, but if it wasn't announced, i'd have been pretty all in on ND.
---
Classic is using retail wow's macro system.
---
You could have two characters. Perhaps your first as an alliance to revisit the nostalgia initially, and then later down the road you could start a horde character on a different server for that new experience.
---
I’ve always been an undead warlock, and will stick down that path since I hit 60 a few days before TBC came out and would like to get the experience I missed out on.
---
Quit in 2015 when Moltdown happened (lost a character of 4 years) in cata.
---
Gonna be exciting to finally play legit.
---
That's a problem with current layering too. At least with this system, each layer can "feel" like a server, so it's not as big of an issue if it takes longer for them to get merged.
---
With current layering, it needs to be gone ASAP.
---
I'm in the city of Love right now, at the airport, waiting for my connecting flight home. Playing horde on the beta otherwise I'd log on to say hi. :P
---
Naw man. Sounds like a good time tho.
---
Nothing has made me less excited for classic than layering.
---
Maybe this is why people are so anti-layering.  They don't even know what it's doing.
---
You’re right, I didn’t see that line, apologies. I would still prefer Druid because of travel form and feline swiftness for faster cat form.
---
I was talking generally, don't take it personally. I never do personal on Reddit, it so often result in flame wars, which I'm not interested in. If you are interested in levelling fast through dungeons, and I've missed something in my OP, then you can talk about that maybe? I'm very not fond of having to defend WHY I'm talking about something rather than talking about it.
---
Well, orcs and trolls do not have Orgrimmar in Classic so that seems unlikely.
---
You seem pretty reasonable so I'm going to try to convince you.
---
Pros of layering:
---
1.  Cuts down on overcrowding for easier leveling.
---
2.  Easy to manage for Blizzard.
---
3.  Cuts down on queues since they could theoretically fill a server indefinitely.
---
4.  Likely reduced need for server merges.
---
Cons of layering:
---
1.  Reduces immersion by having people appear and disappear.
---
2. Reduces immersion by adding a non-world aspect of the game that is distracting to players.
---
3.  Ruins immersion by destroying cohesion (you will not run into the same people again)
---
4.  Unknown total size of server... What is Blizzards goal for server size pre-layer?
---
5.  Unknown ramifications of large AH pool on economy (You have 10k+ people sharing AH possibly).
---
6. Immersion hurt by seeing 4× the amount of rare items on AH.
---
7. Possible abuse in combat.
---
8. Possible abuse for economic gain.
---
9.  This one is IMO perhaps the most important.  Lack of cohesive player body makes it less likely to form relationships, both friendships and rivalries.  Forming friendships and rivalries by chance encounters is one of the most memorable parts of WoW, but also quite rare.  With layering it's almost impossible to do.  Imagine some of your own run-ins with players that allowed you to form rivalries/friendships.  Now imagine there were 3 layers so 2/3 of those chance run-ins never happened.  Would you still have formed the same relationship?  Not likely.  **With layers, everyone you meet is just another rando, since you will likely never see them again, because the odds you're on at the same time+place are slim, but same time+place+layer are nil**
---
10.  If Blizzard underestimates the player decline, they will still have to do server merges.*with name changes*.
---
11.  If Blizzard overestimates player decline **you're stuck with layering**
---
12.  "Overcrowding" can force players to explore the world or do something else rather than follow a straight leveling path.
---
13. Less overcrowding means less world pvp.
---
14.  Some people enjoy the chaos of "overcrowding" for a variety of reasons.
---
15.  Streamlining leveling might not be a good thing and cause players to get bored.
---
Pros of server clusters (clusters of servers share name/guild name pools in case a merge is required):
---
1.  Clusters share same name pool to make merges easier.
---
2.  Can simply keep adding servers to clusters as pop increases.
---
3.  Lowered queues, since you can funnel nee players to new servers via server suggestion.
---
4.  No worry about having to estimate population decline.  If it declines, you have servers ready to merge.  If it doesn't, you can maintain server integrity.
---
5.  Maintains vanilla gameplay integrity
---
Cons:
---
1.  Servers likely will be merged at some point.
---
2.  There will likely be some server queues on high pop servers, especially thanks to stuff like streaming.
---
3.  Possible overcrowding on high pop servers.
---
Also @ his point about not being feasible to quest with 500 people in the same zone, thats the whole fucking point. I WANT it to be overcrowded and unable to quest.
---
If there are too many people to quest or kill mobs, then you dont quest or kill mobs!!! No one needs to have some individualized hand-held experience to make everything happy and cozy for every single player.
---
The whole point of an MMO is a persistent "2nd world" that you can trust. one that you can live in. one that you can build relationships and get to know people by running into them in the same locations time and time again. Like Kevin Jordan said about the integrity.. its no longer a 2nd world when you have layers. What you see in front of you HAS to be what you get for the magic to be there. 
---
No imaginary 2nd shards/layers/whatever. 
---
If there are too many people, tough shit, there are too many people!
---
“Classic comes out next month”
---
“More like two months tbh”
---
“REEEEEEEEE”
---
One streamer escaping a gank will ruin the game!  5 hour q times and not being able to find any mobs to kill is completely fine though.
---
Druid also gives you cat form with a movement speed increase by level 21, dash later in the 20s, travel form at 30, and the teleport to Moonglade can also be used for faster access to a moonwell for turning felcloth into mooncloth.
---
IMO, it's hard to beat druid for a lvl 35 tailor/bank alt.
---
maybe stop spamming every thread with the same words and just filter the threads then?
---
I hear leveling as fury is no longer best because the /sit crit exploit will be patched on official servers
---
I've been using it on a 1.12 pserver no problem.
---
and never confirmed &lt;.&lt;
---
&lt;Coup&gt; | NA |Alliance | PvE Server | Middlecore Raiding | Fri/Sat Evenings PST (exact days/times TBD)
---
&lt;Coup&gt; is a guild with almost 15 years of history, originally formed in vanilla on the Shadowsong-US server. Coup was a top raiding guild on the server during vanilla, scoring several server firsts across BWL and AQ40, including server first Nefarian. Since then we’ve stuck together through almost every expansion with a fairly consistent core of 15-20 members, and are looking to ramp our numbers up to have a healthy community in classic, as well as to support the 40 man raid scene.
---
I’m referring to Coup as “Middlecore” because we plan to raid, but won’t likely push hard on bleeding edge progression. We will always welcome a wide variety of players and playstyles. This ranges from people who always want to play at the top of their game, all the way through to those who want to take the scenic route through the game.
---
Due to the nature of 40 man raiding we will need some consistency in the raid roster, but we also place no pressure on our people when real life happens. If you need to take a sabbatical from raiding or the game in general, we may backfill your role, but the guild will still be here and you will still be a member when you get back. We’ve always treated this game as part of our hobby and not a job, and we’ve been able to maintain many of the same friends and guild members for over a decade as a result. We hope that in Classic we can maintain that M.O.
---
What we are looking for:
---
* We want to build a community first, and then our raiding team later. More than anything we want to find like-minded adults who want to enjoy the game with us.
---
* At some point (ideally around or before content Phase 2) we would like to get the point where we are able to consistently clear current content while it is current.
---
What are aren’t looking for:
---
* Toxicity, racism, bigotry, homophobia, or other generally awful behavior. During the Blizzcon opening ceremony Chris Metzen always used to end with a saying; “Be good to each other”… We intend to do just that, and invite people that will conduct themselves in a positive manner.
---
If you are interested in learning more, please reach out to me via DM here on Reddit, or via discord @ Evilmonstar#7541.
---
Thanks for reading, and we can’t wait to see you in Classic!
---
Wow sick bro and great dramatic setup creeping into the room like that.
---
You have an Nvidia card, so all G-Sync monitors are supported, but not all Free Sync monitors are supported and none of them support all the features of G-Sync. There's [an official list from Nvidia](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/products/g-sync-monitors/specs/) and unofficial reports of some monitors not on that list also working, usually found on places like /r/buildapcsales.
---
Wow, very convincing.
---
&gt; There's not going to be some kind of self correcting exodus in a few weeks so layering can be shut off, it's simply impossible.
---
Yeah, this is one of the biggest problems with Blizzards system. Even if layering was okay for a month (which it absolutely is not), Blizzard is relying on the population dying off. If more people stay around than they anticipate, they have a perfect excuse set up to keep layering forever.
---
Haha ree amirite it's 2016 hahaha
---
I see. Well, first pull is starting the instance iin my eyes. If you count from Lucifron, you basically killed half the trash already.
---
Everybody here.
---
Your comparison is terrible, please stop comparing the beta to classic. Classic is 2 months away and the beta is going to be shut off. It's dead and it should be dead. Blizzard has enough bugs to fix until launch. The beta created a unique social dynamic that will never be replicated again which means it was an AMAZING SUCCESS. The pursuit of bis at every threshold and doing quests / dungeons far above your level was a testament to the depth of the game. Don't act like the beta is going through an unplanned "death".
---
I took an oath sir, one I intend to uphold!
---
The guild &lt;Darkstorm&gt; on horde side of Al'Akir EU did carry/gold-runs to MC and BWL the last 6 months of vanilla. I believe the average price on T2 pieces was like 200-500g.
---
I created multiple orcs and trolls during the stress test, took the hidden path to Ratchet, and did not have the Orgrimmar flightpath available. Seems odd that some races would have their capital flightpath and others don’t, somebody should probably bug report it.
---
it was available on legion, so the port shouldnt be hard.
---
Wtf is with ppl on reddit and the word utter? Never hear/see that word anywhere else.
---
or refuted. Who know?
---
Nice
---
Desperately
---
&gt; Everyone's super worried about the economy of black lotuses and devilsaur leather like their lives depended on it. I just want to be able to kill 10 defias looters in an hour.
---
Yes, we know. Layering is there to cater to the selfish people like you.
---
There's a very real possibility layering is never shut off and they come up with some Frankenstein phasing/shares spawn world boss concoction.
---
Well Rag week 1 would require 40 nerds that have the drive and skill to speedrun on a world record pace. Not exactly likely. Week 2 now, it's pretty much a given though.
---
Or just have more servers.
---
My record is 26. Fuck I’m a causal.

These numbers are wildly speculative and it also makes the assumption that everyone farming layers for black lotus or other resources are working together.
---
The pie is gonna get eaten before you get your slice no matter what you do.
---
90 minutes on a 72 hour run, while devastating for a record push, is nothing against the average player who will take 10-20 days /played to 60.  They could get hung up for two hours 1-10, then still pull way ahead of the curve later on as the crowds thin out in later zones.
---
Their record run was ruined, but they'll still smash the average players time to 60.
---
you can’t assume it’s true until it’s refuted lmao, it’s the other way around
---
Well then what's your better solution?  Exactly.  I love people that nitpick really good solution and just say "well it's not perfect, what about this 1 case?".  Really helpful.
---
Moonkin stuffing some socks down there if you know what I mean.
---
If 1% of all players are "hardcore", then how do You think, which is bigger 1% of 20k or 1% of 4k?
---
I have swum all the way to Westfall shore and got some hight levels to clear the merlons etc. Tedious.
---
Yeah warriors are the most gear dependant class but... they are OK without good gear
---
This is scary to me. I've had an incredible hard time finding a Classic guild. I've used a bunch of different resources including the forums, Classic Recruitment Discord and a number of other sites and I still haven't found one that really fits my needs.  2-3 raid nights, competitive focused but casually hardcore, NA Horde.
---
There are so many people in this subreddit who genuinely think layering is the only possible solution. Really? You're telling me that 3 months ago (since layering didn't exist), there were literally 0 solutions? Come on guys, people have been suggesting significantly better solutions for over a year now.
---
Are you on the Beta or are you talking about Retail?
---
But a couple points: I'm not playing at 1440p and I'm maxing out everything, including using CVars to double the draw distance and spell effects.
---
I would say I maintain 144 FPS 90% of the time, but there are definitely scenarios where the lack of multi-threading support in Classic forces frame drops.
---
So many people here with wrong opinions
---
What stopped places like IF and org having these issues during actual vanilla? 
---
Are you telling me they are doing this purely to stop a lil bit of chop people may get entering a city with a few thousand people in it? Chop that was just ok for people in vanilla but not for classic?
---
So my point is clear, was it not like this around the boom of wow vanilla in these cities anyway and there was no layering then? Why would this be an issue now?
---
I would highly recommend playing a different class if you wanna be casual. As other people said, you can play anything casually if you want but, why play the class that takes the most work to get going casually? Your leveling experience will be really hard and, you won't get the joy of the pay out. Like other warriors will.
---
Mage is the silk slipper wearing class of classic wow. It's amazing for casuals because in frost. They have a whole usable kit right out of the box. They level well and are good at pretty much everything.
---
However if you like tanking. I would recommend a druid. For dungeons they are the best tank in the game. They may not be as good at raids but, if your going casual anyway. Who cares? They also level very well and, have a kit that does very well with only a little bit of gear. Would highly recommend over a warrior if you wanna tank casually. Also you can be an off tank in raids if you wanna raid later on.
---
So essentially a 6 core 8th gen i7 is gunna handle the game exceptionally well?
---
&gt; This is also not true. Blizzard has been testing aggressive layering strategies. They definitely do not wait until the Layer is "full" and can change what "full" means at any time.
---
Please link me to where they talk about this because in all their presentations and posts so far they have said a new layer won't be made until the continent is full.
---
&gt; There haven't been any queues on the beta or stress tests. And this is why they went with Layering instead of Sharding. 
---
There never has been, 1/1000th of the population is playing...wow I wonder why there are no queue times? It sounds to me like this is your first beta.  They did not go with sharding because everyone would lose their fucking shit. Rightly so. 
---
&gt;Layering allows whole realms within realms
---
Yes, that's why we don't want it. Just buy another server.
---
True, but it works for many. Personally I don't care.
---
Send help
---
Surprise surprise another completely ignorant layering solution.  I'd take the "is xyz viable?" posts over these.
---
I paid for it and i hadn't been a subscriber since some time in 2016.  
---
I paid for it because;
---
1)  I'm REALLY looking forward to classic; and 
---
2)  I could not help but be extremely curious to see how Vanilla would play on a real Bliz server compared to Pserver.
---
The Blizz server was MUCH better.  lol.  I was up until basically 4:30 AM both nights of the 48 hour stress test which is a very, very bad omen for where my life is heading on August 26th.
---
Not very relevant. It may prevent resource exploitation, but the immersion and community is still completely ruined.
---
You really think Hunters are that bad in STV? I figured with tracking, flares, traps, and your pet helping you, you would do alright.
---
Are you just dumb or is blizzard paying you?
---
Maybe they are..maybe they aren't. Could be a hot spot through the cell phone. Could be in an executive club using their wifi.
---
Either way it is an airport and I wouldn't do that.
---
Yes 100%, it wouldn't be classic if they did. Part of the fun of Classic is that it's not built around perfect balance. Also the big thing about Classic that people miss is that you usually don't play a spec, you play the class. Even if you go holy you'll still take some talents from the other tree, a lot of the fun comes in being able to do hybrid builds.
---
The problem there may be that, I believe, the flight from Ratchet to Org actually passes through Crossroads, so you'd need that connecting oath first wouldn't you?
---
Can someone add a Feign Death + Shadowmeld macro?
---
And who gives a shit about you or your comments? Nobody.
---
Nice. Do you have a download link for this version of the add-on?
---
For one, mergers didn't even HAPPEN in vanilla, it was realm transfers. But aside from the name clash lottery which means you might have to rename YOUR character? Tons of new names, new players and thus new guilds appeared out of thin air, which meant aside from the server being mostly people you've never seen before and suddenly full of jackasses, people leave guilds for what they deem are the new "better guilds" and the old ones fall apart rather than staying as tight knit communities. 
---
They're doing layering to avoid this because they know it's a shitty retail solution. No amount of Reddit comments will change that.
---
I don't think I did take it personally. At no point did I attack you personally. 
---
You are purposely chosing a method of level that is slower, but with your friends, yet you want to leave them behind anyway? Just level solo. Nobody wins any races in a group. It could be slightly different on classic considering the group bonuses that are on the beta. You don't seem to have any information on that on this thread tho.
---
It’s my experience playing on a specific private server. And sure, you can say it was undertuned, but I’d say the opposite since the itemization was progressive.
---
I'm confused..... What is wrong with doing quests appropriate for your level (yellow quest)???? I'm not saying AoE grinding is bad, but mage is a very strong leveling class and if you're struggling with those quests appropriate to your level.... then like I said, you're doing something wrong.
---
Ha, thanks! From what they were saying layering probably won't be in the game for too long. Plus after a few weeks there is more information out there which server would be worth playing on.
---
I'm just gonna enjoy the rest of summer and start playing when it gets colder outside and cozy inside :).
---
Orrrrrrr, we could have vanilla experience without layering, that is in fact what has bring us here 15 years later... :D
---
Is wasnt so bad... as we all love vanilla experience, dont we?
---
I just have a 32" 1080 p monitor and it's already enough to over-load my senses.  
---
Hard to imagine i use to play the game on a square monitor made out of potato skins.
---
Yeah, I'm kinda hoping to get in most, if not all, of Silverpine and supplement heavily with the Barrens - can't pass up the Barrens altogether, but I never completed Silverpine back in the day. I'm completely willing to level through green quests and take my time to see content, *especially* because of the quest drought I remember from the later levels.

---
thoughts?
---
In bgs as an ally warlock you have pally healers and only priests dispel your dots
---
I’d and orc are better 1v1 but in bgs I think gnome warlocks have more freedom to control the fights
---
I didn’t bother doing the stress test, but if the servers really are much better (and they should be) I’m looking forwards to launch
---
in raids, yes downranking helps a lot. Early on especially it's a struggle, but you're not TOO punished when taking threat into account (early that is)  
---
Moonkin is really solid in pvp and 5mans. But for raiding it takes a lot of extra work to compete for middle of the pack, things like chugging constant mana pots and farming and using Demonic Runes as often as you can. You essentially exist to give mages a crit buff, and bringing battle res which is ALWAYS useful.  
---
It's not viable if you care about dps meters. But if your raid can't kill Garr because they have a moonkin, it's not a problem with the moonkin.

Lol, wanting to play the game at a basic level is selfish now?  Or is this sarcasm?

What's selfish is worrying about those people who are going to get 4x black lotuses instead of 1x.  Maybe don't worry about what other people are doing and try to enjoy the game?

There's confirmation about layering being 2-3 weeks max?

Sneak Sneak, Stab Stab?
---
I would much rather wait for a good game then get an instant shitty game.
---
I played a lot of vanilla and TBC, quit towards the end of TBC, just lost interest. I have played maybe a month or so every year when each expansion is close to its end just to go through and see how it's going. But legion nor bfa were able to grab me/make me want to try it. 
---
I'm not sure if I will really have the time to play classic like I used to, but I can't wait to try it out again. I might have convinced my wife to try it/play with me, so I am looking forward to that
---
I'm making a fem orc rogue, but i won't be hanging out in Durotar for long.  I usually make a B-line for Tirisfal as soon as i find myself wandering over towards Orgrimar.
---
&gt;What is better PvP talent point: 10% imp Inner Fire vs 5% imp PowerWord: Shield?
---
He did, in the post title.
---
So it's a layering ? I like the implementation and I believe it's superior to the current one on the Beta, but I believe you're missing your audience when you blow up people that defend the idea of layering.
---
I completely understand why people speed level. For me, leveling slowly and enjoying the experience of it is the best.
---
I create on Emerald 1, my friend joins tomorrow and Emerald 1 is full. Now what?
---
I can only wish you good luck with finding a guild that would take you as 30/0/21.
---
Yeah, but the entire point is that they're making it take as little time as possible, and you're talking about fanboys who don't care about their own leveling.  I have zero doubt someone like asmongold or sodapoppin could have a constant group of 40-80 followers helping them any time they play after Classic releases.
---
It doesn't have to be the same people, just anyone willing to lend a hand.
---
True but original LFR for dragon soul was still full mechanics just slightly less harmful and actually a challenge for groups. LFR now is just a cake walk now and the only way to die is by having a group of players intentionally not try.
---
They won't. There will be one, and 5 layers of people.
---
Hello,
---
Faction: Either Class:Priest
---
About me: I am looking to get back into MMOs, as vanilla was a huge part of my childhood. I was in high school when this was current. Fast forward 12-15 years, I am 30 with wife and baby….couldn’t be happier. I enjoy my games but nothing has hooked me like WoW did. Overall, I am nice guy looking for other nice players. 
---
Goal: I want to re-experience the magic we call Vanilla. I will be making a priest (low change of mage) and focus on PvE content. My goal is to be that one healer that everyone has on their list to call for help. I’d like to hop in a guild that are full of friendly faces, level with them, build relationships and then kill dragons with them late game.
---
What I am looking for: A guild that understands that I will be late to raids and doesn’t mind that I am not a core member. I will only be able to play on weekdays after 10 EST(usually) until 12EST.  In terms of gear, I pretty relaxed about gear considering I won’t be top priority . I get it J Dungeons, we can duke it out J. With that said, I work remote so I can float on and off of the game depending on my work load.
---
Experience: I was part of a guild that transferred to another server to open up AQ. Amazing experience. We ended up raiding into Naxx. I believe I hit rank 10 or 11 in PvP (doubt I will have that sort of time)
---
 an ud/gnome rogue in 1v1 with all His CDs up beat literally every class in the game. That's not really a fair comparison. 
---
I think people make the 25% of stun resists that work, a much bigger deal then the 100% of people who will try to kite all melee people.
---
Potentially ruining a great game for short term stability is not objectively good. Personally I would feel much safer if they were more transparant regarding their timeframe for layering. I don't mind having it there during launch - but what happens if server attrition is less severe than anticipated?
---
LOL So true. Unfortunately, without pocket-heals it'll be that way until you get to around level 55.

---
&gt; and try to enjoy the game
---
I'd like to, but unfortunately they are adding layering to the game.
---
Yeah, I don't do the whole RP thing, but I definitely dive deep into the story wherever possible. I do that with all my games. The last one was the Destiny universe.
---
Since the Classic announcement, I've re-read all the novels, all the chronicles, watched the shitty movie twice, watched all of Nobbel's videos, watched all the Blizzcon lore panels, and had way too many Wowpedia tabs open at once.
---
I've also played through all the Retail expansions and it turns out, I really like BFA, which I know is taboo here, but it's a really good game. It's just a very different game.
---
Last 3 expansions were garbage. I played all of them for 2 months max.
---
I loved classic. Will def be jumping on and taking a more casual approach, just reliving the nostalgia.  100% expecting streamers to ruin this game and the community and what made it fun, that along with sharding have pushed me off of any hardcore committal to Classic.
---
Streamers have ruined the balance of mmo's imo because now you have people who have legions of people dedicated to giving them advantages that are impossible to design around and keep balanced.
---
I remember leveling at least to level 14 or so with a lot of leather.  Years of D2A had me in the mindset that armor wasn't super important.
---
Last I new, the ability to create a focus wasn't available in beta. Bug reports have been submitted on it because, even though it wasn't called focus in vanilla, you could create a macro to do the same thing it just didn't give you the frame (addons could give the frame though in vanilla).
---
Sharding results in much worse immersion break with players and mobs randomly popping Ina and out. I personally think layering needs to be level locked so past level 20 or so all characters are on same single layer.

---
Yeah but you're missing the xroads FP in that scenario.
---
That's gonna be weird on a pvp server.
---
No way, someone who finally admits that layering is just done as the cheap solution! How about Blizzard do it the right way instead of the cheapest way?
---
That would not lead to a clusterfuck at all :P
---
yeah of course but I'm talking about record run only. they Don't give a fuck about beating the average Joe lol why do you even bring that up
---
lol im an idiot
---
If layering is dynamic and doesn't spin up additional layers without player saturation in that region of the world, this concern would float away on the wind.
---
Won't the other guys in the party get less xp if you're levels above them?
---
Of course it is. But that won't stop Blizzard.
---
They had login queues. They limited how many people could be in the game at any one point. The other big change is that we don't know what server populations will be. In Vanilla the cap was 2.5k, but in Classic it's looking like they will have a much higher population. 
---
This most certainly COULD happen in Vanilla even. In fact Swifty had a meetup in SW one day back in Vanilla and ended up shutting down the server, he even ended up with a ban because of it. So they definitely did not want this kind of stuff occurring and it was definitely possible.
---
The big thing is, will it actually happen? I doubt the population will ever hit that number in one area naturally, but it's still not something anyone can know for certain. Streamers and a number of other factors make this a big unknown and layering can guarantee there will never be an issue. Every other solution can't boast that, which makes layering the safest. This is why I think Blizzard is sticking with layering, because it's safe.
---
00:00-23:59
---
Stand-alone servers that you can hop between...
---
Blizzards own idea, before we had layering. Shard the starting zones, maybe even 10-20 if needed. Keep the rest of the game clean.
---
I still think you're drastically overestimating how much better the average player will be.
---
There will still be plenty of casuals, plenty of shitty guilds that can't clear a MC boss, and plenty of ret pallies wondering why they don't get 40 man raid invites.
---
Well, it's not slower, as shown in cleave guides on Youtube. It's slower than a hunter levelling solo in an empty server, sure. Way slower in fact. Is it going to matter at launch, with 100 people in every zone, and 500 people in barrens? There is a reason I'm talking about dungeon grinding, I recommend you check out a guide on Youtube like  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrJ56pzDExc&amp;lc=UgzJIv-vFBj2-m70fSt4AaABAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrJ56pzDExc&amp;lc=UgzJIv-vFBj2-m70fSt4AaABAg)  if you're interested.  
---
If not, best of luck to you.
---
That just sounds like choosing different servers
---
No, it isn't. Before, I had the *chance* of bumping into that guy. He can still be in my general chat. Someone I play with may invite him to our group. He is still going to have auctions that I can bid on and may buy my stuff. He can still join my guild. With the OP ""solution"" all of the above is literally IMPOSSIBLE, not improbable, because it's servers that cannot be jumped between.

---
Yeah dynamic respawn is a big one here.
---
There is a big difference between raiding mythics for a tier or two in a given expansion and being a member of the guilds who get in and push mythic raids prior to guides existing—those are the only people who have skill at a level comparable to high end pvpers, like your top 20-40 world guilds. 
---
Developing strats from nothing is as demanding as PvP. PvP is more dynamic in the variability any one “pull” can show you. But the iterative problem solving and holistic game knowledge needed to devise many last and penultimate boss encounters is as complex if not more. Equal amounts of class knowledge are needed, just in a different facet. Instead of mind games with three other people, you are accounting for and planning for the unique actions of 20 people, making sure they do disparate things in unison. 
---
Raiding quickly becomes a game of mechanical skill, and adjustments to previously written down strategies, with even the bottom half of your top 100 us guilds being rife with deadweight and not so spectacular players. 
---
But who knows, with the rise of streaming progression, unfortunately no one but the top 3-4 guilds in the world truly get to raid progression as blind as possible. That was the entire reason I tried as hard as I did, so I could go into bosses blind. Now, world #10 will feel compelled to watch method stream else guild #11 might learn something and beat them.

---
Link? I'm curious.
---
I quit at end of WOTLK and came back for legion and quit about midway through. Super excited for vanilla because I know the content well but I still have so much to learn.
---
I've been on that bandwagon since layering was a thing.
---
Based on what you last said, you fit right into classic i'd say.
---
Not when they tested aggressive layering. It was actually playable on test server 3, sometimes even lonely.
---
It’s four giants, some surgers, a couple of of dogs and an imp pack. Around 5 min.
---
Ok that makes sense. I've never played vanilla so I'm really excited to experience it in it's authentic state. You can't inspect talents so I guess it makes sense that people won't be able to notice your spec. That's actually kinda nice. I wouldn't want some asshole elitist whispering me I have the wrong talents.
---
Care to share the better alternatives?
---
Oh that’s something I can do. I can watch the shitty movie. I’ve never actually seen it before. Also I just read your username and realized I called you bro. Sorry about that, bad habit. I don’t see anything wrong with liking BFA. I personally only played for two months on a new account from scratch here on the Chinese client. The most exciting thing was getting Thunderfury. I guess I’m just destined to go back to Classic Azeroth.
---
People seriously suggesting that classic is closer to retail than vanilla need to get a grip.
---
The slow is not the main annoyance for a mage. Enhancement is a free kill for a mage unless you randomly get one shot and an elemental shaman doesn’t need to slow you because he is in range of you pretty much at all times and he is very damn bursty as well. 
---
Earth shock is the caster killer. It’s an interrupt on a 6 second CD so you will not be casting much as a mage. Grounding totem is also super annoying as a caster.
---
Yeah I played on a server that was pretty mellow for a while, then they merged them...
---
Interesting, what is your source for this? As far as I know, all that matters is what level you are. Not saying you're wrong, but I'd really like to find out.
---
If you’ve done pserver launches then you’d know “unplayable for 2+ weeks” is beyond an exaggeration, it’s a straight up lie. I’ve actually been there for those launches, and I’ve been in the pserver community for a while. If a server was “unplayable” (look up the definition of that one, btw) for even a week, it would be dead and forgotten.
---
I hope you’re getting paid well.
---
If you've been in the private server scene for awhile this simply isn't true. Servers always die once Naxx is generally out.
---
I'm 99% sure I'm rolling Shaman....................... 98% sure
---
I was joking, I have no girlfriend
---
I never saw any of that in Vanilla. With only 1 ID per Week and loot being that limited there is not much reason to do that.

Yeah I mean if the lock is bad and doesn’t kite while throwing up dots maybe that searing totem will be relevant, but CoT + dots + totem stomping usually makes it gg. The issue with warlocks for shams is not only their tool kit is great against shamans, but they tend to be beefier clothies with all that stamina so you really gotta be getting ur crit on with those instants to make a big dent in them. Also grenades help against the felhunter if u wanna avoid that brutal spell lock outta nature. 
---
I honestly avoid warlocks at all cost on my sham, and they always ruin the fun if they know to tag all shamans with cot

I think BC and Wrath are logical, that was when the sub numbers still climbed, so you can easily say that Vanilla, BC, and Wrath are more popular games. Wrath ended with 10M and Cata ended with 6M I believe. There’s plenty of a good reason to argue that the *successful* titles should be re released, and that titles like WoD or BFA aren’t as necessary. That being said, I won’t be the one to say no. If there’s enough fan outcry for BFA in 10 years, it doesn’t change anything for me.

Can't inspect, but currently you can armory someone so it's not 100% hidden if they really want to see it.

I totally feel you on this though, I plan on going HotW druid and I will punch any idiot who armories me and asks why I'm not deep resto.

The Axemen vs Devoted in Blackrock mountain was something we all enjoyed watching (from a safe distance), until we grew Big enough to participate (Dominance, Alliance)

Did you end up playing test server 3 or 15?

Personally, I'm not a huge fan of ASUS and Acer monitors because I find their housing kinda cheap and almost always have to buy a 3rd-party stand/mount to get the rotation and positioning I want. But I do a lot more than game with my monitors, so that probably doesn't matter to you. That one does come with a much better stand than their usual one, so maybe they've gotten better.
---
While the monitor isn't listed on Nvidia's compatibility site, there are reports that it works great with G-Sync, so you're good there.
---
I don't know anything about current deals, especially the ones on subreddits, but that price seems very reasonable.

I thought 1am came after 12am?

I've always been a heavily focused on my rogue main, and when they pruned the talent trees and tried to, idk, "brand" talent tree fantasy, I just couldn't have fun playing rogue again. Assassination was alright in legion, but I missed having my full package of CDs and I missed being deep sub, because shadowstep just made sub feel like a completely different class and I couldn't get into it. Haven't missed it until the classic announcement and now the hype is back baby.
---
They implemented a cooldown already.
---
Wow I never thought of that, sick reply!
---
Any person worth anything can just farm diremaul for 50g per hour for a few weeks in phase 2 and sit on 20k+ gold, its not hard in the slightest if you know what you're doing.
---
Gold inflation is always going to be a thing, but if people have more gold available then the amount stuff costs doesn't matter, it just means more gold is being circulated, but once phase 2 starts that's an inevitable outcome because of dungeons farms. (Just like deadzors said.)
---
The economy will fix itself regardless, its not going to be a problem.
---
He’s not wrong. The highest level party member dictates exp scaling.
---
Test it for yourself - have a 60 run you through a dungeon. See what your exp per mob values are compared to a party of 4 equal levels. 
---
The same concept applies for someone 5 levels above you etc.

It was great in early BC when the best pre-raid Warrior tank gear was green Lawbringer.

People have tested this in beta recently and it does not work. You are rezed at the gy closest to your death location no matter what spirit healer you use. There is a way for non-nelves to get to darnasus. You die asap, take the boat, swim out to fatigue and die as a ghost. Then you can rez.

So don't play?

Or keep stamping your feet on internet forums until you maybe get your way?  
---
Just try to understand the hypocrisy in calling others selfish who are OK with playing the game however blizzard decides to launch it.
---
I just remember that you got drastically decreased xp if you were in a group with a 60 at level 30. I'm not sure what an effect it would have with a 3 level difference or so. Or maybe I'm miss remembering.

I am not able to justify a simple phone typed reply after your amount of effort. I shall get back to you once I am near a computer.

No worries, I'm a dude. I made this account to troll EVE Online about making legacy servers after Blizzard announced their own, but they insta-banned me.

I did test this in the WoW classic stress test, if you follow the shore you can spawn in Dun Morough. Then of course run to ironforge/Loch modan.. Huge time saver!

**Gaming/IT Professional:** Without knowing the engineering team and exact technology, I can make a reasonable assumption that based on the Retail game and upcoming Classic, that their core layering technology has been in place for a long time. I'm hoping by now that they have the options to configure certain parameters that allow for testing to be more dynamic. That being said, the development of this core technology is firmly in place and would likely cause an additional X months to create an enhancement that controls layering at the player's level and/or game zones. Would be nice if they already had this in place, but I'm willing to bet the layering implementation was done at the game world level. With maybe some side implementations of the same technology in smaller environments like raid/dungeon/BG. If it currently isn't in place for a zone or player level, that requires weeks or months of one or more full development cycles that includes building the code and testing it... A LOT. Long story short, a change like this that probably isn't setup for zones/levels currently, will take months to implement. The Blizzard team has already committed to a date and this improvement won't stop them from releasing. They will most likely make due with what they currently have in place, doing their best to utilize it.
---
**Gaming end-user like everyone here:** I wholeheartedly agree with you. Layering should absolutely not be a part of this game. The only way I currently find myself being OK with it is from levels 1-10. Everyone at those levels are on the special servers that are meant to handle that load. The reason why a level layering is better than zone layering IMO is so that players at higher levels can travel to any zone in the game and not deal with layering and can experience the game in full as it is intended to be a single instance server. Local community, guilds, auction house, everything.
---
We sold several MC/BWL runs back in Vanilla. It helped fund progress evenings.
---
Yea I saw that Rip aoe farming
---
&gt;I want it to be overcrowded and unable to quest
---
Maybe they can have one non-layered server that all the masochists can join. Problem solved
---
Druids in a Hotw/NS build or a Moonglow/NS build
---
I use the web archived version of allakhazam. It's real vanilla data opposed to pservers and probably the best we have until the classic databases get filled.
---
I will have an alt for that, but I want my main to be 60 asap.
---
nostalgia aspect ratio!
---
Sure as fuck I'm going to play way too much
---
the number of hardcore players is never static, you might have several layers filled with casuals, saying otherwise is just wrong.
---
&gt;I did not accuse you of attacking me personally, I explained that I was unclear when I said "you", while I mean only mean "you" if what I say applies to you. I don't know anything about you mate.
---
So why would you start throwing out accusations about other people taking it personally? 
---
Dungeon grinding is fine. It helps to get a few levels early on to get ahead of everybody else. Once your ahead the curve tho, it's clearly a snore fest that's debatable in its effectiveness.
---
You mean like the cooldown added last week, god, if you wanna discuss shit you gotta be informed.
---
Lol that's the spirit! Not sure what that druid build is but it sounds like you'll have a ton of fun with it so more power to you
---
maybe he's using a VPN :D
---
&gt;When and why did you quit 
---
I quit twice. The first time I quit was sometime in late 07 or early 08, it was after Black Temple came out but before Sunwell. It was a combination of factors. I transferred servers going from a raiding guild who was in SCC to play with RL friends who....weren't very good, like, at all. On top of that I couldn't really play with anyone else because I was on a low pop server and none of the horde guilds there were raiding, so I focused on PvP and things started getting stale. On top of that, I started to miss Vanilla more and more because I felt like connections were easier to make there and the game's atmosphere in terms of the community started to change as the game became more "mainstream". I think I should also mention life outside of WoW started opening up for me. I had graduated high school in 07, so I started going to college and met people there that I really hit it off with, started partying and WoW took a back seat to all that until I finally pulled the plug. 
---
But, in 09 I started working with a guy who still played and him talking about it got me excited about the game all over again. So I resubbed and started playing again. I rolled a druid to play with him and went back to my (rogue) main, and free server transfers were a thing so I transferred back to my original server (Arthas US) and...the guild I left back in TBC disbanded and probably, 85% of the people I played with quit playing and I found it personally harder to make connections with people than in the past. I did some LFR's and it just never clicked with me like old school raiding did. After about 3 months I quit playing all together for the final time. 
---
&gt;what are you most excited for?
---
AQ40 and Nax, the guild I was in never got past Princess H and we never bothered with Nax but I really hope to right that wrong this time around. Literally right behind that though is meeting people and connecting with them again like I did all those years ago. Even today, "silly" as this is some of my fondest memories are shooting the breeze with people on Vent about random stuff, cracking jokes and goofing off, and I really hope I get to do that this time around too. 
---
&gt;I have about 10 friends that are getting back in to it solely due to classic.
---
I'm trying to recruit as many RL people as I know to play. I have ~5-10 myself, not sure how dedicated they'll be though, but I want to be able to play with people I know so we can meet up outside of the game too for dinners or parties and what not. Maybe WoW parties if someone has good enough internet too (doubt it), but we'll see.
---
Well your telling me to imagine a hypothetical situation, and your telling me THAT isn't an opinion, yet the other person's comment is?
---
I can accept that the talent could be added which will solely increase healing power of Regrowth, resulting in the mean of the average crit and hit. But adding a field for crit chance seems superfluous, since all spells will get the same percentile increase.
---
The Dread Raven is a collector's edition mount, not a store mount. You can buy it through the store, but that is  because digital collector's editions exist now. You can argue that is bad, but they technically didn't contradict themselves.
---
None of us will be playing classic in a month. Don’t get peoples hopes up like that
---
Okay, got a source? I can't really test this at the moment.
---
I'm closing on my first house in a couple weeks and I'm already fearing foreclosure.
---
The quest chain for Rhok is probably one of the most fun things you can do as a hunter, next to the Mage Tower in Legion.
---
dont remember, I started on one then it got shut off and had to go to 3 or 15 and that was a total shit show lol
---
I played end of BC to 3 months after release of Cata. I haven't played this game in 9 years and I'm building my first PC just to come back to vanilla. I'm terrified and excited!!
---
"anyone who had a different experience than me is a paid shill"
---
Hard yikes.
---
Or just do the exploration route, get a few levels and get out, you can do this regardless of how many people there are.
---
yes.
---
English is not my first language, this is beyond language barrier, more like IQ barrier.

Classic will probably run on a 150$ thinkpad
---
Not enough people post about this
---
Isn't he one of the guys who designed World of Warcraft?
---
The /sit thing didn't owrk in vanilla as well and reckoning was still a good pvp spec. Don't be dissuaded by private server fans calling doom upon us all, because things work different in the real game. In a fight, you'll be crit often enough. This entire /sit-thing is just to preload a full reckoning and oneshot somebody by letting some weak npc crit you.
---
Now, before we go on, keep in mind that holy reckoning also sacrifices something. You'll lose a bit of pve healing power and you won't have the oomph of a ret reckoning spec, as you lack some crit percentage and dmg modifiers. But, if want to heal in pve and do 2h offensive pvp with one spec, holy reck is the best compromise.
---
Well, the basic spec would be something like this:
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0xoZVGp0cux
---
with the 3 points left to spend at your leisure. Optimum for dmg output would be divine strength.
---
This gives you the most important pve talents, you'll only miss holy power. In prot you get the essential guardians favor, improved concentration aura, which is great in pve and pvp for any caster, you can support your raid with both kings and sanctuary at your fingertips and with imp. hoj, you get more control in pvp. You'll be sturdy and with decent gear, you'll do some nasty reckonings.Plus, with this spec, you also always have the option to be a pvp healer as well ,as you tick all the important boxes except for holy power.
---
Another option is this: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sqxu0xZVGpIczxo
---
This focuses more on using a shield and sacrifices healing power, but makes you a bulwark in pvp and means, you pretty much auto win against any melee class. It also has the option of letting you offtank in raids or tank 5 mans.   But overall, it'll hurt you pve healing potential a bit more and requires you to use weapon swaps in pvp quite frequently, which is difficult with a reckoning build as switching weapons clears reckoning stacks.
---
Played from about a month after release until early 2006. Got burnt out raiding in BWL. Made it to Nef though. The real problem was the guild leaders kept taking in people who would leave after getting geared. Didn't see the bigger picture, only wanted bodies. It broke up one day the MT didn't show up. 
---
Tried to reroll, but the flame went out fast. I did try to chase that high for about a decade after. Tried most MMOs after that, Guild Wars 2 being my last before I stopped caring about them.
---
Can't wait to do it all over and differently. I got to enjoy it the first time around smelling the roses and kinda like being a piece of driftwood without any goals. I started raiding kinda late as though I played a ton, my focus was all over the place.
---
Time to bust out my n52te I got after all that, as I was also a clicker way back too on my only main, a NE rogue. 
---
Thinking orc rogue or maybe undead mage this time. I'll miss Ironforge, but it'll be an even newer experience, and on a PvP server too this time around.
---
yeah but I dont go in for cheap junk
---
If im getting a new laptop its going to be a nice on e
---
Please dont pick a class based off of what the other faction can do. Before death coil and more gear, warlock is going to get destroyed. But at 60 with raid gear, wotf is not a big deal; its not warriors with death wish. So many people are 
---
So many people on this sub are afraid to roll ally, even if they greatly prefer playing them. I hope classic doesnt end up like retail, where 200 horde guilds clear mythic content before any alliance ones, and all rated pvp is just horde against horde.  Understand im slightly exaggerating, but it is really that bad, and has been like that for years.
---
Horde wont be able to fight against other horde, so if everyone interested in pvp is horde, everyone loses.
---
It was a thing during Vanilla too but not like now.
---
Nowadays everything is about competition and bragging about how "good" you are
---
The bonus is that horde locks have to deal with two classes from the alliance side being able to defensively dispel magic while alliance locks only have to deal with priests (not including felhunter pets as a reliable dispel magic). 
---
In pug battlegrounds alliance warlocks absolutely destroy due to this because they just dot up everyone. Also, a paladin can throw that BoP on you when you get fucked by some melee and you can really pull some shit.
---
I highly recommend gnome because warlocks have zero way outta cc, other than self dispel magic snares so escape artist paired with that is actually very nifty. I actually want to try out one come classic because I’ve seen some very good gnome lock players.
---
I think I saw this guy's chair for sale
---
This is super easy. I can fix it in just three words.
---
Buy more servers.
---
I quit a month into WotLK and honestly I'm im not at all surprised to hear about the transmog bullshit. Call me old-fashioned but WoW was all about difficult accomplishments and you were rewarded for those accomplishments with flashy and/or unqiue looking gear. Individualism in game form. You set yourself apart from the rest by working harder and you reaped the rewards for doing so.
---
You're probably trolling but I really hope you don't think that non-hardcore guilds will be like that. And all those non-hardcore guilds, even though slower, will still get to do all content eventually.
---
I think shadowbolt, like starfire and fireball, is a 3.5s cadt reduced to 3.0 with talents.
---
All of these main nukes get reduced cast time, a flat % bonus to damage from talents (10% for fireball and starfire, shafowbolt depends on whther you're SM/ruin kr DS/ruin, either 10 or 15%), and crit scali g tgat exceeds 100%.
---
Mages get 6% hit from talents, which is great, and ignite makes crits do no less than 110% bonus damage- chain ignites can increase this further, which is why mages are so godly in tier 3 quality gear. Imp shadow bolt makes the next 4 shadow damage spells do 25% extra damage after crits, and has a pretty high uptime (realistically boosting warlock dps by 10-20% as they gear up). Nature's grace reduces your next cast by 0.5s, which is the worst bonus but still pretty good. 
---
But if your guild actually lets you roll on good caster dps gear, a boomkin should be about 90-95% of the dps of a warlock. 
---
The math is complicated, but the crit aura alone should increase your groups dps by 4-5% (maybe more, for well-geared groups) since it's a straight 3% more crit, increasing both the raw dps of your mages/locks, AND their uptime on ignite/imp sbolt. Assuming 2 caster dps groups, 6 mages, 3 locks, and a boomkin is going to be better dps than 6 mages and 4 locks. Put the boomkin in a group with 3 locks and the mage with the highest spell power.
---
We're all in hell at this point.
---
Same problem they with their current dynamic layering scheme.  
---
The difference is that with full static layers, you are at least playing with the same people until if/when the pop. drops.
---
I don't remember much about their talks or posts about Layering, but this has definitely not been the case on the beta or stress tests. The Layers are either balanced to not have "full" populations in any of them or they're very aggressive to where there's hardly ever anyone on your Layer. 
---
During the stress test, one of the realms had Layering that prevented more than ~100 people in any one starting zone. And there's been 10+ Layers on the Beta at one time with no more than 1000 people online for my faction.
---
&gt; Just buy another server.
---
That's not how it works... The resources required to do Layering is equal to separate realms, if not more because of the overhead logic needed for balancing them.
---
Been looking for a laptop to handle WoW hows that one doing for you?
---
I Will avoid it as much as I can ofc. But from playing the beta the layering affects Even me when i try to avoid it cause me and My group og friends Will want to play together. And thats when thwe layering affects us. Im not explaining this Any further. Cause clearly this is not a problems for you but I respekt you for trying to understand or make it work for us Who have different opinions
---
Maybe because you blatantly said you did care about levelling fast, when the post before I said that if you don't care about levelling fast, the thread wasn't for you? That's what I gathered, but lets leave it because I can feel some heat from you now, and that's not what this thread is about.
---
I made this thread to debate the effectiveness of levelling only when your team is online versus levelling solo when they are offline and then carrying them through the dungeons to get 5 people to 60 faster.
---
I quit because I was done with college and working full time. I still played but pretty casually. I had a serious gf and moved into my own place. I didn’t really have time to play any game, let alone fucking WoW. 
---
I left at the end of WotLK. My gear wasn’t maxed out but it was close. The thought of a new expansion with new raids, gear, and mechanics finally made me quit. I knew I wasn’t gonna be able to keep up. 
---
I’m excited for classic because first off, I know the game. Despite not having played in years, I can probably recite the leveling path for alliance players 1-60. Secondly, I’m going to play on my own terms and right now is a good point for me in life.
---
I quit towards the end of WOTLK. Daily's did it for me. I just couldn't keep playing as a chore. Came back for BFA and I loved m+ but it become too burdensome to do high keys and idk doing them with strangers each time wasn't fun anymore so I stopped playing. I loved playing vanilla like shit when I was 13 and holy shit am I excited to redo those raids at over 20 frames per second and without freezing up multiple times each fight.
---
I really don’t know what I want to do in classic. I’m between trying to rush to 60 and jumping into raids, or just slowly leveling at a leisurely pace and realizing that I’ll probably never get tier pieces.
---
I quit at the end of WoTLK - for me the story of WC3 was concluded with the fall of the Lich King.  
---
Stoked to play vanilla rogue again &gt;=}
---
No layering.
---
Just use Sharding for the first 3 zones for each race (such as Elwynn Forest, Westfall, Redridge for Humans). 
---
Remove Make more servers if need be. Merge them if the player count falls off so much that it needs to be done. I'd rather have merged communities than separated ones.
---
And then half a year later the small pop server would die because the one progression guild breaks apart because the overgeared loot Council server transfers to play with the top 1% of Raiders worldwide.
---
Well maybe some others with as large of a following would want that but I know neither of them 2 do. Soda is a hard no and will most likely playing off-stream and prefers a more genuine experience. Asmon has stated his intention to not take favors initially but we'll see how long that last, as he is admittedly selfish.
---
Sounds like you may have to occasionally group for difficult areas in an MMORPG. Nah I’d rather play the game like retail and fuck the economy forever.
---
Hahaha. Of course they did. What’s your race/class plans for classic?
---
Like being a mage.
---
I'm assuming someone from the guild was still raid leader so they could hand out the free l00ts. Big guilds like that always develop huge egos and start trying to get away with shit like this. Reminds me of that guy on a private server who was in a big raiding guild and hated "newbs" so much that he would intentionally form raids full of them and then lock them to an empty instance.
---

---
That may be so. I'd really like to know the specific ratio so I know whether or not it's worth it. If you can do two deadmines in the span of one, maybe it's worth getting half the exp while having access to a higher level character with more abilities, and less chance of dying?
---
It's not that 1% of all people that will play the game are "hardcore". There is a fixed number of people that are willing and capable of being a "hardcore" player, and if we have 0 tourists or 10 million, that number will not change (significantly). To quote myself from another comment: 
---
&gt;Imagine holding a sprinting competition, and everyone who manages to sprint 100m below 10s gets a large reward. The people that know they can run fast enough will definitely attend (because they know they will get the reward), but having more people attend in general will not increase the people getting the reward (because there is only a fixed number of people in the world that can run that fast, and they will attend anyway). Now, the reward that those fast sprinters get is based on the number of people attending, with more people attending meaning a bigger reward. There won't be more people running below 10s even if everyone in the world attended, but the reward for those that would have got a reward anyway will get bigger.

Classic doesn't care how many cores you have past 2 and it has no multi-threading support at all. But yes, you're talking about the 8700 line and they'll all be plenty unless you push the game beyond what the available settings allow. You still might get drops in cities and raids and large PVP battles, but they won't be terrible and you'll have Adaptive Sync on your monitor to basically not even notice.
---
There is always one mage ahead of the pack. Even just slightly. He starts aoeing, as he is the first to hit a good zone.
---
He then snowballs and after 40 minutes is 2 levels ahead. It’s like being at the front of a traffic jam.
---
Good mages have alternative or even secret locations to do this.
---
They might hit that one area 1-2 levels earlier than any quester would hit that zone.
---
On pservers the situation was the same. Yet there were always a few ages who could aoe farm nicely.
---
&gt; i think that's against the ToS now?
---
there is nothing against selling in game stuff for in game currency
---
I don't think you quite comprehend the issue but you will experience it first hand anyway. Enhancement and elemental (30/0/21, which you people keep calling improved resto spec for some reason) are considered meme specs in vanilla. They are both viable, moreso in PvP, but when you hit 60 you won't need that damage for quests. Most 60 quests are group anyway, people won't expect you to DPS, they'll expect you to heal. Also, you will have to compete with other casters for gear and it's unlikely they'll give it to you, they'd rather give it to a mage or lock. There's also a possibility that people would flat out reject you for a group when you tell them your spec. I told you in another comment, I wish you good luck with whatever you roll, but you're in for a disappointment.
---
Tbh I’m not going to look for a source for this. It’s pretty common knowledge. Been that way a long time. I think it even exists still on retail.
---
i bought a cheap $300 lenovo laptop during Legion and it ran pretty decent, pretty low settings tho and 720p, but good enought to get my fix while on vacation to do my dailies
---
I think you'd be surprised, but we can agree to disagree. 
---
Anecdotally, an example of the player-base at large being better is when I got back into arenas in BFA. I was a decently rated player back in Wrath as a semi-casual PvPer who focused mainly on raiding (was 2300 in 2s/3s). When I started doing them again in BFA, I was pretty surprised at how much better people were at the game. I was stuck around 1800-1900 for a while, and the things people were doing back in the day at 2300 were just default things people did now at 1800. 
---
It took quite a bit of adjusting and improving to finally start climbing up and get above my old rating. And my experience raiding on retail more or less mirrors what I found in PvP. If I could go back in time now to Wrath there's no doubt in my mind I could easily get Gladiator, the player-base just wasn't as good. Hell, I didn't even use keybinds back then.
---
No, that is not what was suggested.
---
Servers are going up 2 weeks prior to launch so that people can reserve names (create their character(s)), only 3 characters per account prior to the actual launch though (not per server, per account.)  
---
There will probably come several community building sites fairly son to prepare =)

Transmog bullshit??

Can't go wrong with dual gathering, I'd go mining and herbing myself, just make a macro to switch the tracking back are forth

[Kevin Jordan confirmed that Dynamic Respawns already existed world-wide in Vanilla.](https://clips.twitch.tv/TolerantRespectfulHerbsKappaPride)
---
Yeah can definitely agree that a field for crit chance is superfluous. Honestly hadn't seen the tool yet and was just chiming in on the math, so adding the talent might even be useless too since you are just saying which rank is best.

That being said, I'm looking over the tool now and you should probably look at Regrowth again. This might be too rough, but the HoT for Regrowth is basically never going to get full healing out of it (Swiftmend might take it, overhealing is pretty common, etc.). Typically the best rank for Regrowth is 4/5 since you are really only worried about the big crit and the extra healing to follow is just gravy. I'll be honest I don't know how you can consider that in the calculations though, since there's no way to know how much you'll overheal.
---
If you make ED1/2/3 Layers distinct and separate to the point you can't switch at all, they're different realms. What you're suggesting is just realm merging with a different name.
---
Legit server firsts were still within 12 hours though. 80-85 was just kind of a joke, especially with how you can complete Hyjal in like 1.5 hours and get about 1.5 levels from it. That zone was just silly.
---
In the beta. 
---
Do you know if the 8.1 performance improvements to utilize more cores is in the beta currently?
---
Yeah I was worried about switching back and forth all of the time.
---
It's not a MacBook it's a Huawei.
---
The game looks fucking horrible, cant play something like that.
---
So you're gonna be *that* guy.
---
Damn, it has 2 months to live
---
I quit before the pandas. I couldn't stand them and the multitude of oversimplifications they introduced in the game (talent tree removal above all). I don't know how much I'll play Classic but I will try it for sure.
---
Sure.. but just like then no one cares except for the people who got “first”
---
Can you mail more than one item at a time?
---
Found the alliance player!
---
He quick mages I know start at around Hillsbrad. Levels 18-22 or so. I’m not a mage though, I can just use `/who`, have experience and skilled racing mage friends.
---
TBC was fun but it also introduced allot of terrible gameplay mechanics.
---
1. Flying Mounts
---
2. Class homoginization (paladin for horde, shaman for alliance) 
---
3. Destroy the use of items from earlier dungeons/raids. (Basically anything from classic is now worthless at end game) this is critical as in vanilla there were many world drop and dungeon drop items that you could find while leveling that mattered at end game.
---
What made TBC good was the difficulty of the content.
---
just like communities track it now, for raid bosses it's  [https://www.wowprogress.com/](https://www.wowprogress.com/)  I'm sure other sites will track or list other world first achievements. There are no in-game mechanic to track it though afaik.
---
Does the VPN work if your access point to the server is public?
---
Streaming
---
I actually care about the game, not just myself. How the hell is that selfish?
---
You can clear MC in like 2hrs. Early on when the Raids are limited there will probably be at least 1 Twink-Raid per Week.
---
[I watched an Asmongold video, but can't find it. Here's this one though about it! ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F_RRSO1gXd0)
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
weak
---
Back then it was a world first with that patch's class balance and item balance. Now it will be a world first with 1.12 class and item balance.  
---
It's like you have a base game and a remastered edition in a speedrunning category, of course they will be separate.
---
Awesome, thanks, I'll look into this
---
There's plenty of clips of people getting put in different layers and it having the exact same effect as being phased randomly, even mid-combat. To say they're different is semantics when you're talking about the negative effect it has
---
Just make it really hard to switch layers its that easy.
---
I'll repeat what I said in another comment: No, because the number of people who can and will exploit this are not a function of the tourists that come to play the game for a few weeks and then stop playing, but a (more or less) fixed number.
---
Imagine holding a sprinting competition, and everyone who manages to sprint 100m below 10s gets a large reward. The people that know they can run fast enough will definitely attend (because they know they will get the reward), but having more people attend in general will not increase the people getting the reward (because there is only a fixed number of people in the world that can run that fast, and they will attend anyway). Now, the reward that those fast sprinters get is based on the number of people attending, with more people attending meaning a bigger reward. There won't be more people running below 10s even if everyone in the world attended, but the reward for those that would have got a reward anyway will get bigger.
---
I do hope that a cooldown on layer hopping (ideally around at least 1 hour) can counteract many of the exploits, and that it is implemented in a way that won't impact the player experience (i.e., if you hop layers by being invited into a group for a quest, you can't play with people from other layers for the cooldown, which would suck).
---
There used to be an add-on that did it for you but I don't think that's going to work anymore
---
I bet you are going to play a mage or a hunter aren’t you, LOL!
---
No, you can look for yourself. There is a solution at the top of this very thread.

**&lt;Incarnation&gt;** Alliance **|** NA-PvP **|** Hardcore
---
Raid Times: M TU W 7-10pm PST
---
System: Loot Council
---
Hi Everyone! Incarnation is a Hardcore Alliance guild looking for passionate and competitive players for Classic WoW. Our goal is to raid and clear content efficiently while promoting a healthy community.
---
We are a fresh guild, meaning that we do not have “core members” or “clicks” yet like many other guilds. Just because we are fresh does not mean we lack experience. We have a wide range of experience ranging from World competitive Naxxaramas clears in Vanilla WoW (14th), private server Naxxaramas clears, US server first endgame content of different expansions of WoW; as well as multiple PvP achievements including but not limited to rank 14's in vanilla wow, rank 1 arena gladiators from various expansions and even pro gaming experience through various games.
---
We do not expect all our recruits to have this level of experience, however we do have high expectations for all those interested in joining.
---
**Expectations:**
---
We expect all our recruits to know their class, game mechanics and how to progressively adapt into the later phases of Classic.
---
We are hardcore in the sense that we put a lot of time in preparation for the raid (farming consumables/pre-raid gear, knowing all boss mechanics) so that when we do zone in to a raid, we are fully prepared and ready to clear. We are raiding 3 hrs per day for only 3 days and not excessively long hours because we pride ourselves on using raid time efficiently.
---
**Goals:**
---
\-Build a positive and strong community.
---
\-Strive to effectively and efficiently utilize time invested in the game to be the top guild in the server.
---
Mage x2
---
Druid (resto) x1
---
Paladin (holy) x2
---
Priest (disc/holy) x1
---
Obligatory all exceptional players consideres. (People in our guild switch classes sometimes so even if your class is not listed, do apply! We are looking for good players with positive attitude!)
---
Please apply on the website at [https://www.incarnationguild.com/](https://www.incarnationguild.com/) or contact ephy#0620 , iggy#1473 using Discord. (When filling out the application please be descriptive! It is hard to know who you are if you are answering each question with just one sentence!)
---
Thank you and we are looking forward to hearing from you!
---
Please leave my thread if you have nothing more constructive to say.
---
It's like you don't even know why layering is being done. It's mostly being done so people can play a normal launch while still having high population realms following the hyped release.
---
I think the idea is that in this example you would never move between layers. ED1, ED2, and ED3 are quite literally three different servers with the same name. As far as I understand it, at least.
---
Yeah I doubt it. Still could be worth it. Just figured skinning would be a lazy man's way of insuring I have steady gold coming in.
---
I mean common, wrath wasn't all that baaaaad. Ulduar the hardest up to it's time and first heroic raid aka hardmode and then the arena fever still running rampant. Leveling experience wasn't far from tbc and classic, and new zone scenery were an absolute killer, ever make it to Grizzly Hills? Heroic dungeons were hard and required good effort and decent groups, just Wintergrasp was a let down and that 25 man free epic boss
---
&gt; raids themselves are a joke, and will pose no actual challenge to top guilds
---
&gt; competitive progression raiding
---
Since the raids are a joke there won't be any competitive progression raiding. Priv realm guilds have already done all progress, so they just need some basic gear and all content is already on farm.
---
I was told this would be short...
---
We have no actual information in servers yet. Though we do have some speculation floating around. And Blizz have said that they are not planning on RP-PVP servers and they're are not planning of making language specific servers for the EU. We'll likely not have much more concrete information for another 2-3 weeks. Possibly not until August 12-ish.
---
Biggest input on servers currently seems to be whether do or don't want to roll on servers with well known streamers.
---
Factions are also up the air, but Horde does appear to be the more favored in polls. Of course that could all change when people actually come to create their characters.
---
I won't need the /sit exploit. With a pocket healer i can pull 3-4 mobs at a time and have plenty of enrage uptime as well as higher rage generation from taking damage. If my healer goes low on mana i can kill 1-2 mobs while he's drinking then go right back to pulling 3-4.
---
Should probably also mention my healer will be a paladin. That means devotion aura which will lower my damage intake, and between battle shout and blessing of might even bloodthirst damage won't be too awful.
---
No it's not a harsh way it's exactly how it is.
---
how are you playing already?
---
I quit because wotlk dungeon finder and item level/gear score ruined the ability to make friends and party up together and totally changed the feel of the game. I’ve come back a ton of times but never for more than a month (legion was decent) but I haven’t really loved the game since BC or early wrath. Super excited to meet friends and party up and run BGs for hours.
---
I quit early Legion after hitting 110. My PC couldn't run it reliably anymore and I had no money to build a new pc.  
---
When I got my new PC I was out of the loop and didn't go back.
---
Layers being fuzzy is what makes the final realm communities solidify. You need permeability between the layers so that the final realm culture can be defined by the players on all the layers of that realm.
---
All these ideas where layers are completely (or limitedly) disconnected from each other are simply semantics games for releasing more realms than are necessary at launch.
---
Either 1)  the “old way” of proving your achievement by posting on forums or streaming, YT videos with time/date and /total played.
---
2) Since classic WoW is based on modern engine I’ll assume blizzard is going to auto-broadcast world’s and server’s first/-s.
---
You stated what you thought was an objective fact. I simply pointed out that it wasn't. Then I gave my own opinion and I did not pretend that it was anything but an opinion...
---
&gt;	Nah I’d rather play the game like retail and fuck the economy forever.
---
Funny because dynamic respawns are a good way to screw up the economy on implementations we have seen so far.
---
I even mentioned that in my comment. You would of course know that, had you bothered to read it instead of judging me and resorting to ad hominem. And why? Because we have different opinions? Smh.
---
It's worth it just to do it the normal way to grab the Thelsamar flight path. Just my opinion.
---
LOL.  At least in Classic you could easily hide helm from the options menu.
---
yeah skinning is super popular, so popular in fact that most people just vendor it instead of AHing it 
---
but its still as steady gold supplement
---
&gt; You just gotta know what to do and where to go. And thats the Vanilla Spirit.
---
&gt; The stronger survives, the weak ones will fight over lvl 1 wolves.
---
&gt; Hard to wrap the head around in todays society where everything caters to the weak links, slowing down human development further and further.
---
How do you guys manage to act like such tryhards about a game that doesnt even have perma death?
---
Can't get addicted again if you never dropped the addiction ;)
---
I honestly doubt it's a financial decision. The development time required to create and test layering is probably pretty expensive. More expensive than opening new servers? I don't know. But creating brand new functionality is not the sort of thing that they would do in order to cut costs.
---
**&lt;Moist&gt; PvE Horde NA Casual Raiding**
---
**Intro:**
---
We are Moist, a collection of friends (and some significant others) having come together through the ages of playing WoW and still staying loosely in touch with one another. The goal is to find other fellow mature players with limited schedules wanting to make the most of a single organized raid night without the pressure to fully min/max. The core of us are laid back, mature players with busy schedules, but who have raided since vanilla. 
---
We are all excited for this release.  For some it’s about nostalgia, for others it’s about experiencing classic for the first time.  Regardless of why we are here we can all agree we are here to have fun. We are a casual guild but that does not mean we aren’t aiming to succeed.  We want to create a comfortable atmosphere so we can all experience the game in a positive way. Play what you want, play how you want, play when you want.  We are accepting and open to players of all types.
---
Classic WoW relied heavily on individual and guild reputation.  We will strive to make Moist synonymous with quality: quality players, quality attitudes, quality experiences.  Anyone who encounters a member of Moist should leave thinking that we are knowledgeable, respectful, fun, and all around awesome!
---
**Expectations:** 
---
Members should have a desire to learn and share knowledge to improve the guild. Seeing as we will operate on minimal organized raid time it is important that members be prepared and prompt for raid. The goal is to at least be farming BWL and 20 player content and pretty much see what motivation levels are like beyond that. We run a loot council but we try to be fair and transparent as well. We’re looking for people to help share the responsibility of running our guild community rather than focus too heavily on progression. 
---
**Raid Schedule:** 
---
We are planning to run two separate 3 hour raid IDs, one on Thursdays at 6 pm PST (9 pm EST) and the other on Saturdays 5 pm PST (8 pm EST), for targeting 40 player content. Currently the Saturday team has the most availability but the Thursday team can use a mage, warlock, and maybe a couple priests. By having two raid groups, we hope to be flexible for people’s schedules while also providing a large player base for smaller group content. Other nights there may be optional 20 player content scheduled as interest dictates given the shorter lock out schedule. 
---
**Contact:**
---
If you are interested and want to be part of our discord for release day organization, then please message Slaugth#9941 on discord or even a DM here on reddit with a discord contact (I don't check reddit as often so please be patient).
---
&gt; How long do vanilla raids take? Also, how many nights per week do vanilla/classic guilds usually raid?
---
It really depends on the guild. The ones who are faster at clearing content can complete MC, BWL, ZG, Ony and the like in a few hours (individually, probably not in 1 sitting), but other guilds it may take them days and some may not be able to clear the content at all. I went from a guild that never downed Rag despite raiding every single night to one that could clear BWL in ~3-6 hours. 
---
And as mentioned before, the first guild I joined did MC or ZG or something every.single.night. The next guild I joined would break things up. We'd raid (if memory serves me right) Tuesday, Wed and Thursday, but then on Fri and Sat we'd PvP or some would not log in at all and do RL stuff. Then I think we'd clear the 20 mans on Sun/Mon, but again, 14 years, I could be wrong. 
---
If you can't/don't want to raid for 3 or more hours straight anymore, find a guild that'll meet your needs or start one yourself if you can't find one!
---
I know but those were pretty different to the dynamic respawns people are asking for here. Those that can accommodate 15k players trying to start their journey at the same time.
---
Actually after the server shutdowns server 3 was actually empty, I assume they had aggressive layering on it. Server 15 was a shit show indeed since I think they had minimum settings on it.
---
I played through end of vanilla through Wrath. Tried Cata, WOD and Legion but didn't like it . 
---
Excited for classic
---
I've been playing an undead lock in the beta.  Between lifetap + canabalize (and staying up on first aid) there is literally no downtime unless you and/or your pet die from overzealously pulling like 5 mobs just for funsies.
---
alot of people said they didnt notice a difference but when i turned up the render scale resolution in settings, the cracks  and ground textures in the mud in the orc starting zone actually sharpened and looked WAY better than default.  Love it.   
---
I dont think the render res option is enabled on older machines bc my friend who has a gtx970 and 1080p monitor didnt have the option in his settings.
---
The spirit is willing but the flesh is weak.
---
Plan on vendoring while I turn in quests. I'll be saving cloth for tailoring on an alt so bag space will be already be terrible
---
WORLD BUFFS ARE THE REAL CHEAT.   10000X WORSE THAN LAYERING EVER DREAMED OF BEING.
---
There are guilds with over 100 members planning to be 60 week 1 doing for a week 1 rags. They are practicing their routes on their own servers (manually updated with all info from Beta) and on the beta for 1-40. Then they leave their essentially fresh 60s, and practice more leveling. Then they go and do MC during raid time on their essentially fresh 60s to practice it with realistic gear they would experience on launch. They have like 100 or so commited to it, because they know that not all of them will actually make it to 60 in week 1.
---
I quit a couple weeks after Cata because I realized I had been 'forcing' myself to play since post ulduar as is, Cata was just the final nailnfot me. Also StarCraft 2!
---
 Got readdicted via vanilla private servers a year later though..
---
Is anyone else having trouble following what the fuck this guy is talking about?
---
You can make a macro to auto target and kill tremor totems.
---
Also, very important point: Pallys are WAY harder to fight than Shamans, they can just perma dispel all your dots and fear
---
**&lt;Thinkin Bout Thos Beans&gt; - Alliance - NA - Normal/PvE**
---
We're a casual guild looking to expand our roster for Classic release so we have plenty of people to level, do dungeons, and complete group content with. Eventually leading to raid progression sometime in fall.
---
Our guild consists of a mixed group of raiding veterans and casual players who cannot wait for Classic release. We are all working adults who have been playing WoW together for many years, with some of us playing together since Vanilla. We are always on the lookout for new players who want to have a good laugh and complete content at a pace that is fulfilling, but not overbearing.
---
**Raid Times:** Sundays, 7pm-11pm EST. Raids will start after plenty of time is given for players to level and gear up. Aiming for early November.
---
We are looking for any **DPS and Healer** at the moment.
---
You can join us at our Discord. If you are looking for a community that plays games beyond WoW, we run giveaways and server events, while playing various other multiplayer titles.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H](https://discord.gg/PuJsk5H) (mention WoW Classic)
---
&gt;original LFR for dragon soul was still full mechanics just slightly less harmful
---
Laughs in Spine of Deathwing HC.  
---
Just no, it wasn't still full mechanics.
---
&gt; By dis-allowing layer hopping you fix the exploits, and you can still allow friends to play together by letting them pick layers
---
Layers being fuzzy is what makes the final realm communities solidify. You need permeability between the layers so that the final realm culture can be defined by the players on all the layers of that realm. Imagine joining a layer without ever finding out that the layer you'll be merged with in two weeks is the one all the Brazilians chose to play on.
---
solid plan
---
&gt;they didn't have enough servers
---
You know what layering does tho ... add more servers based on demand.
---
i see
---
Ok, let's assume it's only 0.1%. Which is bigger 0.1% of 20k or 0.1% of 4k?
---
Yeah I don't want layering long term but I fully understand and agree with the need for it on launch. At least a few weeks of it are required to allow the initial boom of players to actually be able to play/progress. I played on a launch of a p server before and my god it was chaotic. I would not imagine that bliz would allow thousands of players on one server trying to tag a few mobs. Its fun for its own kind of experience but for a healthy launch they need layering!
---
If I’m a warrior leveling with a hunter, will the leveling experience be noticeably more tolerable? Also, can I rank 5 mans as a non-prot warrior while leveling?
---
As I understand it they're starting with a conservative number of servers and handling launch hype with layering. So a ton of new servers that die and have to be hard merged shouldn't be an issue. I think I read (but can't be bothered to look for it) that if population demands it they will open new servers but not immediately at launch.
---
there is no HK tracking making ganking far less appealing, always was a scalp collector myself
---
I'll be running the fel-hunter edition come live.
---
Yah any idiot who doesn’t farm DM for 400 hours (or 17 days /played ONLY farming, not counting the trips to vendor, repair, afk) isn’t worth anything. 
---
That’s not patience, that’s idiotic.
---
The world/server 1st races will be pointless, but there will still be guilds competing with each other on their respective servers.
---
I'm pretty sure that a whole guild can farm enough flasks for a raid night without having to rely on AH.
---
Thanks man enjoy classic!
---
That suggestion is just layering without allowing people to cross communicate, and requires more micromanagement.   Bad idea.  It also fucks with the sense of community and the economy far more than regular layering.    More micormanagement also means dead servers.   It will take time for blizz to merge things, if they have to do it manually.  
---
It's just layering made worse in every way...
---
Yea people thinking they are going to get 8 shamans are delusional. One of the rarer class choices. Raids will be happy to get 4.
---
Can’t wait for my banana paladin &lt;3
---
Also, for some classes it isn't as big of a deal. Especially if you are grinding mobs in between quests. Joana's guide doesn't have you buy a mount at 40. If it was important for leveling speed, I'm sure he would sacrifice time to get extra cash and buy one at 40
---
Private server launches have up to 10k players with no layering. They will be used to more competition than they will experience in actual launch. Many of them are also practicing on the beta for 1-40. Many private servers have been updated with all the info obtained from Classic to be as accurate as possible.
---
If I go Horde for the guild I've joined (most likely), my "mains" will be (in order):
---
* Female Orc Rogue (my original class but the proper race this time, I was a Troll Rogue in Vanilla, yikes)
---
* Male Troll Mage (will become my proper main before AQ)
---
* Male Undead Priest (PVP mostly, but we're running 3 raid teams so they'll eventually all get played every week)
---
I definitely want to play Female Undead Warlock some too, as that's a class that I've never given any thought. The guild requires everyone to have a level 20 Warlock alt in any case. Druid and Shaman don't appeal to me at all.
---
If I go Alliance for friends, my main will be Male Gnome Mage. I'll also level a Female Human Rogue and Male Dwarf Priest, but I won't play them as much as their Horde counterparts because I won't be nearly as hardcore as Alliance. Female Gnome Warlock and Female Night Elf Hunter are probably in the cards too, but again, just as casual alts.
---
If they announce TBC legacy servers and I'm Alliance, I'll have a 60 Male Dwarf Paladin at the ready. I loved Paladin tanking in TBC. But for either faction, my main will probably still be Mage. I wasn't a fan of Rogues after Vanilla.
---
Priest will be my main in WotLK (if it ever comes to that and I'm still playing). But I think by then they'll have made huge changes to Retail and will be attempting to merge the playerbases.
---
This comment is really the only one that matters in this thread.

---
I look forward to being addicted again and hibernating through the winter months playing
---
How many hours was his stream.
---
Only time I've seen ele shamans provide DPS in raids while healing was during BWL where the dragonoids are super vulnerable to elemental damage. That 20k burst from a crit series of lightning bolts helps bring those assholes down quick where they are otherwise super resistant to "normal" raid dps.
---
Thanks, man. At work, but saved your comment to watch later.
---
Yeah, I installed the bnet launcher yesterday and noticed I have a Classic download available, too. I'm not subbed and won't be until Classic launches, so I know I don't have beta.
---
I stopped playing in vanilla. I came back for a few months during pre-cataclysm to see how it was.
---
Shamans have cleave?
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
You can only see one shoulder so width is impossible to plausibly speculate.
---
And I dont get vacation for it. *sighs*
---
Haha I Considered hunter, but no, priest.
---
Meh, I keep asking Kevin in his chat what his proposed solutions to the problem are and he keeps dodging. It's easy to criticise, but he won't put himself in dev shoes (ironically!) and come up with a better solution.
---
&gt;The suggestions I have seen are that they should have a server being hacked up into layers and you choose which one to join during character creation. So you join Emerald Dream layer 1, Emerald Dream layer 2, Emerald Dream layer 3 etc during character creation and can never leave it. 
---
Whats to stop everyone from hammering the first layer and leaving the problem completely unsolved?
---
What happens when you pick a layer early at launch, and then realize a couple days later that the queues are multiple hours due to overcrowding?
---
What happens when you go to play with friends, but they picked the busiest layer right off the bat that now has crazy queues to log in? Do you just roll on a different layer and play by yourself until the merges, or do you fight the queues?
---
I'm pretty sure they can control just how much and frequently players and mobs pop in and out. If they shard locked you like they do with layering, you'd only pop in and out when new shards were created (or condensed) or going into and out of the zone. 70 level 1s all standing on top of each other while everyone sets their keybindings and mobs respawning all break immersion just as much. Waiting in line to be the 30th person to bring Garrick Padfoot's head back to Deputy Willem is far more immersion breaking to me.
---
I wonder what the layer size would be like at launch vs the stress test.  During the stress test there was one point I almost quit because I just had 1 quest I couldnt finish due to overpopulation.  I just grinded it out (which was still difficult since it was even hard to find mobs) but very annoying.
---
This would be impossible with the solution I proposed as the players could not change layer in-game. They would all have to log off, wait for the timer, then change layer.
---
However, with the current system we've seen in the beta/stress test, this is a possible abuse of the layering system and that's why it needs to be changed.
---
This was my thought as well. would need to be resized a bit though, and i'm too lazy
---
How do you know local release times?
---
&gt;The basilisks drop large fangs, just like rest of them at the top, but they have amazing gray loot, which sells for 4-7 silver a pop, farming here is an easy way to earn mount money and a starting capital for AH goblins on your way to 60.
---
&gt;Skinning is also recommended. **Warning: Kite them around, if they "gaze" on you, you will be stunned for 6 seconds, it has a very short range with a 2 second cast, so if they start casting, move, they will cancel it.**
---
You could also just turn around and it wount stun you.
---
He's a hunter, 30% move speed increase isn't worth.
---
For any class besides hunter and druid, it's 100% worth.
---
 It's decreasing travel time by more than half...
---
Ok.
---
Am I the only one who doesn't care about that at all? Merging servers every so often seems like the best way to keep everyone happy. You can balance for population and faction distribution. All for the low price of occasionally having the slightly alter your character or guild name. Seems like a no-brainer.
---
It is not. Which is a crying shame, but completely understandable. The project of getting the old data working on a "modern enough" client already sounds fucking miserable.
---
I have this mental image of you trying to convince a voidwalker to try the sandwich... 
---
he just looks at you, looks at the sandwich, looks at you
---
why is this so funny to me
---
What I really care about is being to skin werewolves. IIRC, they dropped that for cata when werewolves became a playable race.
---
Thoughts on oversaturation as everyone tries the same thing?
---
I plan on leveling both, but hunter first and warrior only on rested exp, using gold farmed from hunter to keep him geared out while leveling.
---
My guild &lt;Doggo Noir&gt; checks every single one of your boxes except loot council. We are a casual-hardcore guild on a PvP Alliance server. We plan on having a full guild raid by week 5-6 but being a little more serious once we get to that end game stage. I PM'd you a link to our application (nothing too serious) as well my discord information so I can answer any questions I'm sure you two will have. Hope to talk to you soon!
---
Would love to see more posts like this for all classes

Tbh, I feel like it's the other way around no ? super hardcore guilds might do a lot more stuff to optimize their guild members / maximize output but this also means you will clear raids much much faster than casual raiding guilds.
---
It might take you 20 mins doing dire maul for the buffs and another 30 running around the world getting herbs and darkmoon fair and world buffs but you'd most likely clear raids so fast you would probably do several raid clears in 1 sitting, so that actually ends up with less raiding days per week.
---
Whilst the casual guilds will need to raid more days a week to clear 1 raid tier a day which might increase the amount of days you raid the more the game progresses with patches.
---
I have considered most of the things you mentioned, and as you say, the whole thing is too situational to give a good static answer. And the tool is meant to give a good knowledge base of your spell, so you can make a better informed decision of which rank to use. Not sure if you noticed the “Spell details” button in the tooltip, but that will give you a lot of additional info about the spell, and its different ranks.
---
Good plan tbh, try to get WW axe as fast as possible when you are leveling him, that keeps you up to date for a LONG time.
---
Yeah transmog was cata
---
Tbf, pre-10 levelling as hunter is pretty painful as well. Probably even worse than warrior imo.
---
Have you actually played during vanilla? Or is your only experience post TBC or private servers?
---
You may be right. The way I see layering, it is a more permanent version of Sharding. So technically in the early zone if you set similar settings it should have similar experience.
---
It's quite literally not misleading.  We are in July, next month is August.  Classic releases in August.  OP isn't saying we're 31 days or less away.
---
I run it on my 17" laptop from MSI as well, performance is great with BfA under DX11 with a GTX 1060 in that.
---
Remember, Lutris is just a manager for all those games &amp; WINE instances, it's the easy selection of different WINE runners and install scripts via the website that make it a powerful tool.
---
It already runs pretty damn well. I did notice my cpu usage across cores looked a bit more skewed compared to running retail bfa client.
---
It won’t.
---
For this reason I really wonder what's going to happen if Classic turns out to be popular. I'd imagine that at least a few high profile servers will retain or even grow their player counts going into phase 2. So what happens when Blizzard is committed to remove layering for a server that has been allowed to bloat up to 3-10x the normal player count? Suddenly, everyone is forced onto a single layer and players are introduced to massive login queues?
---
I've always preferred the idea of treating separate layers more like individual servers. No hopping back and forth between layers and manually merge layers as needed. Sure, it will cost a bit more server-wise, but we're still talking about rather minor expenses and it's absolutely doable.
---
Uhh, not like warlocks at all. The pre bwl gear is pretty amazing and it's quite easy to top dps meters on most bosses in MC and on Onyxia as a warlock.
---
yes, that's what he said
---
You have to consider that Pallys can perma dispel your dots fears and are way harder to fight than shamans. It’s also better to be an ally lock Pve wise, you’ll gear up faster and be more needed.
---
I still can’t decide between gnome and orc though
---
I'm a lvl 21 warr and I had the luxury of getting a Taskmaster's Axe and Emberstone Staff. Should I still choose Staff of Westfall as quest reward or should i go for the legs instead?
---
Weren't Black Lotus's BoP originally?
---
Make Black Lotus BoP for the first several weeks.

/thread
---
Reminder: nobody likes these posts
---
Even as a warrior on a pserver (granted that changes things), but I was only 30g short of my mount at lvl 38. 
---
Vendors everything, bought 1 or 2 vendor weapons, careful with my skills, vendored a ton of left over cooking food at a profit.
---
I agree it's not as bad as people make it seem.
---
Considering the optimal number of shamans per raid is around 5-8, it won't be hard assuming you're not bad at healing and you also have a healer set -- which is essentially mandatory for anyone looking to raid as a shaman.
---
I think you are confused.
---
Are you incapable of basic math? 3k per layer, 50% per faction. 1500 and 3 starting zones. So its going to be 500 ppl in the same zone regardless.
---
It's a new laptop (2018) and it was like $900 or something. Good processor and SSD. Problem is it uses integrated graphics of Intel UHD 620.
---
It runs the 1.12 client very well on private servers, but people keep saying that the requirements for actual Classic will be the same as Battle for Azeroth because it will run on the same client/engine.
---
I wouldn't count a handful of zealots on a niche community like Reddit as "many".
---
Yeah, it runs great. I'm just pushing it far beyond what they intended and that obviously causes issues sometimes. But it's so cool being able to see every object in Mulgore from the top of Thunder Bluff.
---
Layering is 100 percent required for launch man.
---
&gt; edit: literally unplayable.
---
Thanks for working that in there.
---
Layering does add more servers on demand, I will concede that. It could also be done manually to add more REALMS instead of layers as they did in 2005.
---
Has anyone other than Tipsout said so? How do we know he's not just making some bad assumptions based off of limited experiences?
---
Asking honestly. The only thing I ever saw was his tweet just saying that it's there. I don't even remember seeing an explanation as to how he came by this info.
---
Playing on Nostalrius, I didn't have to buy a mount since I played a warlock, but I could've afforded one at level 40. And I spent zero effort farming gold. Actually, I wasted a ton of money on cloth to level first aid.
---
&gt; Yeah layering is bad but it is what it is
---
I still think it's bad reasoning to use layering when the "one world" is such a big part of what defines vanilla wow.
---
Probably 80% of this sub at least
---
Lol. Oh you own the thread now? Not exactly how this works. 
---
You put the title as xxxx should xxxx. What were you expecting?
---
Can I ask. Why not on a macbook?
---
no, you are weak 
---
.
---
Duo-leveling is almost always faster, especially with the best leveling class, though I think you'd be better off with a healer. And yes, you can absolutely tank 5 mans with any spec, you just throw on a sword and board and you're good to go.
---
Well, those 'many' are wrong. Layering means a much more consistent environment than sharding and server merges are bad press and create huge naming headaches.
---
I like to call it temporary relapsing.
---
i quit in 2011. There was no soul left in the game for me. LFG, flying mounts everywhere, easy epics...fuck that. I'm super excited, if not obsessed, about classic coming out. I want the community feel, and immersion into the various zones. I want to experience running to dungeons again.
---
I'll do my best to create more like this. I try to only include macros that I think are useful to everyone and it takes a lot of testing to compile a good list.
---
Oh look a retail playing tourist who isn’t concerned about the economy or health of the game in the long term, so long as he can log in and instantly get his dopamine fix before he quits in 2 weeks.
---
Yeah - but he launched an MMO in 2004 without layering. So it was literally unplayable! Clearly doesn't know what he is talking about as WoW was an unmitigated failure due to its lack of layering. 
---
(/s)
---
i figure it will be similar to this, but assuming you're on layer 3 in your example, i hope blizz gives a warning like "in 5 minutes this layer will collapse into another". otherwise anyone in the middle of combat or a quest in layer 3 is going to be mad when they get moved
---
Nothing is funny about this
---
Nah, it’s a thing streamers are doing as a click bait meme
---
Disc priest power infusion is pretty dope, tbh.
---
If I ever caught myself typing "pepehands" I'd seriously have to kick my own ass. Imagine a female seeing you type that. Hard cringe.
---
Look at this literal thread. The top post for instance.
---
He is suggesting layering with a different name, and no cross layer communication.  The idea is that they would all still share the same unique name lockout, and AH.   You would just be locked to your layer though.  You can't join another layer or talk to the people of another layer.
---
No it won't
---
Hey I don't really feel like arguing semantics but heres the definition 
---
&gt;Juxtaposition - the fact of two things being seen or placed close together with contrasting effect.
---
AFAIK top guilds still sold raid slots and sold items like Perdition blade, etc.
---
Guilds still wanted to run MC for some alts / sulfuras or thunderfury but already had the items like T1 pieces etc so just invited people and then sold items for gold. It was a great way for geared guilds to "farm" gold.
---
When the stuff is on farm most guilds will bring a few non guildies in to sell gear if no one needs an item, all the money goes to the guild bank
---
It happens lol
---
Yeah but stress tests are not indicative of the true experience. They are trying to purposefully stress out the server by allowing as many as they can on the layer. So with this in mind it is likely that they will over time reduce the amounts closer to launch with each test. This way they can find the level/amount of people they want per layer. If each server is 3000 people like a lot have said. Then breaking it down roughly to 1500 a side, 500 a zone. They could have 5 100 person layers or break it down further and have 10 50 person layers per opening zone. This is if they hold a 3k pop and if all was equal in terms of ally/horde. So even if this made up example was true it would be potentially tricky with 49 other people in your area. No matter what there will be mob competition and the initial launch will be crowded. Its just HOW crowded it will be and we will only know in time with more stress tests/at launch.
---
Yeah exactly. In that case I think it was at around 45 but he is racing and advocating not even looting all mobs etc.
---
exactly. 
---
overpopulation is still an issue on launch.
---
layering is only here to help with tourist issue. in its current form it's terribly exploitable. 
---
you should be prompted to select layer after picking a server, and layer hopping should be not allowed.
---
any form of layer hopping will be abused crazily by the first guilds to hit 60, and that takes only 6 days as we've seen on pservers. 
---
people are seriously underestimating the damages here
---
Ok buddy
---
Yeah, my biggest gripe about layering isn't fears of it being exploited (though it certainly will be), it's just the simple math of laying starting zones, where everyone is split into 6 zones (3 per faction), at the same rate as you're layering later zones where everyone is split into 10+ zones for any character level. There don't need to be 3 different Orgrimmars and 3 different EPL
---
Warrior is the true story arc of WoW, from weakling to unstoppable train of death
---
Maraudon will be phase 1
---
layering doesn't help with the initial launch. it doesn't do a damn thing for the initial rush. it's not meant to be sharding replicated. 
---
it's ONLY meant to help once people leave, merging servers.
---
why are there so many retail idiots in this sub right now?
---
A bit less than half :P A mount does not give a 100% movement speed bonus, at which point traveling time would be halved.
---
I barely get 60 fps on 50% resolution scale in an empty zone on my 2015 MacBook.
---
Whats that command again?
---
Respectful discourse or none at all. Good bye.
---
Layering is bad, think of the children it will turn them Hom....... PLEASE stop BLIZZ before it ruins the world .
---
The lack of effort that was put into this post required the same lack of effort in reply.
---
This was fairly common, particularly as people have noted in regards to molten core and onyxia. Very few people did BWL on my server so I didn't hear of too many BWL carries.
---
The really tricky part is whether or not you would charge someone just to show up or if you would charge them only in the event an item dropped.
---
No. This topic needs to fuck off already.
---
I really, really enjoyed transmogging in Legion. I played in WotLK and then skipped until Legion. T-mogging was so fun and everyone in your guild usually looked pretty fly. 
---
I understand the appeal of the gear you’re wearing being the gear that is displayed but I also see the other side. 
---
I’m just ready for classic.
---
For the horde!! ❤️❤️
---
I started in classic but took my sweet time leveling to 60 and only got there 2 months before BC hit. Had a blast with what I got to experience though.  
---
I loved BC, it was my prime time in WoW. however flying mounts always bothered me because they took away from the world and only hurt open world PvP. Aside from flying mounts, overall I thought BC was a great expansion. Though looking back, there are other things that weren't super great. If I recall correctly, after outlands came out, there wasn't much reason to go back to the old continents aside from major cities. Which left them not feeling as alive as they use to be. Dailies were introduced. Which while I don't think they were too terrible in BC (I know at least netherwing had the repeatable egg rep quest) became really bad as the expansions progressed. I hate FOMO. There's prolly others but dailies and the lose of reason to visit old continents are prolly my top 2 slippery slopes that immediately came to mind. Flying mounts were just flat out a bad idea.  
---
I played for awhile in WotLK but it just didn't feel the same as it use to for me. I don't specifically remember what started me feeling this way, but the nail in the coffin was when my guild went into Ulduar on release and cleared over half of it day 1. I was use to hard raid content and was looking forward to progression. But the ease of it just killed it for me. Granted I've heard that its actually an amazing raid with the hard modes but I never experienced that. So after that first day of raiding Ulduar I quit.  
---
I came back and tried Cata but I only made it to the new max level before I got tired of it again. The game just didn't feel the same as it use to and none of the changes gave me a reason to keep playing.  
---
I also tried MoP. That got me a little bit longer than Cata as I was playing with friends but again I just wasn't feeling it and some of their design choices just killed any desire to play (LFR).  
---
Apparently I played a bit of WoD as well. I totally forgot about it until I logged into retail last week. I caved and did a sub for the stress test. I logged on my old main toon and he was in his garrison. Again, the game just isn't what it used to be and I realized it never would be again. So at this point I quit for good and haven't tried an expansion since.  
---
Classic and BC were the prime to me and always will be. Though I do know both have their flaws. But I cant wait to go back to classic.
---
It hurts too much. It's all I can think about.
---
My birthday is next week but I just want to skip the entire month so august comes faster. I wish I could just sleep until character reservation day then sleep til launch. My body is ready.
---
The rest of my life isn't.
---
I like them. They are important to raise awareness about the most important issue for Vanilla.
---
Who could have ever thought that the main concern about official vanilla servers in 2019 would be f-ing phasing of all things...
---
Imagine tailoring your life around what women think. That’s why you never get laid, son.
---
People are acting like the server populations are going to be in the twenty thousands.
---
You probably didn't pick up skinning, skinning is the edge that would've pushed you to a mount at 40 so long as you do all the things you said you did properly.
---
Here take this downvote
---
You sick bastard that took me to twitch
---
Lightning Shield on all shamans, Fire Nova totem at 12 and 22, after 32 you get Chain Lightning. Also have the benefit of earthbind to keep mobs grouped up. It's not the best cleave, for sure, but it's pretty decent. Every shaman single targets while the totem is firing then puts down another totem after it goes off.
---
People are addicted now with the current technology...imagine in 50 years with full immersion in all ways possible. Going to be interesting discussions about life and addiction.
---
Taurens can only ride Kodos and wolves, correct? Does anyone remember how they look on wolves and the wolves become a bit bigger to fit them, is that right
---
Yes that's why I said I'm not sure what it's like.  I'm hoping the layer size is smaller than what the stress test was because all the quests that were like "fetch these items that are dropped by these specific humanoids" were overflowing with people.
---
Well, fair enough. Thanks for the insight. The point about pservs launch no layering is spot on.
---
You can look up raids by &lt;easy&gt; on the various trackers and notice they had a top 10 ele Shaman that also put down totems when hunting boss records.
---
Server queues......
---
Dynamic respawns.......
---
The fixes are already there but Blizzard wants to go with the most non-classic and cheapest solution.
---
If I am questing in STV with Thunderfury and I hear a Rogue stealth? I am not worried a damn bit.
---
You are not cool for posting this.
---
We do not need reminders.
---
You are not special, because Classic will not be killed.
---
Found your reply interesting because i had the opposite impression from my time in Vanilla as a EU player. Had to check it out and according to the realm list i found EU had ~60 pvp english speaking pvp realms compared to ~40 pve. Only had time to count one US region and there i found slightly more pve realms. So i guess we europeans just were much more into the pvp aspect of the game?
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Realms_list
---
we've already seen how this can be gamed. their intent was to give us actual Classic too, and people vanishing layers and farming 60 resources is not the intent.
---
layer hopping shouldn't be allowed, ever. You should be forced to pick layer once you choose server, and it stays that way until layer merging.
---
&gt;You can't join another layer or talk to the people of another layer.
---
So separate realms.
---
Lol, ok. Didn't know there was insane people like that.
---
Rogue Druid b/c of stealth
---
 Hunter Lock b/c of pets
---
Shaman Paladin because of easy self sustain and tons of room for error. Bonus points to shaman for astral recall &amp; Ghost wolf.
---
Mage is a solid honorable mention due to portals and general usefulness. 
---
Really the only poor choice is warrior and maybe priest, interestingly. No mobility or qol skills to be able to instantly take a break while super casual.
---
D E D
---
Better than the "anti-layering" folks who have no ability to offer any better alternative other than throwing a tantrum like a toddler. It's impressive how immature you folks can be.
---
Differential layers are in simple words nothing more than different servers and merge them afterwards... if I see someone appearing or disappearing I am going to quit and won't look back
---
then you get to 60 and warriors outdps you by a mile and can also tank.
---
Hahah then throws the "roll a paladin or warlock" I laughed so hard man.
---
Oh fuck off. The mentality of “unless you personally have a beginning-to-end plan, you cant criticize at all” is beyond stupid

I will definitely be rolling a Male Troll Mage as my main. I don’t really care about missing out on WotF. I mained Male Undead Priest back in vanilla with a Female Undead Rogue alt so I’m looking for a change this time. For an alt this time I’m going Warrior. Not sure what race yet.
---
its sad you are downvoted. this sub truly has become filled with blizzard white knights and retail fanboys.
---
case in point: almost all these new people think layering is being implemented to alleviate the initial rush.
---
fml
---
Regular people like you and I aren't giving them views. We are already going to buy and play the game. These big name streamers give them views and access to potential players that aren't already invested in the franchise. There is no incentive for them to invite more players. Here is another mind blowing concept for you, they care less about beta testing than they do advertising.
---
a few ideas, lasagna casserole, chicken brocoli casserole are good easy slap together options that are quick and easy.  Oven bake and proportion (or just leave it in the pan lol) and fridge it for week one.  
---
Slow cooker chili or bratwursts with kraut or coleslaw. Things that require a few hours too cook but are zero effort after assembly.
---
I hate to tell you this, but by internet standards this IS a respectful discourse.
---
I even told you about the beta having group bonuses to XP.
---
I am above average intellectually and I have no clue what you are suggesting ....
---
Supplying Engi is particularly nice because so much of the mats are used to create consumables, and are therefore almost always in demand. Herbalism is similar, whereas leatherworking or blacksmithing work differently.
---
I care a lot about who get world first. The amount of dedication and preparation to get that once in a lifetime classic world first will be astonishing.
---
I wouldn't call it extremely unhealthy. If you are generally a healthy person there's no impact long term.
---
That suggestion is just layering without allowing people to cross communicate, and requires more micromanagement. Bad idea. It also fucks with the sense of community and the economy far more than regular layering. More micormanagement also means dead servers. It will take time for blizz to merge things, if they have to do it manually.
---
Another issue you will have is that people will join certain servers/yaers far more than others. People will be drawn to 1-2 more than 5-6. 5-6 will be dead in no time. In contrast, server 1 will be insanely overcrowded. If you make it "full", then you have the issue of splitting up people that want to play together.
---
I've played TBC, WotLK, then came back in late WoD, played through Legion and stopped around september last year. 
---
I'm really excited to get that vanilla experience for the first time, though I doubt I will play hardcore.
---
Sure, but I think this leads to the reason sharding came about in the first place - servers eventually dying and needing to be merged/deprecated. This solution would work if they offered free transfers, etc. but I'm not too confident in that.
---
The reason the layering idea came about is so that they wouldn't have too many servers and that leading to server deaths which would lead to an experience that is considered 'un-authentic': no socialization and no meaningful content progression. I think both of these are huge problems - one happens more at the beginning and trails off over time whereas one is an increasingly relevant problem as classic gets older. I don't think the solution is entirely Layering, but I don't think hosting more servers is the whole solution either. It just defers a similar problem to a later date.
---
I quit during burning crusade, but it wasnt like I was raiding or anything, I was lvl 52. 
---
At that point I was around 10. None of my friends played it so I spent most of my time on the xbox 360. 
---
Now me and one of my friends will play classic, but I know that even if he didnt I'd still play the shit out of it when it comes out. I tried to get back into it by Cata but it was too late, most of the stuff I loked about the game was either changed or removed.
---
I quit when they added transmog and LFR. To be fair, I was already getting bored with Cataclysm, but those two things were the killing blow. I did come back temporarily in MoP and Legion, but both times I just leveled up, did some heroics, did a single LFR raid, and quit.
---
I luv ranting about wow, I quitted back in WOTLK. absolutely loved vanilla. Played through TBC and got max level in WOTLK. The game pace and game focus was changing with each expansion. Less world pvp, less talking, more repetition. Arena's shrinked what battlegrounds already shrinked more which means you did less and less variety, All new spells where near instant cast or low cast time thus completely changing the feel of gameplay. Dungeons felt more like carnival rides and less like exploration/memorizing/nagivation.  Overall gameplay felt more dumbed down.
---
After I quit in WOTLk way back then I remember looking back to see how WoW was holding up in mists of pandaria, first thing i fucking saw was the female panda and went LUL
---
honestly man, this is further evidence of how this sub has gone to shit.
---
all these new retail fanboys and blizzard white knights have appeared in this sub suddenly, and they all defend layering, *and they all think layering is to help with the initial rush*.
---
they have no idea how bad the 60 economy will be screwed by layer hopping as well. fucking morons are ruining the game for us before it has even launched. blizz is a joke
---

The best thing that alliance warlocks have over horde ones is paladin. They are just so massively good to play alongside with, that alliance warlocks are imo better at everything in comparison to their horde counterparts with the notable exception of 1v1s.
---
Contrary to popular opinion, warlocks actually aren't that reliant on fears, they just absolutely wreck people. Here's a video that illustrates the point quite well:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR-2HDV6bYA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SR-2HDV6bYA)  (just mute it, for your own sake).
---
Alliance warlocks also only have to deal with 1 class (priests) to dispel the source of most of their damage (depending on spec, of course) while paladins make it incredibly hard for anything to really stick on your targets as a horde warlock.
---
I'd much rather go up against shamans as a warlock than having paladins on the other team, is what it comes down to.
---
This is looking even worse and worse for our boy SolidJade here.
---
I have no interest in getting to level 60 before first week MC lockout but I will definitely be there for the second week.
---
These continued posts is what will kill Classic.
---
Server queues are not a fix. They're the problem. Anyone who thinks that its a solution is anti-player.
---
As someone who has played EverQuest TLPs extensively (basically the equivalent of classic WoW) I can tell you attrition is the #1 killer of any server. It's actually crazy how much attrition hits, especially when a new server gets released. Everyone bails on the old server, it becomes a ghost town, people move to the new server, rinse and repeat....
---
Layering is a necessary evil. It will give the illusion that the server is still bopping 6 months down the road well after when layering is removed.
---
Example: Let's say you have 10 servers with 5k people on each server, no layering. Attrition rate is 70% (yes it really is that high). In 6 months, each server will only have 1500 people. That's a pretty steep drop and will be very noticed. Now let's say we have 5 servers at 10k people each, with 2 layers. That's 5k per layer, the exact same as the server without layering. 6 months goes by, layering is gone. Population drop is 70%. You're left with 3k people on 1 server, double the other server. Clearly the server will more people has more longevity than the 1500 population.
---
This is a very rough napkin math example but I hope it illustrates why layering is needed.
---
tl;dr: Nobody wants to play on a dead server.
---
Uhhh layering actually makes it unplayable. Vanilla WoW was playable and didn't have layering. The plethora of vanilla private servers I played on were playable and didn't have layering. There is absolutely no reason or justification whatsoever for layering. All the fixes for massive population surge currently exist and would maintain the integrity of the game and ensure the true classic feeling and experience. Layering shits all over the classic feeling and experience.
---
How does layering NOT help on launch? I do not understand your perspective. It creates separate layers of people from within the same pool. It IS sharding just from a set amount of people, all of which are on the same server. You clearly do not understand how it operates.
---
&gt;Buy more servers.
---
Layers are basically servers.  Servers are digital now...
---
It's playable on private servers because they are relatively tiny in population and have easy-mode mechanics like dynamic respawns so that players can have a nice comfy questing experience. Private servers players would rage hard if they had to deal with life without crutches like dynamic respawns.
---
No i cant
---
&gt;Thanks for everyone's help yesterday with my question about getting a NE mount as a gnome. This community is awesome.
---
I'm sorry, you must be mistaken. Everyone always says it's toxic. In fact, everything on reddit is toxic garbage and everyone who posts there is the worst.
---
Layering is automatic and I think a week or two in there will only be one layer ...... with the exception of few servers (streamers, legacy names, RNG)
---
&gt;Yeah I mean if the lock is bad and doesn’t kite while throwing up dots maybe that searing totem will be relevant,
---
You just keep using r1 searing if they're putting in effort to kill/range it. The pushback combined with a fast auto attack is extremely strong
---
I agree lock has the advantage, but it's not an unwinnable matchup vs average players, if they don't manage to set up a good casting window with coil/spell-lock you can wear them down.
---
Layering. Is. Not. Meant. To. Alleviate. The. Initial. Launch.
---
How many times do we have to say it?
---
Layering does nothing for the initial launch, it only fixes the issue of tourists leaving. You are still going to have 500 people in Northshire fighting for wolves.
---
Blizzard fucked us mate

HotW Druid, you are a versatile healer in BGs with the added bonus of being an amazing FC or Babysitter in AB/AV. Get access to a lot of abilities through cat/bear in addition to your own spells, plus you have insane mobility. In PvE HotW is more than enough as Resto talents aren't that great anyway. Added benefit of being able to tank your 5 Mans if you need to and being a good decurse bot in raids which is a very useful thing for raids to have, all of this being whenever you don't want to heal of course (lot of option as you can see).

Well I wasn't planning to downvote today..... guess that ended quickly
---
one of the few people who actually watched the video
---
I see minor shadow resistance that’s in no way game breaking, even undead get +10.
---
What am I missing?
---
Who owns a laptop and still has the sticker on it? What kind of animal are you?
---
Nah youre right
---
First of all, thanks for your replies. 
---
Then, I'm interested in your take on the following:
---
&gt;In a vacuum, it is good (but not very good for warriors). Certainly good, though. The issue with it is that it is the most popular guide. People that have the same pace as you will use it. You will notice that and it leads to traffic jams.
---
That's true. I guess if I'm bottlenecked by people I'll just roam a bit and just mindlessly grind mobs until I'm at the requested XP and skip the quest or smth. Probably will loose some time, but the guide is here to have a general direction.  
---
&gt;The key is probably being able to adapt and not tunnel vision on steps of the guide. Then again, some steps you really don’t want to skip because they lead to chains and are the reason why the guide leads you to some areas. You might get into a zone where you should do 7 quests but find yourself only with 1-2! Knowing which can be skipped requires research and/or experience.  
---
Yep, I know the guide can only do so much in a crowded zone. I'll adapt and reattach to it later on or smth.  
---
&gt;20 is not easier as a warrior and dual wielding is generally not advised. The rough phase is around lvls 18-30. Once you are 30 you get sweeping strikes and you should absolutely respec into arms at that point. Fury is generally only advised past level 20 if you are able to time a /sit macro properly.
---
Well, fuck. I thought that DW would help, with the points in fury. Guess I'll try this on the pserv to see how wrong I am lol.  
---
Also, even if an arms respec can be beneficial, I don't know if I can endure the 3. something swing time of this spec. Will try on pserv for sure.  
---
I really thought Fury was "OK" as soon as you got dual wield and like 20 points in it to get some good talents.  
---
&gt;Keep in mind that leveling as warrior on classic is much easier and you will have a much easier time than on any of the two relevant pservers. Players would rely on hamstring and they agree it is for the most part no longer needed.
---
Hunt your key weapons.  
---
Well, good for me I guess. About the mob levels, I can only try, don't know where the guide will take me.  
---
But I sure will keep it in mind.  
---
I kinda know about the weapons, warr beind so dependent on it.
---
Yeah even in my made up example layer sizes could be a problem for flow. So I am in the same boat, I hope they make small layer sizes to allow for easy questing early. We will see in time though!
---
&gt;There is a fixed number of people
---
&gt;*fixed*
---
It's not a percentage of the population, because it's independent of the population as a whole. That's why I brought up the sprinting contest, because the number of people in the world that can sprint 100m below 10s is fixed (in the short run, pun not intended), and no matter how many people you bring into the tournament, it is astronomically unlikely that there is even a single person in the world that can sprint that fast without already being part of the sprinting community. Just as it is astronomically unlikely that a "tourist" starts the game in August for the first time and starts building a Black Lotus monopoly on his server a few days later. Impossible? Not quite. Likely? No fucking way.
---
i'm no expert but i believe once the VPN is set up it will be funny encrypted - but until you're setup im not so sure
---
Just Audacity - it's robust and free. That's all you really need for this kind of project. I went to school for audio editing, so I know a few tricks about sound quality that might help.
---
If you still want to just use OBS, that's fine - get something called an "equalizer" plugin for it. I use "VST RealEQ (Realplugs edition) for my OBS. Then, mess around with the settings a bit and try different recordings. 
---
Here's an article about Equalizing, if you are interested. Essentially, you're just boosting the register of your voice, and cutting out the "bad parts" - or at least, making them quieter.
---
https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/eq-explainer/4/
---
And if you get the equalizer, here is pictures of what my set up looks like. You just make 4 bands, and copy paste the settings I put in. That will help quite a bit!
---
https://imgur.com/a/iR7j3Us
---
If you decide to use Audacity, there is a tool you can called "equalizer," and you can use the same settings in that as you did here.
---
Hope to see more videos soon!
---
Not only did they sell carries but they'd also put shit on "reserve" or just straight up ninja it to give gear to someone in their guild/gf/whatever.
---
We sold set pieces and the hunter and priest legendary weapons.  For the set pieces I think you were there the whole run and got whatever.  For the legendary weapons we would just pull people in for that boss and you only paid if it dropped.  For the other non-set stuff I don't think we ever sold it because someone always wanted it - even if it was just for an alt.
---
What I saw way more than carries was bidding gold for items and then the gold was distributed among the other members (or guild).
---
How does layering shatter server communities more than the other options people suggest like server brackets etc.
---
Dynamic Respawns and systems like it aren't classic they are Private Server. Not all of us played Private servers and thus don't want it.
---
The entire community can't be destablized if the layer population is the same as a standard server 2.5k or 3k (the issue comes with smaller layers) as the volume of high end resources would correspond with the player volume.
---
Layering works by layering a world not a single zone which would be a shard - if you layer/shard by zone then you won't be able to see across a zone border which is even worse than layering.
---
So we only have a few choices and each of them has its issues:
---
Dynamic Respawns - Leads to exploits and environmental effects that isn't like the original.
---
Server Merging/Server Blocks - Which will cause the same issues it did back in the day, which is degradation of community and clashes when different common standing emerge.
---
Layering - massive backfire if the servers don't drop to like 2.5k to 3k pop. It does however allow a community to interact together which brings communities together - with the recent rumoured changes it may also reduce the seen manipulation.
---
&gt;vendor the crafted items for 2-3 times the value of the mats.
---
doesn't really work like this
---
&gt; Can't go wrong with dual gathering
---
Except with bag space. RIP.
---
&gt; Some blizzard lies in the past:
---
If you are taking this stance, why are you even playing Classic at all? Blizzard could release paid level 60s after launch. Or implement a "Pay cash for BiS gear" mechanic. Or they could personally come to your house and punch you in the face.
---
The possibilities are literally endless if we want to play the game of "What might Blizzard be lying about?" game.
---
I didn’t play much mop, no legion besides launch month and quit end December in bfa. I just want to play with my best friend, explore together, old talent trees etc. I started originally in February 2007
---
He had me at "Oh"
---
With the continued releases of expansions after TBC, my subscriptions experienced diminishing returns and glancing blows.
---
Phasing, layering, instancing, sharding.
---
It doesn't matter what you decide to name it because it is the same thing applied in different ways.
---
Hunter/Mage will always be the best farming class. Hunter because Feign Death/Pet shenanigans are really powerful in addition to being less gear dependent. Mage because they have tons of utility spells and great AoE. When looking at farming these two will ALWAYS be the best, however Rogue/Druid can do some cool stuff and a lot of classes can AoE farm in Dire Maul (just not as fast as a Hunter/Mage).
---
Personal opinion is that Hunter is the king. You can solo farm Mara early in P1 and then solo DM:T in P2.
---
I sell items in stacks of 5 or 10 if they're really common (like copper ore), and anything that amounts to less than that gets listed singly.
---
Buying individual items is not necessarily more economical. I often sell individual items or smaller stacks at a higher price-per-item. You might be surprised how many people will pay more per item to get only 5 because the lump sum is still less than buying 20 of the same item. It doesn't matter that they can just re-sell the excess (even at a higher price and profit a little), most players don't want to.
---
You seem really knowledgeable on Raiding Boomkins - do you play on pservers?  
---
Does the casters' dream group of 4 casters + Boomkin make up for the lost DPS that you would gain from any other class?  That wording may be convoluted.. Does the Raid's DPS increase with a group of 4 Mages/1 Boomkin? or is the Raid's DPS better with just another DPS class?
---
Strange. I can scroll through the different versions and select classic. Then I downloaded roughly 6GB
---
Server queues, buying more servers, dynamic mob respawns (mobs spawn faster based off the amount of players in the immediate area)
---
All those alternatives preserve the classic feel and experience.
---
Yep. I tried leveling Warrior as my first character on a fresh pserver, and it was absolutely atrocious. Never again. Only time I'm ever leveling another Warrior is as an alt, with tons of gold to deck him out in blues.
---
For real. And pserver subreddits are leagues better. This place is filled with retail fanboys and blizzard white knights who actually still think that layering is there to alleviate the initial rush. They actually don't even know what it's for, and they're voicing an opinion on it.
---
God, I loved everything about the Captain unit in WC3.
---
Yeah its 3 levels not 1 like he said. So lvl 63 v lvl 60 essentially for stealth.
---
End game wpvp shenanigans is the best part of the game.  A 100v100 brawl over a world boss is better than anything 1-59
---
I quit because I had to join the army in 2007.
---
In many cases, yes.  But in this case, no.
---
I quit after Legion and I'm so excited to get back to the roots of what made this game great.  I can't wait to level an Undead priest again and heal in raids.  I may also create a Paladin to see what healing was like on the other side with another class.
---
&gt; Yes, we know. Layering is there to cater to the selfish people like you.
---
Says the guy demanding Blizzard personalize his Classic experience to his specific demands.
---
It was until it wasn't, and you're wrong. I have had plenty of civil discourse on the internet, and you ain't it.
---
The only reason attrition kills a server is that private servers are continually building new ones. obviously people want to build their next characters on them. If we had a fixed number in the official WoW, and no new ones, then no attrition, just a continuous supply of new characters until the the end of history
---
Nah, it’s very disputable. On top of the changes they just put in that invalidate most of that and the changes they will undoubtedly further make as we approach release it’s not really going to be a big deal. And if some people still find a way to exploit it Blizzard will probably just ban them and reverse any transactions. They totally have that ability, you know.
---
To your first point, I'm only talking about hardcore guilds. To the second point, I don't think you can complete naxxramas and still call yourselves a casual guild.
---
Blizzard has already addressed layer hopping by putting a timer in between when you can move to a new layer. I understand why it's frustrating but layering truly is a necessary evil. Trust me I've played the alternative in EverQuest (they have their own version of TLPs) and it's truly horrendous.
---
There is no need to allow layer hopping though.
---
You can let people choose layer once they choose server, they are locked to layer, and then merge layers after tourists leave. Done.
---
Layer hopping is the death of immersion in Classic, the rise of exploitation, and the beginning of World of Layer Hopping.
---
Well there's that...
---
So what people usually eat?
---
Leveling a warrior isn't hard if you do it right. You just need to keep your gear up to date, which is easy if you tank dungeons.
---
Anyone willing to tank is going to have a super easy time finding groups.
---
Try doing any quests when you have 49 other level 1 humans killing every single Kobold Virmin, with a bunch just trying to play solo.
---
Ultima: Online had very much the same issue with it's original ecology system. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFNxJVTJleE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFNxJVTJleE)
---
they can heal just as well or prob better  as a elemental shaman .
---
100% hunter. Your pet can tank great, but the most important skill: feign death. If things aren't going well you can just reset the fight. If you happen to get aggro, just feign. You'll pretty much never die.
---
Ignore people saying warlock. The voidwalker is a horrible tank. It can't hold aggro at all. You have no thread reset, so if you get threat it's over. I'd put Paladin and even Druid above Warlock. But Hunter beats them all by a mile.
---
I feel like that's not entirely my fault. Something tells me you think it is.
---
Orc on a felsteed = fat kid on a pony.
---
\+1 orc
---
Hope you learned your lesson. Never group with virgin minmaxers, Chad Casuals will accept all.
---
They don't know that. But it it does happen, then server merge. Bam, extremely easy fix that doesn't hurt the classic experience as much as layering does. Layering is literally the most extreme, non-classic, gamebreaking fix to this problem. Soooo many other routes they could go that would impact the experience much less.
---
I quit BFA and only intend to play classic. Try again
---
What are the recommended specs for playing wow classic?
---
I love people whining about economy in a basic as hell theme park mmo.
---
Like the economic system had My depth
---
You know that his stream is being watched by current Blizzard employees too? If he tells them how to fix the issue, he's providing his skills and knowledge to them for free, without them having to pay him anything or employ him. 
---
He's rightfully looking out for himself by not telling them how exactly to fix the issue. But he's still providing insight as to what he perceives to be issues anyway, thankfully.
---
 If they want him to tell them how to fix it, they better treat him like a dev and pay up or employ him if he wants that.
---
you're a dumbass. you're yet another person who thinks layering fixes the initial rush. it doesn't. you're still in northshire with 500 people on your layer. layering is for tourists.
---
do some research for 5 mins before you spout your bullshit and defend layering. there's so many of you idiots on this sub you're ruining our game for the rest of us.
---
Probably because it’s not phasing like in retail, and y’all are just a bunch of Fox News style fearmongers. Every post I see about it is just misinformation.
---
It’s a necessary solution to a temporary problem. Then it’s gone. Best case scenario.
---
Can't tell if trolling or serious.
---
I can't even bother responding to these guys anymore.
---
The fact that most of them believe layering is meant to combat the initial rush is just proof they have no clue what they're talking about.
---
I quit because it just wasn't the same game anymore. I played from shortly after launch til a month after cata launched. 
---
I was starting to get really weary of things even during wrath. I remember everyone being so pumped about LFG, but I knew it was a bad thing. Nobody believed me. I had seen it before - when they made LFG chat global it had changed the dynamic of the game big time, but it was acceptable at the time. But I knew that the looking for group system would be a million times worse. Playing with randoms you never speak to again totally degrades the social experience. 
---
Dailies were another thing I really hated. It's complicated why but as soon as I encountered them I disliked them.
---
The easy raiding in wrath was a big turn off and I knew it would only get worse. Heirloom items pissed me off big time too, they made huge swathes of content irrelevant.
---
But the biggest thing that make me quit Cata was simply that everything was changed. It was not the same game I had played for the past few years. Even making a character there was no way for me to go back and experience the old content. Transmogs existing the way they do was infuriating. I wouldn't have minded them so much if other people couldn't see them - if everyone saw what gear you really had on that would be fine, but the fact that everyone could see your rainbow pimpsuit was insulting. Why even bother getting the good stuff if anyone can look like they have it? Plus, transmogs make it so you can't tell at a glance how tough your target is. Those two things were the final straws. I quit and never looked back.
---
But once i heard vanilla was coming out, everything was forgiven. I can't wait to go back and play one of my favorite games the way I love it. Vanilla was my favorite time to play wow, and I know I'm gonna have a blast. I love challenging games, I love the feeling of accomplishment when you do something difficult. I love seeing other people have things I don't, because it gives me motivation to get better and get those awesome items. I'm so excited
---
I was actually just curious what the other alternatives were, guess can’t expect anything less than a venemous response from the vanilla community tho
---
I quit like 4 times. I got antsy though, and resubbed in June. Getting my fix while waiting for launch,
---
True true. If the casual guild is slogging through raids then it's going to drag out raid times across the board
---
....
---
I played seriously from Vanilla thru Cata and tried Pandaria (not a fan), and quit. Returned for about 50 hours or so of WoD and then quit again and haven't returned since.  
---
I will be coming back for Classic though, and I can't remember the last time I was this excited for a game.
---
Some players want to clear naxx instead of running wailing caverns
---
People won't disappear, unless you or them jump layers.
---
Yeah this was common to see. An UBRS tank would likely have blue items all the 45+ 5mans as well.
---
Borean Tundra is the worst zone for me to this day. The only expansion I have missed completely while it was current was cata. And that's because I was leveling an alt in borean, got so bored just thinking about the terrible experience it was going to be, then logged out for 2 1/2 years.
---
Originally We did collect outfit gear and then swap to the higher powered armor for serious combat situations when they might arise. There was more cool dungeon drops and choices in bc.
---
I mean they keep giving different answers about RP-PvP the last semi-major interview said it was being considered.
---
Mage has the most quality of life mechanics i.e. portals &amp; conjures. They're S tier in every aspect of the game.
---
Holy Paladin or Ele/Resto Shaman are both great options as they're heavily desired and very strong. Ele Shaman is additionally one of the easiest classes to gear.
---
Looks to me like you are the trash. Here you all talk about the community you want to build in Classic but attack everyone who disagrees with you.
---
I been playing this game since 2005. I won't be "quitting in 2 weeks". I think the health of a server or it's economy won't be destroyed as easily as people in this sub think.
---
on a boss fight, rng might swing it in favor of the boomie + 4 mages. overall meters though, its not even close. if its the only weak spot of your raid, its not a big deal. but dealing with 40 people means always dealing with minor flaws in your composition, optimization etc. so willingly being suboptimal for one of your spots is just a poor decision.
---
"Greetings naturalist, I need you to kill 100 animals and bring back their paws. Leave the carcass in the wilderness, it is of no use."
---
Did you play in original Vanilla? Not being snarky just genuinely curious. I remember the cries of when a server would die and people would beg for transfers to another. *That* was truly heartbreaking. And it happened mainly because Blizzard's solution to not having layering was to make a shitload of servers so they could balance serverloads. The problem with that was it led to servers dying off and having to be collapsed into other servers.
---
Please believe me when I say attrition will happen regardless of what servers Blizzard releases. This is not doom and gloom it's just years of experience. The attrition will be massive. By having less servers with layering, it ensures more people are concentrated on a single server so when layering is removed and attrition hits, it won't be nearly as impactful as too many servers with sub-par population that eventually wither and die.
---
Uhhh
---
I can't comprehend why people don't prefer server queues. Are you that inpatient that you'd be willing to sacrifice the classic experience so you can play slightly faster? Gamers have absolutely no integrity today.
---
My preference as well, I just wanted to see what the difference would be in travel time.
---
Nice! Spam is really annoying in general channels
---
So basically someones who share playtime. Wouldnt feel like an achievement at that point for me though.
---
Why? Mara is listed as phase 1
---
Hybrid shaman builds ele resto only up to nature swiftness in resto, for either Insta heal or chain lightning.
---
You're pregnant?
---
Youre the worlds biggest snowflake if you think casual criticism is “venomous”. 
---
Youre allowed to think something is shit without knowing exactly how to fix it.
---
&gt; But it it does happen, then server merge 
---
I feel like this causes other issues. People argue for server identity a lot. Building your server identity and reputation is useless in this case. This also causes issues later down the road where players are level 60 instead of just leveling. There are so many issues with both Layering and server merges.
---
Thanks all for taking time to comment on my post I will definitely take all your ideas into account😃
---
"I have countless proof for my assertions I just don't want to link it."
---
Go away. Nobody thinks layering is perfect and ideal, we just hate it less than the alternative of closing numerous dead realms and hard merging economies and losing our names to name-squatters that haven't logged in since launch week.
---
&gt;I've seen this argument time and time again, and it is simply wrong because the people that create the layers and the people that abuse the layers are not the same people.
---
No, you are the one that is wrong.   The amount of resources is the same.  The only difference is the people that get those resources are different.  
---
Also, this has already largely been fixed with a timer....
---
I was flip flopping between literally every class but I've finally decided, and it turns out it was my first choice all along so I guess the moral of the story is don't overthink things.
---
Also I guess it helps that Hunter is kinda broken because that was my biggest contender and I guess it's easier just to play the safe bet.
---
so close yet so far away. i want to sleep for 57 days in exchange to staying away the next 57 days :P
---
I suggested a mega thread, the mods wouldn't have it.
---
People have literally died from doing stuff like that, lmao.
---
After like an hour of digging I cannot find where I got that number, my bad man. Not sure how I came up with that.
---
I'd downvote this twice if I could.
---
What? Server queues preserve the integrity of the classic experience. I'm not so impatient that I can't wait a short time to play the game, know the wait makes it that much better for everyone. Have some respect for the game and stop being selfish.
---
This 100%. Game has not been the same since TBC/vanilla for me. Everyone just signs up to the next 5 man/raid and then solo's the rest of the game with no communication. Guild vent/TS/discord? What are those? Have not been in one since TBC.
---
The whole generation gap is what's ruining classic. Kids who grew up with convenient gameplay and payment access, dont understand what the experience of playing on a single nonlayered server. The whole worrying about  quest and item access shows how distressed they get when they don't understand or can't figure something out for themselves. The experience of language barriers and server population overload was all apart of it. People in trade chat talk about how great retail is than classic but theres this whole subreddit worrying about population overload for classic. It's so contradicting its ruining classic before it's even out.
---
You're right, there's no other explanation for people to disagree with these posts or simply be sick of seeing them. It's all a tinfoil hat conspiracy, BFA players who aren't interested in Classic are somehow threatened by a game that has little demographic overlap with theirs and isn't a threat.
---
Are you for fucking real?
---
I like the idea of dynamic mob respawns, but buying more servers isn't going to necessarily fix the issue either. It just defers it to a later date when servers die and need to be merged.
---
PSA: this is the 100th post on layering today. Keep your announcement to yourself.
---
So at first they said nothing about sharding, they just used it in the beta. Then they said its only for the early zones at launch. Then they changed it to all zones in possible all of phase 1. To this day they have never even mentioned AQ opening... And to call PHASING in VANILLA, NECESSARY, is a bit weird if you ask me. Let's not sugar coat it. It's a lazy easy cheap solution to make the max profit just like Loot Trading.
---
I can't even.
---
What? There are 4x as many people accessing the auction house. The ratio of supply to demand stays exactly the same.
---
Not that there aren't other issues.
---
for sure, cant see what about it would break any rules.
---
Yea, always one craaaazy dude who thinks taking an entire week off work to play a video game more is unreasonable.
---
You just gave me bad memories of bursting a paladin to 1-4% with a wombo combo and then saying no to myself and watching the bubble appear.
---
It's not making the choice for you. You are still making the active decision to do it. You are just saving space on your bars by having one bind do both attack and passive...
---
Did you read the first line?
---
&gt; There has been a ton of new people into this sub lately and a lot of them are defending layering because the game would be unplayable with that many players in starting zones without layering"".
---
Wouldn't be needed if everyone knew that, but the vast majority of people don't.
---
The interesting thing is that they have been testing layer sizes - which means they might even be considering a dynamic process initially of having smaller layers increase while the levels of players increase up to a threshold before they move to 2k to 3k pops though that would be me thinking what I would do using layering.
---
It's a good way to prevent endgame resources being gobbled while also allowing people to get gripped by the game.
---
Though as you say i strongly suspect it will just be left at a flat pop rate.
---
&gt; Keep in mind for harcore guilds it gets longer and longer the more content is out. EVERY WEEK you must do MC for TF/Sulfuras memes/Onslaught Girdle/Strikers Mark/Band of Accuria/etc etc (when all of those are added, ofc), not to mention gearing alts. You HAVE to do ZG, Onyxia, and Blackwing lair for their respective heads for world buffs. ZG is on a shorter timer as well, so that's twice per week IIRC.
---
Running through outdated content where the overwhelming majority of drops will be DE'ed or sold all for a world buff is a sure way to burn out players.  I doubt you're saving the time in progression content that you're spending clearing the old content.  At that point... what's the point?
---
Nah just call more ladies!
---
cy@
---
TBH I was copy pasting shit from across the internet to put out a quick reply. But what about the other 11 things?
---
Because unlike the people whining about it, we actually understand how layering works.
---
During opening days/weeks you would very likely have to wait many hours. I have a family and a job and very limited time periods during which I can play. A couple of minutes sure, but you can't solve the problem of the opening surge like that.
---
Or just accept it!
---
then please post sources to go along with your claims, your post is just as informative as all the others.
---
I just hope for the best with hand of Edward the odd lol
---
I’m curious is this an actual serious question
---
Chinese gold farmers.
---
How long is the timer? And is there any way to see which layer you're in? I hate that it seems so obfuscated.
---
Ah I see everything I said is right. Sorry man, I’m just telling you what I see ;( hope you straighten your life out soon man!
---
Hey that’s a relatively good looking helm.
---
If humanity survives that long.
---
Yeah. It doesn’t make sense. Why would this not be a serious question?
---
Yeah, it couldn't possibly be a stagnant level cap coupled with Blizz not adding more people to the beta pool as they lose testers, that couldn't possibly account for decreased activity on beta realms. Nope. Not at all. It's all layering killing the game and not any number of other more likely reasons.
---
Omg give link! :)
---
Ok buddy. see you in 3 months
---
Did you read my first line? This has been reposted over and over again daily. 
---
Like I said, we don’t need your announcement or “new” thoughts.
---
Yeah so the mounts are really hard to get not everyone will be able to afford them. In classic an epic mount was a luxury and a status symbol. You will eventually get there.
---
So the economy will be started by people buying gold?
---
Prices at the beginning vs 1 year will be vastly different. Getting mount/training is first priority in my eyes anyway and it will definitely be a grind.
---
Yep, always gatta wait to blow your load to make sure she's properly finished off.
---
From my BFA config file that I basically just copied over, I'm pretty sure these are the commands you want:
---
    SET lodObject CullSize "10"
---
    
---

I didn't test these individually, but oh boy do they make your hot-off-the-silicon-press CPU churn.
---
You know what will kill classic for me? grinding to 60, getting dungeon gear, getting my epic mount and then the server die because all the tourist has left. I aint got time to start over.
---
I agree that the current layering model has a lot of exploitability as well as compromises game integrity, but unfortunately I am not well versed in this technical aspect or have any first hand knowledge of layering. I voice my outrage at exploits but I have no idea what the best method would be to fix all of this. 
---
I'd like locked layers but it has it's own downsides I am sure. I just dont know the full scope on what would be best. I leave that up to the experts and can only offer an opinion. 
---
My opinion is "funnel layering" where after certain zones all layers are funneled into one so the upper percent of people who are fast leveling will be able to see more people. Like say we have 3 layers 2.5k each and the 1%ers are already hitting 40 when 99% of the servers are 25 or below. If we funnel upper zones into one layer it will still feel active instead of devoid of any population/interaction. 
---
This also makes the high end resources be unexploitable since it's just one layer. Plus upper zones are contested so you cant layer hop pvp. (And one layer means higher population for wpvp)
---
MAN UP, AND NEVER REGRET!!
---
it's quite intuitive how economy on such a small and closed system works.  
---
people generate currency (GOLD) by looting mobs, vendoring items and completing quests.  
---
the more people that do it the more gold enters the system and thus the prices are driven up.
---
honestly at this point its miss information for less people playing warrior from warrior community ! mage community should do some spam about how melee leeway gonna destroy mages ! so we have less mages !!
---
It works the same way it works IRL
---
After lvl 20, you no longer get layered, you move onto the main server, rather than the sub servers. Fixed
---
Right! That was my thought as well. There will be people who level professions as they go, but the majority of the population will need to do it at max, but even so, there is just so much money you need to spend, and no one is going to pay high prices for things, when you still need your mount...
---
Those with more money than sense with buy from the Korean gold farmers and pump it into the economy buying up your mats. It won't take long.
---
I can't remember where I saw the time but it was either 3 weeks or 3 months. Sorry :/ I know that's a pretty big variance. I just remember the number was 3, heh. There's no way to see which layer you're in. The best thing to do is pretend layering doesn't exist because in THEORY you shouldn't be all that impacted by it unless you're trying to 1. exploit it or 2. switching between characters a ton
---
I'm actually in beta. What people are talking about where they phase is not something that happens very often anymore because of the timer that was put in. Basically if you recently earned XP, picked an herb, did something/anything, it triggers a cooldown to prevent exploiting and abusing layers.
---
Most people won't be able to afford an epic mount at 60 for a while.
---
Some will get lucky by finding things like Krol Blades or Arcanite Reaper Blueprints that are (were?) in high demand, others will grind their asses off, some will probably manipulate the AH, others will buy gold from some Chinese coinselling website.
---
literally lol'd
---
You forget how to count ? Lol
---
I wonder how long it'll take to remember my old mining routes.
---
They weren't healthy then.
---
You're entire argument ITT is based on a number of presumptions, 2 of which are very far off the mark. Firstly, you assume that following a zone route will mean that, by the time you get back to where you started, nodes will be respawning. This is most definitely not the case nor can you say that it will apply to all routes in all zones at all times. Secondly, you assume nodes won't ever be located in the same spot on different layers. While its true that it's not guarenteed, you are taking it too far assuming it will never happen. It's based on these premises that you say, "it'll be just as efficient to travel and farm then try and layer hop." Think about any of the caves in the world. While caves do have a cap on the number of active nodes that can be up at any one time, they also have far more potential nodes than the rest of the world. A player layer hopping through a cave multiple times would be much faster than running around an entire zone.
---
A lot of the people that will rush to 60 are people that have done it a million times on private servers, and they don't quit at 60, they simply enjoy the competition of seeing who's first. I'am the same way, I love fighting in terms of who's first, and being one of the only ones to step in a new zone and knowing there's a horde of players right behind you in the zone prior.
---
I had a very similar story, I mowed and took back bottles and everything I could do to make enough to get this!!! I was 15 and my friends had already been playing it and I was well l behind them! God I was strong than
---
Where will the money come from?
---
You have thousands of players questing, vendoring and buying things.
---
Everything sells too.
---
Meat sells, ores sell, cloth sells, enchanting mats sell.
---
Saying "I'm not sure cloth will sell like it does now" is just silly. It does. The market value ngght fluctuate before things get stable, but it all sells.
---
It doesn't work because you don't have the XR flight point.  Without the connecting point, you cannot fly between Orgrimmar and Ratchet.
---
Hyperbole and exaggeration is hurting the agenda more then its helping, your post is mostly damaging what you want.
---
They were probably in the same physical shape as the average WoW player...
---
Played  in 06 until 2012 . I’m back for more 👍🏻
---
Missinformation? Ok, let me ask you right now. Will they use any kind of phasing/sharding/layering at AQ opening? It's a simple yes or no question. Do you know the answer?
---
Ditto. Mobile has been a great help. Gained about 18m xp in two months with casual play! Cannot wait for classic to drop, probably have osrs afking on the 2nd monitor though.
---
You’re making the assumption an orb of deception would be worth 2000g for a start. 
---
An items worth depends on the economy it lives in, and what it’s purchased will pay for it. You can set a price you want for it but if nobody else is willing to pay that much because it doesn’t hold the same value to them, then it’s not worth that much to anyone else. 
---
Secondly, the price of an item is much lower at first as (in a reasonable economy and not one full of idiots) you price things accordingly. Asking 2000g for an item when there’s very little gold in the economy at first is just stupid. 
---
As more gold is made, through vendoring, questing and looting, prices of items will slowly creep up as people have more gold to spend.
---
This is wroooooong, if you wanna get maximum xp from a dungeon, then you should NOT invite a high level!!
---
Yup. It was hard to afford a mount as soon as you hit 40. Getting an epic mount was VERY hard.  And seeing people on nonracial mounts was pretty noteworthy.
---
I've read several people so far in this sub that cleared all AQ40 and several bosses into naxx (never specifically read about KT) in guilds with offspecs and no consumes mandatory. So yeah. And I can totally believe that since I've myself cleared many bosses into AQ40 while having a shit composition for today standards, and only having to stop because of TBC.
---
There is a middle ground between being able to speed run naxx in whatever really short time, and not being able to down bosses in it you know? And remember that in Vanilla, there was barely ANY guide for Naxx fights since it was so late content and with very few guilds actually doing it.
---
Still don't know why I'm writing all this though.
---
Trying to figure out if the march from Durotar to Tirisfal would be worth it.
---
IRL people work and get paid significant amounts of money. In wow you get a little bit of money for killing mobs and completing quests. I get once it starts rolling, then I understand how an economy works, but early on there won’t be the same kind of money exchanged on the ah, as there will be in year 2. It will just be a different experience for me, as I started in BC and there was already an economy started.
---
Virgin warlock?!? Have you SEEN the succubus i command? What do you think happens behind the Goldshire Inn when nobody is looking???
---
Well these won’t work because Classic is using modern WoW macro systems.
---
Rakion too.
---
Those were the good old days... And the Gunz Online xD
---
It's already there, you don't need the quest.
---
Ok then try to find one on google, better yet make one for me.  And then when you make it I’ll show you what it does in the game.
---
I’m not suggesting you can’t make a macro that would do this, the problem is that blizzard will instantly disconnect you and it won’t work because of their chat features.
---
Do you really not fucking understand this?
---
Definitely. I get that. I was just voicing a confusing thought about the wow gold economy to start!
---
Lol what? Alt-rightfrogHands!
---
you cannot target totems with a macro in classic
---
Yeah people talking like warlocks can just fear juggle 2 mobs and have your vw tank one while just life tapping for mana and drain lifing to get life back non-stop..  Sure you can manage that pull but you bet your ass you will be eating/drinking after the pull and exposing yourself to an easy gank at the same time.
---
That or my memory / recollection is just totally wrong.  lol.  
---
I came over with a guild from Dark Age of Camelot and was just going to go wherever they went.  They chose PVE but i swear i recall the realm lists being dominated by PVE realms.  
---
I could be totally wrong though.
---
Mate, I'm not hardcore at all. I'll be playing quite casually and probably won't get to 60 before December. I do however care about other players in the game, and I care about the game as a whole. I'm making demands that Blizzard keeps the game as it should be as opposed to catering to the modern wow audience.
---
Orb of deception wont be anywhere close to 2k or even 1k
---
Dude I've been leveling every fresh private server since nostalrius shutdown. It's not a big deal.
---
Well you dont need drugs to stay awake for 34 hours or even a bit more, lol. I’ve been up for 36-40 hours on a few occasions (one being Legion release) without any energy drinks, just good food, kept myself hydrated with H2O and didnt have any issues. But nonetheless’ i get your point.
---
&gt; I don't think it's even debatable that the average player on Classic will be much better at the game now than in 2005. 
---
A personal anecdote to highlight how true this is.
---
Back in vanilla I was in a progression guild that managed to kill C'Thun (quite the accomplishment back in Vanilla) but fell apart in Naxx just a few weeks before TBC.  What stopped us wasn't 4H... it was Thaddius.  There were a handful of players in our group that could never, after weeks of trying, manage to handle the polarity charges properly (even with the addons at the time telling you what you needed to do).  A handful of folks constantly fucking that up meant a wipe and after several weeks we decided to say 'fuck it' and take a break til TBC.
---
I quit WoW for several years after WotLK and came back to raid casually in Legion.  The guild I was in at the time, to be blunt, was not very good (I was just there to play with a friend who was raiding with friends of his own).  There was a boss with the same mechanic as Thaddius in ToS and this group of... average players handled the mechanic just fine.  In fact I have no memory of it ever being an issue.
---
The point being even bad players from back in Vanilla, if they've been playing through several xpacs to this point, have gotten better.  MC, BWL, and most of AQ40 and Naxx shouldn't be an issue.  The only issue I see, which was one that plagued us back in vanilla, will be maintaining a roster of 40 throughout that entire journey.  Classic is less execution and more preparation (right gear and in the right amount).  It sucks balls to lose a player, find a good replacement, but they're undergeared and you have to bring them up.  That's going to be the biggest hurdle to guilds out there down the road.
---
&gt;unironically saying pirate server 
---
&gt;implying a multi billion dollar company with thousands of employees can’t cope with more players than some neets in a basement
---
So you want sharding inside of the layers? gtfo
---
I don't believe a few hundred Lotus give or take could seriously damage the economy. 
---
However, I am worried that layering will seriously fuck up some server populations. I don't trust Blizzard or anyone to predict a severe population drop-off over several months for multiple servers and get it right every time.
---
Fresh starts. Everyone’s broke and no ones really buying shit. Everyone saves for mount. Everyone gets mount. Everyone hits 60. Everyone has more gold as a result of getting to 60. People start farming dungeons for gold with AoE and pets for bosses generating raw gold into the economy. People start buying up the AH and putting new prices on it to capitalize on old market prices, and causing people to farm more.
---
I mean they had to make a decision between persistent worlds or having zone borders like instances.
---
I'd rather have the ability to see creatures on the other side of a zone border any day of the week.
---
Thanks i really learned a lot.

 **LF Horde / PvP / CST or EST / Semi-Hardcore PvE / PvP Ranking**
---
I am a Vanilla Vet that is extremely pumped to come back to the game that I loved for so long.
---
*  I had 300+ days played on Rogue in Vanilla before TBC released.
---
* I played up until early WOTLK then quit because I did not like the direction the game was taking.
---
* I cleared all content up to the first wing of Naxx except C'thun.
---
* I enjoy PVP very much - Hit rank 11 in Vanilla and was a 2700+ arena player until I quit in WOTLK. (can link Achievement)
---
* I plan to go Rogue again and will use mining/engineering.
---
* I am 31 years old and have a rotating schedule (oilfield). unfortunately this means that I will not be able to make every single raid, but I will try my absolute best to do so. The good side is that I have a lot of free time to invest into my character and help out the guild. I typically work 5 days on week 1 &amp; 2 days on week 2. this alternates, so some weeks depending on how it falls I could make all functions. 
---
* I plan to drop all games that  I play when Classic is released, and put all of my effort (game wise) into classic.
---
* Also, have a best friend with similar accolades that would most likely like to join me in whichever guild I choose. He is a police officer so will likely be able to make all raids. He will be a mage.
---
I am looking for semi-specific criteria, to better prepare for Classic launch. This is what I'm looking for:
---
* Raid times between the 6-9pm CST (range), running no longer than 3 or 3 1/2 hours nightly and no more than 3 nights a week at most.
---
* Mostly an adult atmosphere.
---
* Somewhat "established". Thus far it should be evident I'm looking for some structure. So please, have a core or structure in place if interested in me. I'm not interested in joining 5 people with an idea.
---
* Has intentions of entering MC at least 2 months after release.
---
\*Please DM me here, or on Discord with your guild details. Discord is Havel#8021
---
Right, but at the start of an xpac the cloth is worth a fortune because no one has it, and everyone wants it AND everyone has money from the previous expansion. Starting fresh the cloth, while in high demand will be worth significantly less because no one can afford it, hence the question, where does the money come from!
---
This doesn't work because you don't have the XR flight point.  The connection is required.  If you ran there and got it, you could fly to Org.
---
What is your suggestion for an alternative? 'Buying more servers' only defers the server population problem for a later date. What do you think would have a better effect?
---
You're right. Completely toxic
---
Technically the brave souls over in China who will farm it *for* us.
---
same here i love the class fantasy of the paladin but i feel like ill get bored leveling and priest will be more interesting and is harder to play so even more interesting but pala is sooo strong and free mount and plate armor .... god damn it
---
Around lvl 12 as a warrior I’d go to booty bay then swim to westfall just to world pvp against other low lvl alliance. I can’t wait to relive those days when all 14 year old me wanted to do was rank up in pvp
---
\*many idiots.
---
So, are we talking about that player's name... the spam filter... or both?
---
Right, I guess what I’m saying is that is going to be a slow year to get the economy rolling, which will be a cool experience!
---
Haha yea it’s still 2 months man calm down
---
Alright leveling a warrior is definitively less easy than hunter. But that doesn't excuse the complete lack of skill and know-how that was exibited by that player.
---
Not Hamstring kiting mobs while wuelding a 2-hander is somewhat questionable. Not moving mobs to avoid accidentally pulling additional mobs is pretty pathetic. Running away with you back towards tgh wolves? Completely inexcusable!
---
That player absolutely should play a huntard
---
Technically correct... the best kind of correct.
---
Orc, Undead, Troll.
---
If not undead, exalted to Undercity is needed.
---
It applies to the PvP version too.
---
Away fror keyboard
---
The guild that get world first MC need to coordinate something like 100 players to have portals ready around the world and they have to prepare for thousands of hours and when they play live they have to do this with very little sleep. They then have to clear the raid with a bunch of lvl 58s in green gear. Call me crazy, but that will be a pretty impressive.
---
I'm desperate, i've started playing Retail.. having fun tho, pls don't downvote :O
---
Reminder: Hyperbole isn’t necessary, and tends to actually be more detrimental about this issue vs the reality.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5r821/z/es5lulg
---
The best part is when they're going to say some crap like "You guys made classic so successful, so big, We can't remove it at this point in time."
---
You're all fools to believe Acti-Blizz.
---
&gt; That’s not patience, that’s idiotic.
---
Agree to disagree, if you want to make the gold then do the time, there's no simple quickfix to a pile of gold. sorry to say.
---
Calling people morons or idiots because they can farm for hours on end is equally as idiotic imo.
---
Also 20k gold is probably abit too much to hold on to if you only have 1-2 characters, half of that is decently enough anyways. (Which is roughly a week played, depending on how much you play it can take a very short amount of time.)
---
Yep I flip flopped between literally every class and at one point I was changing my main every day. 
---
I've settled on ironically my first choice. I guess it's kind of ended being a combination 1. The reason I picked the first class is because it appealed to me and 2. The state of Hunter's in the beta.
---
No you injected your feelings and paranoia into someone else's comment and unilaterally declared it opinion and now your still pretentiously gatekeeping what an opinion like the definition of words change depending on what you feel at the time.
---
Pre-10!?!? That's a fraction of a drop in the bucket compared to 11-60 for warriors.
---
I techncially quit retail in MoP. But I played vanilla and wotlk private servers from 2015 to now. I've subbed maybe 3 times since MoP, but I haven't enjoyed it, it's too different then it used to be. I subbed just to play the vanilla stress test lol. I probably won't get the same out of it compared to someone that hasn't played vanilla private servers, I sort of know what to expect
---
I was an enhance sham in vanilla.  I was in the top horde guild in terms of raiding and pvp.  I reluctantly respecced all the time between resto and enhance so I could go raiding while being able to farm mats for raid consumables/pvp in the meantime.  I got to enjoy some legit end game content, but what a GD drag it was.  
---
This time, I'm gonna be enhance and wait for a guild who is fine with me playing the way I want.  It might take a while but that's fine.  Things I think I think:
---
\- Guilds and raid leaders will be more open minded in Classic than they were in Vanilla.  We've all played in an era of WoW where every spec/class was raid viable and we're grown attached to what we like.  
---
\- Early raids (MC/BWL/Onyxia) will be dogshit easy with "gearchecks" really being the only limiting factor and thus the need for min/maxing will be greatly reduced.  
---
\- The melee DPS "group" will be in support of a enhance shaman, yes obviously because everyone loves WF but also, that's one less warrior/rogue in the raid competing for the same class gear.
---
I am amazed how many people were traumatized having to rename their character 'Aryastarkk' judging from how often this comes up.
---
Anyway, multiple servers could share name lists from the beginning in preparation of possible future merges. This is not a problem at all.
---
Sorry I mean to say "If it does happen". I mean I've been through a few server merges in mmorpgs and it was a pleasant experience for me. More people to so things with. I guess I could see it being disrupting for some small communities? But doesn't everyone just transfer together usually to the same server? Failing to see the big problem there.
---
It comes from thousands of players consistently generating it at a rate higher than the games sinks. I already said that.
---
&gt; I'm making demands that Blizzard keeps the game as it should be as opposed to catering to the modern wow audience.
---
This isn't a thing. You can't just say "No changes" and expect anything to happen.
---
We are starting with 1.12 client. Vanilla didn't start with 1.12, so we are already off to a rocky start there. The number of servers are changing. The names of servers are changing. The number of people playing is changing. WoW has a different launch client than vanilla. Issues like the "stuck while looting" bug aren't going to exist. Vanilla WoW also dealt with servers that were sometimes offline for extended periods of time, but I don't see people pushing for them to artificially replicate this "experience" from vanilla.
---
In the end, you want the same thing as everyone else "Blizzard should fix the things I don't like, and leave the things I like". So calling someone else "selfish" when they are approaching the problem the exact same way you are is ridiculous.
---
Two solutions:
---
First solution involves chat: You change your emote color to (255,255,0) and then set the macro to "/e rolls 16 (1-100)"
---
Second solution is client-side, but I'll admit I can't recall the exact syntax (I don't have the game to test). Try this: "/run print("|cffffff00 Nicholaes rolls 16 (1-100)|r")
---
I’ll sub to play classic, even with level and time restrictions. I feel like a drug addict lol.
---
If you don’t have an answer to the question, don’t respond. It’s not the same basic principles. When was the last time you experienced a BRAND NEW economy? How will the same principles that govern a functional, established economy apply to a brand new one that is starting from nothing. Everyone will start the game with 0g 0s 0c. No one has money to buy things and start the economy, which means things will have very little value, which means that no one will be able to do anything but vendor shit for the first 6 months. Meaning that the economy will not be functioning for a long time. So it’s not like a basic economy. Get out of here with you lazy answer.
---
Words I've been searching for the whole time
---
How do you know there will not be phasing between zones and cities? On the beta they use phasing at the city gates.
---
except 20-60, warriors will be cleaving their way through dungeon grinding.
---
If you give retri palas the wrong gear sure. What they need is spelldmg gear and a fast 1h weapon.
---
The 1600dps were not a joke. Someone actually tested it out (though with all possible buffs and against undead). Lets without those buffs he drops to 1000dps, still toptier.

    [H] Cerberus - Hardcore PvE Guild - PvP Server - US East (All welcome who can make raid times)
---
While wanting to relive past heroism's at a competitive level, the goal of the guild is to progress at a pace that suits the core of the guild. With only two days in our raid week, the core of the guild will be held to high expectations to maximize the time we spend in raid. These two raid nights will have minimal downtime and minimal tolerance for repeated poor performance and coming to raid unprepared. Ideally, we seek to recruit the top 1% of skilled players who no longer wish to commit to a 4+ night per week raiding schedule.  
---
Off nights are to be spent farming consumes, gold, pre-raid BiS, 20 man’s, and, of course, doing other things you love/need to do. The last thing we want is to burn out our core and, with a more intense raiding schedule, farming consumes, gold, and pre-raid BiS can be very volatile to the turn over rate of players.  
---
Maturity and respect is very important. Drama of any kind will not tolerated.  
---
Leaders of Cerberus have countless hours, accumulating to years, of leadership experience throughout retail WoW and other games and MMO's.  
---
**Raid nights will be:** 
---
    Tuesday and Wednesday evenings at 8:00PM - 11:00PM (EST)  
---
    Invites will begin 30 minutes prior to raid to ensure we start AT 8:00PM SHARP!
---

**Requirements:**

    18+ years of age (some exceptions apply for mature/outstanding players)  
---
    Minimum of 87.5% raid attendance (~8 raids a month - 1 missed raid per month AT MOST)

I quit in MoP... and in WoD... and in Legion...
---
I've quit once and for all, that's why I'm going to play World of Warcraft in two months.

I just hated how the community disappeared with the introduction of LFG and LFR. Everyone was a complete stranger all of a sudden and the world felt empty. Also fuck Monks and Demon Hunters.

Buy a mouse with 12 buttons or 8 buttons on the side of it so he doesnt have to use keyboard.
---
Deathcharger's Reins from Baron in Strat is the only Undead Mount that Tauren can ride. Orcs and Trolls can ride them all, faction and PVP.
---
I guess the big problem is that the server dies in the first place. Classic has been heralded for its sense of server identity, and when a server dies there is not incentive for that any more. People will likely stop playing because the social aspect has died on their server.
---
It's cross-realm gameplay for weeks or months, with all the immersion breaking and abuse potential that comes with it.
---
That was the stress test client. The beta says "Beta: World of Warcraft Classic"
---
None of which works in classic.
---
What?
---
Are you considering that ZG gear will not be available until post-BWL? No bloodvine, no cloak of consumption, bag of whammies, etc.? 
---
Warlocks (like boomkins) get no hit from talent and before ZG especially, have a hard time getting any from gear, either.
---
Farming sim 19 is holding me over.
---
Interesting. I am planning to raid hardcore and be one of the realm first 60 warriors. I'm in the process of applying to guilds so I dont have anyone to level with me as of now but I'm going to pull several all nighters to get ahead. Could you tell me what the pros and cons are of fury vs arms leveling? For solo and duo of possible
---
I mean that's one zone mate, didn't you say you quit at 75? Yes it was boring if you don't like extreme nature like extreme northern tundra, I liked it on the other hand, the other alternative was pretty good and the favorite of the two. More Viking themed, big ass castle and bigger and more live Viking viallages and towns, fiery dragons, poisonous Forsaken theme as well, the new models, pirates and sick fucking nature mountains like the ones in Scandanavia. Anyways I think you missed on a really cool expansion, it was the peak of WoW and Ulduar raid was the most fun I ever had in pve and I was a hardcore arena player.
---
I didn't know about Myanmar, but Liberia makes sense considering its history with the U.S.
---
Right, not at the start, but if you look at what it could be worth, no one is going to sell it for 60g on the AH unless they don’t know what they have or are totally desperate for the cash.
---
With unique name ids shared across multiple realms, and likely a shared AH.   But yes, pretty much.
---
Hahaha no. .... Classic was announced last November which was actually 8 months now that I do the math
---
On beta they use all sorts of things - we can only wait and see.
---
I must have missed this supposed phasing at city gates because I don't remember seeing it on anything I watched or mentioned by anyone in the communities im a part of.
---
Thank god it's only the things most people care about that are important.
---
In my guild before bwl was released and only a few guilds had mc on farm my guild would spend 16 hours in MC mainly coordinating people...
---
I'm 100% sure the first one does. I'm 90% sure the second one does too since Blizzard is using their modern API, unless they specifically removed the print function for some reason.
---
Then why do you want classic to be more like BFA? 
---
Layering is 100% anti-classic. Classic devs said so them selves.
---
Orb of deception is typically worth 50g to maybe 150g on a good day, who is telling you 2k is ..... deceiving you.....

---
&gt; As someone who has played EverQuest TLPs extensively (basically the equivalent of classic WoW) I can tell you attrition is the #1 killer of any server.
---
Vanilla private servers work the same way. Once AQ is released the playerbase slows down, and once a new server comes out the old server dies.
---
Server queues are anti-player. Period.
---
You'll never get your nostalgia back. Stop being a luddite. Way before server queues are implemented you're going to have to let me come over to your house and kick your balls so far up into your body to replicate the fact that your balls hadn't dropped back when you started playing.
---
Then, and only then, are you allowed to tell people about “the Classic experience.”
---
just limit the level cap on layering. force all players level 30+ onto the same layer. that way only the lower level mats that would hurt the economy a lot less will be affected.
---
I'm not prepared. Haha see what i did there.
---
Just go along the shore to the west, die when the game says you are in dun morogh, spirit res GG easy.
---
Ok cool. Unfortunately my brother is deadset on rolling hunter so I guess I’ll just function as his second pet
---
Well I’m glad you 100% believe in yourself on something that is 100% not in classic.  Really shows your credibility on anything really
---
Paladins!!!!!!
---
Let's be real, with the notable exception of WoD Dark Portal fuckery, every release I've played since Cata has gotten smoother and smoother.
---
You haven't even needed to relog since MoP release, you could stay in game waiting for midnight to roll around.
---
Edgy comment though, points for effort.
---
I gotta show Kevin this comment, lol. The weird, cultish Jesus-worship is getting too delusional 'round here.
---
I never said I did?
---
Layering isn’t ideal, but it will temporarily fix a temporary problem with minimal lasting side effects.
---
All of these doom and gloom, classic is dead posts are more harmful than layering will be. Get over it.
---
Probably worth noting that things that constantly drain money from you like mounts, repair costs, travel costs, etc are all coin sinks meant to control inflation. Virtually every game with an in-game economy has them in some form or another: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_sink
---
This guy might be a genius, every comment about game design is super insightful. Master of his craft.
---
**Gold sink**
---
Gold sink is an economic process by which a video game's ingame currency ('gold'), or any item that can be valued against it, is removed. This process is comparable to financial repression in real economies. Most commonly the genres are role-playing game or massively multiplayer online game. The term is comparable to timesink, but usually used in reference to game design and balance, commonly to reduce inflation when commodities and wealth are continually fed to players through sources such as quests, looting monsters, or minigames.

Between me and my family members we had about 5-6 accounts so that could be right.
---
Yeah, not all who stay up that long will need "assistance" but many will.
---
Luckily I have shadowbringers to tide me over till then :D
---
You should actually learn what the basic principles of economy. I’m giving you lazy answers because you can’t use the internet to get basic info that’s readily available
---
Hi giving you lazy answers because you can’t use the internet to get basic info that’s readily available, I'm dad.
---
You're getting angry over something that hasn't happened. They said very clearly that layering would not be in past phase 1. If what you said comes true, then get angry.
---
Huh. Were you there at the start in classic? How long does this process take?
---
Dungeon grinding? LOL, right along with my dedicated healer + CC. Also, once you complete dungeon quests + get the main gear, it's a waste to grind instances.
---
&gt; It doesn't feel like Blizzard balanced the game around warriors at all
---
The game is ridiculously unbalanced, which is why BC is my favorite era of the game.  BC is insanely more balanced than vanilla without too many of the modern problems.
---
looks good to me
---
Oh. So do you think layering will affect world PvP for those who love PvP In the WoW world of Classic? As well as the economy?
---
Hyped anyway.
---
just wait for launch to play. What classes seem interesting to you? I'll tell ya their BiS race/talents
---
It can do both. It can prevent 1000 people in a staring zone, and it can prevent the world being totally dead in several months. 
---
Ion Hazzikostas, toward the end of this video, mentions that this type of technology can solve launch day load problems *and* dwindling population problems. 
---
https://youtu.be/Q-GobXQTf6w
---
I'm not saying I'm necessarily happy with it (this isn't a thread on whether we like it or not), but it's my understanding that Blizzard thinks this sort of tech solves multiple issues for them.
---
This is basically why I can't bother playing retail even though I have an active subscription in anticipation for classic. Also nowadays it's a different game where nothing you achieve matters. All the quality of life changes added over the last 10 years eventually ended up turning the game into a casual-fest where very few players can identify the elite, and this basically killed the community, and also the game.
---
It felt good when people would inspect you because you were one of the few that was clearing current content. Or one of the few with X cool mount. Nowadays no one cares.
---
This is actually a perfect idea, assuming they eventually just remove the layers all together as planned in phase 2. Hopefully blizzard sees this!
---
Hi, /u/Ridikiscali

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7x9x2/happy_july_1st_classic_is_released_next_month/). 
---
Chest.
---
What a stupid fucking argument. "Oh look, all this other stuff changed? Guess we might as well change the rest of the game too while we're at it!" God damn, what is wrong with you assholes? Don't you have a modern version you can play instead?
---
Nobody knows wtf he's talking about. Not even him.
---
I can stop anytime I want to. Just because I'm still a WoW player after all these years means nothing. Must.. put.. down.. the.. gamer.. mouse.. must.. bwah..
---
lmao! This is hilarious! Great job!
---
No. That's a common pserver bug
---
very well said, I hate hearing folks say "what if the pop never drops!!!"
---
it will every once of data suggests it will, Hard
---
Good point about the cave concentration and the also certainty of nodes being thru-out each time you layer hop. But I suppose you'll need to clear out the enemies each time as well. 
---
When I did resource farming back in vanilla, I never went into caves but based my routes on the longer perimeter routes which usually had time to reset each cycle. Without layers, I never felt the caves were worth back then but maybe they can be with layers.
---
that problem still exists with their current plans, what if phase 2 rolls around and asmongolds server has 20k people on it? they must have some plans to deal with a situation like that
---
Mob tagging doesn't work (well) in classic beta.
---
Don’t ever let anyone dull your sparkle :)
---
The implicit assumption with layering is that it will be gone by phase 2 (possibly sooner), meaning that a server with for example 5 layers in the first week would have about 12000 players quitting (assuming 1 layer is 3000 players). These 12000 players won't pull any significant amount of high end resources (Black Lotus) out of the economy, while them simply playing creates layers that increase the amount of these very resources. The number of people able and willing to abuse such a system (leveling to 60 in less than a week, monopolizing specific zones for as long as possible) is fixed and mostly independent of the total player count. Even if say you as an individual player level up almost as fast as the top players and plan to disrupt this resource hoarding, the best you could do on a layered server would be to gain control of 1 layer of 1 zone, because they could simply evade to a different layer. On a single server, they couldn't do that. 
---
The issue here is that the playerbase is not homogenous, so saying something like "Twice the players means just twice the supply and demand, so nothing changes" is simply not true. The top players are a fixed number of people that will play no matter what, while the number of layers depends mainly on the number of tourists. *If* the timer for layer hopping is high enough so that it can't be abused, the effects might be small. If it's just a few minutes, it wouldn't really solve the problem at all.
---
&gt;Other option is that they remove the layers in higher level zones.
---
Layering isn't sharding.
---
This is incorrect. Layering copies the entire world. It is NOT region specific.
---
&gt; Is there anything that I should try first?
---
Not really, IMO.
---
&gt; Should I try going on a private server before wow classic comes out?
---
Couldn't hurt, but isn't necessary.
---
&gt; How do I pick my race and class?
---
First and foremost go with what you'll enjoy. This game uses the holy trinity of "tank-healer-DPS". There are variations for all of these. Like any game, there is a meta. Some are better at PvP than others. Some are better at PvE than others. 
---
&gt; How do raiding and guilds work in a simple sense?
---
Raids are dungeons for 40 people that drop the best gear and reset  the same time every week. You can progress as far as possible within that week.
---
How does this not go well with druid or shaman? Both used parts of animals for rituals, scrying etc. That's literally one of the reasons I said the Tauren work for both.
---
Guilds did not sell runs during vanilla. The supply and demand factor was nonexistent and the lock out mechanism was not carry-friendly. I bet if you asked all of the players during the end of vanilla what the name of their tier 2 set was called, most didn't know or care. Only about 10% of players raided back then. The other 90% did not care about paying for raid gear. There may have been a top guild or 2, consisting of less than 100 people, that did this but it's nothing like the 5 guilds per server, or thousands of players, that sell runs today.
---
I played during vanilla and BC. Only ever saw Amani War Bear runs being advertised in trade chat.
---
I was playing retail a bit for a month and there was so much spam in trade about runs being sold. So disgusting and wrong. That kind of transactional advertisement is so cancerous.
---
&gt; How do I pick my race and class? 
---
You pick whatever interests you the most. Do not listen to "this race is better than that race for X class".
---
Some people have joined a guild already, some people are waiting until they're in the game, some people are waiting until they hit 60. The best answer is to make friends and play with them.
---
Good point. I remember in right before cataclysm dropped (I think) it would be unable to acquire, so people were farming them and selling them for a lot more. I suppose when it’s a blue item that drops from mobs, it’s worth less, than when it’s unavailable.
---
Either way the point still stands that people won’t buy at the high prices until they have their mounts situated... meaning that the economy is sluggish at the start. People won’t have millions of gold for a very long time.
---
Pet speed isn't that valuble, and 10 points on pet armor and HP to get there is a lot for not much. If you aren't in BM for intimidation or for the full spec it's kind of a waste outside of leveling. Better invested back into the other trees
---
I assume the level split thing on the side means it took him 35 hours 42 minutes?
---
Blizzard has never tracked world first. It has always been outside sources that do the world first.
---
Blizzard refuses to support races because it encourages unhealthy habits
---
My bot senses are going off! Huh? I could swear that nkid... yep. It's a bot alright.    
---
Some stats: This bot has made (spammed) 996 replies in the last 1 hour.
---
The fact that there will be realm identity is a big one for me. Community is the key.
---
Can add me to the list of folks who was in a guild that cleared AQ40 and most of Naxx with no spec control, required consumables, or debuff control.
---
Obviously, if we had been more disciplined in those aspects we would have cleared content faster (though still not finished Naxx... I explained in another post in this thread what brought us to a halt).
---
I'm really perplexed by folks on here that expect full DM Trib runs for the buffs before raids start.  Why spend all that time to gain some time off your clear of Naxx?  Hell... you'd probably save time overall by skipping those runs and just doing Naxx.
---
I've played both (technically 3) stress tests so I know quite well how layering is going to feel and it's going to be much better than having 3 times that amount in the same area.
---
Probably because people ignore megathreads anyway.
---
Sure, but tier 2 has to be one the best looking tier sets of all time across pretty much all classes. Of all time!
---
Servers make the game lose integrity by the same definition
---
Fair warning - it’s against the rules of this sub to encourage private server use, so asking if you should is probably not a good idea.
---
I disagree. I’d much rather see the swarms of people trying to quest at launch. Those hordes of lowbies have resulted in some hilarious moments and fantastic screenshots. Plus, it’s really mitigated by level 10, only a few hours in.
---
Ruining the gameplay for weeks, months, or beyond level 15 is not at all worth it in my mind.
---
Great point, thanks!
---
Yeah it's only a beta. So lets downvote when people post feedback and raise concerns about crucial issues like PHASING IN VANILLA.
---
&gt;&gt;Should I try going on a private server before wow classic comes out?
---
&gt; Couldn't hurt, but isn't necessary.
---
It could. The starting zones on Private Servers are fucking brutal and could easily turn someone off to the game if they've never played anything like it.
---
Yeah but it would save everyone the hassle of reporting every single layering thread as spam.
---
1. Layering minimizes people appearing and disappearing ..... they or you need to get invited into a party in order for it to happen so not random. 
---
2. I am not sure I understand.
---
3. The communication channels are not layered, and every time you play you are placed on a layer. My guess a week or two in there will be only one layer except a few streamer, legacy servers.
---
4. Same issue as non layered server
---
5. Back in a day they had servers with 25K on one faction players ..... more ppl more items more supply more demand. If Majoring in economics taught me anything supply and demand will find equilibrium. 
---
6. Same as 5, more rare items will get bought by more ppl ..... not sure how immersion is affected.
---
7. Blizz is putting in safeguards like restrictions
---
8. Blizz is putting in safeguards like cooldowns
---
9. As I stated before I think for the most part layering will phase itself out in like a week or two. And most of relationships start forming at like level 20 and above so plenty of time to find you favorite tank or healer. Hard to predict this one as it is purely based on .... nothing. 
---
10. There is a much higher likelihood of overpopulation and server splits than server merges; However, this the multiple server suggestion there is a risk of both mergers and splits since ppl are unpredictable.
---
11. Addressed in 10
---
12. Is that a benefit of "overcrowding"? You want ppl to choose to explore not "force" them since all other options are unavailable
---
13. This is a tough one.... I was a part of stress test and with several hundred ppl the lag was insane ..... I think in regards to massive world PVP there are some technical problems. 
---
14. The overcrowding argument helps layering case as it is more likely to end up with an overcrowded server. With mulit server solution it is less likely to have overcrowding. 
---
15. I am not sure I understand.
---
1. Clusters sharing the same name means you are going to merge them no matter the population. So if a legacy name server is packed on all 5-6 clusters you will still merge them? So same exact as layering except "micro mergers" are more dynamic.
---
2. You have described layering. Except it shrinks if one of the layers drops in pop, in your case some of the ppl might be left on empty sub servers for weeks or month till merger.
---
3. The suggested server by Blizz is a meme, everyone knows never to pick it and will always select the most populated server. 
---
4. So some clusters will never merge? So some ppl will play on Illidan 69 (exaggeration for comedic effect). I am not sure that will sit well.
---
5. Vanilla game play is 3 hr queue times for populated server and you friends not able to create a new character because the server is locked..... some vanilla experience you don't want replicating. Plus dead server and I mean dead to a point of merging 3 of them still feels empty.
---
1. Server mergers are horrible. A month or two in you are 60 and getting some gear, found a PVP or PVE group and decided there is a need of a class/role on your server .... you roll that ... merger occurs and it so happens that role/class is now not in demand. It is an extreme example but ppl want stability, they hate change. They want to know there will not be 100 new level 60 players shifting entire PVE, PVP, economy, professions, farming meta. 
---
2. Is a guarantee and will be bad. Imagine you make a character on ABC 1 on day one ..... now on the weekend all of the ppl who made character on ABC 1 are trying to log in ..... and cant ... now they have to re-roll.
---
sorry for sloppy formatting.
---
No, you are giving lazy answers cause you only remember supply and demand from Econ 101, and that’s all you actually know. I could go look on google about mmorpg economies getting started, or I could try and start a discussion about the game I am excited to play with other people who are excited to play it, on a forum about the game. No one asked you to be a jackass about it, so stop being a jackass.
---
People who think the population will only keep increasing are delusional tbh.
---
Maybe he has succumb to the powers of the Orb of Deception
---
Tell that to the morons that think it can all be solved by making massive changes to every aspect of the world AKA dynamic respawns.
---
That's a fair question. I don't actually know. I'm thinking about the esfand asmongold stay safe server especially. That one is going to be a behemoth.
---
There are a lot of things that got figured out later on private servers that never had enough time to be really looked at and fleshed out during Vanilla.
---
A great example would be a feral DPS, while not ideal, could be made serviceable with certain items.  I don't think anyone figured out a blue level 40 hat was BiS for ferals until much later on a private server.
---
Psh, you're so easy! It took me until "wrong."
---
That is probably an easier path to take. Don't forget, you can always save the mats to have someone make you a hammer as well if you will get the rag drop. It's BoE and hopefully someone in your guild would be willing to make it for you.
---
Dang, really?!  That is disappointing! Did Blizzard ever address this when the top guilds lamented the Boomkin's viability?
---
I always hoped (especially through these discussions over the last year) that they were *at least viable* when you group them with 4 casters.  So... this spec is pretty much just for funsies and a fan-favorite if you go by numbers
---
It wouldn't move people from one layer to another, just put new logins into a new layer. If you're in layer A as it gets full and another layer is created, you'll stay in A while people logging in will be put into layer B.
---
Every ounce of data?
---
There has only been one mmo that resurrected their original version, runescape, and old school runescape gained about 30%, they didn't lose 70%.
---
But this is still just one game, can't really use it as basis for a statistical analysis, just wanted to show that there not enough data to prove either way what will happen.
---
So I will be able to mail items &amp; materials between alts in different realms? Or I will be able to transfer an entire character between realms?
---
The quest rewards and vendor trash are how good enters the system
---
It’s  is highschool level of economics
---
It is true, as you say, that with increasing realm population the resources will be distributed disproportionately in favor of the few most hardcore players. However that fact has nothing to do with layering.
---
When your realms are 4x as big and the available resources are still allocated amongst the 25 most hardcore players layering only changes if you have the original amount of resources or 4x more. But either way you have 4x more players and thus demand.
---
I would argue that not having layers in this scenario would certainly mess with the economy much harder.

Eu Horde PVE (Eng/Ger)
---
Hi there, 
---
I'm 29 years old, speak english and german and I am looking for a Guild. 
---
About WoW me:
---
I plan on playing shaman or priest and I'd like to play a healer in raids. 
---
I played Wow Classic as a troll mage and raided quite successful up until Wotlk. 
---
Highlights include:
---
*Cleared MC/BWL/ZG/AQ20 in classic
---
*Got killed by C'thun once (killed almost everything else in AQ40)
---
*Like 3 bosses or so in Classic Naxx then BC got in the way
---
*Got Fishing to 375 before it was made easy
---
*Entirety of BC except for the last boss in Sunwell because I got drafted =/. Basically everything from Mount Hyjal on were server first kills.
---
*That black War talbuk on a PvE Server
---
*First Troll to 80 in Wotlk
---
*Raided Wotlk for ~2 weeks then quit and only reemerged for some short interludes until finally quitting shortly before Lich King
---
What I'm looking for:
---
People that are equally cool as my old raid buddies. (critical luders on Durotan on the off chance any of those guys are also around here ;D)
---
A relaxed but "professional" raiding environment. I was in a guild that was successful precisely because we didn't take everything super seriously and I'd like that again.
---
While i probably won't be able to invest as much time as i used to, I definitely can and want to raid several times a week. Probably 2 to 4 times depending on how serious you guys are with attendance ;) 
---

---
when wow first came out I lvled a warrior, and never had an issue in arms.  I beat everyone in duels surprisingly as well, charge, rend, hamstring, thunderclap, overpower.
---
Agreed. I also still think they are fun, and I love the class fantasy. You really feel like a rugged tracker in Vanilla, and I personally enjoy the micro manage aspect of the class.
---
Polls (which I don't put *too* much faith in) are showing Hunters are getting less popular recently, probably due to things like leeway and the alleged scatter/trap DR bug. But this is good for the dedicated Hunters because you might have less competition for spots and loot, assuming the polls are any indicator.
---
Have you tried BM yet? The only specs I've tried are Scatter/Lightning Reflexes, Scatter/Intimidation, and deep MM. I'm wondering if maybe deep BM would feel any better for burst. Is it any good on Ret --- Ro?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZRyD2LfBZPQ
---
I love warrior teir 2. But Teir 3 is sexy af.
---
Ahhh, I probably play 3-6 hours a day depending.
---
This hits me right in the home.
---
Okay, so for the ideal Classic experience, you want that grey, tube CRT from your grammar school's shit-tier budget library, a mouse with two buttons, no scroll-wheel and non-optical ball roller, a keyboard from the 90s, and a Pentium 4 machine with a 512M (then) mid-tier graphics card.
---
If blizzard is smart, they will be....   You can expect like 90% of the people to login to be tourists, or people that just get bored and quit.  That means within a few months that 20,000 server will be 2,000.  Which is actually still to low, as you want 3000 concurrent players per server.  So, with 90% attrition, then you would want each server to have 50,000-60,000 players?  Maybe more.
---
I know it is, I'm saying what it should be.
---
Stuff is not worth what you want it to be worth
---
It’s only as worth as someone is willing to pay
---
I'm in the classic beta, and so far I dont think focus targets are working in classic. Focus targets weren't in vanilla, so they might not be in classic either. When I target someone, and then do /focus, nothing happens.
---
No I don't think they will. Layering isnt because of server instability or overcrowding, its to help prevent dead servers after the "tourists" leave. They said layers are limited at "vanilla like" population levels, so around 2.5K per layer. 
---
Also, realistically the majority of players at those events are geared 60s, so it shouldnt be the entire sever.
---
Does counter attack deal good damage or is it a set amount?
---
I paid a top raiding guild 200g so I could loot their Hunter leaf from their majordomo loot crate.
---
I mean... the dude is right. This was fucking  awful
---
Not in the slightest.  I will play what I first played back during retail when my laptop was so shitty that I couldn't even load the game without positioning the camera right above my character and waiting about 3 minutes for it to get me into the game.  
---
Classic Rogue, it'll be good to have you back to play once more!
---
I have done wow gold making on the largest vanilla pservers in the past years  , nostalrius and kroonos..  The situation you describe is only true in the first weeks.  After a month or 6 weeks you already have plenty of lvl 60 people who are building up their little lvl 60 economy  . sure prices will be low at the beginning, but that is the exciting part!  you see it develop over time.  
---
It is possible to make 100g out of 5g on the AH VERY early.  With skill and experience you can wheel and deal and make small fortunes, that grow into big fortunes.   How is this possible you ask?   It is possible because very few people do it , most just play the game .  1000 people making 5g a day from quests, is 5000g added daily.  Obviously  you need to subtract the repair costs, the training costs , AH cuts and the flight master fees, but it will add up and eventually the surplus all ends up in circulation. 
---
To start a successful career as trader you need to learn all the common quest items and other stuff low lvl players need all the time, it starts with nickels and dimes, but soon it goes to gold coins.
---
I always have 200g at lvl 40, but I am slower than many at the leveling.  This trading takes time, time not spend killing boars.....
---
This rule kind of baffles me. I get they don't want to turn the sub into /r/wowservers for the next couple months, but they're all shutting down by the time Classic launches.
---
It's one thing to advertise Private Servers, but a new player asking if they're a good option until Classic launches? C'mon...
---
BC and wrath aren’t classic though. Whatever the number they pulled. That’s my point and why I see them going another direction as a possibility
---
What?  That looks awesome!  /s
---
classic beta testing is showing instance grinding to be the fastest way to level up, vs solo questing (unless you are a very powerful solo grinding class that isn't gear reliant, like hunters)
---
Is the trash reduced on private servers? From what I remember, there are around 5 firelord/earth surger packs, 3 or 4 giant packs, 5-6 core hounds and 2-3 imp packs from start to lucifron
---
I'm an adult now, I can ruin my life as much as I want.
---
Man this is too funny. I finally give you an example (actually two) after you fervently deny it being possible, and you're response is basically the equivalent of "Nuh-uh!" Thanks for the laugh.
---
God I wish they would just give us queues.
---
Then the starting zones are going to be a complete shit show and we'll all be waiting in queue after the first week or two.
---
&gt;Is there anything that I should try first?
---
Warcraft III is a great place to start to familiarize yourself with the story and world.
---
&gt;Should I try going on a private server before wow classic comes out?
---
No.  Part of the magic of Vanilla WoW was that it was brand new and full of unknowns.
---
&gt;How do I pick my race and class?
---
Try them out.  If you like one, keep playing it.  There's no secret, just play what you like.
---
&gt;How do raiding and guilds work in a simple sense?

Guilds are groups of people who work together for common purpose, typically raiding.  The most difficult dungeons in the game are designed for groups of 40 players, and managing groups of that size is a feat unto itself: when to raid, what to raid, which roles need to be filled, who gets loot, etc.  Hence, guilds.
---
And when they merge it would fuck the economy far more than any amount of layering would. If one or two of the servers have dead populations you would have thousands of unused materials just flooding into the popular one after the merge. A dynamic layer system would make it so outside peak play times like in the middle of the night there is only one server worth of materials to access. With 3 servers you have 3 times as many materials at all times.
---
i played beta for 2-3 weeks, its cool but i dont think i have time for it.
---
So fucking close.
---
Highly recommended reading, I'm glad that I was able to get it right before the backer window closed.
---
Awesome, thanks for the rundown.
---
Only when they join groups.
---
&gt;Yeah layering is bad but it is what it is. They need to do something, can't have 20k players or whatever on one server on launch day.
---
Why not? Servers have gotten faster. 
---
People are acting like it will be impossible to level up. They've already done it when they introduced new WoW servers and released TBC. It was part of that classic experience. Layering isn't classic.
---
There might be some disruption, but that is infinitely more appealing than layering. Like the man said, layering loses the games integrity.
---
Jeez, the answers in this thread are weird and oddly specific to people's personal experience..  The only right answer is: There will most likely be guilds on your server that fit your raiding preferences, and their progression in a raid in a given week is completely based on the quality of players they have. It will be up to you to wade thru the muck and figure out what intersection of schedule, skill, and friendliness suits you. 
---
Every other answer is too catered to a specific experience. 
---
There will be guilds who raid for 3 hours twice a week and clear 2-4 bosses in MC each time, progressing very slowly (and probably losing their best players to better guilds eventually). There will be guilds who raid for 3 hours each night 5 times a week and can clear MC/BWL/and get into whatever progression is at X time all in one week. There will be guilds who raid for 6 hours a night 5 days a week, and will clear MC/BWL/AQ40, do alt run clears, and get deep into whatever is progression for them. 
---
How long raids take is completely dependent on the level of skill and committment of the people in the guild you join. Some casual guilds will have amazing players that allow you to efficiently and quickly clear content on minimal time. Other casual guilds will have subpar players who don't care as much, and you will struggle to get all the way thru a raid before reset. You will find both types of guilds on every server. 
---
Also - I see a lot of comments on how prepping for a raid works...that is also different for each player and guild. Rule of thumb is you should be ready to go and start pulling at the time the raid is scheduled to start. If your guild is fine with you logging in 5 minutes before that is...cool. If they like for people to log in earlier and be at the instance gate 5 min before the scheduled start...cool. If your guild doesn't care and waits 15-30 min after the scheduled start to get everyone in and get going..cool.
---
layering is fucking retarded
---
“Vendoring” means the first thing you said - crafting then selling to a vendor. In English, the word for selling something is vending, not vendoring - the word vendoring is WOW-specific. I can see how this could get confusing
---
This is exactly why they tend to offer free transfers instead of forced merges. Some people don’t want to intrude or be intruded upon. Don’t want to lose their identity, their character name, etc. some people just don’t understand this.
---
Private server and classic isn't the same thing.
---
Gotta love the lawlbringer set, aka banana shoulders, aka.. etc etc
---
I’m going to farm dungeons with guild mates and sell what I get. That or farm Tyrs Hand Elites with a group. I’m leveling mining/skinning and just going to vendor my non rare leather as I level my warrior. Which will help some. At least will help with getting my 40 mount. 
---
The economy won’t have much gold in it to start. I won’t be selling anything on the AH until P2. I will be using all my Alts as bank alts till then. Mage for enchanting mats, hunter for leather, priest for cloth... etc. between my wife’s account and mine I shouldn’t run out of space. I plan on hoarding till then.
---
Not many, bro.
---
&gt; Any class can get to 60 at around 5 days played. If not less.
---
World record in vanilla (not counting powerleveling by higher level players) was something like 4 days 20 hours, so this is incorrect. I think people are forgetting how time consuming it used to be.
---
Now, it wouldn't surprise me if someone got that record down to 4-ish days at some point, but probably not at release, since there will be competition. However the average time will probably be around 10 days of /played.
---
I could see sizeable groups getting to 60 in a couple weeks, but high level areas are going to be ghost towns for the first month or so... with or without leveling.
---
I didn't like the direction the game was taking so I quit shortly before cataclysm  after playing from vanilla.  On top of that my job had been a perennial hurdle to raiding.  Not working that job anymore and excited for classic.
---
My dirty secret is I hope classic is a huge success so we get TBC.
---
I'm trying to decide between either warrior, shaman, or hunter. Any advice you could give me for any of these classes would be awesome.
---
we already had this discussion and its when they announced "sharding in starting zones" and the entire community collectivly exploded, thats why we have layering now. 
---
We complained about phasing ruining immersion but now people want that back....
---
For most people, yes it will. Assume an average of 7d (not fast for a speed leveler, but still fast, most people will be 10+ easily), an average of 3 hours per day played, and that's just shy of 2 months. You adjust any of the factors [10d to hit 6, 2 hrs per day average, etc] and it can easily jump up to over 3 months. Expect most people to hit it at 2-4 months, so 3 months. About the expected length of phase 1 probably. 
---
What's impressive here isn't the speed, but doing it in one sitting.
---
I hope you are right.
---
Well that was rather rude - I did follow it up with that I hadn't seen any of your claims. So it would be nice if you had anything to hand that you could show.
---
Otherwise, I have to wait to hear back from people - there is no need to be defensive and rude.
---
I wonder how many of the pirated realm shitters will ditch Classic for a new pirated realm?  lol
---
Could you provide a source on that?
---
They've got it up as a global release.  Don't have the link off the top of my head, but just google something like "wow classic release date" and go to the blizzard post.
---
You would be right if there was only one server.
---
 This community is better because you're in it :)
---
Come on ma’am, you getting upset makes me laugh. You do not need to look up mmorpg economies. The basis of all economies follow a very simple set of rules. Look that up.
---
Yea I know I play Ret ;P
---
I lead BWL gdkp runs. You came as a buyer ir a geared raider (seller). Made bank.
---
Might have mixed it up with months. They have said it wouldn't be around when phase 1 rolls around, which shouldn't be more than a couple of months.
---
Beep boop, I'm a bot. How are you not shadowbanned for spam yet? You're the most spammy bot!    
---
Do you know the answer? They have said that layering will only be for the first 3 weeks of launch. Are we going to just assume they’ve lied to us about everything they’ve ever said? Or do you think they only lie about layering?
---
AQ was puggable and ZG could be done by a casual raiding guild. But OK.
---
Yawn. Troll post from a 4 day old account.
---
Next.
---
if you use shadow game streaming there's a controller addon in wow but im not sure you could use it on shadow lol
---
The raids prior to AQ and Naxx really aren’t that difficult - you’re blowing it out of proportion. Many more people will see Naxx this time around.
---
That was an extremely accurate and fair characterization of Druid in vanilla, something I'm not used to seeing. Anyone considering the class should definitely read up on that doc.
---
Which is why I quit.
---
When we got something much worse, yes.
---
You should read the comment chain again mate :p
---
Nice, an elitist and a troll! 
---
Can I request for your next post to be about how layering will ruin the game unless your idea on how to fix it is implemented?
---
I start my next college semester right about when it comes out. My grades are screwed lol
---
Does that not mean you are in the Beta?
---
In essence, if a moonkin wants to deal half the damage of a mage, it needs to use mana intensive spells. It goes oom, and has to beat the boss with its fancy ~~Sulfuras~~ staff while mana is regenerated.
---
Fucking good, then. That means classic is popular enough to warrant it. They can work on realm transfers if it gets to be too much.
---
Shit, I was really hoping my detailed accounting of our plan would be forgotten after I deleted it.
---
Is the wise thing, then, holding onto mats and other consumables until they are worth a reasonable amount? If you only get a little more than the vendor price, what’s the point of selling. It won’t be substantial to your coin purse and you will lose out on the potential money later on.
---
Lol, huh? Most pserver players just love the game and are waiting to pay their 15 a month.
---
That is a possibility. And same can occur with non-layering ..... the entire 3K cap starts on some legacy named server. Happens the entire week. So when weekend comes everyone is trying to log in at once.
---
[https://youtu.be/xrJ56pzDExc?t=46](https://youtu.be/xrJ56pzDExc?t=46)
---
&gt;Most of you will never see the inside of ZG/AQ
---
Dude, my raid leader would get high as fuck and pass out mid raid. We had AQ and ZG on farm....
---
If Blizzard doesn’t rush new content after dropping Naxx, there’s no reason even the most casual guilds can’t eventually clear it (talking a year after Naxx drop).
---
Everyone needs to stop acting like raiding in Classic is the hardest fucking thing known to man. The hardest part of raiding is just get 40 people and making sure they are at their keyboards when you’re pulling the boss.
---
It's going to be a huge shock to the system from people have never experienced the game that's for sure. If I wasn't so excited to play I would probably give it's a month or so before i started levelling. But since I'm only popping onto overwatch now and again as I have nothing else to play, I may aswell strike while the iron is hot.
---
&gt;The suggestions I have seen are that they should have a server being hacked up into layers and you choose which one to join during character creation. So you join Emerald Dream layer 1, Emerald Dream layer 2, Emerald Dream  layer 3 etc during character creation and can never leave it. Then when less people are playing Blizzard merges the layers incrementally. This seems like a great suggestion in my eyes.
---
I thought this is what layering is... if it's not then what the fuck is layering? I'm more confused than ever.
---
WoW hit 100m accounts in ***2014***, it peaked at 13m in WotLK, and is somewhere around 500k-2m right now. Classic launch will probably see WoW hit its all time subscriber peak, if even a fraction of those some back.
---
You stupid.
---
I soloed Naxx in 04 lmao it's so ez
---
Some of these things happened pre cata
---
Imo there were changes in all the xpacs that weren't exactly perfect, definitely became a steeper slope around cata / MOP imo
---
Glad we get a (somewhat) clean slate! :D
---
You tried
---
Your negativity is so representative of Retail, and doesn't have any meaning to anyone who ever did original WoW. 
---
We know it will be hard. That's part of the excitement. We know it will take time. I don't want to zerg for a month and have nothing to do. 
---
And we know many people won't see end game content. It takes serious effort. But that's okay. That's how it was. 
---
We know that, and we're ready for it. Snowflakes need not apply.
---
Play during the next stress test. July 17th or 18th. It'll give you a chance to test stuff out.
---
Yeah same, i got my sub up cause classic recently, decided to play my 70 twink, 30 hours roaming around OL and northrend later I found like 2 ppl, even with sharding the world is dead.
---
PSA: Blizzard has never been clear on the exact reason they're implementing layering. They have mentioned long term population. They have also mentioned server stability. Launch day load problems. And I'm sure I've missed other things.
---
Also, I think you might be misunderstanding at least some of those people. If you were to allow 9000 people to log into a server concurrently to avoid later population issues and didn't use layering, the game would be unplayable. You cannot have 1500 people in Dun Morogh and find a trogg to kill.
---
Huh, what kinds of quest items are you talking about. Is it possible to learn this power??
---
We can already say this. It’s already over with. For example, I think the first level 60 was Xenif.
---
Tauren Warriors are awesome! That extra melee range is nice, especially with leeway. Plus they look menacing in gear.
---
That was how raiding was. If you want to see actual skill then look at current mythic content.
---
That is sooooo gay, but each to their own 😂
---
They do, and they have. Its why private servers are so successful.
---
If you dont like the population, roll on a different realm. Changing the very fabric of reality makes for a bad experience long term and hurts the integrity of the world like Kevin mentions in the video OP posted
---
Tbh, if they care what "bfa activision fan boys" think, Blizz alredy fcked up.
---
Gear is very limited and you don’t want to waste decent gear on bad specs for the raids that aren’t as easy.
---
Unless people are really totally unfamiliar with the fights,a decently geared raid of 40 can do it.  The problem was always getting 40 people together, and then folks would try to short man it and end up failing a lot.
---
I agree with OP.
---
I disagree, I think with the the amount of time/knowledge of raids that eventually casual content will be able to clear most of the content provided over time. Eventually casual players will get geared enough and will either prepare for raids or run them enough till they eventually pass. Not to mention hardcore raiders/guilds will offer to run people through them. I would say the casual crowd will be a phase or 2 behind the hardcore crowd.
---
They are also less common so you get +1 uniqueness points. And female NE Priests look amazing in Priest gear.
---
Check out Project 1999. It will get you into the grinding mindset for sure and if you haven't tried EQ1 it's fun to see where a lot of things in WoW came from.
---
That level cap idea is interesting, but it would need to be much higher than that.  If Blizz is doing it right, each server will have like 50,000 players on release.    You would need that cap to be like 50, or maybe even 60.
---
Whatever you say bud! Ya know, you keep saying that, but there is nothing substantial, lending credibility to my claim that you are just being a jackass for the sake of being a jackass. Either say something that is contributing to a conversation, or just go away.
---
They may not track world firsts, but they've tracked and rewarded realm firsts many times over the years.
---
I encountered a cheater who never took damage and never lost their win streak. Really took the wind out of its sails. It also just felt hugely non interactive with no chat, only the obnoxious "yo" thing.
---
I'm generally in the DotA &gt; LoL camp, but so far team fight tactics has been *leagues* better than underlords. Chat, avatars, emotes (requires you unlock them).
---
Pacing just feels tighter too. Not sure if that's because of timers or round lengths or what
---
Oh true, can you post a link to your armory page for that character?
---
RemindMe! 52 days
---
It’s a shame it’s not well implemented into WoW. I would 100% outfit a paladin/warrior in that gear.
---
It is implemented because of forced overpopulation, which is used to counter attrition.
---
Well, as a support character, do people really not take into account the crit buff? Sure you are not high on dps, but you help the raid in other ways.
---
But, can't you just downrank until you stop having crazy mana problems? Or does that really just ruin your dps that much? Just curious.
---
Bro the point is you can still heal raid without Mana Tide and a 2.5s HW so you can then go PvP without paying to respec every single time. Are you the best healer in this spec? No, but if you're not hindering progression most guilds won't care. In P1-3 on Classic you can quite easily get away with doing this because the reason you wipe on bosses won't be because 1 of your shamans doesn't have a half second faster HW and you will likely have enough Mana Tides anyways. The whole point of this spec isn't to be optimal at anything but to be sufficient enough at both pve healing and hybrid PVP without spending 120g every day.
---
Warrior -
---
BiS Race: Troll/Orc if Horde, Human is Alliance
---
Best tank in the game, top 3 DPS in the game as well with fury, PVP monster
---
Hunter -
---
Fastest leveling in the game, required for some early raids, falls off late game as pets do not scale
---
Orc is BiS race because of pet damage racial, stun resist, people can argue for troll tho
---
Dwarf is best alliance race
---
Full BM is the bg pvp spec and MM is for PvE
---
Shaman - Horde only Troll is better for PvE, Orc for PvP
---
You pretty much have to heal if you wanna raid, so resto is your choice. Ele can be good in PvP tho but takes gear which takes raiding
---
Did they announce officially that layer hopping is going into the live game and is intended ? I haven’t seen any devs say that .
---
There’s been clips of it
---
I'm not sure I understand the point of putting layering into the game if it only lasts a week.
---
Ever quest progression servers as used In the above post
---
I have been able to fly directly from Ratchet to Org on numerous vanilla private servers but I guess that was not blizzlike.
---
Not to mention Battle for Nazjatar event is just stacking on the shard/layer your faction is winning.
---
Phasing is cancer, I couldn't agree more with anyone. Even world PvP sometimes looks like you are fighting someone, chase them and out of nowhere come "stealthed" paladins, priests, warriors and shamans. World PvP in BFA is a fucking joke.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
What about evil? How does that enter the system?
---
Idk what you mean warrior was g8 you don’t die 1v2 mobs at full hp since human come with shield and sword
---
I really really really really really really really want to, but after having beta and still only being level 22, I can’t justify the cost expenditure when I have almost zero time to play. I think I’ve got about 14-16 hours played on the beta and each of them have been sweet, but between work and family and a 2 year old, it’s not happening I don’t think. That $15 a month can go towards half a box of diapers instead of my computer lol
---
No, you are talking about private servers not classic wow.
---
yes. currently in the beta it is allowing you to mail up to 12 items at once. each item costs 30 copper. So if you fill all 12 slots, it will cost you 3 silver 60 copper to mail.
---
Username checks out.
---
Cause you had either beta or stress test
---
Thing is, people tend to define "addiction" very loosely.
---
I only consider something an "addiction" if it is causing a serious negative impact on other parts of your life.
---
Playing a videogame for 2-3 hours a day and being otherwise fine is not an addiction.
---
Thanks so much bro
---
We brought it with us
---
Then why bother with ED 1, ED 2, etc? Just do what retail does and merge the smallest realms, like Lightninghoof, Maelstrom, and VentureCo are all considered 1 realm and players from one can join guilds from all 3 realms. That solves the name problem too, since you just get the -ServerName surname.
---
&gt;Orc on a felsteed = fat kid on a pony.
---
This made me LOL irl, thank you!
---
Vanilla launch and private servers are nothing like modern blizzard servers. You’re just trying to play victim instead of understanding something well beyond your comprehension.
---
There were not many gold carries for instance completion strictly speaking. Item drops were exceedingly rare (4-5 per boss per 40 man raid) and we didn’t sell gear on carries because even by the end of Vanilla we still had loads of people who still needed items from every major raid.
---
You need to change your resolution. Get the easyres app from appstore and take off retina, set scale in game to 100%. Guaranteed will run it better. FWIW I’ve played WoW on MacBooks. It’s not that taxing. People hate macs and while they’re not great for gaming, they can run WoW just fine.
---
Land O' Lakes +1
---
No. It's under "live" category. Furthermore I have no active subscription and when I start the game it says "No servers available "
---
Idk. Still get kite to death by Mage or hunter in open world. Sheep your gap and eat/drink
---
Warriors are very stoppable.
---
&gt;They have said that layering will only be for the first 3 weeks of launch
---
So your claim is that Blizzard have confirmed that layering will only be used for a maximum of 3 weeks?
---
Can you show me where they said that?
---
Just a straight up lie.
---
Can you point me to the worship? I just said he's gotta look out for himself cause his skills are worth a lot of money. Just like anyone else who's really fucking good at something should charge for their service rather than give it out for "free" out of the goodness of their heart. 
---
But sure, read into it whatever entertains you. If appreciating a man for his extraordinary competence of his craft is "cultish Jesus worship" to you, then you clearly got no skill going for yourself. If you did, you'd know how to detect and be aware of why others extraordinary skills deserve extraordinary praise.
---
Koreans don’t farm gold, the Chinese do. Ni hao.
---
I started right when TBC came out and stopped some time during WOTLK.  I'm actually most excited to play Vanilla raid content that got ignored when the expansions came out.
---
Warrior is gear dependent and a little hard to play solo, but can be very rewarding and nothing gives you that big bruiser feeling like warrior. I don’t know a lot about hunter. If you are leaning towards raiding in endgame shaman will be a be a healer only but is super fun throwing out totems, and can be very rewarding.
---
What happens when you MC helmet somebody with engineering as a hunter or warlock that already has an active pet?
---
Wow that’s a lot to take in and consider. Thanks a bunch for the help
---
I'll add my Holy Paladin notes:
---
20/0/31 does very well. It requires a bit more gear than 20/31/0 or 25/26/0 to do well imo, but adds another alternative to smack people as a healer in later phases of the game if you get bored of Holy/Prot talents.
---
This is because mobs have melee Leeway as well as players. 
---
#Remove Leeway Blizzard. Thank you &lt;3
---
World first you need a solid 5 man. All different classes, doing certain quests and ABP：always be pulling.
---
Classic+ doesn't necessarily mean new raid content that is more difficult than Naxx. It just means new content beyond what we had in Vanilla.
---
It's honestly baffling to me how anyone thought sharding was a good idea. Am I just crazy or could the amount of time and money blizzard spent developing the tech could have been better used improving server infrastructure? What possessed them to chop up the game into little shards where you never see the same person twice?
---
You should be thanked more often. So thank you!!
---
Ok thanks. And vendoring shit crafted items is really more profitable ? Than selling the mats ?
---
What percentage of the playerbase do you think cleared AQ40?
---
Yeah, no. We've talked about it before. There's no solution to this problem that wouldn't be anti-player in some way. Kevin hinted that login queues had a “certain charm” about them, which points you to where his mind is at.
---
Login queues are completely anti-player though, so whenever I've tried to press him on that opinion he dodges. Understandably so. It's a fucking moronic opinion for a dev to have.
---
Facts:
---
Have you seen Test Server 3 and 15 ... they had extreme settings and server 3 was virtually empty in starting areas were server 15 was a shit show ..... setting matter.
---
Dynamic re-spawn has proven to be the worst solution ever by every private server launch. The leveling becomes finding a spot where 1-2 mobs spawn and chain killing them for 2-3 levels ...... fun game play.
---
Multiple servers at a launch would have 200-400 servers that will statistically end up either under or over populated. 
---
Layering is simply a lesser of all evils.
---
Just cause Pride Month is over doesn’t mean this is cool.
---
That's not the problem they are trying to solve with layering.
---
I think MMOs need reimagined. In 2004/5 the world was massive. Its not anymore it needs to be made MASSIVE again
---
According to my calculations, the exact amount of time you should wait after launch to ensure a decently populated server is 3 days 16 hours 27 minutes and 59 seconds. Set your timer.
---
Ok. But they don’t actually track it themselves. 
---
Tell me where you go to see who got world first kills? Is it a blizzard site or a 3rd party?
---
Dynamic spawns
---
\&gt;The hardest part of raiding is just getting 40 people and making sure they are at their keyboards when you’re pulling the boss 
---
I can attest to that one.
---
Yup. Ive played warrior forever so if you got WAR questions I got answers lol
---
&gt;The problem is within the first 1-2 weeks where its only going to be the very most hardcore people that can do this farm.
---
How is that different though?   5 servers 5 layers.   It's the same fucking thing.  You will have a few people get lots of endgame supplies early, because they got to max level quick.
---
Yeah, he's getting shit on but something like a total of 65 guilds in the entire world cleared Naxx worldwide out of what, 10 million players?
---
You already answered your own question. No one starts with gold, it is created literally 1 copper at a time.
---
You have thousands of people vendoring junk, quest rewards, old gear and getting money from quest rewards. That is where all the gold on a server actually comes from. 
---
An item's worth is determined by its rarity yes, but also priced based on the economy. If an epic boe worth 1k during Vanilla dropped the 1st month of classic's release no one would have the kind of gold so it would be impossible to sell it for 1k. 
---
Now if the same item drops 3 months after release yeah sure you can sell it for 1k as more gold has been generated and is now flowing between people.
---
If we don't and the launch week is a disaster it could significantly affect the health of the entire game .... so yes this entire layering debate is about a few servers that will have population issues after week 2.
---
If Blizzard isn't releasing new servers like you can expect a constant stream of new players on the existing ones. If you use sharding like in your example, there will be no server community at all. It will be like today, where absolutely nothing you do matters. It's the worst thing that can happen to classic. Sharding isn't the answer. 
---
The steps Blizz needs to take:
---
1. start with a LOW amount of servers
---
2. ignore the temptation to launch dozens of new ones
---
(2.5 ok keep the fricking sharding for the starting zones so everyone can play even though servers are packed)
---
3. wait until the majority is between 25-40 and numbers will drop like crazy
---
4. but because you didn't launch 80 new servers, it's still enough
---
without sharding.
---
Maybe mage? Out of the ones you've listed mage will be the fastest by far. This isn't even up for debate.
---
**&lt;Gammal och Horde&gt; | Horde | EU/SWE | PvP Server | Semi-Casualcore** 
---
**Raid Times:** Wednesday and Sundays, around 19.00-22.30 TBD thou. 
---
**About us:** Gammal och Horde is a Swedish guild. It all started with just a few friends that wanted to play some wow classic with friends. And then friends invited friends, and they invited their friends and so on. Some of the members where recruited after some heavy drinking. And what do you talk about when you are drunk?   
---
That’s right wow classic.
---
Most of our members are +25-35, and a few around 40-50. And some young guns waiting to experience wow classic for the first time, they might get the rank “Vanilla Cherry Coke”.ATM we are 108 members, and in some manner all members knows someone in the guild. But not all members want to raid, atm we are 50 raiders and we need to fill in the gaps with some fantastic people. 
---
**Our Aim:** First and foremost, we want a thriving community, where people are having fun and bashing your friends.  We´ve had one meet-up so far and the next one is planned for the weekend before release. And to take it to the next level of Hype/Nerdiness we have prepared guild T-shirts that some of us are going to wear. 
---
We aim to be  “casualcore” (is that even a word?), so when we raid its all serious business so that we can achieve as much as possible in short time. And experience all the raid content.But since people have obligations and family, we don’t demand 100% attendance. So if you only can attend once a week that’s ok. We are aiming to start raiding around 12 weeks after release (maybe earlier if we have the numbers), but if you need more time to level that’s ok.
---
Some of us are going hardcore for the first week, taking some vacation days. But not everyone can do that.The leadership of the guild have experience through all Classic content, and past raiding tiers and expansions.

I'll be excited to see his farming guides as Prot again.

Ma’am chill out for a second, I gave you the info to look up and study. It’s info that will help you understand how a economy gets started. If you don’t want to read it because those concepts are too hard for you to understand, then I can spoon feed you the answer
---
First time ill be subbed for more than 5 months in arow since probably cata. Took a break every expansion at some point, usually more than 1. Lets go baby. Im hyped.
---
Just remember to stay hydrated my friend! Keep a bottle of water next to you while you play! Also maybe when you are doing big crafting amounts you can start it and then get up and walk around for a second and return to your keyboard when the crafting is finished. 
---
I don’t mean to sound like an ass, or a health nut, but for real you will enjoy doing longer sessions if you make sure to get up every now and then and stay hydrated
---
It's a brainless drone or a blizzard shill mate, either way nothing to be gained.

Layering has already damaged world pvp on beta. It's the biggest cop-out/blue-ball mechanic to deal with a server population problems.

 &lt;Regicide&gt; | Alliance | NA | PvP | Semi-Hardcore  Regicide is a semi hardcore guild born out of a love for the game as it was. A group of people in love with the world and community that was created by Blizzard back in ‘04. We seek to be among some of the higher guilds on the server through raiding and in our world pvp. We are seeking raiders as well as some officer positions available. Socials are welcome, whether it be to be part of a community or you just need some help every once and a while with quests. Come join us!  
---
Expectations: We expect that raiders keep up with the pack when it comes to early leveling and reach level 60 within a week or two of the first 60’s. You will get out of this guild and experience as much as you put in. If you want to be near the top then you are expected to help with prep as well as basic help around the guild.   
---
The ONLY set in stone rule: Don’t be a dick. Respect one another, and speak with officers if issues arise. The last thing we need is turmoil that is hidden from everyone just to explode at random.  
---

Agreed. People who are like "oh it didnt take that long" are just trolls or stupid and dont realize how far the internet has come with all the guides and youtube videos. Almost non of which we had access to at launch.
---
AFAIK everquest isn't a fair comparison as its not a game being revived and played alongside a more modern release, like runescape and wow.
---
Everquest just gets new servers for people to start on, and people go there to start fresh.
---
Technically the same as the servers lose players, but not because people quit.
---
I think, vanilla had enough content for them to not have to do this, and thus can keep a steady players base without losing that same amount of players, for about two years, that is when they will have to either make new content with the vanilla game design, similar to osrs. Or start new progression servers like everquest.
---
Personally I would prefer the former. There were so many things in vanilla that never got realised.
---
its kinda easy tbh, just learn the spells that are necessary for your class  
---
pick skinning and buy big bags at the beginning.  i got 140g when i hit 40 on a privat server.
---
Mm, having raided hardcore vanilla-Cata, the amount of information available definitely saw a significant increase in TBC. That and smaller raid sizes really accelerated your average WoW raider's ability to properly deal with mechanics (as the smaller raids lead to heavy cuts amongst the largest group of players in Vanilla raiding - the 25-30 idiots running behind the 10-15 capable players). 
---
In Vanilla, IIRC, yea we had forum posts and rough outlines, but if you were a 'progression guild' (i.e - clearing the currently released raid), you were definitely learning shit as you went, even if you had a rough idea of what was supposed to happen in the fight. To your point tho - coordinating 40 people was such a difficult task in of itself, that tweaks were always needed to be made to a 'known strategy' to accommodate your specific group of 15 capable players and 25 headless chickens.
---
Ooh, I've always thought that icon was one half of a skull looking helmet.
---
&gt; Layers are basically servers. Servers are digital now... 
---
Ughhh the absolute state of Classic.
---
Joana also can't stay up for days on end because of a potentially life threatening heart condition which he needs to carefully manage through proper dieting, rest and exercise.
---
I can’t play TFT yet unfortunately.  I haven’t encountered any cheaters yet either in DU.  The game definitely has its problems, but I’m still having fun for what it is atm.  I definitely would love some chat features too.  
---
The genre in general is very interesting and I’m excited to see how both companies continue to develop it.
---
What does that have to do with levelling a warrior lol
---
Do I need a beefy laptop to run wow?
---
Fuck yourself. I’m still on trending and you’re not
---
Do you know about the slippery slope and how it's supposedly a fallacy? You are providing strong evidence against this 'fact' with the way you are talking.
---
If any guild runs 4 nights run. Even when naxx drops all instances can be easily cleared in 3. 2 long nights of 4-5 hours or 3 at 3-4 hours is common.
---
We sold MC/BWL and eventually AQ40 runs (max 5 slots for that).  The gold was used to guide provide consumables, repair bills, and tier crafting mats for tier pieces.   
---
MC was pretty cheap as they were just extra dps on binding/eye farms  
---
BWL we'd take up to 1/class with drops for 200-800g per piece   
---
AQ40 was 2500 for a full 2.5 set (provide your own idols and scarabs)    other pieces went for up to 1200
---
What if they layer Naxx?
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Or just didn’t feel like using it
---
I like how it looks like in 3D. After all, it was probably created in 2002 (despite the release being in 2004). One thing I like about Vanilla over Retail is the outdated graphics - they left a whole lot to the imagination. Whereas with Retail, everything is already "imagined" for you.
---
There will be plenty of dedicated players hitting 60 around the 4 day played mark, even on slower classes.
---
Expect world first 60 by Friday morning after release.
---
All the raids are braindead easy. Anyone that wants to clear naxx easily will now
---
When it's different servers you wouldn't meet him at all, no problem. You stick with the players on that server all the time. With layers you will have less chance to see someone you met earlier
---
You can see the realm first achievements on Blizzard's site so... it is a blizzard site.
---
&gt; I'm really perplexed by folks on here that expect full DM Trib runs for the buffs before raids start. Why spend all that time to gain some time off your clear of Naxx? Hell... you'd probably save time overall by skipping those runs and just doing Naxx 
---
Elitism and such competitiveness just equals silliness here, specially for a PvE game which content has been proven to be doable by casual / semi-hardcore players.
---
The funniest is that, on one side there are players who are coming back to Classic because apparently retail is too focused on content and efficiency, with no social interaction. And on the other side, pservers elitist players, that actually are from the exact same criticized mentality, will play Classic because of stability and permanence of their characters.
---

---
So you're just wrong.
---
No one will have (or want to) spend gold early on.  Everyone will want their 40 mount asap and then also want epic mount at max level which will make them stingy.  Raw gold(gold that comes from the game not from other players) will be the most important at release and for a while after.
---
Sure, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYuUD0o-Nz8&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=236
---
What percentage of the playerbase had years of the server running after AQ40 was released?
---
Exactly. My guild cleared AQ40 but we only dived into Naxx trash. Never downed a single boss.
---
wasn't going to, till u told me not to
---
This is because no one knew what they were doing and TBC was released very soon after. With world buffs and new knowledge anyone that wants to clear will
---
I'm already at 50% resolution.
---
Tbh, in classic it was because most people didnt really bother to go for endgame raiding for many reasons. What percentage of people going back are looking for super casual 'omg I'm in azeroth'. I'd imagine most people actually interested in going back intend to do pvp or endgame raiding as opposed to stv Fishing contest and farming all day
---
It's not just lotus though is it, it's literally everything. 
---
Semi-hardcore, not 1%ers but just above average players who like to be competitive will have all the resources they need to last them the rest of the game by the time layering ends.
---
&gt;Because the layers are going to disapear eventually but not the mats farmed from them? 
---
That's still the fucking same if there were 10 layers or 10 servers that eventually had to be merged.
---
Yeah, you could as long as you put some points into prot for a few of the earlier talents, like increased threat. Most tanks eventually specced more fury than prot, since the later prot talents weren’t great.
---
Iirc Shield Slam is actually kind of worth it in 1.12 though. It got some big buffs towards the end of the classic patch cycle. 
---
DPS warriors are always welcome though. You need a bunch of offtanks in some of the classic wow raids, for certain fights, but you’d be dpsing for the other fights that don’t. Warrior dps scaled absurdly well, too. More damage from gear meant more rage generation which meant more damage, etc. Hordies had some threat issues, but alliance just got the threat reducing blessing and went ham.
---
because it didn't exist then, I think it was a cataclysm addition idk for sure I quit around then.
---
What? In both cases they are already “imagined” for you in their 3D form...
---
On trending with some retarded pandering picture woohoo what a champ, you gonna tell your mom about it?
---
You must dismiss you're pet first
---
Not sure if it just doesn't work
---
Or if it uses the cooldown and fails
---
No, this an arrogant point of view. There's a lot of retail players who know nothing of organizing a 40-man raid. How many consumes were needed, etc. Yes there are lots of private server players and experienced vanilla players still. But assuming all those people were stupid back in the day is just arrogant and wrong. We also have 15 years of videos, strat guides and the like to help people now. We figured that shit out on our own 15 years ago. Having played on private servers for 3 years now I can tell you people are just as good at fucking up raids as they've always been.
---
No one said i was up for merging servers either? There are other solutions just so you know.
---
I'm a grown ass man (37) ain't going to stratch shit
---
Do mods remove troll posts in this sub?
---
That’s only the case because on beta there have been 2 max levels already. Of course with BiS level 30 gear and a shit ton of consumables and grenades from engi you’re gonna be faster at dungeon grinding. That’s not gonna be the case for actual classic. Since no one will grind bis for level 30 and the amount of consumables used in those beta runs.
---
The point still probably applies if you use AQ40.
---
Well you nailed it
---
Watch the film
---
Wolves scale a little bit, I believe.  Taurens still look disproportionate riding them though.
---
I mean, I still think the point applies for AQ40. 
---
I'd bet less than 1% of the playerbase killed a single boss in there, let alone cleared it.
---
Because then you end up with a bunch of dead servers, which kills the game.
---
We made it to naxx in nostalrius we can do it again troll
---
Tier 6 would like a word.
---
The video takes the dungeon xp/h estimate from runs at lvl 20.
---
No you
---
It was also only out for 6 months. And most people took the first year of WoW being out to even figure out where MC was.
---
No I'm talking about classic wow
---
Loved Pandaria!
---
I was curious about this. If it’s built on Legion, won’t it require more of computers than what it required in the past?
---
It converts experience to gold when you're maxed out and I dont think grey quests give experience therefore I think only green and above reward gold..
---
Could be wrong though
---
&gt; When it's different servers you wouldn't meet him at all, no problem 
---
Yeah, and then the tourists leave, the servers get merged, and now I'm playing with a server which is 75% strangers. Or, it's a big server the launches with two hour queues and 1500 people in Northshire.
---
Stop, think for a second. These posts always ***describe the problems Blizzard is trying to solve*** by offering them up as solutions and saying "no problem". No, they're *exactly* the problem, it's why this discussion exists in the first place.
---
Yes, but if server population is going lower. You will need to merge layers -&gt; force people into another layer. Breaking the immersion.
---
Thanks, I just noticed. What does this entail? Who do I thank? Who do I look down upon from now on? All of this is new to me.
---
Vanilla =/= Classic.
---
Nice try though
---
They are, but with the outdated graphics the quality is low enough for you to know that they could've looked a lot better and you probably imagine in your mind how they would've looked.
---
With Retail, the graphics are sort of reaching the peak point. Even if Retail gets to exist for 15 more years, I can hardly imagine the graphics getting substantially better than what they already look like. Since Cataclysm, the most remarkable changes were shadows and the new water, as well as models with higher resolution textures and a bit more polygons.
---
But if you look at, for example Female Human from 15m distance, there won't be much noticeable difference. In fact, most people play with the camera really zoomed out so it kinda defeats the purpose of the improved graphics.
---
Yup that's exactly mynplan at least. I will likely be leveling my bank alt to 5 and then all the way up to 35 as needed for Skilling up.
---
Good luck getting gear when you are the guy who never shows up with consumes.
---
So, rather than just saying "it will be screwed", how will it be screwed?  I'm really wondering what everyone sees will get screwed in the economy.  We're all just putting on our economy hats, but is there some evidence to layered vs non-layered (outside of saying one person is going to farm 4x materials, doesn't mean that they are going to be the only person farming either).
---
I mean, were you even there for release?  It was a complete shit show.
---
Many pserver launches had dynamic respawn in place which made the leveling almost the opposite as Classic Beta. On pservers the best strategy was to just camp a single non-named mob spawn and grind that out to get out of the starting zone as soon as possible. Named quest mobs still had long respawn time. In Classic regular mobs have long respawn time while the named one's are quick.
---
In the words of the dude
---
"You're not wrong Walter. You're just an asshole."
---
what you said is probably true, most folks wont even get close to clearing Naxx, but you dont have to be super condescending about it 
---
Now on to classic plus, how says it needs to be just high end raid content? there is room for more zones and dungeons and all manner of stuff
---
Okay, are you playing BFA or Vanilla Beta or Stress Test? What graphical settings are you on? Do you have any aliasing enabled?
---
nothing. just that shaman are the go-to for multiboxers, so i assume it would be pretty fast.
---
On the nose. It's kids that are hyped vs nostalgic adults. And the kids will always outnumber the adults.
---
yeah but thats really really hard lol
---
&gt;anyone in the middle of combat or a quest in layer 3 is going to be mad when they get moved
---
Well that's pretty much what is happening right now in the stress test and beta, so reducing this event to a minimum is the goal here. But yeah I agree with you, some kind of warning would be nice so you don't get caught in the middle of a mob camp and die because of it, as it happened to me already more than once in the stress test.
---
&gt; I really want to get into the 'wow experience' and begin playing asap. Is there anything that I should try first? 
---
Not really it is it's own beast, not even Retail wow ill prepare you, retail is a completely different game with a similar name.
---
&gt;Should I try going on a private server before wow classic comes out? 
---
There are so many things that are wrong on Private servers, the best they can do is give you an idea about what it would be like, and where quests are picked up and turned in.
---
XP rates, Rep Rates, Drop Rates, proc rates,  For some classes even their base damage is off on private servers. Pretty much if it's on the client it's right, if it's on the server, it's somebody guess, or it's extrapolated from an old video with crappy resolution.
---
What would really suck, is getting used to how private servers work, and then being disappointed by the real thing, because "that's now how it works on private servers".
---
&gt;How do I pick my race and class? 
---
For race, it really boils down to, are you a min/maxer? then google for best race for the class your interested in and you'll get an opinion.  Otherwise, it's better to pick something you like looking at. You are going to put hundreds of hours into this character,  So make sure it's something you don't mind looking at.   
---
For Classes, that's difficult.  What most of us do/did was get a list of serveral classes we would like to play, and leveled them up to 20 or so.  Then work your way down the list leveling each in turn.  After 20 you should have a good idea if you like the mechanics of the class,  And you should be able to pick one.
---
&gt;How do raiding and guilds work in a simple sense? I feel like when I try to look up and find these answers online many of the terms and whatnot go over my head.
---
Basically, a raid, is just a collection of groups. doing the same dungeon.  Normally if your into "raiding" you join a Riaiding guild,  which will most likely have set times every week that they raid.  As the guild raiding group gets more and more gear and experiance, it becomes easier and easier for them to go further or faster.
---
Unfortunately, not all classes and all specs are appreciated in raids, in general if your class can heal, your going to be a healer when your in a raid.  Mobs have debuffs slots so if you are a DOT (Damage Over Time) spec'd (specialized talents) then your going to be competing for a very limited role against a ton of others that want to do the same thing.
---
So your going to either spend a ton of gold changing your talents between what you like to run around playing and what your raid wants/needs.  Which means your going to need to farm tons of gold when you aren't raiding to afford a "dual" lifestyle. or your going to have to learn to use your raid spec under not ideal circumstances.
---
Deviate Growth Cap
---
why blizzard WHY
---
Just because you were shit in vanilla doesn't mean people here will be buddy.
---
Got em!
---
So where does he confirm that layering will be used for maximum of 3 weeks in that video?
---
I won't mind better graphics. I'm here for the gameplay, not reproducing bad graphics, lag etc.
---
The price of player sold items are impacted by inflation while static NPC sold items aren’t.  So an epic mount is far more difficult to get within the first month of release than it will be after the first year.
---
Using your example, an Orb of Deception may go for 100 gold within the first month.  I doubt it’ll ever sell for the 2,000 gold you’ve mentioned, but as with all sought after player sold items, it’s price will continually climb as more gold enters the economy.
---
Actually, a elemental/restoration shaman can run a single spec to heal and dps in PvP. In just preraid blues, it has some of the highest burst of any class.
---
Ditto.
---
Better 500 than 5,000.  So yes, it does help quite a bit.
---
I agree with his overall statement but he came off as a Richard
---
So hyped!! :D
---
You're right, where is my alliance belly button ring.
---
Blizzard will also tweet about many World Firsts.
---
Meanwhile that Huawei machine is stealing all your Blizzard Passwords and selling them to the Russians....who are interfering with our layers and AH economy.
---
And it's clear that the two people grouped are in different layers? Do you have a link to any of these videos?
---
End of wrath was a burn out, ruby sanctum was garbage filled. Was decently pumped for cata but a little worried about story and dungeon finder and upcoming talk of changes. And well ya... quit probably 3 months after launch and came back for MOP and rinse and repeat.
---
Did play a bit more of legion which was alright. BFA go fuck yourself. Thank God for classic!
---
I envy you
---
Could be, yo. Shit was like-15 yrs ago. Lol
---
Warriors are primarily tanks - you get the attention of the bad guys, and keep it, while they pound on your face. Later in the game (max level/end game) warriors are also some of the best Damage Dealers, but take an incredible amount of late-game gear to do so.
---
Hunters are great at playing solo, you have a pet that can keep attention on the monsters you fight, and you have lots of tools to both keep yourself alive, and do a good amount of damage. Late game your damage will taper off a bit and you'll be more of a utility class than a pure damage dealer, though you will still shoot stuff from far away.
---
Shamans are very diverse. I mained a shaman in vanilla - you can heal - as the best multi-person healer in the game, you will always be wanted in groups/raids. Your totems bring a lot of flexibility and diversity as well, you have the ability to buff many different types of groups (healers, tanks, damage dealers, melee damage dealers etc...) Everyone wants a shaman in their group! You'll struggle, if you stay in a deep healing specialization, to solo a bunch of content for farming purposes, but deep healing specs aren't necessary to be competitive until later on in the end-game raids.
---
Its both. From some early quests

&gt;Arthas's numbers are overwhelming. But with a New Plague we could eradicate both the Scourge Army *and the Human infestation* once and for all.

---
Hot pockets and mountain dew. The feast for kings....
---
Are there any other examples? In order for this to seem plausible (and I’m not doubting the #s provided) you need to have a well oiled group who all know exactly what they’re doing for this to succeed. Plus, from what I took away from it, theres gotta be group of 5 people who are constantly playing together and have the same time restrictions/lack there of. I don’t know about anyone else, but I don’t have friends and not planning on trying to arrange a group every time I log on.
---
This here pretty much. Yes, the graphics are designed and implemented for us, but it's done in a way that it paints a silhouette for the mind's eye to fill in.
---
You seem to think that the Server will lvl up homogeniously. Which it won't. There will be 50 people at lvl 60 after 4 days and they got a whooping 10 layers to farm. So that's a lot more Mats than what these 50 People would have without layering, because they'd still roll on the same Server, and they still wouldn't be in the Queue because they don't log out.
---
That’s better.
---
I'm with you both but I can see how it would hurt player retention even more for a bunch of reasons, people who can't afford to buy anything cause the prices are jacked up by the guys who have it all are going to get sick.
---
The smart people like us who farm everything we need for the rest of the game will get to raidlog status even faster cause theres no reason to log on so thats even less people online.
---
Also the fact layering exists at all could turn a lot of people off who aren't as clued up about whats going and people just start dissapearing around them etc. old returning players might not know it's going away eventually as well.
---
Yeah it really looks like it is working the exact same way, in practice.
---
&gt; Your negativity is so representative of Retail, and doesn't have any meaning to anyone who ever did original WoW.
---
I quit shortly after vanilla, but people on this sub make it sound like retail is a big, "everyone levels up instantly, every dungeon has an easy mode, and every class can do everything the same!" rainbow land.
---
For example, Level 20 locks who can sit in zones and summon them around to cut out all the travel time.
---
Merging servers and layering are the  only way to stop all the servers from being ghost towns, and killing the game off.  Layering does this infinitely better than server merging.
---
druids are a much easier alternative. They can tank just as well while leveling, they can heal, handle multiple mobs, they have CC, and they have increased travel speed. The warrior is just hard mode.  You'll have to level first aid too.
---
I hate myself so I'll be rolling a warrior anyways.
---
This is just false. Blizzard doesn’t wait until one Layer is full to create another. During the last stress test they aggressively Layered people. I never had more than ~50 people in my starting zone. And they asked for feedback on the leveling experience to better gauge when they should Layer people.
---
Honestly black temple set was tier 5 or tier 6? Because I still see a paladin wearing those shoulders literally every time I logon
---
Why do all rogue mains names start with P?
---
melee cleave is faster. no mana.
---
WOTLK was a good expansion, but I think what he's saying is that it is really when WoW started to take that turn into being more friendly to new players and more accessible for everyone, regardless of the time they put into the game. Cataclysm pronounced these changes much much more and finally topped it all off with LFR for Dragon Soul. To me, WOTLK kind of signaled a beginning to the end of what we once came to love WoW for.
---
No shit, right? Lol.
---
It could easily get better, but many people play with barely enough graphics cards, so they would lose more players.  One thing I would love for the to do is better cloaks.  Their cloaks are a joke.  Go take a look at FF14.
---
My 2 cents why layering sucks: because I want to people of MY server in MY game during questing, farming and PvP. I do NOT want to make Random XY "generic name" from Layer 853 whom I never met before and after. 
---
I want a freaking server community. 
---
Like in 2005.
---
This.
---
Wanted to do it "right" this time and tried warrior on a pserver and the stress tests, they're good but I just cannot get immersed in that class fantasy at all.
---
Dress healing for two nights a week so I can ret in BG's is fine by me lol
---
How is any of this on a different level?
---
15k online and 15k in queue, do you think blizzard servers will have higher capacity than that?
---
I don't think people would like that, because they would feel it killed the server identity?   idk.   It's certainly an idea.
---
Literally any healer can win a 1v1 against dps, but not all matchups are even.
---
Druids rely heavily on roots for all physical dmg dealers, so you better engage outdoors.  That in mind, druids have the best potential against most classes because they are the most well-rounded.  That said they don't have the edge against any single class.
---
Priests have a hard time against physical classes (especially warriors or undead), but they are pretty strong against other casters as mana burn will allow them to win a fight of attrition.
---
Shamans have nasty burst and can surprise dps who overextend themselves, but aside from nature's swiftness they don't have much for "oh shit" buttons.  Like the druid, they have an answer for everything and stand a decent chance against everyone (perhaps better against casters than melee though).
---
Paladins specialize in winning because their opponent gave up.  You will chip away at your opponent VERY slowly.  As long as you deny their ability to heal up, you have a good chance of winning.  If you don't feel like losing, bubble and heal to full... if you *really* don't feel like losing, use Lay on Hands.
---
Back in the day I used to duel quite a bit as a resto druid, and I won more often than not.  It truly is possible to outlast your opponent and win 1v1 as a healer.
---
I do think T6 is underrated. Gotta love the Lightbringer tag on it too, always imagined it was Uther's at some point, or at least modelled on him. But Judgement holds a special place in my heart as number 1, I'll never forget the day they brought the patch out that gave T2 sets the skins they had for the rest of Vanilla, all of the Paladins logging on and being mind blown by the helmet and other pieces, then the unfortunate few that had the legs only, and were just angry they had a skirt. Good times.
---
What will be fun is gold bids! 
---
I don’t think it’s going to be as big as it was in the end if wrath before because 
---
 1: more loot in general because more bosses, and what I mean by that is MOST of the loot is cheap and SOME of the loot is soooo expensive .
---
2: raids are hard and take a long time and needed a very coordinate group of almost 3/4 of the raid
---
Tbh i'm a speedrunner and i played on every launch and on beta and every stresstest etc. If you are good u find ways to avoid it. I made a route made for this which will make other players slow me down minimum. I was server first level 4 on recent private server release and top 5 level 15 (as rogue)
---
So a good speedrunner will find ways to pull ahead, they just cant go "the fastest" route possible for /played but instead figure out away around it.
---
Hint: Way around it is bosses (1 min respawn on beta/grouping/skipping low exp early quests, quests with instant respawn etc) Speedrunners that try to go for worldfirst will know every single quests respawn rate early on. Example i know pick in cave in valley = 7 sec, maps at centuar = 3 sec, admirals orders boss chest = 2 sec, lazy peons = 1.30 to 2 mins and u can do it in groups and much more. Just want to give u an idea about how tryhard some of us are :D
---
Many of those were bugs or oversights that have now been fixed. That's what beta's for!
---
and people, don't underestimate pickpocjeting everything you see. that helps a lot as a rogue. i never had problems getting a 40 mount, even when i buy weapons to keep my toon up to date
---
Seriously doubt they would do that.  They will wait until TBC classic to do that, assuming that's a thing.
---
Here's the thing; Vanilla WoW is perfect for a player like you. Pick whatever class you want to play the most. You don't need to go warlock or mage because you're not rushing to 60. Take your time and enjoy it. If that's on a warrior, that's fine too. Do dungeons, explore, just enjoy it. Pick what you want to immerse yourself in the most.
---
Yes, because at least 50% of wow subs are going to at least try classic out. That's 1.5 million if you consider the minimum 3 million reported subs.
---
Have you actually done naxx and AQ40? Because they aren’t as easy as you seem to think.
---
I demand you downvote me this instant.
---
Gotta say, I think the helmet is one of the coolest bits of the set, was proper psyched when i got it on female human back in the day.  The shoulders were ... strange though, especially considering how well they pulled off Redemption shoulders.
---
i like what people can build with transmogging. its such a great tool for RP reasons
---
My husband and i will be trying out classic. We already decided to never play BFA again. We haven't played since a week after bfa came out.
---
&gt; I'm confident that the developers Blizzard is currently employing would be perfectly able to faithfully execute the original Vanilla Vision without inevitably slamming into LFR mode. 
---
whats the last game they released without loot boxes.  Again, retail exists, we can see clear as day what the current developers at Blizzard envision for WoW, it's retail WoW.
---
&gt; Melee leeway, for example, changes everything. Back in the day, we had shitty internet and toaster computers, so melee had to get a bit of extra slack. This changes the experience entirely. 
---
what's changed?  My understanding is this is something that was in classic, and people are simply complaining that it's exploitable, not different.
---
&gt;  and besides, Vanilla WoW was a game under constant change. That was known and acknowledged and celebrated. We looked forward to change and updates. 
---
From a different Blizzard.  we'll be getting their updates throughout the experience.  Again, we **know** what changes and updates current Blizzard wants, it's retail.
---
&gt; However, I see zero reason why Blizzard shouldn't, say, add a Horde version of the Winterspring mount rep, or even a cool new zone after Naxx 
---
Oh sure, we could finally get the emerald dream zone, populate Hyjal, new mounts, transmog.  But we can also get loot boxes, containing new mounts, weapons, keys to the new dungeons, stronger combat pets, or **tokens**.
---
Please, retail still exists, you can play it, we just want this one alternative.
---
This is like the ear tags ranchers put on their livestock to identify them. They can scan a tag and know all sorts of information about them. Same with your future dates.
---
I have on pservers numerous times. They aren’t very hard with appropriate buffs and gear
---
So like logging in and out or joining BGs.
---
No, you don't run out.
---
I've levelling to 60 this way twice.
---
Would recommend Jack and coke or rum and coke for hydration?
---
I honestly wish somebody condescendingly told me I'd be stuck as a healbot in raids when I rolled a Shaman at launch so I would've picked a different class.
---
It's not an assumption.  It's what they said was the maximum time frame for layering.
---
&gt; meaning that a server with for example 5 layers in the first week would have about 12000 players quitting (assuming 1 layer is 3000 players). These 12000 players won't pull any significant amount of high end resources (Black Lotus) out of the economy,
---
And this would happen just the same, if there were 5 servers.    You would have a handful of people at the top, and then a bunch of tourists that leave on each server.
---
I would highly recommend using an Owl as Night Elf. They have high DPS and apply a Demo shout debuff that stacks with a Warrior's/Druid's in groups.
---
Also, Gore does not exist in Vanilla. It was a TBC addition.
---
WTF are these numbers? "A couple clears of MC" will not net you enough gear to clear it in 1.5 hours, much less 45 minutes.  BWL in 1 hour is around 30 min longer than the world's fastest speedrun clear on private servers (very dedicated, very geared, very knowledgeable, and very hardcore players, with precise raid makeups that push for speed).  Casual guilds will never get anywhere near these times.
---
EQ2 has layers and no one gave a shit.
---
Jezus christ.
---
Layering, Phasing, Sharding, Whatever the fuck you wanna call it this time of the month, it's all the same garbage that should have never existed
---
Just run skinning and tailoring. You’ll want it both to fill in the gaps and to actually make the bags necessary to store your gear. By taking tailoring later all you are doing is negating the leveling benefit of it, just for one item that you’ll eventually replace.
---
With these two professions, you:
---
A. Get all of your gathering done from killing mobs (beasts &amp; humanoids), meaning you aren’t sidetracked from leveling.
---
B. Have the ability to craft armor and especially bags while you level, preventing bad RNG from making your life difficult, and can even make decent money trading greens to enchanters for wands or bags for gold.
---
C. You can simply vendor all the leather immediately, and you don’t have to buy it anytime a tailoring recipe requires leather for an upgrade.
---
D. You don’t have to dispose of a profession in order to get the robe later on, nor do you have to go back and grind it up. It’s convenient in the early and endgame.
---
E. You won’t be hit with that awful indecisive feeling when you go to get rid of herbalism at later levels.
---
Keep an eye on /r/woweconomy , I'm sure there will be a classic guide somewhere in there at some point.
---
So I tried looking up your discord username but got no results. There is a Silverback#1844 but that’s all I find. But anyways I’m interested in talking to you more in detail about the guild. Hope you’re having a great day.
---
You’re deluded if you think that people who are setting up PTO to play arnt going to throw a fit when they’re stuck in an absurd queue.
---
Lol yeah, I mained a druid.... was shocked 
---
But classic is my do over
---
The only 'carrying' I remember from actual vanilla on Silvermoon-EU, was Inner Sanctum(server top), offering a prize MC run to whoever contributed the most resources to them for the AQ gate opening. They ended up taking a prot warrior, and a holy paladin with them through MC to take whatever they wanted, the prot warrior was given eye of sulfuras, he never finished it. Actually spoke to the warrior for the first time in 14ish years a week ago when he got in contact with a couple of us that still hang out, he still hurts about that.
---
ZG was puggable even back when it was retail... No idea why anyone would think it represents some sort of content that only the best get to see.
---
Blitz has no dynamic res pawns
---
"Of Shadow Wrath" suffixed green and blue gear. It should all be in the game at launch.
---
I’m stuck between two possible futures:
---
#Future 1 
---
Undead Warlock - Herbalism, Alchemy 
---
#Future 2 
---
Undead Rogue - Skinning, Leather Working 
---
—————
---
Convince me of which one I pick.
---
I made a human. Gotten to level 18 so far. But yes this has been my experience. You do next to no damage, still take quite a bit even with mail, miss a LOT, can't fight things above your level well (you literally cannot beat anything 4 levels above you), and it's extremely boring.
---
Fair, but it seems like more responses are more along the lines of: 
---
&gt; AQ was puggable
---
and
---
&gt; All the raids are braindead easy.
---
Than
---
"Everyone can do it, it just might take you 2 years"
---
The Human infestation being all those humans what who made themselves active enemies of the Forsaken.
---
Like, yes the plague works as a catch all weapon but the driving motivation of basically the entire Forsaken is revenge against Arthas and the scourge.
---
That this weapon can also be used against their other self-appointed enemies like the Alliance and the Scarlet Crusade is a plus.
---
Like we see the plague used numerous times and its basically just magical napalm where the real benefit is that it kills the scourge and even hurts the Lich King.
---
Sure, back in 2006. It's been 13 years. Most of the people in this sub have been waiting for classic and palying pservers for a long time. There's perfect knowledge of every single encounter available to all.
---
Hmm, never got an email from blizzard :/
---
I started day 1 with classic and cancelled not long  after ICC released. Though I’ve resubbed for a couple of months for every expansion since except BfA.
---
Play a private server or two and tell me a significant portion of the playerbase (particularly diehards) arnt a little autistic. People are returning over and over to level the same route, farm the same gear, wait for the same patches, grind the same gold, year after year. Don’t get me wrong I sort of enjoy it too but its just a little autistic.
---
I never minded the leveling of a warrior wow was casual leveling compared to other games around then and before.
---
Remember it's the same technology, renamed. Ideally, 3500 people get put on Illidan-Layer 1, 3500 on Illidan-Layer 2, for however many layers it needs for however many people play on Illidan. Then you stay on that layer, forever, until the layer is gone. It's literally a seperate server on the same server. Except, that's not how it's working. People are getting invited and changing layers, just like they change servers/phases in Retail WoW. Sometimes changing zones changes your layer, etc.
---
3% crit to 4 characters is a tiny benefit.  
---
You get much much more dps just bringing another mage or warlock.
---
I don't really think this subreddit represents anything close to the overall playerbase. Could be wrong.
---
There's a mailbox near most quest hubs. Don't hang on to that cloth, mail it to your alt every time you go to turn in quests. You can mail all of your ores/stones/gems to the alt as well.
---
When you're ready to level engineering, mail the stuff you need back to your main. Sell the rest on the AH.
---
Especially at early levels on a new server, I think that skinning would be better than herbalism. The skins will stack better than herbs in your bag (not as many types of skins), and I believe that they also vendor better. You also don't have to go out of your way to get to herb nodes.
---
What percentage of the player base played before AQ was put in? Hell, what percentage played before BC came out?
---
The issue is that content was rushed in Vanilla and only the most hardcore players could partake in the raids because they were no-lifing. The content isn’t hard, it just required a condensed time commitment. Stretch out that condensed time and the most casual guilds could clear Naxx.
---
Who has time to date when there are Alliance to kill?
---
most classes have class quests at several stages.  and sometimes it's just popular general quests.  A famous example most people know is 'bronze tube'  that is needed for 'Look To The Stars'  a lvl 20 quest in Duskwood that every alliance goes through.   Or the cooking quest to get past 225 skill in cooking:  A Clamlette Surprise. this needs Giant Eggs and Zesty Clam meat, so those are always worth more than similar lvl food.
---
I played on the launch of a private server.  Cash is king very early on.  No one has it and everyone wants it.  Vanity items go for far less early on as there are few cash-rich buyers.  Only Pre-Raid bis items with longterm value or are a requirement for MC were priced appropriately, blazing medallion, stockade, edgemasters, freezing band, wands with high spell power, lionheart helm mats, etc.  Some mats are so cheap that people sell them at the edge of vendor price.  It is quite common for people to sell cloth for so low that you can buy it and afk mill it into bandages for a small idle profit.  Even stuff like arcane crystals were abnormally cheap, but because so few people had leveled non-gathering professions and there were no alts yet spamming them out, transmutes were super valuable.  
---
Ideally you would buy up items for cheap and resell them later at a profit, but to do so means forgoing your own mount.  I was luckily on a frost mage so I could grind elites for the cash.  
---
The only thing I did this on was elemental fires, I bought around a hundred at around 20silver, and a couple of dozen boe T0 pieces since people were selling them for basically their vendor price.  I was confident elemental fire would go up when zerg guilds hit rag, and if T0 didn't go up in price I could vendor or DE it all at a minimum loss.  
---
It took about 10 weeks for the zerg wave to hit 60.  These people seemed more focused on catching up and getting into raid then for farming their mounts.  I sold all of the tier0 pieces for 30g+, and the elemental fire I sold at around 3g each, but if I had waited they peaked much higher, I remember seeing them go &gt;8g each a week after I sold mine.    I wish I had done it on travelers.  I remember buying 4 at around 10g each just after I hit 60, when I started to get extras the price had dropped to like 6g.  I figured private server just had jacked up bag drop rates, so I didn't keep any of them.  A few weeks later they were pushing 100g each.
---
I work for a company that has issued MacBook Pros every 2 years or so for the last 11 years, and I've installed and played WoW on all of them during that time.  My experience is that the game plays well on the new shinies for about a year, then starts to slow down as Blizzard issues updates.  I'll start at max level graphics settings and slowly bottom them out over time, then my company issues me a new MacBook and I go back to max settings.
---
I suppose it's a safe argument that the graphics cards in MacBooks are a little underpowered by latest standards with respect to cost, which becomes more of a problem over time.  Also, I think folks expect MacBooks to last a while (perhaps because they paid so much for them) and are therefore more likely to experience issues as the graphics hardware becomes obsolete over time.
---
It looks like Apple is starting to release some of the newer MacBook Pros with better graphic card options like the Vega, but the price is pushing even higher ($3K+).
---
I don't personally know how long a Windows laptop lasts, or how much staying power it has for game performance over time, but they're certainly cheaper to replace more frequently.
---
And the icon is actually not misleading! For once...
---
&gt;I'm at level 18 so far and my DPS is barely on par with a caster class wanding. Also, the rotation is horribly boring.
---
You got to force yourself bro
---
Thanks, you're right.
---
For those that plan to rank up as soon as the honor system is implemented phase 1 gold making is the most crucial part as you won't be able to farm much once the ranking begins, which costs quite a lot of gold if you want to do it seriously.
---
So it's not just the PvE tryhards going for the early gold advantage but PvPers aswell, though there are big overlaps between the most dedicated players of these groups.
---
I quit wow because it became too easy. I will be trying classic wow.
---
Take whatever p.m. time it is on the 12-hour clock and add 12:00 to it.
---
1:00 pm becomes 13:00; 5:00 pm becomes 17:00; etc.
---
\*Nerdy mic drop\*
---
But I've already been to naxx in vanilla then again in private severs. Are you saying it's impossible now?
---
Not nearly often enough
---
Tbh I absolutely love seeing people run around with completely mismatched armor because they can’t be arsed to transmog it just as much as I like seeing carefully curated and matched outfits.
---
I took a few days before Labor Day weekend so have a nice long weekend...already told everyone dont expect me to behave like a normal human for those days. Planning on power napping and red bulling my way before reality slams into me like a bulldozer.
---
Joanas 4d20h never was a big deal. It was just the record on his server and one of his own accomplishments. Alot of ppl have already beat his time back in time and today. especially aoe mage runners beat that time like it's a joke.
---
MC = 4-8 hours depending on how scrub your guild is on start up. Once a consistent raid team is established, can expect to finish MC in 2-4 hours. On Nostalrius the guild I raid lead was able to get MC down to just under an hour by the time BWL was ready.
---
BWL = 2-4 hours once bosses are understood. Quickest we got it down to before Nost shut down was about 2.5 hours. 
---
Haven't done AQ and Naxx since Vanilla, but both longer for sure, progress was much less steady from what I remember too.
---
ZG = 2-3 hours depending on group, can be done several times a week.
---
Id say 2-3 nights raiding should be enough to clear all content upto Naxx, I over confidently would say with the way players are now, and that its been really worked out compared to when we did it 15 years ago, I would expect that 3 nights a week would have you doing Naxx towards the end of classic, providing you wernt still in need of gear from every BWL raid and ZG. My experience of Naxx in (actual) vanilla, meant that to do BWL/AQ40/Naxx/ZG in a week, I was raiding 5-6 nights a week.
---
If you believe that your extremely stupid, no offense. The first alternative that was pruposed is the best one? Haha yeah right mate. This is the easiest and cheapest solution for blizzard. It sucks in the long run and will do serious damage to everyone that isnt super hardcore. Which I'm fine with, but I doubt you guys will be when you see the consequences unfold
---
Yeah the RP value was great. I get the no changes crowd on this one but man do mixed gear sets look like poodoo, imo.
---
&gt; Classic is what brought me back. 
---
Yup, I'm messing around in level 20 BG's on a starter account to psyche up for Classic. I haven't played seriously since TBC. I missed all other expansions except for a very small and casual amount of time I spent in MOP. After that I had no interest in ever playing WoW again, the game was just too different and not fun anymore.
---
But hecks yeah I'm coming back for Classic!
---
"Legolasx", Night Elf Hunter. The true vanilla experience.
---
Layering is dynamic. Servers are static. Even with a constant population, concurrent player numbers fluctuate significantly depending on the time of day etc. Layers can be created and removed on the fly to suit the current need.
---
It's not like the old days where WoW had physical server blades assigned to each realm. Now ,the hardware is multi-purpose and used for a variety of tasks/games. The resources of a single physical server is divided into virtual servers that can then be shared out to be assigned different tasks. Modern WoW utilizes this even better by having many more small layers (shards) that can be dynamically created and removed depending on load.
---
This greatly reduces the hardware needed to run the game. But it also makes the game crap itself when you try and force loads of players into one shard powered by a small virtual server (raid vs raid PvP encounters). And of course it utterly shatters the illusion of playing in a persistent shared world, which to me is the core of what defines an MMORPG.
---
well for being 100 I think a prize is in order lol
---
yeah we dont need more layer spam
---
Whoa dude thats kinda insulting. 
---
it takes at least two hours to hit 40 in retail
---
Do quests give additional gold instead of XP at max level?
---
&lt;Midnighters&gt; is looking for players to come own with us.
---
NA|PvP|Horde|PST
---
Raid times:
---
Wed/Thur 9:30 p.m. - 12 a.m. PST
---
Tue a possible 3rd day in Phase 4 with the release of 20 man content.
---
We are a late night progression raiding guild. Our leadership has extensive competitive raiding experience in Vanilla all they way to present. We are an adult based guild as well -- if you can't hang with a bunch of mid-20s to 30s folk who swear, joke, and have a blast... look elsewhere.
---
While we may not raid a lot during the week, we plan on being efficient and ready to go when we do. You are expected to come prepared (this means food buffs, flasks, etc). Our goals are to push content and create a community. 
---
Outside of our raider ranks, we are very open to accepting casual players that want to be apart of the guild and help us build our community. We also expect there to be a good deal of organized PvP going on as several members have confessed their love of PvP. So if you want to join to hang out and play with us, do not hesitate to drop us a message. 
---
We intend to start raiding by the second or third month after release. There will be “pre-raid” raids where we look at our raiding core and split it into Dungeon groups to help with gearing and for raiders to build a relationship in-game with each other.
---
We need commitment. 80%+ attendance for raiding is required. Many of us have busy lives and have to make time to play together on our two nights a week and without reliability it all falls apart. We get things done and have been playing this game forever -- we're looking for long term commitment.
---
Contact Funnyman (Discord: Funnyman#4802) Or, you can head to  [https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters](https://www.guilded.gg/Midnighters) and  apply!
---
I never encountered it either in Vanilla,but i certainly did in BC.
---
I remember in Hellfire Peninsula, the quest where you are to burn down a lot of orc tents, stables etc. So many people were there that mobs spawned inside of me, or at least near me (think 5-10 yards).
---
Other solution is they just make more servers? At what point did doing it the exact same way the original vanilla was stopped being an option?
---
elaborate please
---
When did they add rank11 raptor for taurens? Know i had it but i guess it was after BC patch when they dropped rank reqs?
---
 Hamstring kiting  doesn't really work here. You can Hamstring,  and still get nailed by 3 auto attacks while trying to strafe away.
---
The basic skills of pressing the same 4 buttons as a low level warrior? Lol k.
---
So why put layering in now considering it worked without it pre cata?
---
It really depends....will the raid boss AI and lack of access to flasks mean progression is THAT nuch harder than pservers?  Were there things going on behind the scenes in vanilla? Is the gear drop distribution gonna make such a big difference?
---
People on pservers are killing those raids. If they can similarly kill it on blizz servers a lot lot more people will be doing naxx than before. 
---
I remember naxx being wipe after wipe after wipe even early on in the raid. We downed 2 bosses and basically said fuck it. 
---
I'm thinking raiding is gonna be dramatically harder, but who knows.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DnNITODORGg
---
I'm trying to decide which of my alts I will tell my friends is my main
---
The cases where this would happen though, that is, mobs spawning inside or near you and kill you, shouldn't happen.
---
After all, the spawn rate would only be that high if there were enough people there actively killing those mobs. So you wouldn't be alone to fight against them.
---
It could also be possible to add a 5 ish second time window where the mobs will not aggro unless you attack first, when they spawn. That way you would be able to run away and prepare a bit.
---
&gt; you’ll never even step foot in Naxx
---
Well this is just false. Once you’re attuned, anyone can go in. Mages used to solo trash all the time for money.
---
yes and no.
---
you need gold to make gold, so you have to sell some stuff early on to get the ball rolling.  but once you have a decent bank roll, to be able to buy any bargain you come across, you can start putting more and more of your profits / income into long term investments.
---
i raided retail classic back in the day.  comparing how it was back then to what it will be like in the new classic is just dumb.
---
all of the new players who know nothing about this game will learn from those who know everything about it.  the bad guilds will copy the other guilds and have a much easier time than we did in retail.
---
I figured everyone used an Ah add on to avoid this issue
---
Most pugs would lose to jindo and hakkar in my experience..sometimes bloodlord. For the first 2 everyine needed to know the fights quite well.
---
ZG was definitely mostly easy though. It was for catchup gear after all
---
That's Lordaeron for ya, baby.
---
Just learn the game and the classes lmao. People are trying to give you bits of what they know of this much larger and complex question you’re asking and you’re turning around to be snarky and entitled. Even if you’re trying to figure out this stuff in advance to try and min max your decisions or gameplay, you’re doing it in a completely asinine way.
---
Even though there's not actually any standard, "12 AM" is generally understood to be midnight.
---
Technically, it's ambiguous and shouldn't be used. "12 midnight" would be a better term to use.
---
lol gtfo keep your elitism to retail, i fucking hate elitist people. Being elitist in video games is pretty idiotic anyways. Specially in classic where skill =  time investment.
---
you misspelled warlock
---
Yeah, it was no earlier than the pre-patch for TBC.
---
It's not official data, but we do have private wow servers already and you can see how those have mostly dropped down over time.
---
Possibly. It might be tedious to beat Patchwerk or 4HM without any naxx gear.

Yeah but gay people's opinions of what is homophobic is a good 15 times more valid than yours.
---
There will be insanely wealthy people even early on, you can be sur of that. If you dedicate all your playing time to farm it’s only a matter of days/weeks.
---
That’s why gold sellers use bots, and I hope I’m wrong but I believe there will be plenty of bots and gold sellers.
---
I'm just poking fun, druid is probably the most immersive, lore heavy class in Classic
---
&gt; It's all about saving money, so their solution isnt to invest on hardware for more and better servers but on the software that is cheaper, layering and sharding.
---
I don't see how layering doesn't require additional hardware.  If you're making a layer, outside of the back end database for character storage, you're literally running a copy of a server.
---
The solution for a "vanilla like" release isn't to just uncap the server capacity and let shit hit the fan.  We'd still be stuck at the same server caps that we had back in vanilla for the #nochanges pleasers.
---
How in the world would we know that?
---
I'll be running along in an open area, then 8 mobs just phase in that were cleared out of the area I was phased from. Instant aggro. It's horrible. This happened to me twice in an hour.
---
It'l be fun to wreck through these sad gatherings though :)
---
I ran into my dad bill gates several times, surprised me every time
---
ZG just required knowledge of boss fights and an expectation that even experienced raids will wipe 1-3 times because of unluckiness.
---
But you are correct, ZG was pretty easy and for catchup gear.
---
Calls me a kid, still cares about karma points 😂😭 🤡 🤡 🤡
---
All retails players know is sharding, so they just don't get what the issue is.
---
gathering professions since everyone will be in a mad rush to level up their non gathering professions. Im planning on taking mining/herbalism for now then switching to enchanting.
---
well thats a little discriminatory
---
Chuck Norris apparently hides out in the barrens pretty frequently too, killing raptors with his bare hands
---
Specially in retail since PS are so freaking overtuned, some mobs cast spells for 80-100 dmg at level 15 in some PS lol.
---
nice ,you probably have a heart of gold that benefits so many people in your life :)
---
Except, you can. Multiple private server launches have had 10-15k people for launch. They can also just stop character creation by race/faction/server. It takes the same amount of server space for a layer as for another server.
---
Hey everyone. I'm guild leader for a guild I'm putting together for classic.
---
You might recognize my name from other posts I've done on this subreddit highlighting some in-depth information about WoW Vanilla. [Post on Blackwing Lair](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bs6mxw/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_warn_you/)| [Post on Honor System](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c0m1gb/gather_around_vanilla_newbies_let_me_talk_to_you/) . If you see what type of effort I did for those posts, just **imagine what I'd do for you as your guild leader**. Food for thought.
---
* Currently we have a core group of 35+ people ready for Classic.  We're recruiting heavily on the front end so we can have a solid core on launch which will pay dividends over time.
---
* We are actually doing a "State of the Guild" meeting tomorrow night at 8:30pmCST/9:30pmEST.  You're welcome to join/watch, just come to the Discord for more info.
---
* We are HORDE and will be on a PVP server. For some reason I need to explicitly put this here because some bozos always ask if we are rolling alliance. No, we are not. All alliance must die.
---
* Most of us are around the age of 30. All of us have jobs, some have kids. **We might be an ideal fit for people who want a guild that is aiming to eventually progress.**  Also, if you're younger you're still welcome to join of course.
---
* We've decided on a name but it's not official yet. We are revealing the name in the state of the guild meeting tomorrow night.
---
* **We will have a heavy PvP focus**.  We have numerous Vanilla rank 14's and I personally love world PvP.
---
* Yes, we will definitely do PvE too, but understand we will most definitely not be a 'World First' or 'Server First' type of guild.
---
* **We don't have a raid schedule yet because it's just too early to tell.** I can't even tell you what I'm doing next month lol so it doesn't make sense to me to post a raid schedule for something that is 4+ months away.
---
* Most of us live in Central or Eastern US, but we don't really care where you live.
---
* **Experience is not needed**. Would actually much rather have an easy-going person who is easy to talk to instead of a pretentious know it all.
---
* **I'm more concerned about culture fit than skill fit.** People can always learn/improve -- it's more important to have the right personalities. Come hang out in our discord to see if you like us.
---
* **No class or role restrictions**. We have a google doc that has a class breakdown of everyone who is planning to play, so you're welcome to take a look and go from there.
---
* I've mentioned 'culture' a lot so let me best describe what I think our culture is: regular dudes who like to play video games. We have bankers, statisticians, real-estate developers, academics, mechanics, food/alcohol distributors, nurses, etc. Come from all walks of life.  **A sense of humor is required for sure, but you aren't expected to be chatty if you just wanna be chill**. You're completely welcome to join and just be a fly on the wall for all we care.
---
Message me here or just join our Discord if you want to check us out:  [https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF](https://discord.gg/Kcb3SqF) .  Talk to our lead HR guy (Jeremy/Jurmz) or just look for me on there (Adam).

This was 2.0 right? I know they changed the set looks in 2.1. To make it look like wrath green recolor instead of lawbringer.
---
&gt;Chain pulling MC is doable. 
---
Yeah, it certainly is. But for this to work properly without wipes (which would kinda fuck up the time saved) you either have to be overgeared already or everyone knows perfectly what they are doing. Not sure yet what category most "normal" raid groups will be.
---
People have become so crazy lol
---
Shit a lot of people are going to be completely new to vanilla.
---
The real difficulty was raiding with 1 fps tho.
---
You give me examples that literally don’t work.  It’s not just a “nuh-uh” as in I disagree, it’s a “nuh-uh” because it’s literally incorrect.
---
As in, you are objectively wrong.  Do you know what that means?
---
You're gonna feel really stupid when you realize that grass IS yellow and only looks green because of the blue hue night time gives everything.
---
This is not how layering works though.
---
&gt; for BRD, BRS, MC, and BWL
---
Ugh. I hated this on raid nights. The flight to Thorium Point is so fast from Ironforge, but takes forever from Undercity or Grom'Gol.
---
The most common thing to layer-farm in Beta is chests.
---
Ill get as addicted as I like thank you
---
Im looking forward to it in fact
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Vast majority of games are Windows OS only
---
Weird Al said he’s going to be playing.
---
That doesn't help too much. To know whether 12 noon is AM or PM, you'd have to know whether noon is before noon or after noon.
---
Convention says that 12 AM is midnight, but there's actually no standard.
---
I played/chatted with a guy on a server leveling one of my many alts. Claimed he was Jim gaffigan. He was pretty funny, we chatted/played for a bit. I don’t think he really was Jim but in my mind I tell myself I played with Jim gaffigan for a few hours.
---
That make zero fucking sense. wat
---
Your sentence is definitely shit but it’s not a poem ??
---
Hey,
---
just rechecked the discord name and tag and it's correct - not sure why it isn't working.
---
Please try contacting BuffGamer#3520 on discord and see if you can find that one. Have a good day.
---
I don't think classic vs vanilla will be anything alike. I think it will be a whole new experience. Less wonderment from old school players and "seeing things for the first time" and also learning to deal with the influx of retail players who expect all their loot ezmode. Will game play be the same and classes/talent trees. Yeah, but community and "feeling the same" is something I think a lot of people are misjudging.
---
Put pet follow in all your feign macros. Otherwise the pet will put you back in combat.

Luckily steam sale has been keeping me busy.  Should be enough to reduce my suffering for the next 2 months.
---
I prefer cookies. Or gold... lol
---
I’m just going to put in an app and let y’all contact me. Or you can shoot me a DM on here. Either way works for me. I appreciate the quick response.
---
&gt; Running through outdated content where the overwhelming majority of drops will be DE'ed or sold all for a world buff is a sure way to burn out players. I doubt you're saving the time in progression content that you're spending clearing the old content. At that point... what's the point?
---
Half of the raid is filled with alts and the other half is filled with core raiders. Usually a guild will alternate who can bring alts and who can't. For hardcore guilds getting alts up and pvping is a way to keep the game constantly fresh. Sometimes a guild will allow you to switch your raiding role for example. The stuff that is DE'd goes to a good purpose, either upping the amount of gold within the guild bank or being there to help guildies get enchants for free. Smart guilds will save up their gold for high ticket items, such as the best tanking weapon pre-naxx called Alcor's Sunrazor. On the pserver I played on for two years in 2014-2016 it went for about 6,000 gold.
---
&gt; Seriously? Why go through all this effort to shave some time off clearing raids that are upwards of 15 years old? It probably takes more time to do all of this then simply clearing whatever raid you're doing on its own without these buffs.
---
To hardcore raiders, it's all about kill speed and overall efficiency. To them, clearing BWL is not an accomplishment. However clearing BWL in 20 minutes is an achievement. In modern day every guilds runs are publicized on a public website. I believe ours was on 'realmplayers'. It would rank guilds by clear speed, and to ones high on the rankings means social status.
---
Also, you know that feeling when you get into a good 5 man group, clear through the dungeon without any wipes, people get the items they need, no one disconnects; it's just smooth as butter. Everyone likes that experience and essentially world buffs help make 'buffer out' mistakes that would infringe on that experience. You could make an argument that it's become a  crutch to some extent.
---
That would actually be absolutely ridiculous if they could coordinate that, skip FP's, be able to hearth and the instantly get back to questing.
---
The most recent one does, as well as some other changes based on the beta.
---
Release 3 versions of every server (eg. Illidan A - B - C) and then merge them into one (eg. Illidan) once the tourists have gone away.
---
Restrict character names across all 3 versions so there would be no issues with naming once the merge has happened.
---
This solves every problem layering is attempting to fix:
---
** Accommodates for the influx of tourists
---
** Cuts down queue times
---
** Avoids dead servers in the future by merging the three versions into one
---
and it eliminates the downsides that come with layering such as ruining immersion, exploiting resources, and dodging world PvP.
---
Yes, but not like it is now.  No achievements to get, no personal loot, only there for the 4-5 tier pieces that dropped from each boss.  I knew guilds that started selling MC and BWL runs, but they had rules like, you paid upfront, but if you didn't get any items, you got it back.  I think they even charged fees per piece you took.  But, having raided both, there are many nights you would want a piece of gear, and nothing would drop for you, it would be insane to pay for a chance at items only to not get anything.
---
Yup, it’s the same as phasing, except the phase size is extended to the whole continent
---
Pick a DPS class and do some basic research.  There's tons of stuff out there, they even have guides that tell you what talent points to use and what your rotation will be while you level.  It's extremely simple.
---
It’s almost as if you were a reddit user
---
I was a little older than I assume you were when you started but I had a similar thing. My parents paid for the game and a 3 month sub (this got me to the summer) when I was re-starting my summer job. I was shelling out like 10% of my paycheck towards a subscription for a game and goddamn was it worth every penny.
---
Ticked me off so much that what was epic gear became dungeon loot for the first dungeon.
---
Let’s get the launch to go smoothly first! Baby steps
---
Same here!
---
again, what has autism do with it? You listed nothing of the critera or symptoms to why autism as anything to do with it. (Unless you are saying people that enjoy monotone or repetetive things are autistic by nature)
---
The way that guy said "Scourge".......
---
I quit and Classic is the sole reason I am returning.  Can't wait!
---
I always though xmog should've integrated with professions more.  Start with the original gear, then you have to get a bsmith/lworker/tailor to "combine" the stats of one piece of gear into the model of the other, using other consumable materials ofcourse.  
---
This would make xmogging a piece of gear significantly more involved, so people wouldn't really do it until they had gotten gear that they were going to stick with for a while. That way you would at least see current gear in the game as people leveled through a new xpac, and the higher end gear is less likely to be xmogged in the first place since it *should* be really good looking in itself.
---
Agreed. I laugh when I see raiders with full T2 or AQ40+ gear on the private server with no enchants. The hunter with Icy Chill on his 2h from ZG was rather amusing as well.
---
I should be able to afford my mount at 40-41 as a speed levelers. level 38-40 is my gold grind
---
Yeah when we were doing it, we were also clearing AQ40, so the gear was far and away above what was required for MC.
---
When I played wow and was “addicted” I didn’t really have anything else TO do. Yeah school but who cares about that.
---
Job, gf, dogs. Kind of hard to ignore that stuff unless you have a serious problem.
---
What do you say, guys? You can just...you can just hang outside in the sun all day tossin' a ball around, or you can sit at your computer and do somethin' that matters.
---
PServers only get at mos 3K users spanned across all their shards.
---
There have been so many suggested alternatives over the last week alone, that you're being intellectually dishonest if you really think that.
---
What?  Classic WoW?  What's that?
---
In all seriousness, I feel I am going to be one of many who are going to enjoy a couple of hours, maybe even a day or two of this game, but all of my desire to play is purely on nostalgia.
---
I'll still sign up for a month and run through it all, but I just believe it's not going to be what we have in our minds.  So many factors go into making that game memorable in our eyes...how many of those factors remain?
---
It's like going to Las Vegas for the first time....then returning years later.  We just can't replicate that initial feeling.  The guilds we were a part of, the people we played with and became friends with, we're all perhaps as much as 10 years older or more now.  Our lives might not all be the same as they once were.
---
I am curious, absolutely curious, as to how this game will feel, but I can't put my hopes up like so many on here expecting it to feel short lived nostalgia.
---
I hope I am completely wrong.
---
hit 60 then farm some extra gold then buy out AH to level up skills then farm gold again and profit from profession. Day 6 or 7
---
It'll be much harder on a high pop server since there are going to be several people each single week that will be interested in reaching for the highest rank and thus it'll be a constant competition.
---
It's a chromebook, it's supposed to be a mark of shame for it.
---
Only until they show up in the blizzard shop. Then we all win right?
---
This is huge as well. The best way to make money off uninformed people with minimal effort.
---
Blizzard still basically believes that 'you think you do, but you don't' and that most people will quit shortly after classic launch. At which point they would be able to remove the layers and end up with decently populated servers. The problem occurs if they are in fact wrong about that and classic stays popular or even gradually pulls more people from retail, at which point we will end up with layering for good.
---
Alternative is to bribe your girl(or boy) to play classic with you!
---
And in your mind is all that matters, either way makes for a good story!
---
&gt; he first alternative that was pruposed is the best one? 
---
This isn't the first proposed....  This is the one that they decided on after countless hours of debate.    This is the one that will be implemented as well.
---
I started in late vanilla and quit in MoP.  The game just became so bland and unadventurous.
---
I'm excited just to see classes have meaningful specialisation again, warts and all.
---
true
---
The easiest way to visualize the difference is by looking at the extremes. Let's say that the number of people who are willing and able to pull off a quick level 60 and monopolize certain end game resources for a few days is 100 (the specific number doesn't matter, what's important is that this number doesn't significantly scale with the size of the playerbase because these people will play no matter how many other people play). If you have 1 layered server, as the size of the playerbase increases, the number of layers increase, and the number of layers these 100 people can farm increases, too. The result is that the resources these 100 players accumulate increase, limited only by how fast you can switch layers. 
---
If you have many servers, even if these 100 players are spread out across all server, as the total number of servers increases, there will be a point where the resources available to these players reaches a natural cap, namely when they get all the (high end) resources that spawn on a single server. But that requires more than 1 player, because there is more than 1 zone and travel is slow, and because a single player is limited by sleep to some extent. Also, as the number of servers increases, there might be servers completely without one of these 100 people, or servers where they actually have to compete (and can't dodge the competition by layer hopping). 
---
Layering is a means to solve the dead server problem, and I understand the need for that completely. What I am arguing for is that layering absolutely can have an economic impact (completely apart from it being immersion breaking in general). Is there an alternative so that there won't be any dead servers in the future? Possibly, but that is a different discussion.
---
There are many reasons to avoid streamer servers. Generally, people are referring to the biggest streamers like Soda and Asmongold, as it would be impossible and pointless to avoid them all.
---
*The population is more volatile. If a streamer quits or goes to retail, his/her community will follow. There will be more “tourists” on these servers. Higher initial population could result in leveling being more of a pain.
---
*Zerg guilds. Could also be called massive social guilds. Guaranteed to be on the same server as one or more HIGHLY competitive guilds, that is only at such a level due to the global reach of popular streamers and willing players who are willing to dump every ounce of their soul into the streamer’s agenda...at times this won’t even earn a raid spot. With so many servers and lack of twitch back in Vanilla, these types of guilds were very uncommon. The culture of the server would be dominated by these guilds. There could be a few exceptions here, like streamers who prefer to keep their guilds low-key. These guilds will also likely raid &amp; have events earlier in the day for maximum Twitch viewership, which could be a problem for those of us with normal jobs.
---
*Feeling like you’re serving the money-making machine of the stream instead of carving out your own personal experience
---
*Younger demographic. Most of us who played vanilla are near 30 or above and most of us aren’t envelopes by Twitch culture, and could do without words like sperging, retard, and 5Head.
---
Of course, there are many valid reasons as to why people WOULD want to play on these servers. Perhaps you are a fan of the streamer, appreciate huge social communities, creating memories &amp; content in front of thousands, live for the memes, and want to participate in huge planned events. All very valid. Twitch can be a really fun place. I watch the big streams myself, but I prefer to keep it that way.
---
For those of us that don’t want that, ending up on a streamer server can be the single biggest detriment to our desired Vanilla experience.
---
We are talking about individual server capacity no?
---
My favorite WoW quest I've ever done.

---
THE MEMO
---
I SAID MEMO
---
So it is the first one that was proposed? Hmm its so weird to be right all the time. Get a grip I know its going to be implemented but its not because its best. Its because its the cheapest for them
---
When classic hits, you will see LFG for UBRS all over the place before mid September.
---
The alliance NPCs literally say "for the alliance" when you close their dialogue windows.
---
Oh no, the person being affected by homophobia is more perceptive of what is actually hurtful and messed up than people who aren’t as affected. The discrimination! /s
---
I didn't have to pay for mine, and ended up getting my Wrath helm too since noone needed it! Also had to do the same thing for my AQ40 shield since my guild hadn't cleared past twin emps at the time.
---
im so boreeeeeeed :( come on already

---

---
I collect pins where can I get one!?
---
Bottom line is it's 100% true that just smushing everyone into servers and watching them die is not a viable option.  Blizzard knows this and that's why layering or some similar technology will 100% in the game.

**Guild: &lt;Nevermore&gt; \[Horde\]\[US\]\[PvP\]\[Semi-Hardcore/PvP\]\[Loot Council\]**
---
**Raid Times:** Tues, Weds 9pm - 12am ET
---
**Goals:** Rekindle our romance with Vanilla by forming a close knit, active family of gamers. We will be focusing on raiding content as it's released, clearing content in a respectable manner, being one of the top guilds on our server. Beyond raiding we will be doing plenty of World PvP and pre-made BGs; if it's red, it's dead! We will choose a high-pop NON-STREAMER server.
---
**Sup?:** We have **vast experience in Vanilla raiding or obtained Rank 12+ in PvP**. We also have members that are just looking for an active and friendly community to call home and that's what we offer. **We are very active, chatting throughout the day and night, playing on beta or private servers, honing out our skills and learning to play with one another while we wait for launch.** We are a large family, just like Vanilla, where everyone works together for the common good, and everyone knows everyone. We're playing on Nighthaven while we await Classic's launch. Come play with us on NH and in Classic!
---
**Needs:** We're looking for exceptional, experienced Vanilla raiders. Social members looking for a family. PvPers looking to grind Honor. Players that want to be part of a large, successful organization.
---
**Raid Needs:**
---
Druid (Resto): HIGH
---
Hunter: Low
---
Mage: Low
---
Priest (Holy): Medium
---
Rogue: Low
---
Shaman (Resto): Low
---
Warlock: Medium
---
Warrior: Closed

my eight ball says yes
---
My original plan as Shaman was to go 0/22/29 (improved weapon totems into Resto). Then I became interested in 30/0/21 (Ele/Resto Hybrid w/ NS). I am positively torn.
---
A) Would there be a noticeable difference for my group if I ran 0/22/29 over 30/0/21? Would I be more useful in PvE with this build to any noticeable extent?
---
B) For WPvP--using a net average of 1v1--how much worse is 0/22/29? I'm sure it's practically useless in BGs, but by the time organised PvP comes around I'm sure I'll have a better grasp of things.
---
Yeah, but a lot of the layers new to vanilla started playing during another expansion. There's going to be people new to wow in general, but nothing like the original release
---
I tried Tera but it seemed like a pedophile sim
---
WC3, refresh new every few minutes
---
&gt;implying I'm not currently addicted.
---
To be fair, Shattered Halls is probably harder than BWL. Especially on heroic.
---
Then they should just merge them together after a few years
---
I'd get WC3 but sadly it's not sold anymore.
---
Even though the brackets on higher pop servers are larger, there's just more people who will no-life. The higher competition happens at a rate slightly higher than the bracket size offsets it. So larger pop is harder.
---
It's a bot.
---
If you aren't in a group, XP is based off of percentage of damage you do to the unit. If you are in a group, it's based off of number of people in group and their levels, and is a flat percentage based on that (not based off of damage done to the mob).
---
Also killing mobs 9 levels higher than you gives diminishing returns that make it comparable to killing lower level mobs (when being powerleveled by a level 40 for example).
---
But dwarves look awesome?
---
&gt;Rogue, if nothing else because it's the only class that can pick locks.
---
Can't any blacksmith pick locks?
---
Of course it's easier, you'll get the benefits of x-realm BGs (not that queue time matters what so ever since everyone on your faction will have the same) and if you have less competition it's much much easier to rank up.
---
You're forgetting the most unforgiving of mechanics.
---
Aggro.
---
People still have no idea what it is, that'll still be a major issue in classic.
---
That’s why I’m rolling a druid; I know that I probably won’t be satisfied with whichever niche I choose with the other classes after sinking a ton of time into them, so I’ll settle for being able to do anything I want, just at less than optimal effectiveness.
---
Yeah it is... buy the remaster and you get it free!
---
all the money isn't in gathering mats anyway, it's grinding gold in maraudon and other shit for vendor trash.
---
Go browse some levelling guides for your faction, and see what they recommend. Those items will be consistent sellers.
---
One example is the Deadly Blunderbuss that Horde players need for a quest in Ashenvale. The quest reward is a good piece of blue gear, so lots of people will want it. You should be able to sell them on the AH for a couple of gold when players start getting to the mid 20s.
---
With 16 debuffs in p1 warlocks get +15% damage from shadowpriests. This massively outclasses the +6% hit that mages get. Both classes get a curse so that evens out. Then imp shadowbolt more or less cancels out the +10% frost talent debuff (I forgot the name). It’s not apples to apples but if a warlock is chugging mana pots and demonic runes they will out dps mages even in p1
---
Your last point is great. I raided pretty hardcore in vanilla and everyone really overestimates the fact that getting 40 people on the same page is the hardest part. Look at some of the bosses even in retail that are SUPER simple in mechanics - and sometimes the fights are still difficult. Why? Coordinating all 20 of those people to perform correct. Now double that number and expect every person to be good every attempt.   
---
People think that cause a boss has 2-3 more abilities in retail it makes it more difficult. The excuse that people are "better" now than they were is a joke. Its just not true. My guild was close to several world firsts and we had min/maxers and some of the best people in our guild. Rotations are not overly complicated in vanilla - to say I can press 1,2,3 better than I did 15 years is absurd. People acting like we lived under a rock 15 years ago with no youtube or guides. 
---
Now I can agree that MC and part of BWL is an easy intro raid, but tell me how easy vanilla raiding is when your wiping on twin emps for a month.
---
Pretty sure we had a celeb feral druid in our guild during wrath. Klerm was a great player, usually topped DPS, always ready to do the crappy jobs when asked, never talked on mumble. We knew he was from British Columbia and he spoke French. Ask him anything on mumble, and he would whisper you a reply within an instant, even if he was dps'ing without breaking his rotation (and if you know anything about feral dps in wrath, it was a very complex rotation). My guess was that he was Seth Rogen.

**Looking for Guild** 
---
*Let's try this again.  Thought I had a great fit but guild ended up falling apart.  Sorry if I didn't reply to anyone from my last post, had a lot of messages to parse through.*
---
**Faction:** Alliance, would do Horde for right guild
---
**Server:** PvE, no interest in PvP server
---
**Time Zone:** EST, fine with other time zones assuming raiding hours work out
---
**Raid Times:** 8-12 EST Sunday - Thursday, preferably 2 - 3 nights a week
---
**Class:** Warrior, maybe rogue/mage depending on if I'm feeling froggy
---
**Looking for:** Semi-hardcore or casual guild that is able to push through content at a good pace without being too tryhard and having a good time with guild doing it.  Looking for either MT spot or DPS spot.  More than happy to be a class lead.
---
**About Me:**
---
* Been playing since Launch Day, raided at a semi-hardcore level from Vanilla - Cata before retiring from raids
---
* I am a laid-back, mature adult who has slightly warped sense of humor and a love for Vanilla and its demanding nature
---
* Definitely don't have the time to play WoW like I did in college, but I have a week of PTO to burn for launch week and work from home on a regular basis, so I intend to play a good amount
---
* I like tanking romantic walks through dungeons and raids, getting gear for myself &amp; guildies while trying to have a good time
---
**Raiding Exp:**
---
* Played Warrior from Day 1 to early part of WoTLK, swapping to Rogue to fill huge class/DPS need for guild
---
* Raided as MT or OT/fury from MC to 3/12 Naxx in Vanilla; MT or fury up to SWP in BC, getting pre-nerf Kael; swapped to Rogue doing all heroic content in WoTLK and large amount of heroic in Cata before retiring
---
* **Discord:** Graeson#9598
---
* **Battlenet:** Graeson#1825
---
We probably also lost the RP-PvP battle, and might have to transfer or reroll if / when they add them later.
---
Druid or Warlock would be my top non Hunter picks followed by  Paladin if you're Alliance, possibly give Shaman a try if you're Horde.
---
How is tanking for a beginner that only played as DPS for 4 months in BFA? Realistically speaking.
---
Would it be to hard to level a Warrior Tank with so little experience/knowledge?
---
Raids/Dgs/Bgs/wPvP/Leveling... Playing like 30 hours per week in Classic.
---
Every time I see one of these posts I always read it as "... whats your game?" :)
---
Wait what. How does that work?
---
Doesn't Blizzard have like 8,000+ employees and most of them browse reddit? I'm pretty sure these "we just have to accept it and move on" posters are just blizz people.
---
&gt;Most of you will never see the inside of ZG
---
Really? Like really? Even my 16 year old ass who had no clue what a rotation was and never saw MC in vanilla raided ZG cmon now
---
Pserver
---
Already did Naxx in retail Vanilla and my guild wasn't even the most hardcore no-lifers, we weren't filthy casuals either.
---
More casual players won't understand shit...
---
People will be playing horrible specs all of classic and will get very mad when told that they're severely hurting the raids chances due to their spec.
---
BFA. 8.2 is great!
---
Jagex is attempting to ruin the game (again) with warding (again.)
---
I had no fucking idea there was a dude in that icon
---
it'll be easier on a lower pop sever. you may have 1 or 2 big no lifers on a low pop and 100 on a high pop
---
Day 5 - expect about 50 players hitting 60. These are the smart, efficient well planned hunters and AOE Mages
---
Day 6 - expect another 100-200 mages, lock, hunters and some priests hitting 60.
---
Day 7 - another 200 ish or less hitting 60
---
Day 8-10 - 50-100 who simply had time on their hand but not efficient with routes. Most of the server will be level 30-45 at this point.
---
Day 11+ it's a slow trickling of players moving in.
---
2 weeks = 25% of the server is level 60, 3 weeks = 40%, 1 month = half the server. The rest are the filthiest casuals that will hit 60 in 2-3 months.
---
-----------
---
Day 7 is the day of reckoning. Most of the zerg will be level 30-35 and the 60s are coming for blood. This is where the slow down begins. We are gonna gank the fuck out of every lowbie, slowing everyone down while also farming cloths, resources, etc.
---
Yup. 
---
There are also problems like: "What happens when your main tank gets poached by the top guild on the server, leaving you short a ~month's worth of BWL tanking gear?"
---
That’s pretty accurate, actually
---
No can do bro. Has to be horde.
---
Chapelle played wow? Dá fuk
---
Get better tanks, stance dancing isn't hard.
---
Been playing Some dungeon of the endless with friends.
---
Assuming you have a consistent group to level with. No teleporting or LFG after all.
---
100% agree. I was on the same quest chain as this laser chicken and he kept disappearing and reappearing as we stepped trough different points. Seeing progress in the world is cool and all, but not at the cost of immersion.
---
i think it kicks in at 3 for mana and dps but it might depend on the spell and its just a google search i might do later
---
leveling in a PS
---
Ya, apparently for a pretty long time
---
FFxivs new expac just launched and this shits awesome
---
#PSA: Do not, I repeat, do not freeze yourself!!!

 &lt;Alpha&gt; | Horde | EU-PVP | Wed/Sun/Mon| 19:00pm-00:00am CEST | Semi-Hardcore | DKP  
---
Recruitment◆  
---
We're always looking for exceptional players of any class as well as potential Raid Leader(s)/Class Leaders Head over to: [https://forms.gle/RwvkqSVTiooGR4f77](https://forms.gle/RwvkqSVTiooGR4f77) and fill in the form if you feel like you want to be apart of &lt;Alpha&gt; 
---
We will also accept social players as long as they contribute in some way or form.  
---
Introduction◆ All applicants should have a good attitude towards raiding. You will be required to dedicate yourself to min/maxing as well as having alt(s) in the future. When the World Boss phase kicks in, some members will have their own schedule for when they will have to camp a world boss spawn so this will mean that you have to put some time away for that too. In all, TIME and ATTITUDE you put in into the Guild will be rewarded.   
---
Member Expectations◆ You should be able to handle constructive criticism if/when it's directed at you. Banter is expected but when you receive constructive criticism you should be able to handle it in a mature way and consider other options than your opinion on the matter. As well as being able to adapt according to what the group needs at the current moment. During progress raids our schedule will be quiet demanding and the schedule will be worked on until the launch of Classic. It's really important you understand this before even thinking about applying.  World of Warcraft is a team game and communication is the utterly most important thing when raiding. Therefore you will be required to have Discord and have a working headset &amp; microphone, and you have to be able to understand/speak proper English.  
---
Raid Schedule◆ We are set on raiding at least 3 days a week (Wed/Sun/Mon) and about 4-6 hours per session depending on how it will go during the Raid. That means you have to be flexible with the set raiding times.
---
If you have any questions before applying add: Noox#2597 Onimon#3168
---
Realistically you'd only want skinning and first aides, nothing else. Herb/ore will be impossible to keep up while leveling. Anything else you'd drastically slow down your leveling and nothing you do early compares to gold making at 60
---
Didnt know that this game exists. And its on sale on steam. Got to check it out. Thank you!
---
https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/warcraft-iii-reforged?blzcmp=blizzard_hp_WarcraftIII:Reforged_card
---
buy this and you get the OG version instantly
---
I think it would be undeniably more confusing if you had multiple Emerald Dreams that were unmerged, no?
---
You say login queues are "anti player". They may feel like it for many the moment they are present, in the PoV of the player, cause they aren't fun. It's like being in a themepark (which wow is), and waiting in line for your turn. I get why he says it has a charm, because you are there with so many other people looking to hop in on that ride, and it's cool to see so many people around because it's a one time special event. Very MMORPG like experience, one exclusive to this genre.
---
It's not a moronic opinion at all for a DEV to have that queues have their charm and place, because he's looking out for the whole game experience, not just for the one queue experience a player is gonna have due to the massive nature of MASSIVE MULTIPLAYER online RPG launches (which are special the way the are, and should retain that special feeling). 
---
Liking queues is something you wouldn't expect to hear from a PLAYER more than anything. Not a dev.. because he's concerned with the whole game that you enter after you've made it through the very temporary queue. And even a queue is a memorable event.. a controversial one for many players probably, but much more interesting than a super smooth, non MMORPG like launch that has no issues caused by massive player influx at all. It's anti MMORPG, and that's also why layering and sharding doesn't fit into a game like WoW.
---
Unless there's a dbm for telling people to stop DPS, aggro will still cause fuckloads of wipes.
---
Leeway seems way stronger now. Melee attacking from like 10 yards means 5-8 kiting won't work and it DID work in actual vanilla.
---
The difference between a lvl 9 hunter and a lvl 10 hunter with a pet is hilarious. It's like changing the difficulty from Nightmare to Game Journalist.
---
yes, that's how life works, idiots get mad when they cant preform and they cant comprehend how to improve.
---
Agreed, TBC had some bad ass tiers as well. But nothing beats Bloodfang imo
---
I wasn't even aware this was a battle, the mounts weren't in the game in 1.12
---
yeah modern servers are actually many, many times more powerful so there is less reason for sharding or layering of any kind than there was in 2004
---
been looking for something like this, thank you
---
People are really overestimating how much "easier" classic dungeons/raids are. Sure, there's less mechanics, but the mechanics that do exist are not so simple. 
---
Not pulling extra mobs by accident is a huge deal in vanilla, much more than later xpacks. Also, people who started raiding TBC or later barely have to deal with threat ceilings. There's a whole bunch more stuff along those lines going on in classic, and the biggest one is the sheer difficulty of coordinating 40 people - it is a hell of a lot more difficult than coordinating 25. Alot of people are expecting the raids in classic to just fall over because they're used to the complex mechanics from later xpacks, but they are seriously underestimating the difficulty of all the different balances you need to strike in classic. Even trash mobs on AQ40 are going to destroy guilds. 
---
I bet a bunch of people going in expecting the old raids are gonna be in for a ride awakening
---
You charge people for it because you can, and to fund your guilds actual progression.
---
And it's funny that the icon (like many others) was recycled from Warcraft III. This one is the Human Captain icon too.
---
So they did this while testing, which means they have the capability - which we always knew they had. But there is no indication they plan on doing this, and if you read what they actually posted they stated they intend for each layer to have the population of a full vanilla server.
---
&gt; and everyone in your guild usually looked pretty fly.
---
That was kind of the problem. When everyone looks special, nobody is.
---
Yeah but originally they weren't.  They just wanted to go back to their normal lives and their families, but were rejected and threatened with genocide.  You'd probably try to start deleting those people too.
---
yes they were
---
you sound like such an incredible guy honestly :)
---
So i re-checked the whole 8/8 T2. It gives +30 shadow resistance. (I must admit i remember it to be 50 from one pserver. I cannot check it there now, since im not at home). However still, 30 from equip, 10 from cloak enchant, 60 from aura still makes it 100. Engineers can eventually make it 120 with shadow reflector. 100 wont make you unkillable, but you will resist considerable amount of fears. Combined with your heals, you are nowhere to be easy target for warlocks.
---
Started o  15x exp private server, to fool around and refresh my memory of the game.
---
Awesome story!
---
Yeah, but the layers aren't static. They are directly comparable to old style realms, just connected. So if you on four separate realms had approximately 60 hardcore players on each, it's obvious that you would have 240 hardcore players on the equivalent 4 layer server. They might temporarily be all on the same layer, but that's fairly irrelevant to the resource availability, since there will definitely be ways to get to different layers.
---
Probably not. If a realm needs 3 layers, it will log people in continuously to each layer even if they aren't all full. The only way to switch layers without logging off and on is by joining a group in a different layer, and I doubt server population will fall off quicker than when layer merging happens.
---
Interesting. I hope that bug gets addressed before classic releases.
---
Okay what happens if those people stay?
---
Warrior and shaman have almost no capability for gold making. Hunter is tier god goldmakers, we're talking about making anywhere between 2x to 5x more gold in same amount of time spent (depending on your skill/phrase/gear)
---
Just another thing to consider.
---
Or if you're like me, want to be a ret pally during solo/pvp and heal during raids, then realize holy reckoning is the best of both worlds and do that instead
---
Man that speed run was hella fun. Pulling it off for the first time was amazing.
---
My experience was much the same as yours though I am a little older so it was money from a regular (although low paying) job flying out of my pocket. It was a much better investment than the other games I would have purchased when counting cost to playtime. 
---
I made tons of friends I still talk to to this day, but things started falling apart near the end of Wrath. I had dropped many more casual friends by the wayside in-game to join a competitive raiding guild. College and life to precedence but I still hopped on from time to time and played a little of each xpac. 
---
I have more time now, but I feel the same way. The content isn't bad at all but the RNG of gear drops, the catering to casual players, the lack of a cohesive community due to cross-realm and layering, and the lack of a need for a tight group of compatriots to get through content all detract from the experience. I'm looking forward to playing on a single-server world and reexperincing that world now that I know what I'm doing.
---
Stardew Valley
---
Try gathering all the copper first, before smelting so your skill is higher before you begin smelting for skill ups.
---
the event for them ended way before 1.12, some were available on the AH only
---
&gt;That’s why layering even beyond 1 week will have people exploiting 60 resources like crazy
---
It's going to be hilarious to watch as the Monkeynews alt layer method is abused to farm hundreds of Black Lotus a day.
---
You won't level as tank spec, but you can still tank all instances, you'll learn on the way. For raiding you'd be fine as an off tank. Just talk to your fellow tanks / read up on boss fights and you'll be fine.
---
DPS class will be a lot easier yeah.  
---
Tank spec isnt really needed untill you start doing 20/40 man raids, it's better to go arms and 2H in 5-man dungeons and just inform your healer to actually heal.  
---
but when you start raiding (realistically about 20-25 days of playtime into classic) it'll be nice to tank since you're the one in control of the raids success, your ability to control the fight as the main tank is really neat, even as a dps specced designated 2'nd tank the raid will greatly benefit if you make some good decisions mid-fight like switching to def stance and taunting that one minion that had it's CC interrupted, or if you've got the reflexes to pick up where your main tank just flat out died.
---
hey, just edited my post w/ a link to the thread i was thinking of. their argument is basically that everyone is sorted into brackets each week, with each bracket requiring a certain minimum amount of honor, and that on low pop servers it’s not uncommon for *no one* to hit the minimum for entry into the bracket that you need to actually advance — rather more likely the bracket below it, which is only enough to stave off decay/tread water. thoughts on that?
---
You would absolutely be fine. Tanks don't have to be raid leaders - it's actually better when they aren't worried about what the healers are doing and where the dps is standing - someone else can know everything and you can do your job. Do it well and have fun!
---
Looks like a certain pserver
---
They didn’t look badass or anything they just looked like they were put together. I never really saw a problem with it and making sets that looked good was fun. 
---
It works for retail but idk about classic. I’m not upset that it won’t be in classic but I don’t think that Tmog deserves the hate that it gets.
---
&gt; What percentage of the player base played before AQ was put in? Hell, what percentage played before BC came out?
---
I'm just talking about the percentage of players active at that time.
---
You’re right. They were in a meeting and said “this game is too classic, we have to add something to piss people off!” Very true.
---
Well i think Shaman and druid i a good lvling combo.
---
Two of you have incresed movemant speed and that helps if you lvl together,you can run dungeons as a tank/healer combo...post lvl 40 you dont shere the same armor tipe.Plus you can be tauren too.
---
The 3 K number is the goal, but that is why they were collecting feedback to see the zone aggressiveness of layering to make sure it was playable.
---
I remember that lol, it was a pretty hot topic back then
---
It was probably pretty low because content was being pushed out so fast that people couldn’t keep up.
---
If they slow it down this time around you’ll see more people progressing into the harder content.
---
#**&lt;Rising&gt;**
---
We're **&lt;Rising&gt;!** A new semi-hardcore raiding guild playing Horde on an EU-PVP server.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
**Introduction**
---
We have all been waiting a long time for Classic WoW and we are looking to build our roster of players now so that we can really hit the ground running.
---
The main focus of our guild will be to build a community of friendly players that are keen to help each other and get the most enjoyment out of Classic. We believe that having a group of supportive players will be a huge benefit in Classic as there is such a focus on cooperative play.
---
When you are levelling, we want a community to be there to help you with that quest or to kill that Alliance dog who has been corpse camping you. At endgame, we want to gear up together and have fun doing so.
---
**Raiding**
---
We plan to start endgame content as soon as we can. We intend to host raids on Monday, Thursday and Sunday 20:30 - 11:30 CET for progression raids, although I do not expect we will need all 3 days to clear the current content (at the start).
---
If you do sign up, we expect you to be on time and prepared. That said, by no stretch of the imagination are we a hardcore raiding guild that’s pushing for world firsts or expecting players to sink every minute of their time into Classic. We're all a bit older now with life stuff going on. Our goal is to clear the content before the next patch roles out but also enjoy it, so know your class and bring your best.
---
Although the guild is young, we're starting to get a core raiding team together, at the moment our preference on roles for new raiders are:
---
* Strong - Restoration Shaman
---
* Strong – Mage
---
* Strong - Fury Warrior
---
* Medium – Warlock
---
* Medium - Restoration Druid
---
* Weak – Hunter
---
* Weak - Holy Priest
---
* Weak - Rogue
---
We're running a Loot Council system for raiding with the goal to be as transparent as possible. While we know this can be a turn off for new members, we want to make sure that the loot that is distributed is fair and also rewarding for those who are loyal, attendant and good members of our community.
---
We also have future plans for alt raids, however this will be much further down the line.
---
**Other guild activities**
---
Whilst our main focus will be on raiding we also plan to host some PvP events. Personally, a lot of our current guild members and I love Classic's PvP content! We are hoping to do some World PvP, Battlegrounds and to raid a capital cities.
---
There has also been an expressed interest for twinks by current members. So I imagine we will have a community on this as well.
---
**Member expectations**
---
We only expect members to be friendly to each other, willing to help their fellow guildies and be able to have a laugh while doing so. If you're raiding then we have separate expectations such as turning up on time and so on.
---
If you feel like this could be the guild for you then please visit our website https://rising.shivtr.red/. You will need let us know a little about yourself to ensure that we share the same values.
---
Additionally, if you have any questions, or would just like to have a chat please do contact us directly on discord @[Rising] Boo#0059, @GlenCoco#3702, @mizi#3868 or @QFierced#7447.
---
**Lok'tar Ogar!**
---
Yea get back to me when ret pallys are consistently getting 1k dps in classic without a PERFECTLY set up situation against undead for a short, irrelevant period of time.
---
I quit playing full time after the first few months of MOP, and have only come back for a couple of months for each subsequent xpac, with the exception of BFA. Still haven't bought it, and I don't know if I ever will. Since I'll have a sub for Classic, I may just play occasionally on retail up to the last free xpac (if at all).
---
Everyone having a bit more $$, prices being a bit higher. Inflation baby.
---
A big portion of Classic Wow will be populated with old ass folks, so EVERYTHING will be different.... including farming and economies.
---
This is the most optimistic way of looking at outdated graphics I've ever read lol
---
&gt;people barely knew about thotbot 
---
that’s not even close to reality, most people were well aware of thottbot
---
 Not here in Germany
---
Tanking up to the 50s is pretty simple. Over 50 some instances are a little more challanging, but by that point you should know what you're doing so it won't matter anyway.
---
It's advised to NOT level as prot due to the fact it will take you a lot longer to level with little to no real gain. As you can tank anything pre-60 as a dps spec just fine (use a 1h wep with shield and switch to defensive stance of course).
---
In terms of learning the instances and raids that just comes with time and experience. There is plenty of information out there detailing all the raids.
---
If you do decide to tank and are worried about messing up just let your group know you are new and I'm sure someone will help you out.
---
The group will be a lot more willing to help you if you say hey I'm new anything I should know. As opposed to you just running head first into something and acting like an idiot.
---
Warlocks have talents and gear to negate this as well, and bring it lower to around 50.
---
Still good, I admit, but it doesn’t change the fact that they can dot/drain mana you and leave their pet on you forever
---
Not necessarily a bug as far as I can tell but I have no values from retail to compare. Seems to me more like them trying to nerf mob tagging or private servers had it wrong.
---
Why can't you play tft?

#&lt;The Nuke and Turtle&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP]
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun  
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace  
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette  
---
* Helpful cooperative environment  
---
**You are:**
---
* Patient  
---
* Sociable  
---
* A team player  
---
**Intentions:**
---
We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more!
---
Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you.
---
Raids will be accomplished with a focus playstyle. All specs will be accepted and you will be expected to bring your A game with regards to be being punctual, listening to the Raid Leader, and bringing a reasonable amount of consumables (a few elixirs/flasks, potions and buff food.) We don't mind if you're min-maxing a viable spec with 20 buffs and years of experience, or if you're a new player with the minimum consumable requirements playing something a bit different - as long as you bring you're best you are welcome!
---
Raid days are Sunday and Monday. 19:00-22:00 UK (20:00-23:00 EU.) As previously mentioned there'll be other group content every evening. There is no minimum attendance required for raids.
---
Loot system has been discussed with a DKP and Loot Council system outlined clearly. Majority of current members like the Loot Council system proposed but this too is up for further discussion.
---
**Recruiting:**
---
Old players New players Casual players Semi-Hardcore players We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved!
---
Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/JDHrnU3

Best idea so far
---
Keyword being "better" alternatives.
---
One of the popular alternatives I've seen was to just use queues to solve the problem. As if having people wait in multiple hours of queues for days if not weeks just to login wouldn't be miserable for almost everyone involved (it happened for some servers on vanilla launch and people were "pissed" to use charitable phrasing).
---
Another popular alternative is to just make hundreds of servers and then merge them all later. Which to be just sounds like a much worse and more destructive version of "layering" to me.
---
Which alternatives do you see as being an improvement on layering?
---
Just watch nobbel87 YouTube videos.
---
The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild
---
I’m definetly with you on the blue/purple differentiation, I often have to look quite closely and compare it with other colors
---
Your arguments are valid as a consumer but there comes a point where you need to understand that Blizzard is not who they were 15 years ago. 
---
Blizzard is releasing “Classic”, not re-releasing “Vanilla”. They’re doing this with the intention of making money and having it be a successful endeavor for as many old and NEW players as possible. 
---
 Layering may not seem like a player friendly decision to the minority of vanilla players who are  in this subreddit.
---
But in reality it absolutely is a consumer friendly choice to everyone else who’s paying for a sub to actually play the game on Aug 27th.  
---
Regardless of how rose-tinted people’s glasses may be; every major blizz launch has been an absolute shit show for about a week after it’s release date between error codes on login and waiting in server queues. 
---
These things were NEVER fun nor enjoyable and asking for things to be reverted back to that is just outright confusing and economically masochistic if you consider that you pay for your time to play. That’s literally paying to wait and watch a number go down. 
---
It’s not perfect, but Blizzard came up with a solution that allows you, and everyone else to play the game much more easily at launch and allows dynamic restructuring of players on a need be basis w/o a super disruptive change for a server like a merge. (That and also the fact that it is only a temporary solution to a temporary problem.)
---
I think we should all again understand the fact that this is NOT vanilla. It’s a best attempt at recreating it w/ additional architecture to allow more people to experience the game. We should stop self sabotaging our enjoyment over an unfinished mechanic that you “and many others may not even be affected by”.   
---
Give it time and try to enjoy the game for what it will be when it launches.
---
&gt; People are actually complaining about complaints getting fixed. 
---
People asked for layering to be removed. Sure it's better than nothing, but at the end of the day we still have layering. You're still going to see less people in the world.
---
"Error 500**Something’s Not Quite Right**This character profile could not be displayed, possibly for one of the following reasons:
---
* The character has been inactive. If this is your profile, try logging in and out of the character in the game client.
---
* The character name or realm was spelled incorrectly.
---
* The character is undergoing a process such as a realm transfer or faction change.
---
* The character may have been deleted.
---
* The character is below level 10 and thus cannot be displayed.
---
* An illusion. What are you hiding?"  
---
Sorry, no can do. I switched main late TBC and quitted game early Legion. I think I didn't log on it since WoD. And my account being currently frozen I have no way to log on it without reactivating my account. Remind me around August 13th when I'll reactivate to save some char names.  
---
Anyway, if you're hoping to find anything to confirm what I said I'm afraid you won't, I didn't kill KT or C'Thun on that char so all I have are MC/Ony/BWL achievements on first day of Wrath.
---
Vanilla WoW was most peoples' first experience with MMOs and tons became addicted.  You are going in on a blank slate and that makes me somewhat envious since you're going to experience it all the first time.  My opinion is that you should ignore all the discussion here about whats good or bad for PvP/raiding or what races are best for specific classes. Just pick a race and a class that sounds fun to you and you'll pick up information as you go along either in-game or on forum posts as it will make more sense to you.
---
I would also watch some youtube wow classic beginner's guide videos.  That may help orient you to the structure of the game so you aren't overwhelmed when you start playing.  After that, if there's a specific class you like there's no shortage of class specific tutorials online. Just makes sure its WoW *Classic* as current retail wow is a VERY different game.
---
Little significant lore related to vanilla WoW, and pretty much all of it is related to the Wetlands zone. It explains phenomenon in Wetlands like the presence of red dragons, Grim Batol (which very few people go to the trouble to see), the dragonmaw clan orcs, and the wrecked ships along the coast.
---
WC2 lore is mostly relevant for Cata.
---
The mechanics are simple, there's just less room for mistakes. No one is expecting bosses to "fall over", but there are fights where the tactic is dont stand in fire and spam abilities. Threat is an issue solved by an add-on, and there's *always* been trash that dominates runs, so mob CC is still alive and kicking in retail.
---
Lore-wise, alot has been retconned, but there are plenty of familiar names and places. The game itself is still a blast to play, imo.
---
Orb of deception will not be worth that much lol
---
I remember we started selling bwl gear to 8 specific classes. We spammed general for 1500g buy in, and got 1 of each class as a "buyer". That person got guaranteed class specific drops for the whole run, and had to bid extra on weapons etc. if they wanted those.
---
Taking 5 minutes to go buy a shitty shield and a one-hander will automatically make you the star of vanilla leveling (unless you're an anti-social asshat, obviously).  
---
People then cry when it's hell leveling the most gear-dependant class by grinding solo with shitty world drop gear. No shit.
---
I'm on my phone and it was formatted so wrong so it looked like you said am was 00:00 til 1159pm.
---
 derp.
---
As a horde I would prefer paladins be non-holy spec and not healbots in pvp.  Holy paladins are really annoying just because they heal so damn much in the back.
---
But, you're still a paladin. Slap on healer gear and you're absolutely fine to heal most raid content up until the tail end of AQ and into Naxx where the bosses actually do demand 110%.
---
Devilsaur leather tho
---
play wc3 while you wait
---
for the record, players have lost all skill in mmorpgs.  yes that's right, you're playing them ***wrong***.  cya or not at the next raid pug
---
Ehh shamans are the easiest kill for warlocks. They get pwned in no time.
---
Berserker Rage - The warrior enters a berserker rage, becoming immune to Fear and Incapacitate effects and generating extra rage when taking damage. Lasts 10sec.
---
No they weren't on the auction house.
---
Put gun in mouth....pull trigger
---
of course they were in the game in 1.12, 1.4 only removed them from the vendor tables.
---
Can you explain this?
---
There's still aggro, and a lot of people in retail have played when it was a more prominent factor. Download the add on, don't go above the tanks.
---
Thank you! Super quick response too!
---
F1 2019
---
&gt;You just need to keep your gear up to date
---
This so very much. Also don't you ever diss that Spirit, it's a gift from the gods as a warrior.  
---
Having high Spirit while leveling turns having to sit between each mob to eat into CoD health regen chain-grinding, I swear.
---
this comment, its what makes Orc the best all around
---
FF14 ShB
---
This is a very good way to let those around you know what your sexual preference is lol
---
You can learn as you level 1-60. It's not that hard. Watch some videos and you'll pick up on it. Don't level specced to tank though, you still can
---
Battalion 44, Dota Auto Chess
---
Hilarious. Truly is. 
---
“People didn’t even know how to kill mobs back then.”
---
&gt;You're all fools to believe Acti-Blizz.
---
Where is the deception here? No matter what you think of layering, they're adding it with the (intended) goal of making the game better. This isn't like microtransactions or something predatory.
---
It increases mana efficiency and total healing for healing touch and the initial regrowth heal.
---
If all you had is 4 month of BFA as DPS, Vanilla warrior and tanking will be very challenging. Tanking is not easy in dungeons with no snap or AOE agro, if you have a new healer and DPS there will be problems. 
---
Leveling as a warrior the entire world PVP and PVE shits on you, it is by far the slowest and hardest class to level. If you dont have a higher level character to feed gear to your warrior and you are new and don't have a leveling group it will take you 4-6 month of 5 hrs a day to get to 60.
---
Once at 60 the life gets better..... my concern most of warriors never make it there. 
---
Play an easy DPS, learn the game ..... level a warrior.
---
More like 2-3 hours. Unless you're wiping a lot or people are going afk all over the place there's no way MC + Onyxia takes more than 3 hours even in pre-raid gear.
---
The launches of Legion and BfA are proof that sharding at launch absolutely works with WoW. 
---
Phasing is lore-related, so the fact that you get those confused tells me you don’t really know much about the topic.
---
This was the first guy who's wow videos I was actually really into.
---
it is.
---
Great input! That added so much to the conversation that the other 6 people who mentioned the same thing didn’t!! Thanks!
---
Mobs don't have that
---
its for the stress test homie
---
Taurens were able to ride raptors in TBC. Not Vanilla.
---
Mobs on this sub don’t seem to care if the same thread is posted 20 times a day
---
Big surprise: Blizzard doesn’t give 2 shits about people wanting unarmored mounts/national servers/rppvp servers etc. unless it gives them money it’s not important for them.
---
It’s just a little under 2 months anyways
---
Use your pets to totem stomp, most shaman don't pay attention to your fel hunter or succubus slapping their tremor totem while they're getting feared.
---
Also remember berserker rage can only be used in berserker stance, if you see the warrior switch to battle/defensive stance he can be safely feared.
---
I’m assuming you mean Phases 1-6 because if you’re referring to 1-60 then absolutely not, just no. Warrior DPS until level 40 is nowhere near the top.
---
Steam Vaults was hard as hell early on. Fuck that place. BC dungeons were a trip!
---
I bet youre the guy that says "see you next year ha ha" before leaving for a few days around New Years
---
Tauren Paladin. Meh.
---
Yeah you have to look at the schedule to when test times are then log in... I did it its so much different than I remember.. I did play vanilla back in the day
---
ask in r/Monitors check [https://pcmonitors.info/](https://pcmonitors.info/) [https://www.rtings.com/](https://www.rtings.com/) [https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/](https://www.tftcentral.co.uk/) 
---
The monitor you linked is 1080p in 27' that a big nono for me
---
This guy slideshows.
---
I just keep reporting them as spam since I suspect they're all coming from the same source. I hope others do the same.
---
Thats true for all spells and classes, not only Druids. And since crit affects all spells the same, it doesn’t factor in to where the breakpoints are, it just pushes all ranks upwards.
---
Hmm... now that I think about it. Maybe I should start with Warcraft 1 instead. What do you think?
---
Most wont reach Naxx, but most wont aim for it either.
---
If you want to maximize reputation gains to get the mount it is. Its a bunch of free rep you're not getting if you don't. You get a Zepp straight there. It would probably only take you like 10-15 mins or so to get there.
---
Thank you!
---
If a warrior is feared out of berserker stance, he is stuck in the fear right?
---
Dont you DARE diss the paladin tier 1 set, its badass and unique
---
theres a video of todays beta showing that mobs indeed have it, but you can continue defending blizzard with misinformation
---
thats a cool way to think about it. back in the day blizzard planned that rogues had a class profession in whivh they can make costumes and such. loved that idea :) 
---
dont get me wrong, i love vanilla how it is. but those ideas are great
---
The difference is STV is full of groups of ppl waiting to gank you. If you cant go invisible you're screwed.
---
Umm than neither can you? Of course it's speculation. The point is players have the option to play what they want and the consequences of each choice. I hardly see how it hurts blizzard or layer fans by having more options.
---
Wow, so smart.  Everyone else is just a drone if they don't agree with you, right?
---
On the other hand if you were a rogue looking to grief it's easy to see where he is, kill him once then scamper before he calls backup:)
---
I gave you an upvote just for not saying jebaited. But yeah that entry is just the for when the stress test opens up again around July 19th. You also need that drop down if you want to uninstall the Classic client.
---
Second playing wc3. It shows a bit of age, but it's a great game and will put you at the starting point for WoW story-wise.
---
MMOs are all about the game world and immersion. So if you find yourself liking the orc campaign in wc3, or the night elf druid units, you know better what to roll on WoW. I strongly believe that people should follow their aesthetic instincts with MMOs and not look for a specific gameplay rotation when rolling for the first time.
---
i like you and your comment ! ;)
---
I have fond memories of tbc heroics being a catch 22 kinda deal where you needed gear from heroics to do heroics. Good times.
---
Prot paladin is worse than any meme dps spec because not having a taunt or dying can wipe the raid, but doing bad dps just adds 10s to your kill time.
---
Boop beep. PSA: nkid&amp;#50;99 is a bot out to be a karma farmer!    
---
While everyone appreciates kindness and kind wishes, a bot with ulterior motives is not the way to do it.
---
Except the speed levelers play night elves.
---
As people mentioned Berserker Rage breaks fear https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=18499/berserker-rage#comments
---
HOWEVER you must be in the berserker stance as you cannot change stances while feared.
---
Yeah most of them are literal bots that just follow their idol mindlessly
---
It's straight up free. You just go talk to a guy and he's like you are doing such a good job, quest complete, learn the spell.
---
Even BWL is easier than people remember.  We cleared that on Scriptcraft with a moonkin no problem.  The only place I could see it really mattering are when you get to AQ40 or Naxx.
---
Haha any reason?
---
Shamans are an easy kill for a warlock
---
It's ok if you can't spot the hypocrisy.  I didn't expect you to be able to.
---
Shadow oil is also BiS for melee as weapon buff (unless replaced by wf)
---
I'm coming back after only play TBC and WoTLK as a casual.  Will still be pretty casual but excited about vanilla.  Sadly, my RL friends refuse to play.  At least for now.  My luck is I'll roll horde and then they'll come back to play but only want to go alliance or vice versa.
---
That's really great to hear, I'll try not to get too overwhelmed when it first drops. Is there any specific tutorial or guide you would recommend?
---
Remember to actually think before defending mechanics and looking at all the evidence that Layering is just Phasing with a new catchy name.
---
KappaPride
---
What I really need to do is not play anything, and get some IRL stuff done in the next couple of months.
---
Yep
---
Unless it’s a false memory, I could’ve sworn you still had to go to a lock trainer and learn it like it was a spell. I think I even borrowed the g from my brother because vanilla was poverty.
---
Blizzard has so many people wrapped around their fucking finger with this layering. 
---
"It's the ONLY choice. NO other alternative could EVER work. DEAL WITH IT!"
---
Oh, ok
---
Aye same , was amazing to watch and because I sucked back and didn't really know aoe farming was possible ( untill I saw a mage in tanaris doing it )
---
You get to play the game with virgin eyes, to experience the wonder for the first time, oh and you're probably taller than me lol 
---
As for your class selection I recommend picking a role before class. Do you want to deal, DPS (deal damage) or tank (soak up damage) 
---
Those are the three roles, they have ups and downs, if you wish to know more just ask. I heal myself
---
"week or two"
---
Haha.
---
It won't be any harder than it was for all the people who did it in 2004
---
How so?
---
The 30 minute cooldown Recklessness also breaks fear but 1) long cooldown 2) requires berserker 3) 20% increased damage received. On the other hand crits!
---
WotF is not worthless. Berserker rage only lasts 10 seconds and has a 30 second cooldown. Shadow priests can actually survive long enough for their fear cooldown to pop back up and will catch you without berserker rage up and then it’s game over.

BFA, it’s really fun now
---
Ehm yeah, Layering actually does not apply to the entire server. They are Layering each continent = a set of zones. That means you can easily also break it down onto a smaller subset of zones.

All this and you’re still actively supporting blizzactivision with a sub every month. Vote with your wallet. Your “begrudging” $15 is the exact same $15 a die-hard retail loving fanboy pays. They don’t care, you’re giving them money

Damn dude. Proved him wrong. 10/10. Nice
---
I fell out of love during Cata, kept raiding through Panda with the friends i had made in the raiding guild i was in.  At legion the guild wasnt raiding so i found a different group.  It was definitely not the same.  It was a little challenging but just didnt like the story or feel immersed in the community.
---
Came back when they had the legendary weapons.  (I wanted ashbringer) even raided with a community that i have known for years and play diablo 2 with off and on.  Good people, mature and friendly.  I couldnt get myself to commit.  After i got the weapon and had to grind those quests for the exp for the weapons it was just meh.  I also really dislike having to do the same dailies over and over.  I dont mind grinding, but i prefer to run an instance or grind mobs for rep.  Doing the same sets of dailies over and over everyday (or i fell behind) really drove me mad.  Maybe i dont want to log in Friday-Saturday i will make up for it on sunday.  Instead i was just 2 days behind the rest.
---
I'm ready
---
*I'm not ready*
---
For most, that isn't an issue. However, for the few that have what's known as "addictive personalities," nearly anything that creates a dopamine hit can become an addiction in short order. It is why they don't recommend for those addicted to drugs to switch to alcohol: it ends up with the same problem. Same with gambling, same with sex. The defining characteristic is whether engaging in the activity negatively impacts your life.
---
Thanks for the raid info, that's super helpful to know as I was pretty lost when trying to understand raiding.

---
apparently thats too much for you.
---
"There no alternative."
---
Idiot.
---
sad part is, 1-40 isn't even halfway done
---
By your logic they should ask for a separate subscription payment for classic
---
Don't worry.
---
No. A bit of searching shows you that you really don't need a great laptop for it. That's the beauty of it, accessible for everyone.
---
Unless he has the pvp trinket.
---
I think it's possible you've misunderstood the post you've cited a little bit.  
---
There's no minimum honor requirement, there's a minimum participants requirement. To be a participant you only need 15HKs. The top 0.2% of players get bracket 1, this means if you don't have 500 participants, there's no bracket 1. To have less than 500 players with 15HKs or less (Level 10 or above) in a week would be **insanely** low pop, to the point of bordering on impossible.  
---
Also, even in the scenario of insanely low pop, where bracket 1 doesn't exist. In the example he uses he gives what is almost the most extreme example possible, of being at 59000RP. It's true that in this extreme example it would take longer to hit rank 14 but the question wasn't whether or not it would take longer, but whether it would be *easier,* and it's a lot easier to be in the top brackets with less competition. Just less time investment needed.
---
I came back in Legion after quitting at the end of wotlk. 
---
I can't fucking stand mythic plus. I always liked to think of five mans as stepping stones into raids, and I was perfectly fine with never having to step into most of them again once I got raid gear. The fact that I not only had to grind these dungeons over and over again but also try and optimize the path I take made for a rather poor experience all expansion. To make matters worse I was a tank so many of the affixes were designed to ruin my day and being a tank you're expected to run this shit a lot with your guildmates.  
---
I also don't like world quests at all. I would do my 4 per day for the box and that was it. And the only reason I did that was for the chance at a legendary which itself was a fucking stupid system in legion that I can write an entire other post about.

---
00:00
---
What? Why would that happen? I think you're hamstring kiting wrong.
---
The whole point of hamstring kiting is to trade blows 1 for 1 with mobs that have a faster attack speed. If it doesn't work then it wouldn't be talked about in literally every warrior leveling guide?
---
I still don't understand the answers saying it's harder on high pop servers when everything is % based.  Is there a higher concentration of grinders at high pop servers?  Wouldn't they move to the lower pop servers if it's supposedly easier?
---
You couldn’t buy them in 1.12, so why should you be able to buy them now?
---
wait some time without doing pvp/farming/whatever then u switch layer when the cd hits 0. seems good, whats the problem?
---
you just accurately described current Retail WoW.
---
Imagine waching a really good movie and being able to forget it and enjoy it fully again!
---
its kinda easy to have 100g at 40 if you don't waste money on useless skills, like really, you will save **at least** 10g to 40.... went with a troll priest in a pserver and had 70g at level 36 lol
---
Power levelers find it more efficient to not loot and skin ever mob while leveling. So instead they aoe grind skinning spots and once skinning is leveled they continue on to leveling. Bag space is another big issue
---
You can jump to the right on the ledge just after killing the opening two giants to skip some trash.
---
OK, now I see you were not referring at all to the Tauren part, just druid class itself.
---
Yeah, I guess you're right - it's kinda ironic, isn't it? : D
---
34 hours isnt that bad, anyone can do it and be fine a day later
---
Elemental grinding stones are better, especially when dual-wielding.
---
Lol I loved borean tundra. The quests were easy and the zone had a simple layout. I also liked the lonely music. Only place I didn't like was the gnome area. I took my first alt through howling fjord just to see what it was like and the next four or five went through BT again.
---
This is exactly what they are trying to avoid.....
---
There are a lot of people who just play private servers because its free. In my experience there are plenty of casual guilds on private servers who take 4 hours to clear MC and spend months trying to kill Nefarian.
---
madman stand up after leveling to 1-40 in one sitting and the blood clots travel to his brain and he dies
---
It was an afternoon work joke on excessive layering threads where you swap the nouns "servers" and "layers" and you get the current system:(
---
It literally isnt rare. It is second or third most played for horde
---
I would probably skip gathering profs for leveling, if you really want to get one, do it at 40 when you have a mount and can easily run through early zones with a mount.
---
Some people say skinning is just free money you can vendor, while this is true, it's only worth it if you go and sell items frequently, if you are full all the time it's probably not worth getting skinning. Depends on your route.
---
If you don't want to get to 60 in a decent time, you can pick up professions on the way, it's a lot of fun actually so it entirely depends on what you want, good leveling time means you don't take professions, if that doesn't matter to you as much, take a gathering prof and tailoring no problem.
---
I picked a warrior as my first toon in 2004. I didn't read a damn thing until I was past level 50. I had not played an MMO before. I had a friend who knew a little about the game but not much about warriors. I was bad. I was really bad.
---
I got to 60 in about 12 days played. You'll be fine. Tanking in vanilla was so much fun.
---
Warrior pvp trinket doesn't break fear.
---
I haven't looked at any but I'm actually curious so I'll check some out tonight and link what I find.  Some people here might have some recommendations.
---
999 - 1.0k felt so good
---
Also, no one seems to be mentioning that Fury Warriors can talent Death Wish, which makes you immune to fear effects for 30 seconds, on a 3 minute cooldown. People might not have been mentioning that because I'm not 100% sure that you can activate it while feared, so you wouldn't be able to break fear effects.
---
Seth Rogen doesn't play WoW, never has. He shits on it all the time.
---
During the stress I was making groups left and right. Felt amazing having a social WoW experience again. And I'm going to need it so I can be that star everyone needs tanking for them. I'm so damn excited I don't even care. Plus I leveled pally in vanilla as my first character. At least warrior does more than seal every 30 seconds.
---
For sure, not everyone went full retard because it was 2004-2006
---
It's not like it was the stone age, the main difference I remember is I read guides then, now I watch them
---
-2 point for ugly human.
---
Oh crap. I looked it up real quick and forgot it did different things for different class. My bad. Ty.
---
They wouldn't mark the quests with different colours if there weren't different level requirements and therefore, different time investments for them.
---
Also a great place to farm cloth, so that's a nifty bonus.
---
Wotf is good for anyone in pvp. Charm, fear and sleep. Not just fear. It has a lot of uses, including against magic dust that people will probably have stockpiled by the time phase 2 hits.
---
It's what made me finally decide to go with my aesthetic preference of undead warlock over Orc
---
Hey man! Semi-Hardcore/Casual is exactly how we're describing the Guild we're creating, with a focus on PvE (while still doing PvP).  
---
What Region and Server type are you looking for?
---
I know this was added late in vanilla. So I would say yes. However since the beta is not 60, no way to know for sure if this will be in release or in phase 6
---
IIRC, WC3/FT is the main lore setup for WoW, with WC1 setting up world/characters and WC2 almost being a filler.
---
This has never been my experience but, with the giant influx of normies you never know what classic will hold removed from private servers. Who knows maybe a whole new generation of Unbreakable watchers will think it's good and get caught in the Shammy trap. lol
---
Holy shit this looks amazing. Hope someone can port it to Classic.
---
Layer can definitely help with launch if Blizzard wants it to. They can tweak the layer size to be aggressively small right at launch, so tons of layers are create for say, the first 12 hours, but then as time goes on and the new character rush slows down they can start expanding the layers to be larger and thus fewer for each server as people are spreading out.
---
I'm not saying they will do this, just that it definitely appears to be an option from everything I have seen.
---
That doesn't really have anything to do with wanting more content. It's not like only the people who cleared Naxx were excited about Burning Crusade back in the day.
---
Assfolk is that like a gross version of merfolk?
---
Once the raids are on farm, they tend to take 2 hours or less, going down as your DPS get better gear.
---
By Naxx, MC should take just over an hour, and BWL about 1.5 hours, AQ40 maybe 2 hours depending on wipes, and Naxx 3-4 hours.
---
You have to do AQ20 for the max spell rank upgrade totems.
---
Ooo nice, definitely something to check into
---
I played wow all through the pre tbc and tbc and loved the hell out of it, always watched old 60 pvp videos as a 70 rogue being bummed I missed out on all the world pvp.
---
Quit not long into wotlk as it felt too button mashy and recovered my account when cata had been annouced with lots of pvp promised to find someone had played my rogue to 80 and decked out icc hc gear 😂 (hacked or?)
---
Played all cataclysm mainly as a resto druid getting really high rated in all brackets of pvp and even into MoP despite not liking the direction of the game.
---
MOP I played off and on forever as a r sham, got a few challenge mode sets and nice rating in pvp but never really enjoyed the expac
---
Was really excited for WoD especially with a new hunter main for pvp, got high rating in the first season and just lost interest. 
---
My friend who I've not spoken too in years, messages me out the blue a few weeks ago as says how tempted are you by classic wow? Watch a few vids messaged a few other in game Real life friends and boom  here we are. 
---
The hype is now real af. 
---
Going orc hunter this time for classic, I'll probally roll a troll s priest and a human pally too ngl. Alt itus is real

**&lt;No Offense&gt; Alliance | NA-PVE | Late-Night Raiding Guild**
---
* No Offense is a group of old school raiders that just want an enjoyable gaming experience. We are currently running Heroic Raids and obtain AOTC on every content tier in retail, and we plan to do the equivalent in Classic WoW.
---
**Late-Night Pacific Time (PST PDT PT):**
---
* The guild tends to log on after the kids go to bed and log off around midnight.
---
**PvE:**
---
* Because we have kids and jobs and we enjoy raiding, not corpse camping streamers and being called terrible names by kids younger than our children.
---
**Alliance:**
---
* We currently raid as Horde.  So we're mixing it up!  Plus - Paladins!
---
**What we are looking for in members:**
---
* Mature players interested in raiding and playing to support end game content.
---
* Social members that want to hang out and have fun playing later into the evening with a friendly group.
---
* It would be great to get several farm groups going, so even if you just want to goof off and get carried by the main raid team through BWL while we're farming our 12th Ashkandi for a hunter... come on by!
---
* We will also be pushing AoTC and Mythic+10 content Horde side on retail WoW, so that option will also be available.
---
* Anyone that is also looking to participate in both retail and classic, this will be a great fit for you (though it's certainly not required).
---
**General Gaming Schedule:**
---
* 8:30 - 11:30 PT Weeknights and Weekends
---
**Raid Scheduled:**
---
* TBD, though our current Retail raid schedule is Wednesday/Thursday
---
If you are interested, please contact:

False.
---
We are talking about raid clear times.
---
They will be faster than retail vanilla...fact.
---
I think layering is going to be in classic forever, it makes sense for them to do it. They know people will learn to accept it and just learn to live with it, same thing with modern WoW. 
---
I don't want Classic to fail, but at the same time how can you remotely trust a company like Blizzard-Activision anymore? Just in the last 2 years it's been an absolute disaster.
---
* Killed modern WoW with greedy anti-consumer practices
---
* Killed Diablo for the Chinese mobile market
---
* No new innovative titles, just rebranding (WC3 remastered, Classic)
---
* No language specific servers for EU players for Classic and of course layering
---
* Not having language specific servers for EU players should be raising alarms everywhere, just goes to show they truly don't give a shit. It's almost like they want Classic to fail as hard as possible.
---
Even the "you think you do, but you don't" and "don't you guys have phones" perfectly encapsulates the attitude this company has towards it's customers. I think before it wasn't like this. It was gameplay first, and they respected their customers more. Now it's "Us vs Them". How can we (as blizzard-activision) squeeze as much money out of the customer as humanely possible without being too obvious about it.
---
Before companies had to make great games in order to turn a profit. They didn't have micro-transactions to save their game. Now games are designed with anti-consumer practices (including false advertising) and nothing but micro-transactions. It's a really sad state of affairs for video games. I think the industry might have to go through another crash to reset this anti-consumer nightmare were currently in.
---
T6 with Shield Wall of Azinoth is pretty lit, but T2 + Skullflame and Lokamir is better imo.
---
*raises hand* 
---
I was a no-lifer through vanilla and tbc. And then just kind of lost interest. The sense of server community really started dying towards the end tbc and I felt totally alone in wrath. 
---
I'm excited to  join up with a guild that I used to PvP against and forum troll with in vanilla. And they're one of those guilds on the list that actually cleared naxx in vanilla, so I'm really looking forward to raiding with them.
---
You may think that helmet looks bad, it's all a matter of taste, completely subjective... But you would be wrong.
---
Astroturfing by blizzard. It’s going on in the discord, Reddit, and the bnet forums (where it’s to be expected).
---
Sharding/layering threads and posts are being deleted by the hundreds, under the guise of “spam”.
---
Meanwhile in this thread I can count 50+ posts of people being intentionally misleading, downplaying the effects, and even straight up lying about layering. 
---
It’s meant to appear like a small issue that not many are worried about. Easy enough when negative opinions are silenced and positive opinions are allowed to stay, even if the poster admits he has no idea what he’s talking about
---
you're a great example to others :)
---
I do agree there. The learning curve is much less.
---
At some point you just have to let queues discourage people from hyper-focusing on a handful of servers. It's not really what you want to do across the board, but it's really the only way to combat the problem for specific instances.
---
What do you mean? You don't have to buy any expansions. The monthly subscription is all you have to pay to play Classic
---
five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls.
---
Lol. I was so bad back then too. I had spirit gems on my hunter. I was a keyboard turner and a clicker!
---
Yeah, I don't have for all the interruptions and irritation. Never could deal with PvP servers in any MMO.
---
If Classic is anything like Vanilla than the PvE servers will still see some world PvP action. Being able to opt in/out is nice...
---
If you do not loot, no you will not have the 100g at 40, Joanna took till 45 or so to get a mount.
---
Correction, both Chinese and Koreans farm gold. Chinese sell the gold for $$$, Koreans hoard the gold for in game huge purchases.
---
I’m gonna confess. I have always loved the banana set. 
---
Its got a lovely and tasteful colorscheme of white and gold which fits the paladin AND the alliance. Its got a full face helm that in my opinion looks way better than for example the stupid horn ones that plate wearers get for every level above 30 up to 60+. 
---
The helm and shoulder have blades on them, you can stab a motherfucker!
---
Arlington, Texas ?
---
Layering has its issues. My main fear is server overpopulation once layering ends. I'd be happier with queues and server merges once realms get too small. Not a good experience at the start, but overall the economy won't be hurt as much.
---
Oh I see what your saying. All this praise for the game is hyping me up!
---
It’s not too bad, definitely get into a levelling guild though so you always have buddy’s to quest with on the way up. 
---
Use the lower level instances to gauge how many mobs you’re comfortable tanking at one time and get used to when is best to spend threat. 
---
Practice taking control of 5 mans, people will generally do what you ask them too but if you don’t tell them then they don’t know. Example, I ask my groups to allow me to pull and give me a couple of seconds to collect groups before spamming DPS. I had a lock in WC that kept pulling mobs and I asked him repeatedly to stop, his reply was “lol does it really matter?” I insta kicked him and we just found a new DPS for the rest of the run. Bit harsh for a 5 man? Maybe, maybe not as lots of groups seem to struggle on the final boss when it’s very import for the tank to hold aggro on the second wave of mobs
---
Honestly, coming from no experience is almost better than coming from years of experience as BFA tanking is so different from Classic tanking.
---
Just take it easy, find a group of players that are willing to work with you and you'll be fine.
---
Tier 6 can go suck an anvil! It's got nothing on tier 2. I will fite u!
---
Oh I did, don’t worry. I quit since WoD and just re-subed to play the classic stress tests. And if they fuck classic up with people appearing and disappearing I’ll simply unsub
---
The quickest way as a night elf is to make the journey as a wisp and use fatigue to reset your graveyard.
---
just roll on a server that asmon isn't on, it isn't that hard
---
I hark back to the halcyon days when one could opine freely without worry of find-faults who will harry one's musings.
---
That might be true if you are only looking at mana efficiency. But as discussed, the tool balances both efficiency and output by default.
---
ring ring ring
---
You're underestimating how few people it takes to clear out an area of mobs. 5 or 6 people could keep a whole section of mobs pretty clear, all it takes is for 3 of those people to leave and suddenly the next wave of spawns comes and you are by yourself or with one other person with a dozen mobs around you.
---
You are right, I will add talents increasing crit, along with a crit field for all classes
---
There's a minimum population required to be able to get rank14.
---
Anyway other than that, the main factor is just how hardcore the server is. That's the only real factor. How many tryhard pvpers per population.
---
Picking your layer and being locked to it is literally no different than standard servers.  You can call it Emerald Dream layer 1 or ServerMcServerface...it doesn't matter.  This is in no way a solution to launch overpopulation or attrition over time.
---
I was going to go pally, but I got put off by the complaints, and I didn't think I would enjoy it end game. I like the supporting role/healing but something told me to go priest and I'm enjoying it alot. Maybe I'll alt a pally, but then I want a hunter again. I hate my brain.
---
Sstv said you can not have partial layers. It´s all or nothing. Source is someone at Blizz he talked with. I believe that.
---
Oh I know, I was ret spec for most of my first run through vanilla and healed in raids just fine, but still the idea of going a different route that still fulfills the class fantasy of holy warrior while being a potent healer intrigues me, and I really want to reckbomb some hapless rogues as well
---
Hey bros.
---
"Next month" sounds short but 57 days dont :D
---
I'd stay away from it alltogether as it might feel very slow and clunky to level a character in classic right after having leveled one in BfA.
---
Playing Retail to get ready for Classic is like playing Call of Duty to get ready for Battlefield. They're both good games with similar things, but not much translates over.
---
Damn, that's a terrific idea.  I was going to roll a hunter/warrior combo as well and this will be the perfect strategy - thanks!
---
It is there for no reason. A 20k pop server *cannot* exist and play out like actual Vanilla WoW did. There are too few resources for it to work. It's the reason the higher pop PServers have higher spawn rates on Lotus and things of that nature that have limited availability. 
---
It serves no purpose as a "Classic" server should max out at maybe 5k, probably less, population. Which would not need to be layered at all.
---
Do i recall gdkp being a thing. 
---
All gear was bid on with gold and was split amongst the raiders at the end of the raid. 
---
So you take a few geared a few undergeared and everyone can either get loot or money for there time.
---
I think on some servers withh really hardcore players probably did do this. But honestly on my server, where only one guild on each side was doing naxx, I never saw it. Multiple guilds could dobwl and my guild was one of them. We would get drunk and try to get people killed in MC cause it was so easy eventually. New guildies had epic loot raining down on them because most of us had it all. We could have easily sold runs but honestly it never occurred to us. I don't think anyone on my server thought to try is all.
---
What Crazy said.
---
180 is the skill required to skin mobs level 34-40 and depending where you are grinding, can take your skinning level to 300 very quickly.
---
I'm a big PVPer, I was a Gladiator in several seasons, but the thought of leveling a warrior  on a PVP server seems so nasty. Send me a DM when you get started if you remember and I just might do it ;)
---
So fucking wait and stop being selfish.
---
When you take part of a server merger I expect you personally to gladly give up both your character name and guild name as another player already possess it. Imagine your whole friends list suddenly changing overnight everyone having to take up a new identity.
---
A solution for this would be layering - but restrict it to the lower to mid range level zones and time-gate it. If layering is truly indented to handle the initial launch influx of "tourists" then I'd expect most of them not to climb much past 30.
---
Phasing, sharding, layering with all their different nuances, whatever you want to call it would be good for both short-term and long-term server health as long as it is implemented in a careful manner.
---
Well I'll be playing casually. I probably won't even log on for the first week of launch. I'm also not entirely worried about getting to 60 asap. So I'm fine with grinding ore or anything else I need to!
---
A gallon is the smallest size Coke you can get at a McDonald's. Farenheit was part Dutch, German and Polish. You basically can't blame him for coming up with weird stuff all the time.
---
Classic isn’t hard at all. It is just that people sucked back in the day. The old people and meme speccers on this Reddit hate the «min-maxers, but these min-maxers are the ones who will clear content fast as hell because they are optimised, and, because it is easy. It is just very grindy.
---
Raids in modern wow are waaaaay more complex.
---
I think the main reason people haven’t been mentioning it is largely because Fury isn’t  nearly as good in PVP as Arms. The healing debuff is just that important for focusing targets down.
---
Anyone?
---
No, but this post wasn't sent to the overall playerbase. It was sent to this sub.
---
Ha, you assume I have any of those things.
---
Yeah you have to transmog the actual item to be invisible
---
Unless I'm mistaken, those are boe
---
Yeah, I think I'm gonna hold onto everything I farm up and see if markets rise after initial craze.
---
It doesn't work in classic right - and is talked about in every post complaining about Hit Leeway.
---
Taking it easy I see
---
The cool thing about vanilla/classic WoW is that you can go in blind and discover all this at your own pace if you want to. The game is very new-player friendly, despite a subset of players trying to gatekeep it as some kind of hardcore game noobs and casuals simply cannot appreciate. You'll find the very nature of the game makes most players patient and communicative so I wouldn't stress over going in blind, and you definitely don't have to know how to min/max your character and play optimally to enjoy the game. WoW was released in 2004 as a casual man's MMO and it just got more casual by the time 1.12.1 (which Classic is based on) went live in 2006. The game isn't as hardcore as you may be led to believe.
---
&gt;Is there anything that I should try first? 
---
Can't really think of anything comparable enough that would get you a good taste of what Classic is like.
---
&gt; Should I try going on a private server before wow classic comes out? 
---
You could, but you'd have to keep an open mind and take it with a grain of salt. Blizzard's Classic server is based on the actual 1.12.1 patch and includes values and formulas that are not available outside Blizzard HQ. By contrast private server developers do not and never have had access to some of this information and thus a lot of educated guesswork went into it. We learned recently with the Classic beta that private servers are actually slightly more *difficult* than vanilla 1.12 WoW was. I found them to be authentic enough to scratch that vanilla itch, and if nobody had told me how "off" they were I honestly never would have noticed. But I would use them as more of a "this is roughly what Classic feels and plays like" guideline than an in-depth guide to gameplay and character builds.
---
&gt; How do I pick my race and class?  
---
I would search this sub for individual threads on this, and maybe [start here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c5nqx1/what_should_i_play_wednesdays_june_26_2019/). As a general rule play whatever you want. There's a pretty strong end-game meta, mostly pertaining to raid content, and you'll want to start with the thread I linked to see general end-game roles for classes you're interested in. Different classes/specs are in demand for different types of content. While a class/spec that interests you might excel at 1v1 PvP, flag-running, or ninjaing AV towers, it might significantly underperform in a 40-man raid. This doesn't mean you can't find a raid slot with that spec/role, but you'll want to be informed before you get halfway to 60 and learn that it might be hard to get a raid slot for your ret paladin.
---
Raids are challenging 40-man group dungeons that reward the best gear available. Your progress in a raid resets every week. Guilds are basically groups of players that share a global chat unique to that guild. Guilds are usually united behind similar purposes. A guild may focus on raiding, leveling, roleplaying, or PvP for example.
---
Yeah I was thinking about tailoring simply for making my own bags early on.
---
Because this is more like vanilla launch then an expansion launch, except it will be super easy to try out the game for a bit (especially with retail players able to try it for effectively free) and then stop playing.
---
Except also that vanilla launched surprised people by having player numbers in the low hundreds of thousands, while Classic will potentially have player numbers in millions trying to play right at release day.
---
Because non guild members getting gear for your guilds work should cost them something.
---
It is still incredibly abusable. A really big no life guild can send 20 players each on a layer and grind resources. After consolidation the guild now owns a metric ton of resources.
---
Always a good idea to play around that. Hadn't really thought about it!
---
Some consumables? Sure. The list of 16-20 some people are rolling out? Doubtful. I'd wager the time investment required would be comparable to live.
---
Bourbon
---
Peanut butter stuffed pretzels (lots of calories &amp; protein so you can skip a meal)
---
Goldfish
---
Them wands gonna be mad profit for sure haha
---
They said tauren hit box is correct. Afaik they haven't commented on the actual leeway mechanic.
---
Do it!!! Not spending gold on bags and making money off them is huge!!! I’m lvl 40 with 100g on a private server with this tactic!
---
The game will teach you everything you need to know up to max level. At end game you should have enough experience as a player to figure things out from there.
---
For picking a race and class I recommend the cool factor. What looks good and sounds fun is the right choice. You can always make another character to try new things if one of them isn't working for you.
---
Out of everything you mentioned, learning MMO jargon might be helpful to do ahead of time. It's all pretty simple though - most of it will make sense in context.
---
What on earth are you trying to calculate?
---
Smaller layers aren't really shards, as layers are designed specifically to be more static where sharding is designed to be very dynamic. Even with small layers you aren't going to be constantly shifted between layers as you move around the world, whereas sharding is always looking to move people to a more "optimal" instance of the game.
---
[Hype!](https://imgur.com/jq85OWU)
---
Few things.   
---
1. EQ is releasing Progression Servers on a fairly regular basis. 
---
2. Every server would have to luck into that perfect number. Much more than 3-4k population is not viable on a Classic Server. So, even if it dropped 70% (unlikely on most servers, unless/until they start releasing more similar to how EQ does it) it would barely end up in the prime population for a Classic Server.
---
What I mean by prime population is that Vanilla servers had limited resources. Black Lotus, Thorium, World Bosses, etc. And the spawn times of these resources was balanced around 3-4.5k pop servers.
---
Leveling a tank can be gruesome, especially warriors. That is, unless you have a group of friends and run 5-man dungeons non-stop. That is typically the best way to power-level since you'll always have the best gear. 
---
When solo questing, you can typically kill 2 mobs of your level and then you have to eat. As far as tanking goes... it's a pain. You have to communicate first and foremost. it's very easy for a caster to strip aggro if you're not geared for the content. Leveling in dungeons seems to help here. If you have a group that is somewhat competent and knows how to back off dps to let you pull ahead, you're gonna have a bad time.
---
One tweet. All the time.
---
k
---
T4: karazhan, gruul, magtheridon
---
T5: The Eye? (Kael'Thas? &amp; friends), SSC (Serpent...Shrine...)
---
T6: Back Temple, Mount Hjial
---
Bonus: Zul'Aman (no sets) somewhere in between.
---
Sorry for the language mistakes, non-English native here.
---
T5 was the pink powerranger for Paladin. T5 is/was kinda rare cause most people moved to T6 quickly. 
---
T6 from BT/MH is the bright yellow Lightbringer set
---
(awesome head 'nd shoulders)
---
Mage, for sure. Mage in classic plays like it’s from future expacs.
---
Cooking isn't hard to keep up with, and the stam/spirit buff is nice.
---
There are also some foods (like jungle stew) where the crafted good vendors for more than the ingredients.
---
Most likely going to be the opposite outside of something like Black Lotus. More items, cheaper product. Supply and Demand.
---
It was because they expect populations to drop and they don't want to bother server merging. It has nothing to do with any launch experience.
---
beep boop
---
Agree.  Offspec players should be in the back of the line, but still able to get in the line
---
Warriors are grossly overrated in Vanilla. I think it must have originated with Pat's PVP videos where he's got 52 talent points and a crew of healers.
---
Outside PVP movies, they're pretty weak and get completely steamrolled by any caster 1v1. Fun to play though.
---
As for what class, what type of combat do you like? 
---
**General types: ** tactical, spell casting, supporting friends, all arounder, Ranged, melee, burst damage, slow damage, control.
---
From this list what 2-3 things is something you'd like to be doing the most?
---
I don't see why you'd say that. It wasn't that uncommon towards the end of vanilla to see MC or BWL carry buy ins. There were 2 guilds selling spots on my server. I still even recall their names if you want them.
---
Ned healz!
---
Still a far easier solo class than rogues, that's for sure.
---
I have one in my room for those long flights.
---
Could perception be used as a purge shield for sac shield?
---
I remember reading guides back in the day about anything and everything. I had myself "min maxed" even while leveling...
---
They may not have been as efficient as todays ones but they were around. That being said more disposable income means that things will cost a bit more and people will be willing to spend alot more on boe upgrades. 
---
I feel the boe market will be the most notable thing. Things that are "bis" or on bis lists will be worth alot more. People will buy them.
---
[https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy\_fallacy](https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Fallacy_fallacy)
---
The first part had me breathless. Badum tiss.
---
Slow yes, clunky no. Just switched to a private server after playing retail for the last few months and it’s honestly refreshing being slower. The game feels like an actual MMORPG where your level means something. And it gives the game a sense of adventure and danger again having to do some work for a couple days before you can move to the next questing zone
---
That was the biggest naxx obstacle imo. So many warriors got poached because you went from needing 3-5 to like 8+. Losing a geared warrior hurts.
---
there will barely be any players around to thwart the possibility of aoe leveling, due to layering
---
It's amazing that you think blizzard cares an iota what you think.
---
That’s wrong because it’s the SAME amount of players, this isn’t 4 servers on 1 layer each, this is 1 server with 4 instances of spawns. If there are 10k players with 4x the loots spawns , that’s not 4x the players, that’s still only 10k players.
---
This is how you get addicted all over again!
---
I gave you examples that literally do work. You just refuse to accept that because you want to "win". Man, what a silly thing to get so defensive about.
---
I second the WC3 advice. If story is one of the things that drives you in a game then maybe read or watch videos that covers the lore of the world and story from wc1 - wc3.
---
In WoW there isn't really a single large story arc. Rather, each zone or area has its own small story. As you gather this information you may start to see some relation between the smaller stories. Having a base knowledge of the world and its history will help the stories make more sense.
---
Haven’t played in years and this immediately brought back all the sounds of buying and selling on the AH. Good times
---
Check out the Emerald almond lineup. Some of the flavors are very good - Wasabi, Habanero, Sriracha. Eat em straight from the bag/tin, no mess!
---
Unless your guild requires flasking at every raid, that's not a very tall order.
---
You mean not in your circle of friends.
---
There were mmorpgs before wow.  WoW launched in the US several months before it launched in the EU.  I guarantee you that there were German players on EU launch day that were not clueless and also knew about sites like Thotbott.
---
Blood fang only looked good on undead. There were sets that looked good on every race
---
&gt; while I have engineering, cooking, fishing, and mining maxed
---
what, no First Aid?
---
Mr T’s Night elf Mohawk is what I’m hoping comes back
---
They aren’t that stupid because then retail would just lose all of the players who have been waiting years for this. At least this way they are still getting new subs from returning players who only want to play classic. And the people who play retail now that are waiting on classic, probably won’t quit retail altogether. So it’s just healthier for both games this way.
---
I quit at the beginning of cataclysm. I couldn't stand there being a finish line that kept moving. Months of raid progression thrown away by moving the level cap up by 5. And they went and tore the world apart. If I could, I'd stay in classic.
---
&gt; If you think hunters are only present for dps then you never raided endgame in any expansion. Stop pretending.
---
I was an only Hunter player for 12 fucking years lol. And i raided Naxx in classic. You don't stand a chance against the other pure dps classes: Mages, Warlocks, Rogues and Warriors. Especially if your guild manages to have someone applying the Nightfall debuff. Yeah you can shoot while moving. The boss will fall anyways without the mediocre autoattacks.
---
&gt; Also, hunters dont improve as much as other classes with vanilla progression. They are STILL miles ahead of ret pallys in naxx parses. 
---
I like how you completely ignore above statements. Parses use wrong gear. Apply with correct gear and we talk. Also there is video evidence of someone doing 1600 dps. You just scoff it off. No Hunter does 1600 dps. Not even close. Not with all buffs or the best circumstances.
---
&gt; **Did guilds sell raid carries back in Vanilla?** 
---
&gt; Any obstacles in Classic that might keep them from doing it? 
---
No. Do you think they shouldn't be?
---
Exactly this, it's not about first 60, with layering its first to black lotus. 4 layers 4x the resources and I can get there in less than 3 days played. Remember you don't need to be 60.
---
:thonking:
---
Because it just sounds like he's bragging. Someone that acts like that couldn't handle running a top tier guild.
---
I'd guess Paris on this on lol
---
Pretty sure I'm already addicted.
---
Naw don't even play BFA. Don't give blizzard money for that complete disaster of an xpansion
---
The speed doesn't bother me, I've leveled two separate OSRS accounts while in Deadman mode (15x leveling speed) and the slow down has never effected me. I feel more accomplished leveling slower tbh.
---
I still play but there is a lot about retail to not like. The social dynamics of the game have evaporated through the convenience automation factors. The initial allure of the game for me was the world elements and trying to gain a reputation on my server as the bad guy people would go "ugh, not again" when they saw me. When you add in dungeon finder, flying mounts, class boosts, phasing, server sharding, and many of the other changes they have implemented you never see the same people in the game. 
---
Lore wise the WoD alternative time line stuff was a sour point too. Hell, theres a lot of other issues too. WoW is still a quality game but it does not have the same appeal and charm it once did.
---
Oh my word. If modern WoW looked like this... Like Dark Souls combined with WoW...
---
... I need a minute, brb.
---
What this even supposed to mean?
---
Spend money on vendor whites to simulate buying ammo.
---
Especially when we have so much more computing resources. I dream of a fantasy MMO with size of a small planet, without teleports, with advanced AI where world lives its own lifes, so I could spend literal months exploring that world and meeting new people. This game will conquer the world.
---
I have absolutely no idea what it entails or who to thank for it.
---
I do know it means that someone(s) thought your post was bloody awesome.
---
Smh to this day there still isn't a helmet that looks like that, huh?
---
Oh right I forgot the conspiracy theorists think it’s going to last until AQ
---
The entire paradigm of playing a class vs playing a spec shifted between the two, so it depends on what spec in retail you enjoy. For instance, playing a demonology warlock in retail won’t translate much at all, but if you prefer affliction, warlock will feel much the same in vanilla in most respects. In general, it feels very different playing retail vs classic, as retail gameplay has had 15 years of refinement. So if you’re looking for something that will feel exactly the same, it probably doesn’t totally exist.
---
Well everyone has the transmog mounts anyway so it's not that bad
---
Always a time marked tradition for the alliance. 
---
God speed good sir. Just don't get dumpsters by castered as reck bomb!
---
Autophagy breh, you can kill fat cells through fasting, but that's about the only way
---
Well, I have to take time off or I lose it. Also there is a star *incredibly* close to the planet and it cooks the exposed surface for like 12-13 hours a day this time of year. I *need* to be inside to survive that environmental hazard.
---
Hi dad.
---
The mount system we're using in Classic is pre1.12, why is that?
---
Watch him play! His gameplay is super clean
---
The sub-servers or 'layers' share the same chat channels and stuff like the auction house, same with in-game mail. You can also group up with people from different sub-servers, which transfers all group members to the same sub-server. So there is travel in-between sub-servers as well.
---
Fuck off m8 do w/e you want
---
Who we are: American Married Couple
---
Experience: played WoW for 14 years, Vanilla cleared through Twin Emps and Spider Wing  (both full Tier 2, AQ/Naxx geared), served as class leaders for vanilla on Moonrunner server
---
Work: In China as Acting/Theatre Teachers
---
Classes: Holy Priest and Mage (willing to play others if needed)
---
Seeking: An English speaking EU guild that raids beginning around 20:00 UK time, PVE or PVP is fine
---
We are fun, mature, and dependable. We are in our early 40s.
---
Hitboxes are hugely increased while moving
---
&gt; But the dynamic respawns back then were on a different scale.
---
The amount of people questing around you was on a different scale.
---
Tbc items especially plate was great. This shit looked so funky and strange. I still got a 63 warrior just for the nostalgia
---
Doesn’t take a rocket surgeon to figure this one out
---
"Parses use wrong gear"
---
What the fuck are you saying? Parses include everyone who submitted parses. which were all the top guilds at the time. You have no idea what you're saying. 
---
I guarantee you never played vanilla and are one of these private server kids essentially pretending you actually played. Also priv servers all have different settings and different ways of trying to recreate the "vanilla" experience. Some are closer than others. Parses from there may not be accurate at all. 
---
I never said hunters beat mages or rogues or warrs. stop building strawmen because you realized you misspoke and are wrong. It is transparent. Hunters were better and will be better than ret pallys by a significant margin in classic. Sorry if this crushes your ret dreams. You will be dead weight. And you will actively be hurting your raid if you are taking gear from mages or whatever the fuck else you need to steal to make your shitty ret spec function in a raid environment.
---
Should note that ZG is a 20 man raid as well.
---
Adderal, trail mix, and a fresh tube sock. That'll get me through the first 48 hours.
---
I feel like that's going to end up being the general way people handle it in pug groups, was suprised no one else did. Tbh it wouldn't be worth a whole lot.
---
Why could it not have come out earlier in the summer tho
---
One piece of advice I got when first time I dabbled in tanking is to remember that you're the one setting the pace. Move as slow as you need to, you'll get faster in repeat runs once you know the place. 
---
In pugs try get party leader and keybind some markers. Put up a skull for your primary targets (usually casters), and moon/star etc. for any strong cc in your group. Mages are your best friend when learning the ropes.
---
Also, charging packs of trash mobs will often punish you in Classic. If it looks risky or you're not sure if there's a patrol or whatever, use your ranged weapon to pull, and use line of sight (walls/pillars/doors etc) to bring ranged mobs close where necessary. 
---
Most people will give you time to learn in my experience, and if not just accidentally forget to taunt when they overaggro.
---
inflation come to me I summon you! Going to need cheap respecs
---
It is up for debate. On private servers mages are the kings of leveling due to abusing the obscene dynamic spawn rates on fresh servers. They will be significantly slowed on live.
---
Yeah I was wrong to say "maybe" but good to know that's enough to put you at a lower comment score than the guy who says hunter is the only class that can level to 60 in 6 days.
---
I’ll be playing a Human Pally on a PvE NA realm. East coast is my time zone, and I’m specifically looking for someone who’s interested in questing and dungeoneering, preferably a tank or someone willing to tank while we level. 
---
I have aims of healing dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds. I also plan to have 2-3 Alts to level from time to time (aka, collecting that rested XP)
---
Not to bad honestly. But none of us really know how bad it will be day one.
---
true true :/
---
You sound fun at parties.
---
Nice. I still have some of these too!
---
I could have written this
---
This isn't even the best example from that guys channel you could've linked.
---
 He has an entire 1-60 questing guide specifically made for warrior where he takes the time to level cooking, herbalism, and alchemy and *still* makes it to 60 on his warrior in around 5 days played.
---
I quit in wotlk because life didn't allow me to play any more.
---
I tried coming back during cata and it just wasn't fun to me anymore. Game felt extremely lonely so I quit for a few years.
---
Decided to pick it up again during bfa and it was tolerable because I made a friend early on and we leveled together. He then rage quit the game after blizz released higher ilvl armor and made it trivially easy to get to our current ilvl. I quit shortly afterwards too.
---
Starting with 20k server cap when vanilla servers were 2.5k(?) seems like they are making more problems than they are solving. The game is 15 years old, how many tourist do you think your going to get? The average person on this sub their class picked, know they're leveling route knows their BiS at 60. Were not jumping into the unknown here, banking on 80% of the player base to leave the game by the end of phase one is crazy.
---
Does anyone really argue this?  I feel its more just people realizing its how it going to be and then either raging about it or dealing with it.
---
Hmm sure it's not the base ui with titan background? Sorry havnt seen xpearl for a while.
---
yeah there's zero chance an actual adult will fall back into playing wow for 12 hours a sitting like they may have used to. it simply isn't feasible. 
---
if you *are* the kind of adult that's still susceptible to abandoning responsibilities then wow is the last thing you should be worried about.
---
just go play BFA. It's more efficient and user friendly
---
It’s about server identity and a persistent world with shared resources and consistent communities and enemies; it’s the immersive world. With layering you won’t have to compete with other groups for world bosses, just jump a layer. World pvp can just be skirted by spamming for a later invite. The persistent world is really important to the success of Classic. This cannot be overstated.
---
There is a whole other game within the game. Investing in goods to maximize your profit per unit of storage is an art form.
---
I think we won't see any bis boe in the AH for quite a while, simply because there isn't much gold in the world early on and nobody would sell them for 10g if they could wait and get something like 200g for it a bit later. So at best we'll see them after a month or more for crazy prices that can only be paid by people who farm 24/7 is my guess, but we'll see. There will always be exceptions though (I hope), people who aren't too serious about making profit or just aren't aware.
---
The most frustrating quest for me on the stress test was Securing The Lines, because there were only like 5 Dustwind Savage spawns for some reason. On private servers there were a lot more. It's a tough quest to skip for a lot of people though, because it rewards weapons.
---
A lot of stuff you have to play by feel. I felt like I wasted too much time on the Scorpid Tail quest even though I had 1-2 spawns mostly to myself. You may need to skip Sarkoth depending on how many people are in your layer. And like always, try to be the first person on your layer to hit level 3 and immediately try to do Lazy Peons. If you're behind, skip it. There aren't enough orcs and their cool down is too long.
---
Vanquish the Betrayers on the other hand is less skippable than on Private Servers, because his chest didn't appear to have any sort of respawn delay, which makes the quest line worth a lot more exp. I'm not sure if this will get fixed before launch, or if private servers are wrong.
---
Mccaulay caulkin said he was going to play on his reddit AMA

That is the wiki article about the First War.

People dont like anything and will complain about everything, no matter what blizz does a big group of people will be unhappy.

George ”Corpsegrinder” Fisher said that he would be playing once he’s home from touring.

I feel like there are special mineral nodes in the wetlands that can help here. Near the spiders for the warrior quest

What is it with everyone using this word incorrectly

# LF NA / PVP / Casual-Social / CST
---
**Me**: \~30 Texan. Marketer/website owner/designer/developer. In a relationship (my girlfriend will be playing occasionally on her own character), full-time 9-5 job. I played during Vanilla initially, but quit to play Runescape more around lvl-40. I'm currently playing on L-Hope on the new server (\~lvl25 atm), and will be playing pretty seriously on launch.   
---
**Schedule:** I have plenty of RL obligations, so I don't want to overpromise my availability. I can commit to 1-3 nights a week, and build my schedule reliably.   
---
**Character**: Feral/Resto druid, TBD on Alliance or Horde. It's going to take me several months to hit 60.   
---
**PVP**: I'm bad, but I'm doing a lot of practice though. I enjoy support roles, and flexing to help the team (Gold support flex in Overwatch).   
---
**Dungeons/Raids**: I didn't make it to raids in WoW, but I healed dungeons as a druid and priest. I'm looking to get to end-game content eventually, but I'm not in a rush. I'll be able to heal and off-tank as needed. I'm willing to be adaptive and fill whatever role needed.   
---
**Looking For:** A friendly guild that is working towards end-game, but not at all rushing there. I'm team-oriented and get a lot of joy out of helping others. I was in a clan in Runescape that I'm still in touch with, going on nearly 20 years now. LGBT-friendly would be a plus.   
---
I don't want to join a guild that wants to be server-first in anything other than being known for being a chill group. I will commit to dedicated times around the guild's schedule.  
---
I really just want a laid back group of people who understand real-life/relationship/gameplay balance and want to have a great time playing together. I'm a professional both at work and online, and I extend that to my play. I'm an adult, and don't do drama things. I don't like arguing with people in life or online.
---
I'd like to get to know the guild, if you are playing on a p-serv it would be great to play with you there before launch. If not, I can get to know you on discord.
---
**Interests**: Cars, crypto, poker, PC builds, advertising, Overwatch, OSRS, sports betting, craft beer, fantasy football and lots of other random hobbies.
---
If you think I might be a fit I'd love to get to know you! Shoot me a PM and I'll give you my Discord. 
---
Sorry if this comes off like a dating profile. This isn't my first rodeo so I know what I'm looking for and what kinds of people I want to play with. If your guild isn't exactly what I said, that's cool too and I may be swayed.
---
I still have my hunter and warlock ones.
---
&gt;yea, yea, I'm missing Cruelty, but crits add no rage, and I do no dmg
---
Sorry what?
---
You know that the "you can tank in greens" is more like it's possible, but not that people want you to? You will slow down the groups massively so much that they'd probably rather spend 30 mins to find a proper tank than spend 4 hours in ubrs. Just because you CAN kill drakk, doesn't mean people want to wait around for ever to do it.
---
I feel ya, but PvP is player generated content in WoW, and for me personally some best memories (southshore/tauren mill, ashenvale raids, arathi mountains skirmishes, stv, mind controlling people into lava in MC, to pick a few).
---
Sure got ganked a lot too, but eventually I got to 60, and with layering it will be easier to avoid most obnoxious ganks. 
---
You can also spend lots of time in instances and level up this way, or go to less populated zones.
---
I don't gank myself, unless some group activity, but I do enjoy the thrill of it, and it adds some randomness to rather static pve world (once you know it in and out).
---
Why I like PvP servers more: running as level 20ish alliance player to SFK instance on a PvE server it's just boring lame run. But it turns into kind of "adventure" just because it's on PvP server - totally different experience.
---
A few minute CD on layer hopping has little effect if you’re farming devilsaur that already has a 20 min CD, or nazjak spawns that have 18 hour cd. You still have 7x chances at tidal charm and 7x the devilsaur floating around
---
&gt;It made sense in 2005, when people's PC's couldn't handle many players on screen. But these days when hardware allows for it
---
The fact that you think this has to do with player hardware makes you woefully unqualified to have an opinion on the matter.
---
anyone at level 58 will be running MC on their own, its pretty hard to intentionally fuck up MC unless youre just running and pulling every pack which will get you kicked
---
Its puggable, but if your pug fails you are out 3-4 hours of time.
---
Raid bosses are immune to taunt though...
---
You'll probably see Rags die the first week mate. Doesn't mean that's the average.
---
This is *really* difficult to nail:
---
* In all zones
---
* In all areas in those zones
---
* During all levels
---
* With all kill speeds
---
* At all times (first day or weeks later)
---
* With all population densities
---
* In edge cases (such as people joining or leaving. Dying etc)
---
* And all this for mobs, quest containers, resources etc. etc.
---
We have *so many* variables. From a math perspective this is a diffuclt, multivariate problem. One without a perfect solution, just one or a few *best* solutions.
---
You can optimize around early levels but things will be entirely different at late levels. You make it right in one scenario but there are infintie more scenarios just because we have like 10-20 variables to account for with a good dynamic respawn system.
---
Most implementations will try to keep it simple and make that simple bit good. But that inevitably will run into walls.
---
Obviously I'm not speaking of thousands of players but it won't be just a handful of people reaching 60 this fast. People in this sub seriously underestimate the experience and dedication some of the pserver veterans have. Even if values are different than actual Classic WoW (which they are not by such an amount to make a major difference) they know how to adapt and push the limits. 
---
Around 3 days for the insanely fast and those competing for world first, 3.5 - 4.5 days for the very experienced. Throw in some accountsharing, 3-4 hrs of sleep on average per day or drugs and you'll end up with a world first 60 by Friday.
---
Dokey
---
Well yeah, in order for this to be effective you'd have to keep the circle of people who are involved in it very small. Basically just the guild master and a handfull of goons who are doing the deed. I mean even with five people you could mess up five potential Thaddius kills and I'm sure people will only get suspicious if the same person messes up the bossfight more than once.
---
I got 6 different flavors of GFuel lined up and ready to be injected into my veins.
---
As for food, I got DoorDash, GrubHub, UberEats locked and loaded.
---
Costco 24+ rolls of TP in the linen closest ready for action.
---
Was this done in Eve Online? How so?
---
&gt; Mind blast is one of the worst mana efficiency to damage spells in the game.
---
It also does a thumping load of damage, and the rest of your spells are cheap, so it all works out.
---
&gt; Smite priest stacks spirit over int because it scales recovery speed and later on raw spell damage with the talent.
---
I thought everyone did that for Spirit Tap procs. I guess it's easy to think shadow is bad if you assume they gear badly.
---
&gt; And if you are in fights you might actually lose, shadow's survivability is not comparable to someone speccing into the holy tree.
---
Mmm. I guess that is why everyone in PvP is so afraid of those unkillable Holy priests, and nobody ever talks about those squishy shadow priests with no survivability.
---
&gt; Improved SW:P won't get much value as mobs will usually does before it is realized.
---
That is not at all how I remember it. 
---
I get the feeling you have read some people posting silly things about their memespec levelling build and they are growing in the retelling. Shadow is unquestionably the best levelling spec because it has the only +hit talent and the best +damage talents. Next is Discipline because it has good shields and mana regen, so you can wand for days. "Smite spec" is garbage because it has none of the above, just minor bonuses to crit and damage and lots of boosts to healing spells that you shouldn't be using in a fight anyway.
---
:(
---
That is my exact timeline.
---
Also it's good to see see others exited about going back to Vanilla mechanics and class design.  Sure LFR and the other QoL "improvements" weren't for the better but I constantly see those listed as the worst changes that were made.  For me it's always been the feeling that I'm no longer the character I originally played due to the loss of the talent tree.
---
What about advanced raids though? During Naxxramas progression a bunch of saboteurs could break a guild's back.
---
I hope you realize that the 1600 dps are created via the Gnomeregan hammer Manual Crowd Pummeler, which requires ridiculous amounts of farming time. In his other videos he shows consistent 1000 dps without that hammer.
---
That hammer is a bit of a cheat, but dps feral druids need it too to stay relevent in dps. I can't recall anyone used it back then.
---
You are not the only one to mention this, so I want to say it is a fair point! But in private servers you have to play around potential respawns *constantly*. Our memories are foggy but since I never had to bother around with this on my melee back then, perhaps things are different.
---
Pservers have it tuned in a way that it is problematic *even if nobody is close to you*. Both relevant ones at least.
---
The new meta is leveling cooking, at around level 30+ you start converting vendor trash into really good money. Skinning is inefficient due to bag space and time requirement.
---
Same! But opposite! I have no idea what to do
---
That’s just not the same. The game got more complex so the skill gap increased. New abilities, new things to learn.
---
Vanilla is the same. To say everyone will be better now is just ridiculous. Rotations in vanilla were very straight forward.
---
That’s like saying your better at the number 2 multiplication table after learning calculus. Your not you still know 2x2=4.
---
Wow is for casuals. That is also true for classic. Just pick up a warrior and start leveling. People are so focussed on doing things optimally for classic, that they forget what really matters. The experience of having your own character grow and improve. Just like your character will grow, you will also grow and become proficient at tanking.
---
"If a person doesn't have a sense of achievement in their real life, it's easy to lose themselves in a virtual world where they can get a false sense of accomplishment" that's classic players for you.
---
for class and speccs by role for raids:  
---
Tanks: Warriors (protection), some guilds might take 1 feral druid, but don't bank on it.  
---
Healers: Priest (disc/holy), Paladin(holy), Druid(resto), Shaman(resto)  
---
Physical DPS: Rogue (Combat), Warrior(Fury), Hunter(marksman)  
---
Caster: Mage (Fire/ArcaneFrost depending), Warlock (SM/DS/Ruin), Some guilds might take 1 shadow priest - some won't.   
---
Very nonviable combinations that prob won't get your into raids:  
---
Paladin (Retribution or Protection)  
---
Druid (Feral Tank or DPS / Balance)  
---
Priest (Shadow) &lt;-- Depending  
---
Any class in PVP specc.
---
I guess? Any raid guild thats genuinely in competition for world first is already been clearing these raids on pservers and will just take that team
---
what can rogues pick pocket thats profitable? not saying there's nothing, im just curious
---
The ideal server population is the one that the game was designed to support.
---
T2 beats T6 because Judgement feels like its own lore-encapsulating set with the balance scales and attached scrolls.
---
People do GDKP runs now on private servers.  
---
There was no achievements back in the day, so 'carries' certainly weren't sold. However a guild I raided with (one of the '23 guilds' who cleared naxx) sold pieces of loot out of Naxx to try to help fund all the consumables they were burning through trying to progress.
---
wat
---
No one playing classic is going to be able to answer that for you, since the conditions aren't the same.
---
hurrrrrrrr durrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr
---
Are those even good weapons?
---
You will be very surprised.
---
This very person this post is about will do it below 4 days. I know many that have been practicing day and night to get it between 3-4 days.
---
If you are really thinking 5-6 days after release, *think again* lol.
---
Quality content right here
---
Without layering or at least a variation of it and there will be mo community because most people will quit before they can create their character after 2 weeks of trying to log in
---
In pve or pvp?
---
PVE:
---
Warrior: Tank has so many different specs I don't even wanna go into it. And then there's duelwield fury warrior or if horde you can go 2hand fury warrior(small differences in talent choice).
---
Rogue: Combat dagger or sword, dagger kinda blows on horde. Later in the game there's options to go assassination + combat but it requires rly good gear.
---
Mage: Pre AQ you have 1 deep frost, and rest arcane frost, arcane is like a modifier spec, you still cast frostbolts.
---
Warlock: One warlock goes affliction + destruction, the others go demonology + destruction, but the spend is just spam shadowbolt. Aff can use corruption sometimes.
---
Priest: There's both holy and disc for raiding. Holy is pure healing and disc is more utility based especially if you have less gear or want to pvp outside raids. Shadowpriest is sometimes accepted, and only 1 of.
---
Paladin: Holy
---
Shaman: Resto
---
Druid: Resto
---
Hunter: Marksman + beast mastery. 
---
PVP there's like 2-4 different viable specs for almost every class. Only class that only has 1 is warrior who is just boring arms.
---
I may be wrong here, but I think that's the competitor's tabard from TBC
---
Is everyone forgetting there are server and engine limitations that may be causing the layering? Yeah we can handle the excess on our personal PCs, but will the server or engine crash if we have 3-4K players in one zone? 
---
I understand we are mostly players and not devs, but this is a common issue in the MMO world.
---
Hey there. Based on your post I think we might be a good fit for each other. I could give you the typical info dump or we can just chat. You can reach me at wildgunmen#1302 on bnet or WildGunmen#9537 on discord. 
---
Whatever you, good luck in Classic!
---
&gt;Players Seeking Gui
---
EU - Alliance - PVE - No loot council -  Hiya, me and my partner are looking to join a guild has a casual  schedule but skilled/well prepared players. Looking for something thats  focuses more on high quality raiding over quantity i.e 3 days a week  would be fine. Planning to play druid/x (warrior, priest, rogue, or  mage). Druid would like to offtank. Not a fan of loot councils due to  past experiences of officers just using them to gear themselves and  their clique. Willing to consider a loot council guild if there are  set-in-stone rules in place on how its done.
---
I  have extensive raid leading experience from TBC, WOTLK and Wrath.  Partner was a bank officer and a very successful mt for a raiding guild  for a number of years.
---
It should work as is in Classic since there is no coding involved. It works in BFA and on private servers currently, although some of the graphics drop out in BFA due to different file names in retail. I will test on Classic in the next stress test to make sure,  but I don’t foresee any issues.
---
&gt; Also, no one seems to be mentioning that Fury Warriors can talent Death Wish  
---
A warrior who doesn't want to be feared in vanilla has Death Wish as an option, definitely has Recklessness as an option, definitely has Berserker Rage as an option, and might have that mithril insignia from blacksmithing if he's really serious about not being feared.  And for ultimate immunity, also be undead!
---
Hunters, mages, priests, warlocks can all solo farm high level instances and vendor the loot at up to 50 gold per hour. Maraudon and Dire Maul Tribute and West are the most common.
---
This is where I'm leaning as well. Plus the GF wants to play Hunter and I'm set on warlock so undead or orc is our only option is unless we roll Dwarf + Gnome combo which could be pretty cool.
---
If it was, it would be full normal mode mechanics, not heroic.
---
My suggestion has been to pin the ~2000 highest level players to Layer 1. They’re not able to switch to any other layers. 
---
This solves a few issues:
---
* The most dedicated folks who race ahead and going to be in the same world together.
---
* Can’t abuse layering to farm high-level materials like Lotus.
---
I'll second Druids, because you only needed 21 points in the resto tree (for nature's swiftness) to raid heal.
---
The reason? Nearly all the rest of the resto talents were for spells rarely used while raiding, for multiple reasons, so no need to spec deeper.
---
Which leaves you with a ton of points in a dps spec. 
---
I PvPed to rank 10 using a 0/30/21 spec and healed with the same spec for my guild's raids through the beginning of Naxx.
---
People barely know bro.
---
tbh I don't understand why layers is so polarizing for some people. I'm starting to think some people are complaining for the sake of complaining. Once the game launches nobody is going to care unless Blizzard monumentally goofs it up.
---
Found the Hunter
---
They have said there wont be layering for world bosses.
---
Aggro. A very complicated, very technical, roleplaying expression. Loosely translated, it means "The Priest Dies."
---
Credit: Some comic I saw online 10-12 years ago.
---
Who cares, it’s just a transmog
---
It's only MC-level gear my friend. Massively overgeared players could easily carry 10+ pugs. We'd have bindings, they eye and some of the really good pieces on reserve like (cauterizing band) for new recruits that needed them.
---
If people didn't like our way of doing it, they were free to organize their own run.
---
People would infiltrate guilds over long periods of time, rise through the ranks. Then eventually they get enough power, steal everything they can, and ambush/destroy their stuff.
---
Been playing in Nazajtar and you're misrepresenting what is happening. 
---
To those that do not know the area, Nazajtar does have phasing, but it is not sporadic and crazy like the OP is suggesting. 
---
Phasing in this zone happens when the player is completing specific story quests that "open" the zone for you. 
---
So, for example, one of the quests you do in the zone "prepares" the camp for you. You help set up the teleporter that you'll use to go from there to The Great Seal (i'm horde). 
---
Once that quest is done, it "unlocks" the zone for you and you've completed the hub. You're essentially "building" this quest hub and they use phasing to accomplish this. 
---
So far I have not encountered any herbs disappearing or rare spawns phasing out because the phasing areas so far are specific to the hub. 
---
OP is exaggerating.
---
Your guild will be in multiple layers. Don't kid yourself.
---
Sure, you can say that. 
---
But I’ll never group up with a warrior who’s equipping staff of westfall or emberstone staff..
---
You’re reading an awful lot into the use of a very common slur. Especially among private servers. The word has a tongue in cheek feeling associated with it that an oxford dictionary definition isn’t going to convey.
---
And still manage to get lvl 45 in ashenvale, such a waste of good levelingzones 1 to 100 should be able in cata revamp zones.
---
No one will be spending money on thr first initial wave or should be spending money
---
No, it's more like your job starts at 9am but your boss expects you to be there at 7am because they wanted to to also clean the windows without telling you.
---
You just play as a dps, you just don't have a healing debuff.
---
Hate to be pessimistic but ya'll need to accept that they aren't sending out any more beta invites at this time. I'm feeling the pain as well but Classic is less than 2 months away, hang in there!
---
This isn't throwaway money for me, none ever is - I grew up on food stamps with a single mother in a gang infested neighborhood. My first job was not legal and I wasn't even 10 years old. Now I've just studied hard, worked harder, took many risks (most that failed) but some were great opportunities that now allow me to not work so much anymore. 
---
I try to only spend my time doing the things I want to do, so wherever money can be spent to save time, that's very valuable to me. My house isn't very grand, but someone cleans it every week. My clothes aren't very expensive, but someone washes them for me. I love cooking a couple nights a week, but I hate shopping, so I don't do it.
---
I'm actually waiting for the state to process my application for a license so I can teach public high school of all things, because teaching and mentoring have always been the most rewarding experience for me.
---
So yeah, I'm spending stupid money on launch week for a virtual world, but I'm not some family-money kid that doesn't appreciate it.
---
This isn’t vanilla, you can’t use a 2h in one hand in vanilla. Also tabard is TBC.
---
Dumb post
---
&gt; There is just holy and shadow for priest.  
---
There is just holy, shadow, arcane, fire, frost, nature, and phyiscal, for everyone.  If you use star shards or whatever as a night elf priest, and get kicked, that interrupts your arcane school.  If you get kicked during starfire as a druid, that interrupts your arcane school.  There's no such thing as a balance spell, discipline spell, etc, and the fact that it is confusing is that some of the specs are named after the schools.
---
Transmog is good, though. You still have to work for your transmog appearances. What are you even talking about? I shouldn't have to look like a fucking edgelord because I want to be a geared warrior.

They could do a "planned merge" of several servers. So 4 servers with non-overlapping names, then if/when the populations drop too far they merge to make healthy servers again. Either stopping at two servers, or all four eventually moving into one, depending on population levels.
---
The only downside of this that I can see would be if the devs were planning on having a ton of layers so players can do the starting quests like normal. But if there is only going to be 4 layers anyway, this would obviously be they way to go.
---
1. Yes EQ releases servers on a fairly regular basis, but you're fooling yourself if you think people aren't going to sub to Classic for a month then quit once the nostalgia wears off. There will be fairly high attrition because these servers are essentially a nostalgic trip. Sure some of us diehards (myself included) will play Classic exclusively, but a lot of people will dip their toe in Classic, see what it's about, then quit/go back to live.
---
2. I did say this was rough napkin math, I'd say focus not so much on the numbers and the actual percents. I'm willing to bet 6 months into Classic that the attrition drop will be 70%. Players today are nothing like players during vanilla. We have shorter attention spans and there are just too many good games coming out in early 2020 that will likely chip at the playerbase.
---
The world record in Vanilla was a hunter named Joana who went from 1 to 60 in 4 days and 20 hours (solo). And that was long after release when the congestion in the early zones had died down.
---
The 3.5-4.5 days number is for private servers only. Private servers have different spawn mechanics, trash HP, fewer players, etc.
---
Now you expect people to level even faster than that on highly populated servers during the Classic release surge. I'm telling you that unless Blizz got something drastically wrong, that's not going to happen.
---
I expect the world first lvl60 classic player to ding with at least 5 days of played time due to congestion. Probably more like 6 days. IRL, that'll be a week and a half... and that's for the FIRST player.
---
&gt; I think nearly all of us would be willing to deal with a messy launch ~~day~~ week experience to get rid of layering once and for all.
---
FTFY
---
I was thinking attunements might be obstacles that would lead to fewer sales. Fresh 60's can't run MC, but maybe they could throw in MC attunements into a deal. Also, I think there will be way less carries for real money, since it takes so much longer to level, gear and will include more whistleblowers. It's higher risk, each character will be more valuable.
---
It's both this community, the streamer community and the streamers fault.
---
/r/classicwow mistakes:
---
Lots of envy over them getting guaranteed beta access especially with a lot of the streamers being completely clueless about classic. 
---
A lot of envious about the whole concept of streaming who think "streaming is just playing videogames and getting money for it".
---
Most of the community consists of 30-ish year olds who see streaming as this new thing for children
---
Streamers mistake: Many cocky streamers who at least act like they consider themselves above other players 
---
Streamer community(twitch chat) mistakes:
---
Being obnoxious as fuck just in general. 
---
The whole "follow the streamer, protect the streamer in-game" kind of thing which sort of breaks how classic is supposed to be played. Lots of people on this sub is afraid of that community ruining a server they will play on because as a player you could be severely punished for doing something to a streamer without even knowing that the person is a streamer.
---
I just find it hysterical that people have so little going on they actually even do this.  How bad is your actual life that you have nothing better than this.  They literally probably day dream about this internet nobody actually talking to them from the couch in thier mother's basement.
---
Excuse me while I go back to killing 65,340,284 more boars so I am seasoned enough to challenge my nemisis.
---
Good to know, thanks! I will make and edit to remove Gore.
---
It does seem like the logical next step.
---
There are currently no Dynamic Respawns in Classic.
---
Oh I I understand now, thanks for the explanation bro
---
will /cg/ trannyposting ever stop?
---
Huh? You vendor it. You convert all the meat you loot in STV to cooking recipes. Once you get Jungle Stew you convert a 90c Tiger Meat into fucking 6s.
---
Really depends on the gear. Warriors are either horrible or amazing in PvP, with little in-between. As to weapons, again, is one much higher iLevel/DPS? Use that.   
---
Arms is a little better due to Mortal Strike, but you aren't likely going to out-heal in anything less than full purples and even then not sometimes. Fury isn't bad, a lot of rage, a lot of easily usable abilities, and some nice burst when you need it.
---
This is my warrior from vanilla, level 107 now that i just mess around on. The screenshot is not *from* vanilla
---
Because then you would get this scenario, horde fighting alliance on the border of a zone, losing side runs into next zone, they all phase out to a new phase. Thats why individual zones arent being layered. With the layerig system, that specific scenario shouldnt happen. 
---
They have now added a cooldown to changing layers, hopefully they also add something that prevents you swapping layers while in combat.
---
T6 literally belonged to the most powerful Paladin of all time. If you never did his quest line in eastern plaguelands you missed out. Tons of lore.
---
Chain lightning and fire totems im guessing
---
Countless times at varying levels. Some of the biggest heists, stolen blueprints, betrayals, etc even make trending news stories. I only logged in a few times many years ago - game didn’t feel like it was for me - but I still enjoy reading about the epic interaction between corporations (Eve’s “guilds”).
---
This is a fun read that gives the gist: https://www.gamesradar.com/8-eve-online-scandals-that-prove-its-basically-sci-fi-game-of-thrones/
---
I found it better against casters than MS but worse against other warriors than MS. I used a 2h.
---
Then again last time I PvP’d as a fury species warrior was vanilla before warrior talent revamp so I honestly have no clue.
---
Go light on booze, big on weed. Eat whatever is you like that can be eaten one handed while the other hand presses 2 and 3. Can’t go wrong with that.
---
I quit right after WotLK. I would come back with a group of friends for about a month or two when each expansion dropped. I haven’t played BfA at all, as just about everyone I used to play with wants to come back for Classic.

---
"Nobody knew +spellpower increased the power of your spells, true story!"
---
Dynamic Respawns are typically used when an area has a high number of players killing those specific mobs. 
---
The scenario of you having mobs spawn on top of you as you're trying to quest wouldn't be a major threat because you'd have, or should have, a bunch of people around you already. 
---
The problem without Dyanmic Respawns in Classic Beta that i've experienced is just not doing a quest at all because there's too many people doing it and the drop rate for the item I need is dog shit.
---
I don’t think you understood me. T2 opened up a whole different perspective on Paladin lore outside of the Knights of the Silver Hand.
---
08 olympics iirc. Also DW 2handers... this is no vanilla warrior.
---
As long as they remove the layering after a few months or so i am FINE with it. Imagine launch day in starting zones with 200 other people. You have to wait 30 minutes to complete one "kill 8 defias bandits" quest. That or maybe find a group and jump ahead and kill level 7 mobs with 5 level 3 characters. layering will actually make launch day and leveling feel vanilla like. But they better remove it later in the game otherwise world pvp will be ruined.
---
I played from vanilla launch and quit 1month into BC. Wasn't happy with the way blizzard were changing their original vision of the game. Giving alliance shamans and horde pallys was the icing on the cake to make me stop. Glad I didnt waste anymore time seeing how the current version turned out.
---
Banana-din!
---
&gt; Yes EQ releases servers on a fairly regular basis, but you're fooling yourself if you think people aren't going to sub to Classic for a month then quit once the nostalgia wears off. There will be fairly high attrition because these servers are essentially a nostalgic trip. Sure some of us diehards (myself included) will play Classic exclusively, but a lot of people will dip their toe in Classic, see what it's about, then quit/go back to live.
---
Never said they wouldn't, but EQ at least has a reason for the diehards to restart, where Classic, I assume, won't keep releasing new servers unless there are *too many* people, which is the opposite problem to have.
---
&gt; I did say this was rough napkin math, I'd say focus not so much on the numbers and the actual percents. I'm willing to bet 6 months into Classic that the attrition drop will be 70%. Players today are nothing like players during vanilla. We have shorter attention spans and there are just too many good games coming out in early 2020 that will likely chip at the playerbase.
---
That's all well and good but not the point at all. The point is the final pop count on a server after the attrition is (more or less) done with. If it's too low, they can simply merge servers. But if it's too high, then those servers are going to have broken economies.
---
LIVE TO WIN
---
Have you seen the clip from OP? He's a very fast player but not **the** fastest - still managed to be much quicker than Joana on Classic. This isn't some private server. Joana himself leveled on his own private server without any other players and hit 60 in sub 4 days. This server had the same values other players managed to get 60 in barely above 3 days with competition.
---
Having slight differences between private servers and Classic won't magically add 2 days of played time.
---
Quest rewards, dungeon gear and random drops amount to a lot in the end.
---
everyone seems to bring up competition. i realy dont know why thats a thing. back in the day we had 1-2 premade pvp groups, everyone had a honor addon installed and was given a placement. so we could comfortable play 5h a day and get one after the other to r14. there where always enough recrutes to fill in the open spot and after the last of the initial group was done the organisation was passed on to the next in line
---
talking to people in an mmo is a big part of it and makes stuff so much easier
---
2,500 for each faction online at peak times, so probably a total server population of ~7,000 players.
---
Am i too late?
---
Will spell power and crit etc stats be displayed?
---
I want there to be at least a 4000+ player cap to make the world feel alive and like an MMORPG.
---
The player cap in Vanilla WoW was dynamic. The max their hardware could handle was 3,500-4,000 players back then.
---
Shouldn't be that hard to sell carries, the problem is there is no personal loot. So its pointless to sell a carry to more than a few people, at max a 1-2 of each class. For instance you can easily 20 man onyxia (or even 5-10 man her at certain gear levels) but there is no way you could sell loot to 20+ people. Onyxia aside the other raids are not as easy to run with small groups. But you could for sure do a 30 man MC once you get some gear, and sell the "bad" tier sets to people who want em. Or you could just play the game and not make it a business...
---
Then why post a retail transmog...
---
imho... 5-6k is ideal
---
but there should be three sizes to support the community
---
3-4, 5-6, and 9-10
---
I agree. I plan on limiting my experience to 5 mans and PvP. Maybe UBRS for my dungeon chest piece, though even that is debatable. Gonna enjoy it anyway. I really doubt we will have content beyond the Naxx era, raiding or otherwise. If they move things on to BC I wont complain though. :)
---
Nobody is sayig nobody will abuse it (and if they do they are idiots) of course people will abuse something if able. As for the rest of your comment, you are doing the exact same, they say it wont affect anything and will be puppies and rainbows and all is happy, you lot say everything is doom and hellfire and the game is already doomed.. in reality it will probably end up being inbetween and will work itself out eventually, hopefully and most likely way before phase 2.
---
&gt; Fresh 60's can't run MC, but maybe they could throw in MC attunements into a deal.
---
You can run MC at 56.
---
You will not be useful but you can do it.
---
There is so much wrong here.
---
Gentlemen, get your pitch forks. OP is trying to bamboozle us.
---
Yeah I noticed the slight irony just after I posted, guess it’s all that work at the logging camp!
---
usually 2 nights a week and how long? It depends. My guild got to the point where we could clear MC and BWL in like 2-2.5 hours so we went down to 1 raid night. Most guilds do ZG on offdays or let people just pug it. BUT, then when AQ40 comes out you might go back to 2 raiding nights. Only the ultra hardcore guilds will do more than 2 nights a week. 
---
TL:DR Most guilds 2 nights a week 3 or 4 hours a night
---
Well assuming the item levels are equal, do you use 2h or 1hers when pvping? Also do you mainly stay in battle or berserk stance when pvping?
---
KEVIN SMARTS
---
You must not be very strong in the reading comprehension area because nothing he said sounded like bragging to me &amp; the only one acting like they could not handle running an MC raid is you.
---
Getting that first piece of ruthless was amazing
---
This subreddit, I swear
---
NU  UH
---
I doubt it's that bad. The client is updated and they have modern server hardware. Private servers can handle 13,000+ players on the old client.
---
The reason for layering is to make sure the servers stay alive after the first initial rush of players trying out the game.
---
Illegal Danish, very old WoW machinima
---
He was probably making fun of himself, lol.
---
people are overestimating their own abilities a lot... The field will stretch out quickly.
---
Lol what a legend
---
Thanks for clarifying
---
"and the entire community collectively exploded"
---
It really didn't. It had far and away more defenders than layering does at this point. Moreover, those defenders seemed to have won the argument, because over time more and more people became defenders of the policy. The opposite is clearly the case with layering.
---
How DARE you post something that is from BFA here?
---
Nice picture. Too bad it is not appreciated because this subreddit is full of idiots.
---
Yes.  It's truly great
---
I love this attitude.  Just because the aren't any laserz shooting out of walls during phaseshift or what not, it does not mean that raiding is easier. Or just because every boss tactic is well known.
---
Can't wait for all the guys claiming how easy raiding in classic will be, to get killed cause they pulled aggro. 
---
Threat management is its own minigame and big part of raiding, and tanks have to balance their gear between mitigation and threat.
---
I mean there are even raid encounters tailored for it (eg. taunt immune bosses).  
---
Did vanilla raids have simpler raid mechanics? Yes
---
Was raiding less intense in vanilla? No.
---
Was raiding in vanilla "easier"?  If you think organizing and getting 40 people to work together is "easier" then 20 or 25, well, you are gonna be surprised.
---
Then Enhancement is perfectly viable and fun.
---
&gt; I really thought Fury was "OK" as soon as you got dual wield and like 20 points in it to get some good talents. 
---
We can compare the talents easily to see what Fury offers. Let's assume you are not doing the `/sit` macro thing. Let us further assume you are at levels 10-30 where tactical mastery is kind of wasted as you have no berserk stance / intercept / whirlwind.
---
**Fury**
---
1. Malice (1% crit per point, super good)
---
2. Piercing Howl. Pretty great but with hamstring it is not a gamebreaker.
---
On pvp servers most go booming voices for shout aoe. Unbridled wrath is super overrated. Imp demo shout is not really beneficial until end-game PvE content. None of them are great.
---
That's kind of it. Imp BS is not too huge. And you are not getting crit often enough for Blood Craze or Enrage to matter.
---
**Arms**
---
1. Rend is super good. It is one of your best abilities pre 30. It is also game breaking in pvp with hamstring.
---
2. Parry is also enormously good. When you parry you get haste. In the warrior discord, a lot of people advocate for parry.
---
3. Improved Overpower is your best talent basically.
---
4. The synergy with deep wounds is insane.
---
5. Improved charge is comparable to unbridled wrath. But it is front up rage, which is super valuable.
---
6. Impale is also pretty great but malice is probably much better. But Imp OP + Deep Wounds + Impale are a great trifecta.
---
The differences are huge.
---
Enrage is what makes or breaks Fury. But you have to `/sit` as they swing and then be standing again (hit `/sit` again) before the swing arrives! Only then do you trigger a guaranteed crit. This used to be much easier on private servers.
---
Most experienced warriors argue that even if you keep enrage up, fury is not far better in pve but it's definitely worse in pvp.
---
Another issue is that there is basically no way around sweeping strikes. It's the coolest and most fun ability you have. You pool rage and pull a two mobs at once and just get 50% more kills in the same time period. In dungeons it is on another level. So you would have Enrage the last few levels and just as you get 5/5 Enrage you would have to respec.
---
&gt; Well, fuck. I thought that DW would help, with the points in fury
---
The misses are the problem. You say you don't like the slow swinging thing of 2H. But if you miss most your attacks that's not much better. Most warriors only contemplate DW if they happen to find a super strong main hand that is almost as good as the 2H.
---
&gt; Well, good for me I guess. About the mob levels, I can only try, don't know where the guide will take me.
---
That is where it is important to realize *that the guide was made for hunters*. That is why I say it is good but not very good for warriors. Sticking to it to a fault is not wise. It skips many zones for the sake of efficiency. It does not matter how efficient your route is if you are always on low HP or even die.
---
There are always more quests you can do. There are always more mobs you can grind.
---
And most importantly: There are *dungeons* you can do. The guide skips out on them entirely. That is such a shame for many players. They are missing out. Dungeons are a lot of fun. If you are not a practiced speed runner, *do dungeons*. They are what puts you above the NPC levels. Do some multiple times. Warriors/rogues/paladins really want gear to shine.
---
[still rocking the jinx horde patch to this day ](https://i.imgur.com/gahwilr.jpg)
---
Three main reasons:
---
1. They initially announced sharding as a way to combat overpopulation during the first week(s) during launch. Seeing as each layer is 3k people, it will be about the same (maybe a little better) than any other server in 2004/5 during actual Vanilla server launches. This means that it's only helping overpopulation relative to a server with a much higher population than Vanilla servers had (10 or 20k or whatever they can achieve). So, in a sense, it does nothing for overpopulation. But this brings me to the next point:
---
2. Vanilla servers were balanced, as a whole, around the server pop cap limits of the time. Around 3-4.5k. This helped determine number and frequency of node spawns for Black Lotus and Thorium (maybe others?) as well as World Bosses. If their idea of combating overpopulation is making a 20k server several layers of 3k, then yes, that would technically be combating that overpopulation, but, again, it would be no different from Vanilla server launches. It also makes the final pop counts potentially much higher than servers were balanced for, and would require other 'fixes' that we've seen Pservers implement, such as dynamic spawns for mobs/resource nodes, and world boss buffs, that kind of thing. 
---
3. With layering, it is potentially possible to exploit the aforementioned resource nods / mob spawns. This could lead to one (or a few) main guilds getting way more than you could on a Vanilla server, and completely throw the economy out of whack.
---
There he goes, one of god's own prototypes. A high powered mutant never intended for mass production. Too weird to live and too rare to die.
---
I would much rather have the quests fixed to have faster spawns and spawn items on the ground be clickable by everyone. Multi-tagging mobs Ect. Layering
---
it's always going to be too soon. He was one of my favorites. =[
---
Okay there comrade, no need to get smarmy because you can't comprehend a sentence in it's context.
---
WoW can be your girlfriend

It wasn't even full normal mode mechanics.

NO. JALLIS IN END OF AUGUST

dude, take a fucking break and cook every few days. you don't need to play 16 hours a day for 2 weeks. You can play 14 hours a day and have 2 whole hours to jack off shower and cook some real food

---
Here's a video of an old shut down private server with 10k+ players online.
---
Even if you fail you will probably get some kills assuming people can stay grouped together. And hopefully the idiots in the pug will be noticed and ignored next time and people get some better gear and some more experience and each week it's easier and easier and easier.  The servers culture is a big part of it but as long as someone decent is consistently running the pug then that person will find the good players, figure out the server bads, and herd their group of cats through the Molten Tube.
---
Legit if you're asking what stances you use pvp you really don't have to worry about the spec.
---
The reason why bloodelf is so popualr is because of racials. Up till legion they had an aoe silence which was great in pvp and pve and now in legion they changed it to an aoe purge to make it weaker but at the same time put a lot of mobs in dungeons and raids with purgeable buffs making them mechanics you could trivialize with bloodelfs. I dobt know about the recent raids but in uldir zul had some mobs that i dont even temember what they did but they had 0 health but had a shield, bloodelfs could aoe kill them instantly with their racial
---
I'd use a DW with Fury due to DW Specialization, Unbridled Wrath (higher proc), and Flurry (higher proc). As to which stance? If you're getting hit Battle, if you're doing the hitting then Berserker.
---
Undead and Orc are going to be pretty close, but Human will be the most popular on the Alliance by far.
---
I agree with most of what you said but when you complain about m+ and then say you don’t know where any of the dungeons are since you don’t have to walk there tells me you haven’t really done any m+.
---
And how would they determine who moves to which stand alone server? It's going to be pretty common to have multiple people guild up, or add to friends list, etc. then be on different layers at different points. Do they organize everyone into roughly 3 equal groups at random? Do they prioritize guilded people? What about the people who became friends and will no longer be on the same server?
---
I mean, Arcane Torrent used to be REALLY good, now it is good. Same reason people pick undead in vanilla, one of the best racials in the game.
---
I doubt it, private servers are perfectly capable of hosting way more than that without either lag or crashes, and Blizzard should have more resources and knowhow than them. But then again I don't know the technical side to it, so maybe there's something to it.
---
Thank you
---
Quit for a long while after a little time in Cata...didnt ever pick up Panda or WoD, tried Legion out a little and BfA was trash after a month or two of it. Played a ton of private servers, very excited for the real deal!
---
I still don't know that
---
Judgement set looked better
---
They could also make "twin-servers" where they can't overlap names with each other from the start. Then when/if the populations drop far enough a merge happens and it's back up to full pop again. Presto!
---
DON'T THINK SO. ALL JALLIS NEED IS BIG AX AND MUSCLES TO SWING IT. HONOR COMES AFTER SWING.
---
I'll be doing a 7 day water fast. Only need water, electrolytes and an occasional trip to pee.

Do you know if it's possible to make one button toggle between Pet Stay and Pet Follow? I mean without any modifiers. I've been curious if there's a way I could switch between the two with one key, or if there's no other way than two separate binds (or modifiers).
---
There is a pride month?
---
That's the dilemma: some feel having to compete for spawns is unacceptable, others that seeing a mere handful players in capital cities is depressing. The world itself can easily accomodate several thousand players, beyond the launch where everyone is gathered at the same place - so it's really a matter of preferrence.
---
So it goes from 11:59pm, to 12am to 00:01 am?

I like your thinking on the profession button macro. It reminds me of how I set mine up back in the day. The one difference is I'd set them up as [button:2] modifiers in combat ability tooltips, so they didn't even need their own action bar spot.
---
Eh, one group can do it in 30 minutes before raid and have people rotate in if you think it'll be a hard boss. I agree with your overall mindset towards this though, I just wanted to add specifically that DM:Tribute buffs are only a few minutes of effort for 35/40 people. Or even 39/40 if you have a beast-ass hunter that solo's it for everyone like we did for one week once.
---
In general though, people are really overestimating the amount of micromanaging of players that will go on in 95% of guilds. As long as no one is trolling and you have the right gear, classic's PvE is super relaxed and easy if you aren't speedrunning.
---
I still have my original priest pin in my office at work god I’m glad someone else loves these as much as me.
---
If you’re going for speed just take skinning. Anything else will take you a lot of time to keep leveled up and you will probably have to back track.
---
I found a patchwerk kill https://legacyplayers.com/Raids/Viewer/Default.aspx?id=36136&amp;exp=0&amp;upl=57896
---
The kill takes 2min16 seconds, that's 136 seconds.
---
The average amount of windfury proc for each class(that doesn't miss):
---
Warrior: 20.28 hits
---
Rogue: 20.25 hits, kinda crazy how close that is huh?
---
That means you have roughly 0.15 windfury procs per second. That means windfury adds (94.5/14)**base attack speed damage to your procs, then you times it with 0.15 for the amount of procs per second to get the damage increase and then we have to account for crit
---
The base attack speed obviously depends on your weapon, but most good onehanders are 2.8 or 2.7, so say 2.65. 
---
94.5/14*2.65 =17.88 damage added per windfury proc. Times with the procs per second this is 17.88*0.15 = 2.68 dps
---
Be kind and give it 40% crit with no crit damage modifer, that's 2.68*1.4= 3.752 dps added.
---
That's.. just as low as you got it. Quite mysterious indeed.
---
Shut up, lawbringer looks awesome!
---
Do 16 year olds play WoW? What’s the demographic nowadays.
---
I thought we got bonus or penalty based on level compared to quest level?
---
I too am an old fart now...
---
* without addons, you had to add up your spell power yourself. There was a really neat one that showed how much your abilities did (avg) on the icon on your bar, and others that gave you a more detailed stat-sheet
---
* crit you can get from the tooltip of your "Attack" ability in your spellbook. I don't remember if this actually included all your "+1% crit" bonuses from gear/talents. 
---
* and i'm pretty sure spells you had to add up yourself
---
&gt; The scenario of you having mobs spawn on top of you as you're trying to quest wouldn't be a major threat because you'd have, or should have, a bunch of people around you already. 
---
I have played thousands of hours on private servers and it has been a big issue on launches the past 2 years on both relevant private servers.
---
&gt; The problem without Dyanmic Respawns in Classic Beta that i've experienced is just not doing a quest at all because there's too many people doing it and the drop rate for the item I need is dog shit.
---
I think that is because you are biased with your 20k pop servers. Yes, the dying part is much rarer but it has other issues such as literally instantaneous respawns or seeing 10+ herbs on your mini map at the same time.
---
And there is always two weeks later on those servers. Suddenly you might find yourself alone at Fizzle in Durotar but the respawns can still screw you over.
---
On the big pserver it was often very difficult to penetrate caves.
---
because people didnt spam shit in vanilla
---
really quick counter example. Level 14 frostbolt has about 1/1 man/damage ratio. Lvl 14 arcane explosion has about 2/1. Hit 2 mobs you are even. Hit 3 and you are winning
---
It is too late for me, son.
---
I quit cause BC ruined all the hard work everyone put into raiding...and now I'm coming back for round 2
---
Other way around. BFA is a zombie grind. It's boring and unpleasant.

Playing classic after BFA will make you love it even more.
---
I had a warlock one that I had totally forgotten about until I saw this post... strange, I wonder what happened to it.
---
Retail bad 
---
Classic good
---

---
Depends on the tier really. Early game for dps at least warriors and rogues are completely shit useless you basically have to make a guild in order to get a raid spot. Hunter warlock is really great all around. I think mage is really sick though with arcane but it can be a bit hard to find a guild.
---
That record is from a private server. And we're not talking about small differences. We're talking about major discrepancies in quest XP and spawn rates.
---
Yes, that can make all of the difference.
---
That's pretty much my experience too. Fury is less vulnerable to being rage starved, has Death Wish, and feels more consistent versus casters (most notably Priests and Warlocks) - but lacking Sweeping Strikes and MS is a big downside in most other PVP settings.
---
There's multiple variables but the main one occurs when AV is released.  
---
Before AV the best premade usually communicates with its members and determines what Bracket 1 is going to be, it has to be high enough that your competition can never really catch you but not so high that you play constantly. The people who are the best at this stuff don't want to play 12+ hours a day, they want to play as little as is possible, so the idea is you pick a reasonable target, say 550k honor and you farm that hard and then stack the bracket so everyone maximises RP gain.  
---
After AV, that all hits the fan because suddenly solo players and other worse groups can compete and they don't give a single fuck about bracket stacking. The result is a burst in the required honor for the top spots and even though the percentages around those brackets haven't changed the availability has.  
---
The end result is the competition (especially after AV) just far out strips the extra leeway bigger brackets gives you. Also, even before AV this is a variable to a lesser degree. If you have 10 premades all fighting for bracket 1, the point where you stack it gets higher and higher to make it "safe." If you have 1 premade fighting for bracket 1, you can more or less just stop after 4/5 days every week because nobody will catch you.

Phasing is still cancer,  it was used as a solution to closing servers due to dead population and then it was turned into a huge money saver.  Why invest the big bucks in proper servers when you can hire microservers for a fraction of the price at the players expense?

In general terms, every time someone vendors an item they increase the gold count on the server. If they vendor something that couldve been sold om the AH, they decrease supply of that item in relation to the time that has passed since the system was started. Supply will increase with every item looted and posted on the auction house, whereas  it will be decreased by actions that consume the item for good. Actions like these are vendoring, using the item for enchants, equipping a BoE item and so on. Prices depend on supply, demand and on the current amount of gold in the system. The longer people can farm gold, the more inflation will happen with prices too. Mechanics which decrease or work against inflation include all those actions which force a player to buy from an npc. Repairing gear, buying mounts and arrows or special profession blueprints would belong to this category of actions which "delete" gold.
---
Yes, I think a majority of the high end guilds were as good as they could have been. Maybe in casual type atmosphere people didn’t know what they were doing. There was only a limited set of gear and limited rotation. You can’t change a 5 button rotation much and you can see that because 15 years later - every single rotation is exactly the same as what was done in vanilla. 
---
Saying the average raider is going to be better now is a hard thing to judge. Tell me how a frost mage who was optimized in 2005 will somehow click frostbolt more efficiently in 2019. It comes down to the player. If rotations are exactly the same what else is there to judge this on? Moving out of mechanics, correct? If you’ve raided in wow at all you know there are some players that will just always get hit by mechanics. So if rotation is the same, gear is the same- sounds like the skill of people will be exactly the same.
---
Have you even looked around and tried the different specs or are you basing everything off of your impeccable memory of vanilla wow from over a decade ago?
---
You’re salty kid, you’re also losing this argument on every single comment lmao.
---
I'm afraid you could be right about the company. Other than I think their calculation is way off. Some will learn to live with it certainly, but a whole hell of a lot more won't and will just give up on classic altogether without ever resubbing, or within a few months after seeing what the exploitation does to the gameplay and community.
---
I noticed from WotLK on they seemed to have a short term profit bend to their decision making. Which, in this case is the "risk averse" mentality trickling in from the parent company. Layering is just short term thinking, if they fall into the pattern of going after the short term profits again, they'll ignore the much larger potential profits that would come from catering to the somewhat smaller population of true fans over many years.
---
The fact is there are changes and this is a new game attempting to recreate the vanilla version. It is still a new version of an old game.
---
Quests on private servers (the good Vanilla ones) are giving identical XP as on the beta, same with mob XP. It's a simple formula. This run above was done on the beta btw, if he kept the same pace he'd be looking at just over 3.5 days /played to 60 - and that's without him making his route more efficient between now and launch. Joana's run will be beaten by Joana himself, but he will not be World 1st 60. He doesn't have the mechanics for it - just look at the way he plays on stream to Ahmp; it's a world of difference.
---
I won't be disappointed because I know that it won't be nearly as bad as everyone seems to make it out to be. I know there will be some exploitation. But if there are 5+ layers, there'll be A LOT of people who are hitting 60 around the same time and competing for those resources. 
---
I don't like layering, but I think it is a good temporary solution to the biggest problem facing long term health of servers. I also hope that they continue to tweak layering, like the cooldown they added to make sure it is less exploitable.
---
Everytime I read about how impossible warlocks are on alliance side I have to chuckle...
---
Yes, there are certain racials which allow horde players to resist or break out of your fear...but compare the amount of cc breakers to that of retail. Its laughable really. You will still have a great time fearing people.
---
&gt; Joana himself said he will get it down at less than 5 days /played LOL.
---
The previous record was *already* less than 5 days.
---
Huhuron and twin emps will most likely be the first wall a casual guild hits, maybe a couple wipes here and there to bosses in bwl but i dont really see tons of guilds struggling before that point.
---
I'd say like 10,000 concurrent max which is roughly 3x what it was. That means more competition, more wpvp, and s more epic experience.
---
or the one informed hardcore pvper who don't give a fuck about the rules, and/or no group has formed officially and would raise the bar of setting 800, 900, 1mil points on the bracket, ruining all the other R12/13 folks. 
---
This will happen for the first 2-4 weeks once honor points are in. Cause we won't know who's who and who's all going for the elusive R14. 5 hours aint gonna do it if someone sets the tone of 8-12 or more hours, and there will be those kind of players.
---
&gt; So for the first month of the game, players will have access to more reagents than normal.
---
And if the server pop is higher than 4k after layering is removed, that server will not have a functioning economy due to the lack of, not over abundance of, the rare materials. 
---
&gt; he main thing layering will likely do is lower the price of what items are worth and that isn't a bad thing at all.
---
Or higher, depending on who gets them. If one group has them all the price will be whatever they want it to be. 
---
&gt; Yeah it's the "authentic classic experience" but this isn't 2004. Most of us don't have the time we used to and it's okay if some things are different
---
And what about the people who do have the time? Not saying it should be 100% exactly the same, but the server balance built around the limited high tier resources is going to be fucked during layering, and potentially after it depending on server pops. 
---
&gt; Make several servers with smaller populations and no guarantee that people will perfectly spread out across each realm so that there isn't realm instability. The chances of this are slim to none. Remember Goon Squad on Mal'Ganis? Yeah.
---
They could just merge the low pop servers, and there are people that prefer low pop servers.
---
&gt; Make one giant server with several layers and let the client decide when to shuffle people around to keep things balanced. This should result in a more stable experience for everybody without server crashes preventing you from playing entirely. You also get the added bonus of having a healthier long term population.
---
This will not be balanced if the server pops are higher. It will be much more broken than any lower pop server. 
---
The second option is very much the worse option, depending on final (post layering) server pop caps.
---
Classic beta is showing dungeon grinding as the fastest for a few reasons.  
---
Most of the players did a bunch of quests at 30 to get gold, so when the cap moved to 40 they didn't have viable quests to do.  
---
They were all geared with BiS and could fly through dungeons.  
---
They couldn't be ganked in dungeons.  
---
They didn't have to compete for quest mobs.  
---
Dungeon spamming will not be a viable way to level quickly on a fresh server.

Why does Electro look like Nicolas Cage?
---
Exactly.  Only difference was I raided to the end of WOTLK and Cata lost me somewhere before the end.
---
I think the LFR implementation.  I wasn't raiding in Cata I had gone quite casual.  Then LFR came out and I was like hm interesting casual players can peak at raids.  Then it was a terrible watereddown nonsocial mess where I didn't even really know why the fuck we were there or what we were doing besides easily defeating what looked like epic fights with no need to know the mechanics... Yeah that garbage was the nail in the coffin.
---
If you look at how buggy/broken the game is right now, and the level cap is still 40, I want them to have another month and 3 weeks to figure it all out.
---
This was definitely a consideration...of course it would be that's part of the UX.
---
But you never know what layer your in until you actually get there sooooooo yes. You will very rarely be in the same layer. Might as well just have one giant mega server.
---
World firsts will be a thing. And some salty moron can’t change that. Feel the downvotes you pathetic dunce.
---
It’s honestly easy as fuck
---
Got one to 40 in 4 days played not even trying
---
I’m really just hoping private servers are easier than clasic
---
Yes, yes you should. Even as a druid, I am leveling first aid. Never know when you're out of mana and need to bandage during a bossfight.
---
"Why not have Blizzard do more work?"
---
Why should they?
---
not very rarely we will all be on the same layer one the invites happen 
---
it will only be on log in that we will have different layers lol
---
Blast extended stress test I grabbed a group of of level 1s &amp; 2s and just went into Elwynn Forest. I played like that 2 to 3 hours and leveled that way.
---
Yup. I think #1 spot on my server horde side was about 1.1 mil a week. Also will be interesting to see how the handle afk’s in bgs
---
It's likely that OCE won't be getting servers.
---
But it's also likely that US West won't be getting more than 1 PVP, 1 PVE, and 1 RP server.
---
I think MS would really be *better* to have over instant corruption unless grinding BGs.
---
Over 9000
---
a bunch of squeaking and text 
---
that was painful
---
Catering to a wider audience = more money.
---
So Vanilla that the guild image was never seen in vanilla.
---
Hey, check PM's, I think our guild might be a fit for you.
---
aye
---
I think the main difference is information was so obscure then that to be “optimal” was a result of reading forums and discussing with your guildies and fellow players of that class. Theorycrafting was done via spreadsheets people modeled through extensive testing and was ever changing. Nowadays you just look up a short guide and practice a bit and you know most of all there is to know about how to optimize your toon. It was much easier to tell the difference between someone who did a lot of research and someone who just winged it. There was much more work involved in learning your class so I understand why people resort to the “everyone was shit” excuse but the reality is a lot of people were shit but at the top end those players and guilds knew exactly what they were doing.
---
The @ symbol replaced "target=".  Macros used to work like:
---
    /use [target=&lt;some unit&gt;] spell
---
It condenses that to:
---
   /use [@&lt;unit&gt;]

It's really just a space saver.

A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before reset, thus the name. :) I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not casual either.

---
Yeah, ideally layering will be gone before phase 2, as blizz have said its unacceptable to be still up for the world bosses, should only ever be 1 per server at a time
---
What wider audience?  Do you really think there are enough people that care enough about layers that they are not going to play because of it?
---
I don’t believe it....you solved it!!
---
Wait...wait...no you didn’t. This isn’t a new idea. It’s been posted dozens of times before, and this is one of numerous layering posts today. 
---
Enjoy your downvote.
---
I see what you are saying by catering to people"s interests. Blizzard, however, has not really imposed that type of non-uniformity in its servers though.
---
But when I played you couldn't use target= for ground targeting spells like rogue distract. It appears this changed (I don't play retail). I was hoping to find out if you could do this in classic.
---
After reading the forums it seems like only @player works, which casts these spells at your feet.
---
Oh I was just curious, not judging!!  Personally, I'd like it to be the same long hard grind. It built strong guilds and fostered competition. Regardless, enjoy it!

Not only are they just assholes, but they're usually just ignorant and oblivious as all hell. Like they don't realize they are dying because the healer didn't have mana, there was a higher priority that also needed healing, they were standing in fire, they weren't using bandages, (and the most likely reason of all).... spite
---
If you have a target which'll be different every time, I would do [@focus], so you focus your tank at the beginning of the raid and it's set for it all, I'm not familiar with targetting by role into a macro tho :/ I use mostly @cursor for a one-press use of aoe's

yeah only the 7th guy to suggest this today....

When the next expansion drops I’ll do the world first in that expansion.

It's suddenly so important that you have just enough time to squeeze in this post in your busy work day, but not enough time to search and read one of the hundred posts about it?
---
It's been confirmed we are getting servers. Please don't spread false information without doing research.
---
Seriously? The post right below this is about layering. And there have been dozens of others today.
---
Pro tip: don’t post on Reddit if you’ve done zero research of your own.
---
Lol like anyone gives a shit about a downvote.
---
What's the argument against it then? I sort by hot, been here forever and I've never seen this. There must be a good reason why this is isn't a solution.
---
Sadly if they already think the population is a concern, they wouldn't split every server in two, that would just cause more problems...
---
Not a problem, that’s what it is
---
I mean to be fair BFA content is gross. Most of us here don't even want to be reminded that retail is a thing.
---
I thought they removed @focus for classic
---
I can’t wait until this post gets removed like all of the others.
---
The issue is tanks are usually the lead of any group they're in.
---
a tank has to know the fight better than most people.
---
tanks in vanilla spend alot of time preparing to tank so if you're prepared for the leg work go for it.
---
&gt; That's a fraction of a drop in the bucket compared to 11-60 for warriors.
---
It's worth it though, you scale so much harder. Also, just ger a healer/partner.
---
Bing
---
One of the original devs has said that the world was meant for 3-3.5k people.
---
That means mob respawns, resource nodes, etc. Anything over 3000 people feels like an MMO already.
---
It will be though.
---
in 2004 you didnt have thousands of experienced tanks as competition
---
BFA is okay. What don’t you like about it?
---
Layering is a whole copy of a continent, mobs, resources, everything. Players across Layers share chat and auction houses. When you group with another player that isn't in your Layer, one of you gets "phased" into that Layer. 
---
Sometimes you might be solo and get phased. This is because Layering is meant to prevent overpopulation of a continent at launch while still guaranteeing a full server after the population dips.
---
True, I think hunters have it worst pre-10.  After that, yeah it goes to warriors no question lmao
---

Yeah, that's why he stopped at 40. I'm talking about the run OP posted.
---
It's like a constant reminder that somebody ruined your classic car. Somehow the company was sold and they got to change all of the cars. They added some stupid ass bright colored spoilers and tacky racing stripes. 
---
Then somebody keeps coming by and reminding you of the thing you absolutely hate, that replaced the thing you love.
---
That's why we get more upset than we should. It hits us right in the gut every time.
---
This is a thing in Korean wow I think.
---
You might be underestimating the sheer amount of farming done just for vendor trash that’s been popularized. Not exactly unheard of back in the day, but there are many more resources pointing people that direction for reliable income than there was back in the day.
---
All you did was steal music and take pictures of a classic wow thread. :s
---
And 10 minutes thinking up insults? Also, I posted this like a half hour ago and I still can't think of and no one's given me a single reason this isn't better than any other option.
---
shit?
---
This is what I want to see.
---
It’s just a game, but you’re allowed to see it that way!
---
From what I have gathered:
---
1. SM/Ruin spec. Which is affliction to Shadow Mastery and Destro to Ruin.
---
2. PvE: Shadow Bolt. Repeat until mob is dead. Maintain your assigned curse.
---
PvP: Completely depends on your spec and what you are fighting against. Different curses and demons for each matchup.
---
3. Pretty easy to play with a very high skill ceiling. Like you will have one of the easiest times of any class while leveling. And will be somewhat effective without much gear. But knowing each matchup and properly utilizing your skills in PVP takes a lot of time to master.
---
I think someone’s mother told them that they weren’t going to get $15 a month for a video game so now he’s salty the free-to-play servers are shutting down.
---
Damn. I may not even worry about mining then and just go skinning/tailor! Need the bag space to grind mobs ;)
---
Katana farming? Like the sword? I’ll gladly take one if they are giving them out for good posts! :)
---
Then you only make a very small number non-layered and however many they were going to make layered anyway.
---
If there was one thing in life I want.  One piece of knowledge I crave to become public....
---
It would be the true amount of players who not only dislike the feature, but wont be joining because of it.  I think there is a huge underestimation of how many 30+ year olds out there were already on the fence due to having time constraints... but all Blizzard did was give them a slight push in the other direction to just hop off the hype train altogether. 
---
I can only speak from my personal experience where I had most of my old guild spamming me the day they announced classic, then spamming me late last year about the demo.  Now people are just done.  No one cares, and the people who I think might still play, still have negative things to say about classic in general thanks to layering, loot trading and other misc tweaks here and there.  
---
This whole project was so simple and they decided to put their own spin on it.  Well, hope they get the new generation on board, because they sure screwed the pooch with many of the original players.
---
The only @ conditional that works for ground targetted AOE is @player and @cursor  
---
This will cast Blizzard directly on the player himself
---
/cast [@player] Blizzard  
---
This will cast Blizzard directly on the cursor
---
/cast [@cursor] Blizzard
---
Each will not require you to place the Blizzard spell as you've already done that in the macro.
---
It's not a different server though.  All of those resources being harvested from all of those decohesed are still being funneled into the same coherent AH.
---
That's where you're wrong, kiddo.
---
I have always sold larger stacks for much more people will always pay more to not have to click 100 times.
---
Thats not a bad idea at all.
---
That's a pretty good Hunter weapon there.
---
If more people than anticipated are drawn to the non-layered ones they can always add more.
---
There is a need to allow layer hopping. If Blizzard allow layers to form and merge dynamically it means they can always keep each layer at close to a healthy population. If they lock people to layers and only allow layers to be merged once then they need to wait until two layers have less than half of a healthy population before they can do anything.
---
there are more consumes than just flasks, if you think you don't need gold to raid then idk what to tell you, join a 4fun guild and enjoy  spending 6 hours a week in MC; nothing wrong with that but if you're expecting gear it's another story.
---
People will be buying gold regardless.
---
It is just a game. Cars are just cars. Food is just food. People take both of those things seriously as well.  This is also just a post of something from BFA on a classic subreddit. I'm allowed to dislike it. 
---
Did I msg a mod and tell him to ban him? No. I just gave it a dislike and made a comment.
---
Why do morons like you keep pretending like it is only here for 1-2 weeks?
---
If people DO NOT LEAVE, then layering cannot be removed.  In order for layers to be removed, then the majority of the population of the game needs to stop playing...  so either layering stays forever (I am sure they can work around world bosses despite what they say) or the game is dying.  
---
Man, I don't care if you like it, can tolerate it, or simply don't hate it enough to not play, but are you that dense as to not understand why so many people are against it?
---
For the Horde happy pride, brother.
---
If it was only for 1-2 weeks, then Blizzard would have made an official announcement long ago.  
---
This is a PR game right now, and the game is silence.  If they had something positive to say, they would have said it over a month ago (if not the moment layering was announced).
---
I'm going mage as well. Never mained one. I was leaning skinning/mining, but now I'm thinking skinning/tailor. Making my own bags/gear will be a nice little bonus. Then maybe have a bank alt that is enchanting so I can DE things. Not sure what to do yet!! So many options lol.
---
I look like a Banana!
---
Engineering seems to be high priority profession for a lot of peeps
---
I understand that they won’t do that. I reckon costly to keep many servers up with maintenance for a pure fan service with a small profit. People seem to forget that this is not a main project. It is not their main focus.
---
Blizzard is a company, not a charity.
---
People vanishing to avoid PVP happened in Vanilla as well thanks to battleground queues. 
---
I don't think Blizzard is going to halt layering because you want to single out someone and grief them, as fun as that can be. You'll still be able to do that once layering is gone.
---
whats your point?
---
or are you just angry at the world
---
Look at this guys post and comment history lmao 
---
Just a whiny incel hating on everything LOL
---
1. That's just pure pessimism
---
2. The problems of dead servers affect a minority of the player base. Layers are a change that affects the WHOLE player base and the drawbacks are more immediate and significant.
---
3. The problems of dead servers are easily mitigated by either a) mergers b) overpopping a bit to begin with as they did in the past c) building up strong communities
---
4. Layering cannot be guaranteed to end at any specific time. It can only end when the population reduces. So you risk world bosses with layering
---
5. Remember that most people who will play have no idea about layering. If Blizzard leaves layering in, the majority of players who come back to play and don't know about it are going to be PISSED when they find out that people have been exploiting it for advantages. Many people won't stick around.
---
6. Because of point 5, the population reduction is a self-fulfilling prophecy
---
It's much the same as retail, run into a group of mobs hit them once and run to the next group. The DPS characters are there to kill them, that's not your job. It's up to the healers to manage their mana so keep pulling to maximise speed. Kite the boss mob to the next boss to aoe them all down at once. Good luck.
---
Because??
---
That’s your opinion and you are allowed to have that
---
Integrity: the state of being whole and undivided.
---
Is the playerbase whole or divided amongst servers?

Been playing warrior throughout most of my wow career, so naturally I'm going to be a warrior again. Human warrior because meta. Will be DPS and off tank if necessary.

A little bit about me, I'm married with a dog and currently serve the united states military. My schedule is pretty set for the next 2 years with no future deployments to worry about.

4 Hours every day is way too much for any adjusted person with a balanced lifestyle

One of the things I never understood was how the region closer to the ocean (water evaporating and falling as rain) was the dry yellow fields we see. Any theories on this?

Asking whos going to play classic wow in the classic wow reddit. Come on.
---
known troll nothing to see here
---
There's an anti-layering thread everyday on here with hundreds of likes... You're not making any sense at all. If you don't have any arguments to make that's fine, no big deal.
---
there is nothing wrong his post, maybe it could have been written in a nicer manner ? anyway a lot of guilds will disband during aq40, key people will quit, officers/raid leaders will burn out. aq and naxx kill guilds and even pserver guilds with years of experience need to be very prepared because its such a time commitment to clear naxx.
---
if you are really serious about finishing all raids id advice you to join a hardcore guild because even a semi hc guild will probably disband before naxx.
---
Because it's false. You're trying to tell me that Blizzard arbitrarily removed emotes and the print function in classic? You know, things that have been in the game since vanilla and still exist today in BFA? Nah man, stop lying to yourself.
---
You are surprised that people aren't jumping at the opportunity to rehash the SAME points that have been made countless times before?
---
And in debates where the author put considerably more effort than you. Although that isn't difficult.
---
Weird how people aren't lining up to educate a person who spent 5 seconds and couldn't be bothered "thinking it through", yet somehow thinks his idea is not only unique, it's also the best.
---
I'm not the one trying to prove my "interesting thought".
---
DON'T TELL ME HOW TO LIVE MY LIFE, MOM!
---
Oh absolutely! I'm not expecting to have the server to myself, it's still gonna be ridiculous at the start, maybe even for a few weeks. But surely competing with 3000 players is better than 10000 no?
---
AFAIK, the fastest vanilla 1-60 using official exp values and mob spawn times was 4 days 20 hours, and that was done by a hunter.
---
This is a detailed post, nice job. Also cast battle shout is good advice for getting threat.
---
Yeah then Blizzard banned him for exploiting. Fucking stupid how they punish players like that.
---
If the whole city is built on a slope, like we see here and not in a valley between some ridges. Then how do you get the Canals of Stormwind?
---
It’s also not true either. I have yet to play on a 10k pop pserver without lag. It’s actually why I don’t play on them when they are that populated. It’s why I chose Nost PvE over the PvP server cause I had pretty bad lag constantly on the PvP one.
---
I ran with a CC team and we rallied that place.  Sheeps saps entangling roots we had it all.
---
No I haven't, but tbh I think it would be worse since the reason hunters fall off is because pet damage doesn't scale. I've mostly just used the MM raiding spec and MM/Surv PvP spec. BM might be good early on in an expansion but would definitely fall off due to scaling
---
Jesus man, it’s not that big of a deal. Especially because it’s gonna be temporary. It’ll be in place so you don’t spend four weeks in northshire cause you just can’t get that kobald kill you need cause a thousand other players are doing it too at the same time.
---
It makes sense as to why they want it to be there in the first place. The backlash is over exaggerated and made even worse because of streamers. If anything you people should be angry at streamers because they’re going to heavily effect the game.
---
honestly the biggest effect is smaller populations are going to have a wider monopoly on the world. Most people are going to be poor af
---
I’m done talking to someone as dumb as you man I’m sorry I can’t anymore.  I don’t need to waste my time when I’ve already been proven correct on my statements at the very top of this thread.  
---
Have fun living life being wrong
---
It's actually the thing about Classic I love and hate at the same time. Do PvE in order to get gear for PvP, do PvP in order to get gear for PvE.
---
Honestly this is the kind of post I want to see and talk about. Well I won't be able to take PTO for the launch but IF I DID this is what I would do:
---
\- Wake up at whatever time allows me to have a full 8 hours of sleep (for me this is usually 8am). Gotta be fresh to think straight AND be able to remember this magical journey back through Azeroth
---
\- Big ass breakfast every morning that way I can sit and play for as long as I can without another meal. Eggs and pre-made pancakes are key that way there is little clean up and it's less down time trying to make the meal
---
\- Snacks: "poppable" snacks with minimal grease to get on your keyboard (gross). I think your idea of beef jerky is spot on. Personally I would just have a case of the pre-made protein shakes and just slam those that way there is ZERO grease that gets on your M+K.
---
\- At around noon I'd go for a nice lift and light cardio to get the blood flowing, freshen the mind, and make sure I don't get burned out on the game (I just need an hour or so and then I crave it again). Come back, slam a man-sandwich (ham, turkey, roast beef combo with 3 pieces of bread, mayo, sriracha, and cheese), then get back to the game. 
---
\- Take a quick shower around 6-8pm (no masturbating, that wastes time) so I feel fresh for the night time dungeon runs or questing
---
\- Unless I'm in an instance or an amazing group I'll hit the sack at or around midnight and repeat (guest bed is quite literally in the same room as my computer)
---
Multidot is exactly what they *can* do in raids. Usually the main target will be heavily contested with debuffs, but all the adds are free game. Most bosses and certainly most trash has more than one target. Lucifron and Gehennas has two adds as does Golemagg. Harbinger has  four adds and Majordomo has 8. 
---
BWL is the only raid without add heavy bosses, the only adds you'll find there are on the first boss and dots are not ideal there anyways. Some guilds actually do two of the loot drakes at the same time, so then you probably can multidot a bit.
---
Skeram has two images, Sartura has his guards, bug trio are focused one at a time so with clever positioning you can keep dots rolling on all of them. Fankriss and Visc have no dotable adds and Huhuran has no adds at all. Twin Emps you can dot the bugs but in general that fight is more a tank fight for warlocks. Ouro has no dotable adds. CT has many adds but few are reliably dotable.
---
Anub has his guardians, Faerlina has a bunch of adds, Maexxna has nothing unless you dot the cocoons, don't dot the cocoons.    Razuvius has four adds but don't do damage to them, Gothik has a wealth of adds but until you get the killing pace down I wouldn't bother with them. 4H you can usually unload your dots on whatever horseman you are fighting.    
---
Noth continually spawns adds and you can multidot these very well, until your raid dps is so strong that you just nuke them down immediately. Heigan has adds which you can cheese while running through the gauntlet. Loatheb has no dotable adds.    
---
Patch is a straight up nuke fight. Grobbolous has adds but I can't remember if we dot them or not, same with Gluth. Thaddius has no adds but you can probably dot the dogs quite heavily.
---
Sapphiron is a nuke fight and KT has a lot of adds but it's not always effective to dot and in the case of the guardians they need to be kited so be careful.
---
Ya even if something has absolutely minimal grease I HATE the way my keyboard feels and looks if it's not perfectly clean. Probably the OCD kicking in but whatever.
---
How's your wife taking this Classic launch by the way? I don't think mine is going to take it too well if we're being honest.
---
Mate don’t stress. Just level at your own pace and gear up with BiS pre MC, get attuned asap, Max your profs. You’ll find a guild that fits those requirements easily. 
---
What are you rolling? If it’s a healer or tank you’re laughing
---
Irrelevant statement. Never touched EQ, likely never will.
---
Yes I am because the 3 min CD was introduced in TBC, idiot. 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Fear_Ward
---
&gt;Patch 2.3.0 (13-Nov-2007): Fear Ward is now available to all priests at level 20. Duration reduced to 3 minutes, cooldown increased to 3 minutes. (Old - only draenei and dwarves, duration of 10 minutes, cooldown of 30 seconds)
---
For PvE your rotation is shadowbolt until oom, wand. its not difficult
---
This is what cancer looks like
---
Practice your username.
---
It's been discussed.
---
Think about that for a second. Buying BFA, to grind WoW tokens to ... Save money on a sub. That kinda sounds ridiculous doesn't it?
---
Well it's a good thing I didn't specifically reply to someone who had played EQ, and instead replied directly to you, isn't it?
---
I eventually quit playing because my realm was changed from PvP to PvE and the really core group of friends that I loved to play with all transferred to different servers. I really couldn't justify transferring all of my level 70's to another server cost wise and never really found another group to play with as close as I did them so I stopped partially into WotLK
---
Illidan - 69 is much better home.
---
I don't mean for them to open a bunch of servers this way, only however many they can justify profitability wise, and perhaps with a slightly higher than normal level cap that shrinks down to normal after phase one.
---
I just personally anticipate that Classic will be much more popular than they (and you) think. Especially if handled correctly. And there's no doubt in my mind that the present implementation of layering is the wrong answer.
---
Throw in an eighth of K and I’ll join you
---
1. SM/Ruin work fine in both.
---
2. In PvE you start out by applying your curse. Then you cast shadow bolt... That's about it..  Lifetap for mana.. Oh and shadowburn at the end, or waste a ton of soulshards by using it as a dps increase. SOMETIMES as SM/ruin you will be allowed to cast corruption. In PVP you don't really have rotations, it's far too complicated
---
3. In PvE no. In PvP It is one of the high skillcap classes, but it's not like the class is hard to play either. It's pretty simple.
