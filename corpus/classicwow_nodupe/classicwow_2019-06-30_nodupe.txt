Cc means crowd control? I figure because I found it on urban dictionary.
---

---
I dont quite get the example. I take away that macros make switching between targets more efficient, so as a mage you can sheep a third party in nearly an instant.
---
It will probably make more sense when I get in game. Definately going to check out macros. These are going to be like addons or something? Not in the base game?
---
---
---
What patch was this? the grind was made much easier after the TBC patch.
---
In a way the question is moot - they're already monetizing it by demanding a subscription fee. $15 monthly is definitely not a necessity, they could run proper servers at a fraction of that price for a game this old, that has no significant future updates. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Classic is a finished product, the amount of resources they invest just to dust it off for new hardware is minimal compared to developing an entirely new game. Some people seem to think Classic is some kind of new paradigm in Blizzard's history. WOW peaked nearly 10 years ago, but it's still a massive cash cow unlike anything in the MMO world. They would've done everything the exact same way given the opportunity, the idea that they "regret" everything since WOTLK just because they're releasing Classic is beyond ridiculous.
---
correct.
---
I hever got into serious pvping in vanilla so I don't know but in PvE servers, can you rank up and unlock titles the same way as in PvP servers? Just that it might be more difficult with the lack of people pvping in the world? Or would it be easier since you're dealing with people that don't usually pvp?
---
Gonna be a priest main with tailoring and enchanting. Planning to farm dungeons for cash and enchanting patterns. So I can go and sell those. I'll also fish a bit. Since I like to get my secondary professions maxed as well I'll probably cook stuff and sell that. Occasionally check the ah for reselling.
---
Doesn't seem like it adds much. I'm going to roll enchanting on my main for the reason you stated, all other professions can easily be held by an alt such as alchemy and gathering proffs. 
---
I'll combo it with engineering once I'm more established.
---
Yeah. they are good. I  just read day of the dragon again. One thing i cant wrap my head around is the locations... it just didnt sound right in the book. But then again the book was written in the early 2000's before WoW hasnt even come out.
---
The main lore does check out, they travel to grim batol which is in khaz modan... but in WoW khaz modan is smaller because half of it became the wetlands due to corruption from grim batol which is kind of explained in the sequel.
---
On a pally? What?
---
Asmon and Esfand were talking about it yesterday.
---
Depends on what class.  Rogue trinket removes fear / charm and shadow reflector too so I orc/dwarf rogue.
---
Most people do there rank grind through Battlegrounds. Its one of the reasons why some people dislike the way Battlegrounds are set up, because there is less reward incentive to go out into the world and fight players.l
---
These are leveling zones to help with the level and content drought that hits between level 30 till about 55, and to give people more options for how to reach 60, and to make the world feel more expansive and rich.
---
I don't know about content past naxx, I'm pretty sure I'll never reach it
---
&gt; I've already done half the work
---
  
---
42 is a long way from 60, is it even near halfway? You don't have to do it all at once, an you can do it with maximum rested exp after 20-30 or so. 
---
You bring up a good point though, why not lvl it to 60? 
---
Pick a class you want to experience the 1-60 leveling with but not play at max lcvl for raiding. Have that become your bank alt, replacing the quick&amp;dirty lvl 5 you use until then.    
---
If you're levelling an at to 60 anyway, might as well get an awesome bank alt out of it, that has 2 crafting professions at max.
---
A lot of people talk shit about enh shaman. And they‚Äôre right to. But at the end of the day, there are gonna be enh drops that the hunters and fury warriors no longer want and are inefficient on any other class, that need a home to go to. Raid as resto, pvp as ele, and you‚Äôll inevitably get gear for enh; imo the game is a lot less boring when you‚Äôve got three distinctive play styles that you enjoy and set goals for, and shamans probably the best class for that.
---
Lots of folks
---
I'm responding only to the title.
---
* Apprentice - Level 5 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
* Journeyman - Level 10 for Production/Fishing and no req for Gathering
---
* Expert - Level 20 for Production, Level 10 for Gathering and Fishing
---
* Artisan - Level 35 for Production, Level 25 for Gathering, Level 10 for Fishing
---
how many of those are there? ..dot
---
Cc= crowd control 
---
Having a focus target allows you to have two unit frames instead of one for the enemy
---
As a fellow paladin, I'll be fapping while I farm, too.
---
https://i.imgur.com/oUtUv.jpg
---
I saw for leveling tips on your website you say to use Sword or maces and forego backstab.  What about front-facing backstabs on npcs?  I find it works best.  Any thoughts?
---
I haven't seen a single video claiming you can reach (close to) exalted at 40.
---
Watching tribe and monkeynews farming sm was pretty insane, especially once they got sweeping strikes and ravagers from armory. Looked 10x easier than the mage aoeing too
---
Why? Do you do that to every post? Seems like a great way to misinterpret the post as you did here
---
You can‚Äôt. Can‚Äôt remember what stream I was watching but they tried to do it and it didn‚Äôt work üòî
---
I'll probably just do mining and engineering.  I might have to grind and farm a bit for my mount, but so what?  It might also take me an extra couple days to get to 60 too, but that's not a big deal either.   I might just stop trying to leveling engineering at some point.  Depends on how hard it is to get the necessary mats.
---
Completely forgot about that 2H.
---
Yea sure, I do that to every post.
---
Why not just continue leveling instead? Get the gnome mount for 40 and replace it at 60 if you really want. 
---
Even if you could get the rep at 40 the way you described I bet it would be slower than just going to 60 and then getting the rep.
---
Someone who thinks of the future.  
---
You can have two professions at max on it, freeing up your main for 2x gathering etc  
---
   
---
Leveling to 42 is relatively quick compared to the time you'll be spending on your bank alt over the years you might spend playing wow. If it's a class you haven't played before, might as well try it out and get good bank alt out of it.    
---
You can go quick and dirty, but if you really want a great bank al a little investment will pay off in the long term.  
---
Look at your bank alt, they can just list and mail things.
---
Now look at my bank alt, that can swap cities easily, sell ports and water.
---
It's a fresh slate to mess around on a character, do dungeons as a role you haven't done much of before, and before it gets to 42 you've got a dirty-peasant lvl5 bank alt, while you lvl your bank alt to be.
---
Subbing isn‚Äôt the issue, leveling them to 60 and getting actual good recipes is.
---
Ah the good ol days of beefy bois warstomping and backpeddling out of fights.
---
You will not even get close to exalted. You can only reach exalted with the main city of your faction and for all the others you will have to do cloth turn ins.
---
Well no different than the rest of reddit I suppose at least you admit it lol
---
literally have been buying gold since vanilla and never been banned ..buy it from a real site and not a site that hacks people and you'll be fine ... lol
---
Are BGs not the go to place to rank up or do the hardcore players usually go wpvp solo or in groups to maximize honor?
---
I remember though on pve, I never really had trouble starting fights but I'm sure it's no where near as intense and frequent as pvp servers.
---
Its a little shy of half way. 42 is 45% of the way there. 44 is the halfway mark. 
---
32=25%, 44=50%, and 52=75%. For anyone curious.
---
I think the priest ones are locked to specific zones. Like dwarfs have to go to the Cath of Light in SW to get desperate prayer no matter where they are when they hit 10.
---
Outside of that I don‚Äôt think the class quests are zone locked based on race. But I could be wrong.
---
Bummer
---
It's not about noticing wether or not someone is from a PvE realm or not, it's about people should be allowed to play on a PvP realm if they didn't level on a PvP realm. It's like how LFR raiders should not be able to get items with Mythic item level. If you don't work for something you don't deserve to have it. If you want to play on a PvP realm start on a PvP realm, if you chose PvE, stay on PvE.
---
Y'all are wild dude
---
My name is original and has never been taken in any game I‚Äôve played!
---
I wish you all the best of luck getting your names. ‚ÄúBestwarrior‚Äù ‚Äúiamwithstupid‚Äù and ofc ‚Äúnoobnoob‚Äù
---
Make the name, and then customize the toon after the naming rush is over and just pick an off time to transfer the name to the character you actually want to play.
---
On a scale of 1-10, 10 being extremely, how boring is this method?
---
I'm just agreeing with you because the argument is a complete waste of time.
---
Some have concerns about it taking too long to lvl.  
---
It's the same logic behind getting a university degree, sure it takes longer than working at mcdonalds, but the longterm payoff is great.
---
You seem nice despite your aversion to reading a threads content before replying. Have a lovely day
---
Level 42 bank alt?
---
Yeah, fuck that.
---
Plan it out via privat.e servers. Make your character on one first.
---
Anyone who dares try telling you how to play isn't worth listening to. And they are over compensating for having a small dick irl. And they have no friends. And they hate themselves lol.
---
[removed]
---
Anyone serious about ranking up is probably doing AV most of the day. Its the best place to be in terms of honor per hour. 
---
Battlegrounds won't be until Phase 3 though and the honor system comes online in Phase 2. During phase 2 wPvP is gonna be crazy.
---
I have done two subscriptions at once before.  
---
There are two times it is worth it:  
---
1) Account sharing with a minor. Play together, have fun!
---
2) those old RaF promotions where the only way to get a companion mount was to get a second subscription.
---
3) (Not my liking, but ymmv). Multiboxing, if it is still allowed.
---
Eng is as much of a money sink as BS while leveling. I'd argue it's a bit more useful though, if you like to PVP a lot at least.
---
35 might be a good compromise, if someone can bear missing out on being able to give ports. Lets you get 2x max crafting professions on it, with much less time investment than 42.
---
I've never tried EPGP! I've seen people suggest that decaying points will discourage hoarding. Personally, I don't think that would work on me, but I'd be interested in hearing more about your experience.
---
If I'm saving to get the next Drakefang Talisman, and the criteria for who gets that item is 'who has the most points', then personally, I don't care if my points are decaying for months on end. What's the difference between that, and having to spend an enormous amount of DKP for it? I can't see one. I just know I wouldn't spend anything that would reduce my chance of getting it, even if I was losing countless points in the process.
---
These are good points but you're probably going to be downvoted to hell because a lot of people seem to have a very rose tinted recollection of playing on PvP servers. They're a lot of fun at times, and I'll be playing on one too, but sometimes they really bring out the absolute worst in people. The reality is there's a big overlap between people who rush to 60 on PvP servers and people who corpse camp level 20s for hours on end. If you aren't one of the people getting to level cap in the first two weeks, you are at some point going to be corpse camped by people who did. You are going to encounter zones devoid of NPCs because someone thinks it's funny. You are going to rally for help and more often than not get none.
---
I'm not going to tell anyone not to play on a PvP server, but sugarcoating the experience isn't doing anyone any favors. There's a lot of fun to be had on PvP servers, but at times you literally will not be able to play the game because some people just don't want you to.
---
My recommendation for casual players (of which I am one) is whenever you get ganked by someone considerably higher level just log out and play an alt for the rest of your time online that day. A level 60 killing people leveling in Ashenvale isn't there for any purpose other than ruining your day. In my mind it's a waste of time to res and hope they don't kill you again; most likely that's precisely why they are in Ashenvale in the first place. I don't give them the benefit of the doubt, I just log onto an alt. Maybe they were just passing through, or maybe they spend the next hour sitting on my corpse waiting for me to res. I'm having fun on an alt one way or the other. My time, and yours, is too valuable to waste on assholes.
---
Seriously, just name it and finish immediately. On release, that's when you'll edit. I'm pretty sure you'll have to delete your character and edit then, so be sure to be quick with the customization. Like others suggested, memorize how you wanna do it, or just write it down and have it ready (three click to the right hair, 1 click to the left for face, etc...). It's risky but it's the best way. The odds of someone taking your name the moment you delete is low but every second that goes by chances go up, especially if the name is extremely sought after.
---
We'll have two weeks before the servers launch to recreate them with the look you want, so no it's not worth wasting the time tweaking the character's looks first go around. Just make a character and save the name asap. Yes, you can delete the character and get the name again as there's no actual name reservation or lock out beyond creating the actual character.
---
Yeah I think this is the right way to go for me too
---
Class calculus as in the way I build the class overtime? Premade as in playing with the same group every time I que up? I'd love to have a group of people to keep playing with, improving together as well as improving individual performance is important to me.
---
I'm definately going to focus on finding a like minded guild eventually, seems like a great idea for me, people are suggesting it. It would be nice to have a few veterans who know strategies we can use straight out the gate.
---
Gear for standard tanks wildy outpaces druids.
---
A shaman can tank 5 mans lol.
---
100% depends on the people you are playing with. If they are all quiet, then super boring. If they are funny guys - more fun than solo.
---
What instant 60? Been wanting to try classes
---
For you
---
For example, the video says 500 rep in duskwood which references this quest https://classicdb.ch/?quest=253. 
---
But if we actually look it up in database with info from the beta intead of pserver database https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=253/bride-of-the-embalmer and we see it gives 60% less rep.
---
So you can see why the video is wholly inaccurate.
---
But can‚Äôt shadowmeld for when u need to tend to the kids
---
How about a lvl 60 bank alt?   
---
keep a lvl 5 until then but have a class you want to try out on the side, in addition to your main. When it eventually reaches 60 (or 35 for 2x max crafting professions) make it your bank alt.  
---
Of course you just use a lvl 5 at first, but this is about the long term.  Having a character to mess around on when you're not raiding/locked out etc, can be a god idea.
---
If you're putting that much into the character, it's no longer a bank alt and it's just your alt.
---
Or you pvp or go play an alt. My time is as precious as yours, but there is always another day. Don't base your real life happiness on a game and just enjoy all of its experiences.
---
Its a stupid thing to do. $15 a month just so sometimes when you want to Enchant your gear you don't have to pay someone a small amount of gold to do it. 
---
In RMT terms 250G per month (thats roughly what $15 will get you) for the ability to enchant your mains gear without having to interact with another player.
---
Its a silly thing to even think about.
---
My issue is I feel like Warlock is the perfect class for my plastyle and late game plans, but I just don't like the Warlock class thematically.
---
The best strategy for getting your name is to NOT MAKE POST LIKE THIS and remind people. Just jet them forget to do it.
---
Video was great! I imagine this probably wouldn‚Äôt work so well for rogues because of their lack of AOE abilities?
---
If you want to world pvp any class you go engineer. It's too much fun donning the charge helmet, swifty boots and slowfall cape.
---
Hell no.
---
Human, and most quests I turned in while green. You don‚Äôt get any extra rep for turning them in at yellow/orange/red, but you do start to lose rep after you outlevel them by 6+ levels and they turn gray.
---
Thanks for the info. One more thing, are bgs cross server? I wanna at least face some against some good competition in bgs if I choose to go pve.
---
NE Hunter and Dwarf Priest -multibox
---
Yeeeeyeee
---
Yes, I know. The problem is you don‚Äôt have a personal mailbox with you 24/7 so you‚Äôre going to have bag space problems all the time. It‚Äôs just one of the problems everyone deals with when they are forced to prioritize leveling speed and gold spending on things other than bags.
---
Oh my God, the irony.
---
Same here! Stick an extra 8 gigs of RAM in and you're set!
---
You won't get Exalted by lvl 40. There is a slim chance you can get it by 60 if you do every single NE quest possible and then the other factions for spill over rep. I don't know the cloth turn in lvl requirement for runecloth, but if that's in at launch you could potentially just farm the runecloth on another character and funnel it to the gnome.
---
Bro... I was torn between a mage and a priest... then I watched a YouTube video, and now I‚Äôm also considering Rogues, Warriors, warlocks, Druids, paladins and shamans.
---
That made it MUCH better
---
My experience from playing pserver priest through MC/BWL.  Short answer no, they do not do well in the open world.  Long answer there are options.  You are not going to be good at grinding mobs no matter what spec you are, but you can take Herb/Mining and also there are some Dungeon farms that you can do for gold.  Killing regular things for a simple quest yeah its not bad its just not fast or near the efficiency of other classes.
---
Im debating between Shaman/Priest as my main for classic and im going to dual box level a mage for gold farming.
---
This screenshot is as old as nostalrius its not like OP made it lol
---
Lol, I posted this right as it happened, there's bound to be reposts of the same thing if 80k+ people are watching.  Sorry to have upset you m'lord.
---
class calculus as in what class and spec you might be gunning for. Some things are technically viable, but you won't get a spot in a premade with it.  
---
Example of people going through a typical comp here: [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5JlRGjIPkc&amp;t=45m30s).
---
I tried to avoid the subject of rogues so that people don't start excluding them, cause solo leveling a rogue sucks... but yeah, rogues are on the 'only bring him because we can't find someone else' list
---
/w Dun_Morogh Hey man, do you want to do Strat. Just you and we good to go. we can summon :)
---
/w Dun_Morogh yo dude! we gotta free spot for UBRS you want in? we can summon you.. .plz? &lt;3
---
/w Dun_Morogh fort plz &lt;3 thx bro
---
I don‚Äôt miss them.  Rude people.  Questionable weather.  I was super glad that BC was the last experience of that for us.
---
I get that it was part of the experience, but it wasn‚Äôt a fun part.
---
The aoeing method takes a lot of practice and has a big margin for error but it is potentially way faster
---
baby you got a stew!
---
Battlegrounds are cross-realm from the start is my understanding. 
---
Some people are a bit shook up about that around these parts so if we talk for it long enough, we're going to get called retail babies.
---
Omg that sounds like a huge quality of life improvement. I know I never used that when I played before. Can you just tab back and forth between the two? So if sheep was on number 5 you can just hit TAB &gt; 5 &gt; TAB as fast as possible?
---
...reading at the park....of course you were...
---
No, that's just an alt that will have it's own inventory to maintain, not a bank alt.
---
That's about it there is no solo life lol people love you
---
Well I think I have decided to go mining + Engi instead so it shouldn't be as much of an issue
---
&gt; For leveling 1-60? Yes, the game has virtually no gear nor are the elemental talents suited to leveling.
---
not true. Almost all shamans who leveled fast on pserver swiched to ele at level 40. Its faster and not as much reliant on gear as enhancer.
---
It's because they fired the guy that was engaging with the community.
---
Cheers!
---
Assuming this is correct, it's great. Thanks for putting this together
---
I‚Äôm late to the party, but since you can take the item back, you put them on ignore, kick them from the group and exclude them from future runs. If they keep the attitude up, the server will eventually catch on and they‚Äôll effectively be blacklisted and won‚Äôt be able to group for anything. Had a couple weasels like this on Thrall server back in vanilla.
---
Well played
---
I didn't mind pandas or Monks. It was all the other shit like raid finder and talent choices and raid difficulties and shit that made the game suck.
---
If you say "Fresh" even one time in this video...
---
Druids.  Aspect of the pack.  Sure bro.
---
Some of those flip tank fights were due to a stacking debuff which Paladins can reset by casting rank 1 shield and insta-cancelling.
---
Once and a while I get one that's half way OK
---
:(
---
If you thing pandas are the worst thi g added to this game, you must not have played the last 6 years. MoP may be the best post wrath xpac.
---
As soon as Diremaul comes out you can make bank farming DME lashers with holy nova. You easily make 50+gph. You probably wont find yourself killing stuff out in the world much, because although you can, you're rather slow at it.
---
As holy/PI, you'll probably get wrecked walking around in the world occasionally if you're on a pvp server (mainly due to lack of dps and mobility), but you have a fear and a bubble so it isn't the worst. You should actually be able to win most 1v1s using a wand, but it will take awhile. You'll usually get wrecked because someone else comes by as you're fighting the first person. As shadow you melt faces.
---
You most definitely will be able to handle every instance in your raid build for healing for both PI and holy build. If you're shadow, it's actually much better for dungeons than it is for raids because the fights are way shorter so running out of mana is less of an issue.
---
The difference is , is that it is much easier to bail on watching a computer show than to bail in the middle of a raid with other real people
---
Or take Engineering and have your Gnomish Net Launcher ready
---
I respect the MATLAB
---
Is it worth the read (for someone who remembers almost 0 wow lore, but likes good fantasy reads)
---
Mages are easy as a Paladin, you have only 3 seconds of downtime with improved Blessing of Freedom
---
Troll priest. I'll be DME lasher farming from phase 2 on, but righteous orb farming in phase 1.
---
So when WoTLk was released I got out of work 2 hours early to go stand in line at Meijer. ‚ÄúWe will have limited copies‚Äù they told me. Fine. I‚Äôll wait, I don‚Äôt care. 
---
Get to the store and go up to the customer service desk and they told me they‚Äôd have to check because they didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. So finally they find the games and brought them all to the front of the store. Turns out, there was like 5-6 of us waiting. So we stood there. For 1.5 hours, and they let us purchase them a little bit early (11:30ish). 
---
I get my copy and I‚Äôm so excited that I run to my car and jump in and drive back to my apartment, open the box up carefully and remove the disc and pop it into my iMac. Nothing happened. Turns out that this was the night my dvd drive decided to take a shit and stop working forever. 
---
Undeterred, I run back out to my car, drive back to the store. No problem I think to myself, it‚Äôs still like 10 minutes to midnight. I get to the store and buy an external disc drive/burner thing thinking I‚Äôll just return it the next day. I need this game installed NOW. 
---
Back to the apartment, get everything going. It‚Äôs installing, and then updating. The update gets to 100% and I click on the login button, and my computer tells me it‚Äôs having connectivity problems. FUCK. So I check my router, hardwire the modem to my computer, still nothing. So in my frustration I pace back and forth trying to figure out what‚Äôs going on. That‚Äôs when I noticed a Comcast truck sitting outside the building messing with wires in the ‚Äúbox‚Äù outside. ‚ÄúNo. You‚Äôve got to be kidding me,‚Äù I think. I call Comcast and they tell me they‚Äôre doing routine maintenance and can‚Äôt guarantee the internet will be back until like 4am. Fuck you Comcast. 
---
So I unplug my computer, grab it, my mouse and keyboard and hop back in the car. I drove across town to the only place I could guarantee had internet that I could use for free in the middle of the night. So that‚Äôs how I spent 1:00am-5am playing WOTLk for the first time at Dunkin Donuts, eating breakfast sandwiches and drinking coffee. Fuck you world, I wasn‚Äôt going to miss launch, no matter what was going to get thrown at me. 
---
Later ended up starting a 25-man raiding guild and had some of the best times of my life gaming during that expansion. But yeah, good times.
---
Beautiful, checking that out in a little while. I think I understand that, a premade will want a character that is built with pvp strategy that involves working together where technically a full dps glass cannon build can still be fun and "viable" for a random match. I can just watch the video soon I'm just out right now.
---
cool seeing my guide getting reposted :) i made a list for viable gear aswell  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/7dgie2/since\_im\_starting\_to\_raid\_as\_enhancement\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wowservers/comments/7dgie2/since_im_starting_to_raid_as_enhancement_i/)
---
I'm imagining you as the dude from the South Park episode covered in doritos saying this and dying with laughter. 
---
I refuse to look at you post history to find out this isn't how you actually look!
---
So if blizzard added an epic store mount into classic that would be fine? Since everyone else can access epic mounts with gold then it should be fine right since it's just a skin? If it was a free to play game, then paying for skins is fine. But when you pay a premium price to buy the game, a premium price every expansion, and you buy a subscription just to play the game, charging people for high quality mounts that should've been in game rewards is fucking absurd.
---
Yeah and like I said, I think my time is better spent getting to 60 first .
---
We can go back and forth all day , the beautiful thing about humans is they each have their own opinion and they don't always have to coincide.
---
Luckily I get to play the game AND you get to play the game, so we can both do it our own way!
---
Hm alright. I really want to heal but not being able to hold my own when i'm alone is a bit of a deal breaker for me. Thanks for info.
---
Yeah I figured as much. But im wondering about when i'm not trying to do group content and just want to relax by myself.
---
bullshit, ill have thousands on 1 site ready within 2 weeks
---
Saved
---
 Yeah that is something I thought of as well. Once you have 10 slots bags though it should be better.  I'm guessing 10 slot bags will be available pretty fast. For sure there will be players leveling tailoring quickly so they can be among the first selling them on the AH. Up until the point you have the bags you could always just not pick up the skins you gather. Light leather doesn't vendor for very much. 
---
 It's tricky though, last warlock I leveled on a private server started out with all bags being traveler's backpack. This will be quite different.
---
 If I had to cut one profession I guess it would be skinning. So just mining+engineering I guess. Engineering is a waste to have right away though. I'm rolling gnome I guess I could try and sell bronze tubes for the quest in duskwood. Problem is a lot of people will try selling those, prices will probably be very low. Also they can be bought for 8s from several vendors. On horde selling deadly blunderbuss is probably more effective though, can charge more.
---
They can either get the game ready or talk to you about getting the game ready. They're not elected officials, they don't need to explain their decision making process to you.
---
Space will be much less of an issue then.
---
Definitely Mining + Engineering.

Almost anything you make with blacksmithing is BoE. It will literally cost you more money to level it up than it will to tip someone to make the gear for you.
---
It all depends on what kind of content you're doing. In PvP, Healing Focus is much better. The way Renew works is that only one Renew (from all Priests combined) can be active on a target at a time. In PvE, whichever Priest has the highest amount of +healing will typically be the one putting Renew up on the tank, and that Priest sometimes takes more points in the Improved Renew talent. I typically prefer Healing Focus. I don't use Renew much (max rank or downranking), because of its low healing for the mana cost.
---
With this as a base at 60 (don't use this to level), you have most of the good general healing talents for PvE. From there, look at some of these example specs. These are all fairly decent depending on your level of gear.

If the tank supply is well below demand bad pull will usually be tolerated. While I playing as a hunter on a PS the tank engaged in a condescending rant when I accidentally pulled an extra, when I tired to give advice when he made  several mistakes he tried to get me kicked, then held a grudge
---
Thank you for all that you do!
---
You didn't see a moonkin in the raid because it's NOT THERE
---
Can you run me through stocks?
---
I'm playing the long term plan. I'm going to go for names that there is almost a 0% chance I'll even be fast enough to get. 
---
I'm going to type Executie (or something equally hard to get) as fast as I can with no regard to race, class, gender, or character design.
---
Its now exactly 120 days post launch. Its 4AM. The hype is died down. The tourists have quit and there are thousands of players on my server who tried to claim the name "Executie" and failed. 
---
This is when I delete Executie and make my Gnome Warrior and pick the right face, hair, hair color, etc. Doing this in less than 25 seconds. 
---
If someone manages to steal my name after all that; Merry Christmas you lucky bastard.
---
Farming Tyr's Hand. Some of the elites drop some recipes (elixir of sages, crusader, major mana to chest) and they all drop good coin/greys, on top of the usual low chance for green/blue/epics.
---
level 5 for bank alt with enchanting for DE
---
Level 35 hunters for max profession alts
---
35+ is an actual alt you intend on playing
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt see any enhancement shaman in our raids back in 2005, and I don‚Äôt think I will this tome around. I was an Elemental Shaman myself, but Resto for raiding. 1-2 respecs per week for PvP. I expect the same from shaman who want to raid - at least until stuff is being farmed.
---
As a current (retail) and future (classic) priest main, this is encouraging to hear. Running dungeons and raids are my favorite thing.
---
I really hope people will poke me to join them on dungeon runs. I'm a support at heart, rarely say no to help requests.
---
I always found it silly that people were like "panda people in a game with cow people?? How out of place."
---
But almost all my characters are pandas
---
Chen's Keg barrens quest still in game, checkmate.
---
Red Dragonscale is only marginally worse than robes of the exalted.  Arguably better for MC, BWL, and Ony because fire resistance is relevant.
---
Blacksmithing is really only worth it if you think you're going to be one of the first (or preferably, the first) with a rare pattern such as Arcanite Reaper or Lionheart Helm on your server. Usually you're going to have a high ranking Prot Warrior in your guild with Armorsmithing for the FR gear, and they'll probably have the highest chance of scoring the Lionheart Helm pattern if you're lucky enough to see it drop early on. That leaves Arcanite Reaper as the best thing to race for in the early game.
---
Engineering on the other hand is the most powerful tradeskill in the game. Its biggest impact is in PvP, but stuff like the Gnomish Battle Chicken are great to have in PvE too. And a free portal to Gadgetzan is nothing to scoff at either.
---
She admitted the game is not for her and moved on. I don't see anything wrong with that. 
---
People we should hate are the ones that cried that Classic shouldn't even be a thing or people that want to change Classic because they don't like putting in effort or the class balance or whatever.
---
Admitting something is not for you but accepting people enjoy it is much better than whining about the game not being good for you and ruining it for everyone else.
---
Anyone who wants to use them for profs
---
I think I'll name my bank alt mazziwe now.
---
As a healer focus no you will lose almost all 1v1 however that‚Äôs the beauty of Classic. You‚Äôve chosen to specialise, can‚Äôt be the best healer and beat a dps doing dmg to you.  You‚Äôll live for a while of course but as a priest without consumes you probs aren‚Äôt getting away so you‚Äôll lose eventually.
---
They went from non-canon easter egg jokes to canon comic relief to eventually stealing the spotlight for essentially an entire expansion. 
---
In WC3 there are Orc Space Marines and Hydralisks. I thought those were cute easter eggs. Does that means I approve of Blizzard adding a Protoss raid tier to WoW? No. (Although to be fair, it could be pretty bad ass.)
---
As is usually the case, the answer is "it depends".
---
If you go engineering you'll see situational but noticeable dps increases. I'm no expert but I'd have thought eng was better for tanks thanks to AOE threat and the shield. It's great if you plan on pvping much. The con to engineering is that it's a sizable gold sink.
---
With blacksmithing you'll enjoy a generally higher quality of life thanks to being able to craft a wider range of items, and sell those you don't need. You have potential to make good money if you land a rare recipe. Oh, and sulfuras. 
---
In general if you think you'll be serious enough to push through the inconvenience factor then go engineering. Otherwise blacksmithing.
---
Your playstyle being "Hit Shadowbolt"?
---
I made and shared one on here a while ago.
---
I went through over 300 original WoW PVP videos to compile the playlist so it‚Äôs about as authentic as it gets.
---
https://open.spotify.com/user/215reqxiyyujsh7eg2pt2d3ta/playlist/7oubgttcHtwBllf2iqVtSw?si=RaulQ2WeRxCxoXYt7zYiTw
---
They had on the best gear you could get at level 30. They had Whirlwind Axe at level 35. You won't be clearing it nearly as fast.
---
&gt; Tauren have to run into Barrens and across to Durotar and again vise versa.
---
As Orc or Troll, running up the back of Valley of Trials, jumping down to Ratchet, running to Crossroads then Camp Taurajo and finally into Mulgore might actually be a good way to get a bunch of quick exploration XP and a few Flight Points in early game and Mulgore will likely be less populated than Durotar.  
---
Wouldn't do it on a clothie or Rogue though, Mulgore only has trainers/quests for classes that Tauren can play.
---
Blacksmithing is for convenience/money making. Engineering is for throughout, by a considerable margin.
---
Honestly I'd be screwed if it was physical copy only LOL I don't have a dvd/cd drive in my computer
---
I was holy priest in vanilla, I have to be honest compared to now I had no clue wtf I was doing back than, only thing that I was reasonable at was healing in raids and dungeons.
---
But yes it was doable for me to survive on your own in the world, it's not optimal of course not but it's not this impossible thing it just took some time to get the same results as a mage or hunter.
---
For money I mostly did dungeon runs since that's also what I enjoyed doing, healing plus bringing the UBRS key was very profitable back than. It also helped that I was a herby/alchemist and would farm my own stuff, plus sell surplus on the auction house for some quick cash. 
---
As for killing mobs, I'd just stay my raid spec, it takes time but it's almost impossible to die, I've grinded most of my alchemy recipe's solo, I just spammed smite and holy fire cause I had no clue about wand and auto attack chaining back than.
---
As for W-PVP, I was just a pain to kill 1v1, they usually left me alone, but if someone was stupid enough to try me, I'd win a lot. Dueling outside of Ironforge had the same results long drawn out battles where I'd be victorious most of the time,  more enemies would cause problems of course.
---
Your raid spec will be the same as your dungeon spec, it's just to expensive to change all the time, but that's not a problem even if you are the designated disc priest, you can still heal dungeons with ease, especially after acquiring some raid gear, or blue bis items.
---
Do note that this was in vanilla, where everyone was clueless, on a realm that only had 1 horde and 1 alliance guild that raided naxx. I had a mix of MC and BWL gear, so I outgeared most players.
---
Nowadays with all the tips and tricks online, players with years of experience on private servers with optimal builds coming, many raid guilds with many geared players, so everything is subject to change.
---
Still debating with myself if I'm gonna level my bank alt. I have had a mage alt next to my priest for many expansions. Only bfa made me dislike my mage.
---
Sold
---
I highly doubt you'll see 1k going for $50, takes way too long to farm even doing the most efficient methods for that type of money...
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs fair. If you‚Äôre taking the time to compile a resource, particularly one that is widely shared then doing some research first isn‚Äôt unreasonable advice.
---
You should most definitely do that. That‚Äôs my very first toon on vanilla, but not my cool original name.
---
You have my blessings, eve...
---
Epic story lol. I purchased BC on my credit card that I was sure was cancelled and or maxed out.
---
What do you feel like the dps difference is here between a top tier dps, like a geared warrior, and a bad dps, like a druid? Is it just insurmountable? or is it something small, like 10-20%? I don't run with a dps meter, though looking at this, I realize.... I should.
---
He makes so many people wanna be ret but this is the truth about em
---
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem like Blizzard will be as useful in classic. [See this](https://clips.twitch.tv/TransparentGrotesqueMallardYouWHY) from the beta.
---
This is why the game is shit now. Blizzard designs the game for morons like this.
---
EPGP is good for casual guilds who don't kick for low attendance, giving a soft incentive to show up regularly.  
---
Specific complaints against DKP depend on the type that is run.  
---
If we instigate price fixing (similar to GP in EPGP), then older members can hoard points for months, wait for the new phase, and then the newer members wouldn't get anything for months (As their DKP is far behind). The only way to solve this is with inflation - later raids earning far more DKP and items costing more. Without solving it, even people who just joined the guild 6 months after its founding will \*always\* be behind the earlier members for loot.
---
If we use an auctioning system, then DKP is a tax against classes that are heavier in raid comp. This leads to hunters having the best trinkets and rings, as they have less competition for many of their other pieces.
---
Icon for Prot is incorrect. It should be the same one as Devotion Aura
---
Was there still a debuff cap in tbc? When I raided in TBC as a warlock, I remember using my full DPS kit (maintaining all of my dots, shadowbolting, etc).  I don‚Äôt recall them getting bumped off and I never got complaints about it mucking things up in Gruul‚Äôs lair, Magtheridon or SSC.  I didn‚Äôt do any raiding in vanilla, but from what I‚Äôve heard, warlocks pretty much only used shadowbolt and curse of elements or w/e.
---
That's the way it was though back in vanilla right? It's a battle between "no changes" and something many people never wanted in the first place. The dislike for it boils down to wanting to maintain a tightly knit server and having cross servers would ruin that. Personally I don't care either way but I understand their concern.
---
The main reason for that implementation was for queue times on lower pop. servers. I don't think we're gonna have that issue for at least a couple months lol. Maybe they could hold off to see which servers will dwindle in population overtime and either combine or implement cross server for certain realms and hold off on the higher pop. servers. Or maybe they stick to "no changes" and do it now so people can accept it and not bitch about it when it's implemented a couple months from release. Like I said, either way works for me.
---
Most people don‚Äôt these days lol
---
R14 is the only one that helps the raid meaningfully and it mostly helps in early bwl before you ever get ashkandi. If you were a world first guild it would be 100% hunter prio. Most guilds open it to all classes that can use it. In either case, it definitely isn't warrior priority.
---
hey im the author of that guide. was playing shaman on my last private server run (thus the shit with LB cast inbetween swing timers - just private server things). 
---
i've been in a pretty hardcore speedrunning guild and they specifically were looking for a enhancement shaman because their roster didnt allow another healer. enhancement shaman, balance and feral druid and shadowpriests just bring mediocre dps with a support for other dps classes and the utility of their respective healing spec. most of the people talking down hybrid specs are idiots that never really played the "private server"-meta.
---
Haha that was dope
---
Engy imo, it is way better for raiding to help with your DPS. Especially sappers
---
Not even close as far as the gear goes but good talent builds and a good visual for totem twisting.
---
Well you simply dont play it like a mage... the pros of being a warlock is that if you play correctly you will have close to 0 downtime due to Pet tanking, Drainlife/Siphon life, frontloading spells, and lifetap to balance mana/hp constantly. You have alot of CC like Fear, Howl of Terror, and Death Coil aswell as utilities like Voidwalker Sacrifice Shield, voidwalker AoE Taunt and pet healing, aswell as healthstones for unlimited HP pots and soulstones to save you from hopefully never ever corpse run if you get ganked or do a bad pull and die.  
---
Oh and about the AoE lvling as a frost mage, its not really gonna work at all on a fresh server. The dynamic respawning that blizzard has in vanilla is not as "potent" as the custom dynamic respawns private servers use for fresh servers.  
---
If you wanna look at a warlock, check out Staysafe he streams warlock gameplay alot on the Beta, i think today he did a 1-30 speedlvl in under 25 hours? maybe hes still going not sure, but hes going fast boi on stream, so u can probably check his saved VoD on it. Other from staysafe, im not 2 sure theres probably TONS of guides out there on youtube on how to lvl efficiently as a warlock in vanilla. just gotta search for em
---
The 25% chance is all the time and not just a buff for x seconds. It‚Äôs really helpful to stop ganking because if a rogue resists cheap shot he‚Äôll have to vanish/cold blood or get fucked up. That applies to all classes not just rogues. Smart ally players can easily bait the cd and put themselves into an advantageous position
---
yes, noone has much gold in the beginning and those that do aren't spending it on skins...  
---
I found it was good to have a skinning/LW, turn all the skins into greens, send them to my Tailor/Enchant lvl 5 alt, disenchant them, then turn them into lvl 5 wands, and sell those on the AH.
---
I wouldn't discount an enhancement shaman, good move speed with wolf form and can self heal so you can farm for days.
---
5 man comps don‚Äôt matter at all, long as you have a tank and healer you can use anything for the rest. If a group is struggling in a 5 man dungeon, they‚Äôre either poorly equipped or just bad players
---
They meant leader of the pack
---
Figure of speech dumbass
---
I am levelling a priest right now in retail and it is such a cakewalk. Spam shadow word: pain on all mobs in the immediate area, pop shield, cast mind blast, and then mind flay until everyone is dead. Mana? Naw, no need to worry about that cause mana regen is so high. I remember drinks being such a precious resource to me in vanilla WoW but now I just vendor everything.
---
It is fucking ridiculous, there is zero challenge. Dying is basically impossible and it is so different than vanilla. In vanilla I was basically popping all my cooldowns to escape if I pulled 3 mobs. In retail if I am not fighting 5 mobs at once I am wasting time. Elite quest that requires 3 players? Fuck you video game, I can solo it without breaking a sweat. A single elite is easier than a regular vanilla mob. Retail is so fucking ridiculous now.
---
I may either go priest or mage when classic releases, but if I go priest I will try to befriend a warrior early because priest solo leveling will likely be very painful.
---
thanks for acknowledging :)
---
Except there always was.
---
Not being able to evasion cap makes them nonviable IIRC. Getting youyour tank oneshot by a double crit is not acceptable.
---
You're wrong though.
---
Blood Elves allying themselves with the Forsaken and eventually the greater Horde does stay true to the lore. **Sylvanas was literally the Ranger General of the High Elves.** The Blood Elves were betrayed by the Alliance and left for dead, those who didn't make the exodus to Outland with Kael'thas were undoubtedly going to perish if not for the Forsaken.
---
Yeah you can solo stockade
---
Will it be ready for the Classic client or just 1.12.1?
---
I‚Äôd be in it for the tank shield and bombs more than the pvp rocket helm etc. not completely sold tbh. Alchemy/herb seems like a better play if not enchanting/herb.
---
Are there other guides you‚Äôve done in similar way? Thanks bro
---
That's just mean. I've always wanted a starcraft MMO too.
---
tamb√©m reparei hahah
---
lol
---
Said no one, ever?
---
Lol bet your life sucks
---
&gt; during the alliance Easter Egg campaign
---
FTFY
---
I recommend visiting r/woweconomy
---
Did*
---
I'm not doing stuff like that anymore, i just had no resource to find things out about raiding as enhancement shaman, so i put stuff together. some of that is pretty whacky since its tailored to private servers (e.g. casting lb inbetween attacks) and i forgot stuff like the higher nature resistance of bosses making earthshock worse than frostshock.
---
after all i can say that enhancement is a pretty deep spec but i will not roll a shaman again. i just played shaman because i wanted to try something new and i didnt like it.
---
Nonoptimal != nonviable. I'm not arguing that warriors aren't better main tanks. But bears are perfectly viable in most vanilla encounters. Definitely through MC/ZG/BWL. A couple fights in AQ and Naxx are admittedly tough for bears. At the same time, furyprot warriors are much more popular now than in vanilla and they dont get defense capped either. Lastly, bears can easily get upwards of 10k health. There's no boss in the game that hits, let alone crits, for that much.
---
With good healers and a formswap-potion macro, a good tank will never get taken down a double crit.
---
Maybe. The only data I can gather is private server RMT prices. 
---
The point of what I said had nothing to do with how much gold will actually cost on launch though. The point of what I was saying, was buying gold to save yourself time isn't worth it, because you risk losing all of the time you've already invested.
---
Would you say trolls are to appeal to Jamaican players?
---
Omg haha  just laughed so fucking hard
---
If it's got 4.5 stars I'm gonna roll a paladin.
---
They didn‚Äôt build an entire expansion around trolls. Also they have move Chinese players than any other. So it‚Äôs pretty obvious that‚Äôs the reasoning.
---
I've found imp doesn't really work with affliction. You will run out of mana or health pretty quickly and need food/drink.
---
i put together a spreadsheet with viable phase 1 and 2 gear for flagcarrying on druid: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ugEjHtNQWwsc6LJctwypneGoUmwKj5WpI3O4dF48ejI/edit#gid=0
---
druid has always been my main and i will not play a shaman as mainchar again.
---
General Reposti.
---
TL:DR Don't it's shit
---
+5 engineering bro
---
Well I'm gonna fish a shitload anyways...
---
Healing Way is definitely an optional one. You really only need it if you're going to be rolling heals on a MT.
---
Lots of ways to distribute resto points depending on what fights you're doing and what role you're fulfilling in raid.
---
Yeah, it would be easier to have a warrior. But pre lvl50 it's not that tough. Just more slow.
---
Rofl.....so what you're saying is....its not possible?
---
Boomkin is probably the only thing that compares.
---
i like this guy
---
Says a guy on the classic wow sub... Are you even planning on playing? Are you even planning on dinging 60? Get your self righteous anti gaming rhetoric out of here man.
---
Yeah, you CAN also drive with your feet. That doesn't mean you SHOULD. lol
---
I guess that's fair. Before MoP I always felt they were just a joke, worthy of some easter eggs here and there but never felt I could take them seriously enough for them to be cannon. They just feel too silly and out of place for a world marred by constant war. I don't think I'll ever like them but to each their own I suppose.
---
It was an easter egg in WC3 before they came up with the brewmaster....
---
There is no coding involved so it will work. It works in BFA, but not all the graphics in the BFA UI were part of the UI in 1.12 so it would be incomplete if used in retail.
---
Just remember, put all the folders in the Interface folder with the Addons folder, not inside the Addons folder.
---
I highly doubt that, unless you installed a modified/altered image.
---
Use your tier set parts and fill the slots that compete with Mages/Warlocks from ZG/AQ20.
---
Just FYI the phrase ‚Äúbig margin for error‚Äù means it‚Äôs a lot easier to execute, not harder.
---
I know :]
---
Even with Garithos the whole Blood Elf thing was an extreme stretch. The High Elves were at least partially allied with human kingdom for ages. There's no way one idiot would've ruined that and sent them flying straight into the faction that contains the scourge, orcs and trolls - all three things they've gone to war against.
---
Nah, this only happens on PServers. That's about $400 a month right there.
---
It really was mean as fuck, and we did NOT realize it was a joke at first
---
‚ÄúWhile the pandaren race was originally announced as an April Fools joke for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos before the game's release, the pandaren would actually find its way into the game as a neutral hostile creep.‚Äù 
---
Same to you m8.
---
Posting a ton of single stack items is called ‚Äúwalling‚Äù, because you are creating a wall of crap that most people find too annoying to bother scrolling through. You post these at lower than market price, and other people will post full stacks at the same or even lower prices. You then sit there and watch the listings, buying up all of the cheap materials. When you‚Äôve had your fill, you cancel the wall, buy anything that remains and relist it all at a high price, resetting the market. If you know your server‚Äôs economy well enough, this gives you a few hours where you can sell thousands of trade goods at 3-4 times their actual price.
---
Blizzard actually raised the deposit costs on trade goods in retail to reduce this behavior because it was so effective at screwing over uninformed players.
---
Warcraft lore before wc3 was so cool. Just loved the style.
---
After I make s shit ton of wands though....
---
lol at unlicensed version of the game. Guarantee I played vanilla longer than you did, as well. You probably didn‚Äôt even play, did you? Level 40 BGs on beta are good solid numbers though
---
‚ÄúWhile the pandaren race was originally announced as an April Fools joke for Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos before the game's release, the pandaren would actually find its way into the game as a neutral hostile creep.‚Äù
---
Founding of durotar didn‚Äôt come out with the original release (Reign of Chaos), it came out with The Frozen Throne expansion.
---
blizzard only cares about money this is a good thing for them
---
EPGP works for all guilds basically, I don't know why you think it would only work better for casual guilds. 
---
There's no scenario where DKP is a better system.
---
Not mad just my opinion. Lmao.
---
From the Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness manual, back when manuals were awesome.
---
Yeah... I just wanted to check to see if anyone had come up with some way around it on private servers since vanilla lol, but when the response is:
---
" The way around it is to accept that you're a hybrid, and hybrid means you're a healer who can occasionally off-tank under the right circumstances. "
---
It's pretty much what I expected :-(
---
Okay so at first you should note down Classic WoWhead. This is basically your go-to source.
---
UBRS key service
---
Thanks :) it‚Äôs a fun story now. Never did return that disc burner either. It‚Äôs sitting right next to me, and works like a champ. lol
---
And they clearly have. Just because it's not perfect doesn't mean it's ok to be snarky with them.
---
I plan on doing this too. Has anyone tried maraudon princess runs on beta yet? Does anyone have an idea if it‚Äôs soloable for hunters? Same pats etc?
---
They're still less of a stretch (both lore wise and otherwise) than goat people from space that are 'good' Eredar.
---
The most hardcore progression guilds will be running loot council.  
---
I didn't claim it worked better for casual guilds, I said it is good for casual guilds. What I neglected to explicitly mention is that EPGP is better for casual guilds than DKP because it promotes consistency. Based on my higher comment, I clearly agree that it is superior to any variation of DKP.
---
Is that taking into account freshly leveled characters or the overgeared beta players?
---
I definitely miss going to midnight launches for games, but being able to install everything a week in advance and just playing immediately at midnight is so damn nice.
---
 I really disliked the switch to Procs-Per-Minute for everything in WoW. 
---
Loved the possibility to enhance some effects by increasing attack speed. 
---
They could have implemented a hard limit for a guaranteed proc if you're really unlucky instead of hardcoding it like a spell cooldown.
---
https://imgur.com/ZPJDgoN
---
Nice
---
Warrior alone is slow, frustrating AND a walking free kill for almost every classes in the game. Its really not fun as a solo class.
---
Engineering. Hands down.
---
Everything a warrior needs from Blacksmithing is BoE. 
---
Just have some other sucker level BS and make it for you.
---
I've already said I dont think they should have a store for classic, I'm not arguing for that. Having an epic mount in Vanilla was as much a status symbol as it was a great utility. Since then, having a mount has become meaningless as a symbol other than the achievement ones. Its dirt cheap to get the skill and an epic mount. 
---
For retail, you get $60 worth of content. Adding a couple of purchased mounts on top of the dozens you can get in-game per xpac isnt "absurd". You think they should be in the game, why? Are there not enough mounts? Do you really think blizzard would have even designed the store ones for the game? They wouldn't exist. The only incentive blizzard had to make them in the first place was to sell them as a skin.  You're acting like they stole content from us to sell them later, do you have any proof that they designed this for the xpac, then decided to sell it as an mtx?
---
Damn yer that was during the stress test
---
It was good... after they fixed the godawful dailies. The dailies were horrible.
---
No idea what that is and I mained a rogue on a pvo server. Mages were my playthings. So to answer your question, yes.
---
It's ShestakUI.
---
A guide?? in a photo??? holy shit OP you are the fuckin' greatest
---
Sure. But doesnt remove them from the other campaigns and being a major neutral hero
---
Perfect! Thank you! I know this will be helpful.
---
Considering Humans have had the most OP racials since the release of WoW, it doesn't surprise me that they're super popular.
---
Works about as well as a paladin.  At least he might hold threat.
---
I'm torn between mage, priest, or shaman.
---
If I was a horde player shaman would be the obvious choice for me, but I've been alliance the entire time I've played WoW. Right now I think I am kinda leaning towards Tauren shaman.
---
If you‚Äôre interested in WoW history, it‚Äôs a great read. But it‚Äôs more of a statement of events rather than a story.
---
Because they weren't a big part in warcraft 3 means Blizzard shouldn't make them a race with lore? Shit dude, might as well delete all expansions (past wotlk) because anything that wasn't in warcraft 3 shouldn't be in WoW.
---
Ah yes being crammed in a small game stop with the smell of onions. What wonderful memories those were.
---
Honestly I think they spent the entire budget and most of their time on the opening quest sequence and then got to garrisons and were like 'well, fuck.'
---
If they worked for, say, a few more years on the expac it could have been the greatest thing since vanilla. Areas like Gorgrond were really, really fucking cool... but they just weren't fleshed out at all.
---
So I‚Äôm going Druid. Basic question on raid tier sets. Where can I find what dungeons drop the gear for them?
---
There is data showing private servers overtune low level druids. Its very possible other classes are overtuned too.
---
Also, the AI on private servers often isn't as good as Classic.
---
Nice, wish I could find mine, swore I kept it but... many years have passed
---
There will be no BGs and probably little in the way of meaningful PVP.
---
Really appreciate the help, you may have convinced me. Ya, I tend to forget how crowded everywhere will be lol. I‚Äôll check out his stream. Hopefully he past streams I can check out.
---
I dont read a lot and Im def not gonna read 20+ books but would love to brush up on a little lore before classic. Do you know of any summaries and cliff notes or something of that nature I would be able to look into?
---
of course...if the mage gets blind he has to block or take an ambush for half hp
---
originally... "they would actually find their way into the game"... on release. So they released the game with panderan in it. So Panderan have been around since wc3 release and you think you are actually disproving the last guys point?
---
Lorewise you're making sense but it's kind of ridiculous to add even more humanoid elves imo. The alliance already has 4 'human' races (humans, purple humans and short humans) with a big lack of creativity. Adding another boring elf race would make it even more stupid. At least draenei gave a tauren equivalent to the Alliance and the Horde didn't have very elf like races.
---
Sadly people don't seem to mind though as they love void elves.
---
aka it's cringey but shes hot
---
The colours are lined up nice.
---
Made my day, I love your comment thank you stranger
---
same
---
I think frost mage might be the fastest class to level. You can basically pull massive packs of mobs in the world and aoe them down without them ever touching you
---
Deathwing was in wc2. It‚Äôs not about being a big or a small part, it‚Äôs the fact they were introduced as an april fools joke, and became a whole expansion later on.
---
I really hope your joking.
---
How did you make the gold for that?
---
It was certainly an experience, but it is not one that I miss or want to do again
---
Just learn your class lmao
---
But there are pandas if you have the collectors edition.
---
Yeah you need two accounts. Or someone who can assist you.
---
AS A NEUTRAL HOSTILE CREEP. They were completely different from what they are now (standing naked rabid black and white bears), more akin to furbolgs than today‚Äôs kung fu panda looking dudes.
---
Can‚Äôt find the vanilla version. Someone got a link?
---
&gt; the Horde didn't have very elf like races
---
Nor did we want any.
---
Kung Fu Panda 2 came out in 2011. MoP came out in 2012. I think without those movies it would be received better, even though Pandaren have been in Warcraft a long time, at the time people drew parallels between the two.
---
Plus spell damage mail is pretty much just the AQ Shaman set and maybe a few pieces here and there.
---
Hey booper your recent work is awesome. Keep up the hardwork and grinding buddy.  You're a rising star in the recent community.
---
&gt;The undead campaign mission, Digging up the Dead features a *hidden* pandaren relaxation area 
---
&gt;the night elf campaign mission, Brothers in Blood features a *hidden* area hiding The Largest Panda Ever
---
Everything with pandas in campaigns is an Easter Egg IMO.
---
I think you can do a decent job healing as shadow from what I‚Äôve read on other forms. Even as far as bwl.
---
Hunters are needed anyway for tranq shot and distracting shot though. Much more important than an enhance shaman.
---
Hi
---
[female dwarf paladin here](https://i.redd.it/qjabqsfupdq11.jpg)
---
Rolling a pally ain;t that bad. We have buffs, 'oh shit' buttons, and we can heal ourselves. Plus free mount at 40. 
---
It really isn't as bad as people will have you believe, I personally enjoyed vanilla paladin leveling than priest...
---
I did, I‚Äôm 22 now. A lot of my friends moved out after HS too but I turned 18 in Jan of my senior year and got an apt later that week. 
---
Probably not significant as it‚Äôs just my personal experience
---
"daily" quests is a terrible design philosophy that most modern shit-MMOs currently are ripe with. Agreed!
---
Nope, people who played Legion earned enough gold to set up an unstoppable multibox machine for 0 $. 
---
Atm BFA gathering is ruined because of them, herbalism multiboxing became the norm and there's no way to earn a Token with gathering professions in a decent amount of time if you're just a regular player with one account.
---
EpGp is just DKP but with extra steps. Both are kinda trash tbh. Loot council PROPERLY ran. is prolly your best bet for loot system.
---
claasic is not for braindead people ,you need think, not faceroll in keyboard and get out the fire when addon tells to you...
---
im in the beta lvling a mage and a few other classes to try out and this is killing me.. the drinking after 1-2 mob lol then frostbolt spam, i wonder if there's a macro to continuously cast it
---
My group and I was well-geared at 30 and 40. 37-40 I think the butcher was my only keep from lvl 30.
---
As long as they aren't lean pockets, he should be fine.
---
Bruh, you bringing up instance xp without AoE group grinds or 4warrior + sham WF combos.
---
Smh
---
Its gonna take you alot of time because alot of BIS items are for alot of other casters and they will take priority of it before you. Main spec &gt; off spec. UNLESS you ask your raid leader and officers that you want to roll/dkp/loot council w.e the system is to have primarily on dps gear and not healing, some will be okay with it some will not.
---
Mmm, yes. I know some of these words.
---
I took my laptop to a Panera parking lot to finish a raid when my internet died. The place wasn't even open, was barely able to get their free WiFi.
---
Vanilla isn‚Äôt a solo game. The rank 14 literally HAD to have the dedicated help of at least 15 other players. The raid leader who plays 10 hours per day is a central piece of the game for 50+ other players. When one of these guys quits, especially if they go to another game, they‚Äôre likely to take a large chunk of their friends with them. Not many people want to play vanilla solo. It‚Äôs an MMORPG, not the single player dopamine simulator that retail is
---
Focus frame is in addition to the enemy frame. Make a macro for it and additional macros that use the spell to target your focus 
---
the macro is ‚Äú/focus‚Äù
---
The lore was so incredibly amazing before Warcraft 3. It's been 20 years since I read this and instantly knew where it was from.
---
BiS PvP item for sure.
---
It's not a corpse, there's a name above it. You mouse over it, if it's the dagger icon, they're feigning.
---
Felipao gostoso do kraleo
---
That's one of the things that makes me wish for a version of classic, maybe a few years down the road, where original design ideas that were cut for technical reasons are introduced into the game. Things like removing the debuff limit or adding a paladin taint.
---
u/TYsir knew a video that was described to be one only ‚Äúreal gamers‚Äù would know, thus implying that he is himself a ‚Äúreal gamer‚Äù. ‚ÄúReal gamers‚Äù are known to have a fundamental belief that we all in fact ‚Äúlive in a society BOTTOM TEXT‚Äù. Therefore, I wanted to confirm my suspicion that he is a ‚Äúreal gamer‚Äù by asking him the simple question of whether he lives in a society or not.
---
Uh, I played Vanilla beta kid, lol. I figured you needed the sarcasm tag after you said something so ridiculously inaccurate and uninformed. 
---
Also my server had more horde than ally, but I'm educated enough to know that anecdotal doesn't beat facts.
---
You can also politely tell the tank to stay back and let you pull. I did that as hunter in basically all 5mans and it worked like a charm
---
I don't think world buffs will be nearly as relevant as some claim. 
---
They are too much work and people die too often to bother unless its a world first.
---
Couple things I noticed on your gear prog tab:
---
* Nightslayer Bracelets are BoE
---
* Rune of the Guard Captain is not better than Hand of Justice
---
* Some of the other phase one picks are debatable, namely the legs, hands, and belt.
---
* Mirah's Song is not better than Dal'Rend's Tribal Guardian, especially if you have the Main Hand.
---
* In Phase 2, Tarnished Elven Ring &gt; Blackstone Ring
---
The exact problem with professions haha
---
I played with a tank who was keyboard turning, which means he's most likely clicking.
---
yeah but we are talkin about 1.12
---
Just no
---
I started in TBC (around S3) and the best experience for me was 1-58 I was trully fascinated with old the world, places like Western/Eastern plaguelands, Searing Gorge and Burning Steppes felt so daunting to me, it felt like that there were a ton of secrets and mysterious places in them. Cant wait to really see whats in there :'(
---
There's barely any mail with spell damage on it at all outside of the PvP set and there's almost no spell mail that doesn't also have agi/str budgeted into it meaning it has less spell damage than cloth gear.
---
There's basically almost no proiper caster mail in the game. Most of it is itemized how Blizzard thought enhancement should itemize, but that never ended up working and they eventually just reworked hybrids all together.
---
It looks like an unreleased corpse. Like I said not a guarantee but could work on some inexperienced players.
---
GIVE THIS MAN FUCKING GOLD.
---
[This is you.](https://i.redd.it/iihc1ofswp531.png)
---
Pandaren Brewmaster was added in TFT, in ROC there were no Pandaren except for an easter egg one you can spot by doing the reveal all cheat.  In TFT there are no Pandarens in the main campaign, only in the bonus campaign and on a side quest.  There's no substantial lore given in game.  Then, Pandaren made no appearance in any WoW expansion for years.
---
It sure never seemed like more than a tiny bit of side lore which verged on just being a joke for a long time.  So yes, you're technically correct, you're kind of bowling over many details which work against your point.
---
Mining and Skinning so you can pay for your repair bills lol
---
Meh, I started to list out some math to prove you wrong, but I just don't care. No multiboxer cares to farm enough gold to keep all their accounts on free tokens. It would take too long.
---
Chen Stormstout was a main character of Rexxar‚Äôs campaign tho.
---
I love the most minimalist UI as well? Would you mind sharing yours? I mean not too much of a difference when taking about minimal UI but I‚Äôm still interested in your setup!
---
I just kicked you out of my group for not equipping a BoE you rolled need on. How's that for fungibility?
---
On the contrary, back in 2004 nobody knew DPS paladin was garbage. Lots of people got to 60 and started raiding with no clue how bad their damage was.
---
Ally having shorter pvp queue times is inaccurate and uninformed? Ignoring the truth doesn‚Äôt make it any less true. Horde will have longer queue times than alliance on classic, just like always
---
Why are you even here then?
---
*PTSD flashbacks of Sri Lanka with a 3g wireless dongle intensify*
---
250 ping league games...waiting until between 12-5am for uncapped 100kb/s download speeds...
---
I do not miss it.
---
So you dont even need to switch targets? Sounds like a huge advantage. Thanks for the idea.
---
Focus was not in vanilla. But I believe it will be in classic when it come out.
---
Just like how you can make macros that are aimed at your target, you can do that for focus.
---
For example, you can bind keybind "3" to sheep. And you can bind "4" to focus sheep. So if you are fighting a warrior and a paladin, you set the target to warr and focus to paladin. If you hit 3, you sheep the warr, if you hit 4 your sheep the paladin. You never have to change targets, you always have the warr as a target but you can sheep the paladin by pressing 4 without even clicking on them or tabbing.
---
Hamstring kiting does not work as well with meele leeway though on beta i have found.
---
No, switching back and forth all the time is annoying. Best thing about it is they cant tell you have them focused the same way they can tell if you have them targeted
---
Blizzard almost always did releases in November which to a Scandinavian such as yours truly meant having to stand outside in the freezing cold in the middle of the night for hours.
---
I don't miss it lol.
---
They'd have to be extremely inexperienced. Anyone with minimal experience with mouse over the corpse to check the name, and the tooltip will change to a dagger.
---
Which relesed with the frozen throne expansion after some of the pandaren easter eggs had come out, not in reign of chaos.
---
Why don‚Äôt you create your own material then?
---
You are just wrong on facts though.
---
Fury warriors won't be top DPS for MC. Especially not when they are fighting 30 ways for gear.
---
Does energy continue to "tick" even when you're at full? I've always assumed it only ticks when you're missing some, but I've never paid much attention to it.
---
For shadow in dungeons you get to use all your dots and mind flay but in raid those debuff slots are used for something else so you don't get to maximize dps.
---
The majority of the Blood Elves also allied with Kael‚Äôthas and Illidan, which the Night Elves wouldn‚Äôt like considering the High Elves were originally exiled because they wanted to continue to use the Well of Eternity and Illidan betrayed the Night Elves.
---
There‚Äôs more marks in the For column for Blood Elves in the Horde, and less in the Against one.
---
It's crazy to me you can do this, that's a huge advantage, everyone is going to be doing this yes?
---
&gt;He would wait until I pull, kill me, and corpse camped me.
---
Log off, play an alt.
---
I, like many of you, have changed my mind so much these past few months that's its starting to give me anxiety. FUCK. Dwarf or human rogue ya'll?
---
Unless he's still leveling in phase 3.
---
Leveling my Rogue solo while I play my shaman when people are online.
---
Pickpocketing runs / smelting dark iron / transmutes.
---
Zero reason for me to ever need to waste money on respec and when I farm enough cash to be comfortable I can just park him at redridge.
---
To be fair, post WotLK was when the story got worse.
---
More fun to farm rank in the open world. Plus battlegrounds won't be until a later phase.
---
Same! Well, that was my philosophy all throughout my retail career. I think I'm going to try something like the OP for Classic to feel a little more immersed. I'm likely playing a druid, so this would be perfect.
---
Glad to see that there are other people wanting to take their time by reading the quest text. Makes the game way more immersive.

---
It‚Äôs still canon lore to the franchise before WoW, meaning something we could see in a Classic+. I mean otherwise I guess a lot of the setup for TBC and WotLK never happened either.
---
No the big gripe with Warriors is that they were pretty shit until their class rework.
---
I don't know why people were so gung ho about #nochanges when releasing WoW straight into 1.12 is an utterly massive change.
---
Every single raid up until Naxx was balanced around much more shitty itemization, talents, mechanics, and even entire attributes not existing. For example here's an interesting fact...when we first started to raid Molten Core there was no such thing as spell power yet. You dinged 60, bought your max rank skills and from there all your character progression involved was getting more HP, Mana, and some spell hit/crit.
---
In WoW Classic a guild going into MC for the first time will have Mages dealing 50% more damage than we did in Jan 2005.
---
Anyway /rant
---

---
Multibox a problem? Maybe for you, but for blizz its a goldmine. 
---
Also if you ever tried it, its way too much effort and work to get all the accounts in sync with macros and leveling them all. There will be not that many multiboxers and if you see them, its fun to stick around with them as they 1 shot everything because of superior coordination
---
BC was the only midnight release I stood around for, because Wrath had some leaked download directly from Blizz over their old updated.  They shut it down from any new connections starting, but they never cancelled those that were already started.
---
Long story short, the day before release, I got a digital download and didn't have to go to the store to buy it, and I was able to get logged in at 12:00, and into an instance with my 5 man grind group before the world servers continually chain crashed, and we ended up at level 74 without ever leaving the Nexus, while most of the rest of the server who hadn't gotten into instances was still 70.
---
I'm still mad I missed server first Troll and Hunter by 20 minutes to some dude I never heard of who just flew out of nowhere and got ahead of me when we were both 79.
---
Got a stew goin lol I love it
---
If a mob is rooted it will attack the nearest hostile target that is highest on the threat list. If any given mob is rooted near your totem, then it's technically smart enough to kill your totem.
---
This basically only happens when you're doing dungeons with a mage who frost novas a bunch of mobs while they're on top of you and/or your totems.
---
*Top Raid DPS: Warrior or Rogue?**
---
I've loved my time as a rogue since vanilla, however I've been raiding TBC on private server, and I'm a bit traumatized with how terrible rogues were in TBC pve.
---
I know they're more proficient in Vanilla, but I'm feeling the need to double check given the current state of the meta. 
---
With the information we now know about the two classes, and given a semi-hardcore raider:
---
* which is most like to represent the top of the DMs for each raid tier? 
---
* will there be a clear outlier, or do you think it will be pretty close?
---
If it weren't a clear winner for warrior, I figure I'll just hold course with rogue since I know so much more about the class and enjoy the play style.
---
Completely wrong usage of the term, but alright..
---
until AQ40 hits and the fun begins ;)
---
Plugging Kork for hunter guides
---
I wish people would stop bringing up DM farms.  Especially DME.  /Camp does not work the same way on classic as it does on private servers; it doesn't return you to the beginning of the instance.
---
Alot of this gear won‚Äôt be in phase 1 like the necklace from DM and the ring from AV.
---
Sorry just saw this. It's nameplate damage something or other someone linked it here. It's fantastic lot of customization
---
i dont understand this meme
---
IIRC Lok'amir is bis for any mace wielding class in PvP and bis for Shaman, Druid and Shadow Priest in PvE right?
---
The only problem I ever had with warrior leveling is much like shaman leveling, you actually have to put effort into literally every single mob to hamstring/earthbind kite.
---
Other classes can just send a pet in to tank, or have built in snares like frostbolt and don't have to do much more than spam 1-2 buttons per mob.
---
Source:  ended up maining a Hunter back in Vanilla.
---
Priest solo lvling is one of the best.  You dont have the highest mob kill times, but its actually still pretty fast and you never have to eat or drink if you do it properly.  The only better ones are really hunter and warlock to be honest.  Priest will even be faster than most mages, since AOE grinding will be fairly difficult with everyone sharing spawns early on.
---
Nostalrius isnt Beta. it's possible that Nost used PPM because they didnt know better or preferred PPM for game balancing.
---
if it's been tested and proven to not be PPM in classic beta, there's a good chance its not gonna be PPM in classic release
---
Private servers and bug free in the same sentence.
---
LOOOOOL
---
Sleep with the raid leader.
---
Yes, yes they have.
---
Not all have been discovered. In an interview with John strat he said there are plenty that have never been found. Some are also impossible to find only able to be seen in creator mode. So good luck but I am going back there now also since I know the story.  I have been there before but didn't understand why it was there.
---
50+ hours, wtf man?
---
I dunno If you're EU or NA. In EU you can log anytime in Dustvar and you will always see some guy with his druids or sky golems farming anchorweed and winter's kiss. I don't know if they're botting or selling game time through discord channels but they're here.
---
Cara, to procurando a comunidade brasileira pra jogar no classic.... Faz parte de uma?
---
1. I did not remeber them being BoE, but you wouldn't have to go out of your way to buy them if you are raiding MC.
---
2. I'm not a huge fan if proc trinkets.  So I would want to do some testing to see if it would be better dps.
---
3. I decided against the devilsuar pieces, because I will be running Herb/Alch.  So I can't get the leather myself plus it will be harder to to buy they on a fresh server. The cloud runner belt is off a rare elite as far I was able to find so you might never see him/it drop.
---
4.  I put Mirah's in because it's a quest reward.  So it's guaranteed.  You will be fighting every physical class to get the Dal'rend set.
---
5. The Evlen ring nets you about .5% to crit, but you lose 60 health and 5 ap.  So that might be a personal thing for me.  I would have to see what kind of crit I had with other equipment and might not want to sacrifice all my stam for pvp and farming.
---
I made thousands in vanilla fishing essence of water in azshara. That and selling titans flasks.
---
Excuse the language here but no you fucking won't lose most 1v1s unless you're a complete nutbag. Healer priests are amazing in PvP.
---
For phase 1, raiding should be light. MC+BWL is 1-2 nights.
---
One of the things my father taught me was that you should never let work dominate your life. You work to live, not live to work. 50+ hours is way too much...
---
I've done it before in vanilla, shit works and people get mad pissed.
---
Always send from a throw away level 1 alt.
---
Tier 1 - Molten Core
---
Tier 2 - Blackwing Lair + Molten Core (Legs) + Onyxia's Lair (Helm)
---
Tier 3 - Naxxramas
---
So can you focus someone without targeting someone else? Or do you need a primary target first (like another enemy, an ally, a minion, or a critter)? Is there a meta game around making sure to focus enemy players instead of targeting them?
---
Your Game Stop smelled of Onions? Where there ogers?
---
Very good, definitely worth the read.
---
I was thinking about that when some people were going on about the no changes thing. I was thinking "Well if you want the full 100% no changes route then I guess you wouldn't mind if you had to get the physical copy across however many discs it was and install it that way?"
---
What? Anyone you havn‚Äôt followed the controversy of Warcraft lore if you think it started with Wrath. Burning Crusade already butcheted and ret conned the lore, and you can read the old forums to see this.
---
You know what? If fantasising about having the power to kick people out of a 5-toon party in a MMORPG is all you have, I'll let you have it. That just happened. You won. Go you!
---
They should totally do a physical release for this, and let them have early access.  Create some sort of buzz...
---
Gallywix is the ruler we deserve.
---
Your reasoning behind multiboxing doesn't make any sense. 
---
&gt;there's no way to earn a Token with gathering professions in a decent amount of time if you're just a regular player with one account.
---
If you want to pay for every account with WoW gold. Then you aren't going to make gold faster by having multiple accounts herbing the same herbs. It's going to take you the same amount of farming to pay for your accounts.
---
Lemme call my guy whos an expert on signatures. Do you mind waiting in the shop while I give him a call?
---
There were way too many abilities for my taste. Particularly in PvP. Button bloat was at its height.
---
Hahaha that's true. We did lots of other stupid shit.
---
How would it not?  Leeway is for moving players hitting moving players as far as I'm aware, not mobs hitting players.
---
No just very over weight unwashed adults and children.
---
I still cringe when I see a panda running past me.  At least no one seems to play them so I forget they exist in wow.
---
I would be fine with that, obviously
---
Generally I like selling at main cities, with rep u get more money and things become cheaper.
---
Have the names ready in a notepad .txt and copy and paste them.
---
As someone who doesn‚Äôt know the farms but have seen them discussed, what impact does it have? You have to run out instead? So cuts into farming time?
---
Agreed. Such as the fact that all of those logs are tainted by inaccurate data
---
Honestly, I think it is really unclear at this time. 
---
It would make a lot of sense for people on pve servers to go to the dedicated pvp areas (the plaguelands towers, which from what I have heard here, will be in on launch). That's my ideal server: where pvp is opt in, but still open world. Ideally, you would not get ganked while trying to kill mobs, but rather, would get opened on from stealth while at full health, and trying to fish/mine/herb a node. 
---
but from what I have heard, there is also no precedent for them actually being used, because world pvp was already dead by the time they came out.
---
I really wish that there was a hybrid server, where say, ashenvale and wetlands were not contested, but say, 5-6 level 55+ zones were. So if you want to hit 60 and grind dungeons for prebis? you can. but if you want to farm devilsaur leather while also fighting the opposing faction? you can do that too (well, probably not devilsaur leather due to the whole chinese gold farmer problem, but you get the idea. Fish in azshara?  Sure, but you also get to pvp while doing it. 
---
I honestly don't even know what I am going to roll yet. I really like the idea of learning to pvp in super unorganized pvp where I can still be a bit useful (rather than going into a bg and getting wrecked by premades). But... I don't see any value for me in ashenvale being a contested zone. I am never going to be the level 60 ganking level 30 hordies.  I am also not likely to get any meaningful pvp experiences as a level 25 warrior in ashenvale. 
---
Especially once trees block LOS, because that's the only way I get even remotely fair fights on private servers. I see no way I should ever beat a mage at level 25. They are faster than me with blink. They can reset any fight I am winning with polymorph, and if I can't hide behind trees while I clear snares, I see no way any warrior should ever even get to run away, let alone fight a mage.
---
I don't think you should let that stuff scare you away.  Frankly I did play in Vanilla but was younger and played very casually, never even got to 60.  I had so much fun, did mostly pvping and at one point was a pretty well geared level 49 focusing on BGS and PVP.  I think you should just pick whatever class you think has the coolest vibe, whatever you enjoy playing most, and just enjoy the process!  There will be plenty of other people leveling at whatever pace you're at, that will also need help doing quests or dungeons.  Plus, from what we've seen so far in the beta, even people that didn't like the idea of classic are LOVING it.  The pace is better, fights are more interesting, the zones feel a lot more lively and scary (in a cool way).  I hope you are able to just have an amazing experience leveling and making friends as you play.  It's an amazing game and I think you'll love it!
---
how about some more awkward crotch zooms?
---
I feel like showing action bars goes completely against a minimalist UI.
---
Just get an addon to show cooldowns, it'll take up less space than showing action bars, its not like you should need to see your keybinds or something.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if this is due to the release of 8.2 
---
As much as Classic is a 'new' game for them that they wanna hype up, it's also a competitor (at least in terms of time spent) to Retail.
---
A beta expansion last week/this week, or an increase in level cap to 50, would pull some people away from their shiny new retail patch.
---
I too am finding random things to occupy my time until classic wow drops
---
I'm well aware, I'm not talking about the specifics of the lore, yes BC had issues (even vanilla retconned some, it just happens).  I just mean from a narrative perspective: Illidan and Arthas were main established villains, so working towards stopping them felt significant.
---
Deathwing felt like a contrived way to add more content.  I know technically he already existed, but he wasn't an active threat and was not on anyone's radar so him just "appearing" feels forced.
---
I don‚Äôt, I‚Äôm only on the second book haha.
---
I guess that's fair enough.
---
This is overthinking it. You really dont come across that much ore, each vein is quite rare. So that's 2 spaces for ore and stone, 3 or 4 spaces for skinning. You're trading off 6 bag spaces to guarantee your mount at 40, it's a good strategy.
---
yup. It's so bad I had to search "CSS" on this subreddit. Now I've turned it off (only realized it was the culprit a week or two ago, I don't browse here that often). I can have 8gb of ram free and this subreddit will bring my browser to a crawl.
---
If the mage is retarded.  You literally don't have a slow as paladin so you are saying you have 80% you are equal speed with a mage and 20% of being their bitch, so net you lose.  
---
I literally never lost a 1v1 at 60 on mage to a paladin, even at times being at a gear disadvantage.  I frequently killed mages as a paladin, but all of them made clear mistakes or some circumstance like terrain or CDs were heavily out of their favor.  
---
Only with extreme engineering can a paladin close the distance, but a frost or elemental mage can block any such shenanigans.
---
agreed, and less waste.
---
&gt; Priest will even be faster than most mages, since AOE grinding will be fairly difficult with everyone sharing spawns early on.
---
I mained as a mage and I remember AOE grinding basically being a meme in vanilla. AOE grinding was fun to do but it was actually slower than questing due to the difficulty involved.  AOE grinding only worked if all the mobs were melee, spawned close to each other, had a fast respawn rate, there was no one else in the area killing mobs, and you never fucked up. Fucking up almost always ends up in death, which causes you to waste precious time corpse running or repairing your gear. I remember trying AOE grinding in vanilla and white it was pretty cool when you actually pulled it off, it was a really frustrating way to level. I only AOE'd mobs when I felt like fucking around, really.
---
AOE grinding should really be called AOE farming, imo.... It was a really shit way to level and only useful if you were trying to farm mobs.
---
Yes it ticks when you're full
---
No have not given it a go and don't plan to as I do understand what is needed to be done
---
Oh man, the boat to Northrend was packed when Wrath came out. Crazy coincidence: I unknowingly met my best future raider while waiting on the dock in Menethil. We didn‚Äôt discover that until a couple years later when I was going through screenshots and there we both were, in /say about how I was playing at Dunkin Donuts ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I mean, sure, but there's no reason why Chen and some Easter eggs got a full xpac. I'm still salty about how the nerubians got dicked hard
---
I like these type arguments as if any classic rotation is somehow vastly more interesting.
---
Spoiler they aren't.  Stop being a douche.
---
No it's mobs too.
---
I also really liked Towellies bio. Full of buzzwords and just big words without explaining what exactly he stands for. Reminds me a bit of Trump tbh. Just picture him saying that:
---
&gt;Towelliees Gaming in today's day represents more then just WoW, or tanking. I represent a community of gamers. Gamers who want to see raw action. Gamers who want to hear what others are afraid to say. Gamers who want to know the truth. I have made Gaming my career. I am my own person. I am my own boss. I will stay true to my fans and to the community that I represent. That aside. Yes I am a tank in WoW and in any other game I encounter. I have been tanking on a progression level of WoW for about 11 years now and loving every second of it. I strive to be the best at what I do. I am currently on Stormrage on my main Towelliee with the amazing guild Death Jesters on the Alliance side
---
Whenever I see the matlab plots, I know I'm dealing with a professional.
---
What‚Äôs different this time? There are no more good Horde characters lmaoo
---
I'm going mage, it fits my personality (which better than everyone else's).
---
Hey, it's going to be safed for like 60 days when you delete your character. So go ahead &amp; quickly create and take your time on release day.
---
They are excellent. I've only read a few myself but the lore in them is amazing. I LOVED the Illidan book. Shows you really how much of a dickhead he is.
---
This has to be a troll, surely?
---
Wasnt there a pulsing totem that could snap rogues out of stealth?  I have vague memories of dropping that out of habit
---
Basically yes, camp won't reset your position.  On DME farms you jump down the ledge, so practically it's not really possible to run back.  You would have to suicide and take a run back each time.  Cuts into profit in both time and repair costs.
---
Thanks so much for all this information. I love being a holy priest. This makes my heart happy.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/K9xzRGZ](https://imgur.com/a/K9xzRGZ) that's what it usually looks like, but I forgot to turn of DPS meter - which I was just using to test rotations and specs.
---
It's just one addon, Dominos I think
---
That whole manual was put together by Chris Metzen, both the lore and the art. Well done, Thundergod.
---
Yeah I'd let a paladin wear it no problem. Will be interesting to see if FR will become relevant again. On private servers only the tank needs it, but everyone wore it during vanilla, so maybe private servers are wrong, although the damage values seem correct.
---
It's not a meme, it just needs a lot more deliberate consideration than most people really thought to put into it.  You have to pick the right spawns at the right times, and even one extra person in the area is going to basically nullify the entire thing.
---
It is faster, fastest even, if done correctly.
---
Hunter makes best. Movement speed and any weapon.
---
I purchased BC with the money earned at my first job. Only worked at that job long enough to buy BC and game time for like a year
---
Good to know.
---
Retail = current wow.
---
Classic = vanilla.
---
PPM = procs per minute.
---
Windfury = shaman weapon enhancement that on the shamans weapon has a chance of swinging your weapon twice more instantly, as a totem it allows your party the chance to swing their weapon once more.
---
ICD is internal cooldown.  As in certain procs have internal cooldown so that they cannot proc an unlimited number of times if you somehow have absurdly good luck.  The proc must wait till ICD is over (5seconds 10seconds 30seconds or w/e) to then proc on chance.
---
These enchants are weapon enhancements that have a certain number of procs per minute instead of being based on an internal cooldown.
---
Crusader is a weapon enchant that has a %chance to proc on weapon swing that deals holy damage and heals you.
---
Lifestealing is a weapon enchant that has %chance to deal shadow damage and heal you for that amount.
---
Fiery is a weapon enchant that has a %chance to deal fire damage.
---
Seal of command doesn't exist because you're playing Horde so fuck pallys.
---
A 2% chance for an extra swing on every swing is much better than a 1% chance to hit, especially since your yellow attacks will already be hit-capped.
---
It's worth 2 level 20 talent points versus 1 level 5 talent point.
---
I feel like the transition is a bit too clear and the source material is just too short to be super suited to this sort of compilation. The transitions are not jarring, but VERY noticeable, and as a result, I think I prefer the versions where the other night elf music is also used for variety.
---
I feel the other guy in this thread is being a bit harsh though, by searching youtube for "wow+ moonfall", I didn't find anything that was the same, and so I think it likely that SOMEONE with a username including the word faraz probably made this. Is it you? I would say at least 60% likely.
---
I like physical copies because then I dont have to rely on some content distribution network to deliver me my game. Same reason I still buy physical copies of movies.
---
tl;dr?
---
This is what i'm using ATM. It honestly seems cleaner than that - and would have been possible in Vanilla cause its 1 addon. Too many spells to remember - especially as a Mage.

My bank alts are level 1. I aint got the time to level a bank alt. That alt is gonna park his has right there in front of the mailbox in stormwind and his only job is to run between the bank, mailbox, and auction house.
---
Not really.  You just jumped into a thread about an RPG UI design and replied to someone who loves RPG UI.  And started spewing your setup.
---
Lol.
---
It's way out of place in this thread and as a response to that comment.  It was just like you were desperate to talk about your setup and no one here was interested but you dumped it anyways.

Druid would be a bit worse (probably 15-20%) at the start, but would be much worse 40+ when warrior gets WW/SS etc. Could be doing double a druid‚Äôs dps.

Going to roll a female priest night elf. I will dance for those willing to pay my steep but yet fair prices to watch me dance.

I really loved the first two midnight releases for expansions. They both came out in the winter so it was cold as fuck by the time midnight came around. Just getting to meet everyone else who shared your love for the game and talk about all the cool shit you were going to do in the expansion all while sharing in the misery of being cold made for great times.
---
If the prof isn't a gathering profession then there is no reason to level the alt. It just needs money.
---
Tl;dr: Gul‚Äôdan is metal AF.
---
Would highly recommend.
---
Its okay, I had an early life crisis (I'm 29) in the form of buying a 20 thousand dollar truck after being so happy for 2 years not having a car payment and thinking I was finally being financially responsible.
---
I can afford it, it was just an impulse buy.  I can justify needing a truck for all the shit I haul for work, but there was nothing wrong with my old vehicle and I was making it work for the hauling of stuff, it just wasn't ideal, but I had it paid off so having a new car payment kinda sucks.
---
On top of that early life crisis, I get to become a total recluse again come August?  Don't tell my wife.

Just take the boat to me within then swim north and die in the water northwest of Ironforge. You‚Äôll spirit res at Kharanos

---
Imagine liking memes this much.
---
Might be a stupid question but how do greater blessings work exactly? If I buff say a Warrior with greater might, does EVERY other Warrior also get greater might? Or would it just be all the Warriors in the same group as the Warrior that was buffed? Either way, does this mean more time is spent actually healing because the greater blessings lasted 15 minutes? I‚Äôm still on the fence about Paladin and I‚Äôm ok with healing but the constant buffing was driving me away.
---
its not that a memespec being in the raid is the actual problem.
---
The problem is the raid mentality that ALLOWS a memespec raider ie: one special snowflake shaman gets to have fun, and the ones that respec resto to progress dont feel fairly treated.
---
This type of "favoritism" ends up creating a toxic environment
---
Yeah thats not bad at all.
---
The only thing that bugs me is I've never been able to find a map addon I don't hate (hence using the script to hide the default map back in the day).
---
A book as physically big as the wow diary needs a kindle edition.  Shits too big to take anywhere with you.
---
To train artisan requires level 35
---
That's what I don't get, how is he able to pull such crazy DPS on the beta if ret paladins are so bad? Like he's always top in every group.
---
Have you heard of the definition of insanity?
---
Yeah I had heard of that. I think that 'works' for all bosses that have that mechanic except 4 horsemen lol... unless you run out of bubbles I guess
---
I mean, obviously a properly run loot council is optimal for the progression of the guild. But many people have motives above the good of the guild. These systems allow people to make their own optimal decisions, and build incentive structures that hopefully help the guild.
---
It will be. I will probably spend the majority of my time on twinks as it allows me to play the most amount of classes in a competitive PvP environment, and I hate raiding. I know others think the same as me, and people are more knowledgeable now on BiS, etc.
---
Be a fun time to twink on Classic!
---
No but there are repetable quests for rep etc
---
With blacksmithing in reality you'll only be making sharpening stones, which you can buy from people cheaply anyway.
---
If not mining/eng, then herb/alch is pretty underrated, as making your own raid consumes can often be more convenient than buying them, especially if you can get recipes for greater protection pots (and if you're really lucky/dedicated then titans).
---
*Ymmv*. 
---
Silenced?
---
Why show the bag icons at all?
---
Earliest = TLC.  Check yourself bruh
---
Engineering gadgets aren't worth the effort pre 60.  It will hugely hamper your gold gains.
---
Getting lvl 40 mount and Epic Mount via skinning gold is far more important.  Then get your engineering leveled up to become competitive in pvp.
---
Herbs engineering is the best endgame combination for melee.  Herbs make more money than mining, you will need a ton of pots.  Other guildees will craft pots and enchant for you.
---
Compared to other classes Hunter is definitely more interesting / complex once you add proper pet management and melee weaving to the already engaging (again compared to others) playstyle in raids.
---
Ad a healer main I do not look forward to playing on a PvP server.
---
EpGp and DKP can be manipulated by officers. Iv been in top guilds on servers before iv seen it happen. Its one of the hardest things about raiding, finding a guild you like the loot system for and trust them. You never know what guilds intentions are.
---
did it? Guess I forgot
---
rofl this must be a meme
---
Do EVERY darn rep quest at the lowest practicable level. You won't get it at 40, but it'll save you having to do a ton of hand-ins later on!
---
Once upon a time in Vanilla I had a full T2 set on my resto shaman.  Took many, many BWL runs to get it all.  I never took a screenshot of it but noobs in Org were salivating over it, asking me how long it took to get it, and generally treating me like I was some kind of godly player.  Good times...good times.

---
I absolutely love this! Would be fantastic if someone could write a similar one for Rogue!!
---
I thought not. It's not a story the Titans would tell you. It's a Legion Legend. Lord Sargeras was a Gigantic Lord, so swoll and so swole and so wise he could use the Fel to influence the magics to create demons. He had such a knowledge of the Fel that he could even keep those useful to him from dying. The dark side of the Fel is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful, the only thing he was afraid was was losing is power, which eventually, or course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught the warlock class everything he knew, then the warlock class (and Illidan) killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death but not himself.
---
This looks awesome!
---
yup, its why *most* people make hunters as an alt because they are the fastest to 35 for profs
---
I own the domain [https://classic.wiki](https://classic.wiki) if there is anybody out there who enjoys working on wikis and wants to help run it. Fandom is really going to shit and I'd like to have a place where we can have a real wiki for knowledge.

I haven't been keeping up with BFA lore. What happens at the end of 8.2? I haven't played since 8.0.
---
Should we tell him?
---
You can buy items your own character listed, I played on a PvE server in Vanilla and used the goblin AH to transfer gold to my shaman twink from my alliance main.
---
I'll use the cross faction AH to get the other factions cooking recipes because I want to get all of the cooking recipes available in game. I had them in Vanilla as well, I really loved collecting cooking recipes.
---
Can confirm, looked at the bottom of the page
---
Chill dude. Have a snickers.
---
It‚Äôs a good site man, nice work.

When I click on a talent or piece of gear and it takes me to a separate page view, I can‚Äôt go back to where I was when using the Reddit app, it takes me back to these comments and I have to reopen the site again.
---
Also, I notice people are chucking up leveling gear as well. I don‚Äôt suppose creating areas for twinking is possible?
---
Source?
---
Or I guess no one has made twink builds yet haha
---
 Norvegia. Cheeseless chees that doesn‚Äôt taste cheese. Jarlsberg yooooo!!!!
---
Goat people would have been really fun as Horde. I would assume that Draenei and Trall's Horde should have gotten along better considering their mutual hated and enslavement by the Legion.
---
Vanilla is unbalaced as fuck.
---
Didn't Every Man For Himself get added in a later expansion?
---
[audio source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-87JIFGEa4s)
---
All warriors in the raid would receive the same buff, 95% of the time that works perfectly, exception would be like salv on fury warriors and obviously not wanting it on the tank so you would need to overwrite you 15min salv on the tank with a different 5min blessing.  
---
With 15 minute buffs between a few and none need to be cast in the middle of most fights.  You are a full time healer/dispeller in pve as paladin.
---
Felcloth farm in felwood. You‚Äôll have no problem stealing tags from people with moonfire. This used to drive me fucking nuts!
---
Any spec priest can heal all 5mans perfectly well, and it should go without saying that a holy spec priest can. Make friends with a good tank or two and you'll always be able to find an instance to run.
---
In wpvp though yeah sorry you're going to have a rough time while solo unless you're shadow spec and even then a lot of the time.
---
As a new classic druid, can you elaborate? I was a priest back then and like 12 lol
---
Most of the gear is just a mix of tier pieces and other shaman-only items like Deep Earth Spaulders and Malistar's Defender. You won't want to wear cloth in PvP, except maybe wrists/belt. For the most part, the gear you want for PvP is stuff you can get just fine raiding as resto. You should ignore the BiS lists that have been floating around lately where the elemental shaman gear is hilariously wrong and basically just a copy of the mage BiS.
---
As far as I'm aware. Warlock and hunter pets have terrible pathing problems, fail to switch targets, return to the player after killing their previous target - even if they've been assigned to attack a new target - and warlock pets occasionally unlearn all their grimoires.
---
Imagine having a piece of video gaming history just folded up rotting in a drawer.
---
If you think that Jack Black's cartoon character was a main protagonist, you don't really know what went down with MoP. That expansion got dark super fast.
---
I highly agree with this. I would also look up an engineering guide for the fewest mats required to get to 300, and only save those mats. Skinning is just for vendoring until you get to like thick leather (maybe not even then, if the server is still new), and you can still make some decent cash with mining after you've acquired the min mats for engineering. Getting the mount in the 40-43 range drastically increases your leveling speed. Also remember time is valuable too, and extra time spent leveling engineering below 60 is probably better spent leveling up.
---
Eh? We had a rank 14 pally who was a hardcore raider as well. He was on 20hrs a day pretty much but he did it all
---
If you're ganking someone, you should get the jump on them and make the engineering stuff of limited value anyway. Wpvp... Well kinda the same imo, unless you're doing organized raids on somewhere. Imo I wouldnt spec engineering until I was ready to have my entire focus be pvp (for me, 60)
---
So I want someone to review my plan for Classic:
---
- Undead Warlock
---
- Professions: Herbalism, Alchemy 
---
- Goals: Weekly raiding at 60. 
---
What do y‚Äôall think about a spec? 
---
I don‚Äôt remember much about the differences between the three in classic. Which one is for raiding and which one is generally good for leveling to 60?
---
Warlocks have consistently gotten the coolest shit but they rarely are top tier dps and when they are they're usually too strong and get needed into the ground and they get cool shit taken away (looking at you, MoP).
---
Big margin for error, means it is easy to mess up.
---
Base HP, iirc, but it was made irrelevant by gear sooner or later.
---
I agree completely but unfortunately most people can't just leave their job because the other options are just as bad or worse in a big way (scheduling, pay, etc). It's depressing!
---
Isnt a name locked for some time after the toon gets deleted? Meaning only you can use it? Or was that added later?
---
Does Warcraft 1 have a manual like this one?
---
Depends on what your playstyle is really. If PvE is your focus: rsham is probably the best raid healer (chain heal lol) and priest can do both raid heal and tank heal. If pvp, priest is an offensive healer in terms of purging enemies, mana burn, fears, etc. while shaman is offensive because of their crazy burst damage in between heals, utility with totems, and also purges. If you want to dabble in both, priests 21/30/0 can do both very well so you don‚Äôt have to respec while shamans 30/0/21 is the preferred pvp spec but 0/5/46 is pve, so you might have to re spec a lot.
---
I think that's a good think. It would make ganking so much worse.
---
There was tier 7 and tier 7.5. Think one was from 10 man and other from 25 which looked exactly the same except color.
---
Not to my hand right now. That's what I found out about 2 years ago when I wanted to safe a name. Maybe I can find it. I'll edit it in.
---
Warriors getting rank 14 is important, paladins not so much.
---
Rank 14 gives warriors massive damage increase, for paladins the healing mace is really good but it's not exactly as important as warriors getting a damage boost.
---
That's the thing that's sad about MoP - it actually had an interesting dark horror underlying story trapped within it that didn't get to properly shine. The idea of a cultural/society that had to repress its own feelings because they manifest into fiends of darkness, that said people turned to booze and to pushing down one's emotions, is super compelling. Too bad the greater share of the expansion's quest experience was dedicated to fighting giant rats for their carrots, getting hammered by beer elementals, or getting involved in a civil war between monkeys and fish. 
---
If MoP was a dark gothic setting the Sha could be been very interesting, but they were wasted being in MoP. It's really sad too because the Y'shaarj stuff is the most interesting iteration of the Old God stuff, all the other Old Gods are generically "spooky faceless cthulu mindflayer" monsters but Y'shaarj embraced actual Lovecraftian values - you can't kill what is already dead, his death echoes across eons and scars the "psychic plane" in a sense.
---
DM actually stands for directessage. He clearly is trying to scam people.
---
You won't be getting the WW axe if your group is instance grinding unless the Warrior spends time outside of the group farming up the required items.
---
Absolute best expansion, the only thing I'd change would be a toggle to go back to Old Vale, before the corruption destroyed the beautiful landscape
---
My biggest concern is picking a server that eventually sways into the favor of one faction. I don't want to be playing Alliance and then come to find out oops I picked the "Horde" PvP server. Hopefully they stay relatively balanced or else I'll just be transferring servers I guess.
---
Ok good to know
---
Do you think you could provide a link of a list that is more accurate?
---
Anyone got a pic of all the gear on at once?
---
It's hard to explain since english is not my mother language, but I will try :
---
Multiboxers make their profits by abusing 2 mechanics :
---
1 - When a node is harvested by a player, it will not disappear right away. Others players got \~ 30 seconds to loot it before it despawns. 
---
2 - There is multiple versions of the same node across the regions, and you access them by abusing the phasing mechanic through the custom LFR.
---
So if you have 5 accounts and got access to let's say 4 different phases, you will be able to loot the same node 5x4 = 20 times
---
Yeh man, made friends, got to nerd out hard about the game and our plans. See people who were way more hardcore than you. Good times.
---
Do you have a recommended source for those podcasts?
---
So there's no point in starting to level there from level 1 onwards ? Orange, yellow and green quwstnames give the same rep?
---
Would probably be better off skipping the Whirlwind quest if you plan on leveling in dungeons. It would require hours of farming highly contested mobs.
---
Oh boy, can't wait to make my Pandaren Death Knight on Classic!
---
I mained a warrior in vanilla. It's a goddam grind. I'd say don't do it first. Unless you like grinding dungeons out. Then it's super easy to get groups if you tank.
---
Not everyone cares about being in the "best guilds". Raids in classic have enough leeway that an average guild can clear them.
---
No, it effects mobs as well, there range is much longer then on private servers when you are moving.
---
didn't realize pirated servers were old school....
---
I know what you mean. Might not even know until release day but I‚Äôm leaning lock or mage... I also get what you mean about low lvl PvP against a good mage. You gotta play perfectly and hope you out gear them for a bit of an edge. On top of that, you gotta have grenades, it‚Äôs probably a must, as well as free action potion (which is unreasonable to have on you at all times, to start at least). Also being a gnome would obviously be helpful but those lvl 1 frost bolts are killer to counter escape artist. Trinket frost nova when close too and hope you can get a pummel in there. It‚Äôs basically gg if you can manage a pummel with blink still on cd. Healing pots help to get that extra bit of hope while they run oom but they could use mana pots to counter too or just poly you. It‚Äôs tough, you basically have to take full advantage when you‚Äôre close to them, no fuck ups and rely on getting lucky crits on their squishy bodies.
---
Not really sure about the best spec. Bleeds vs having piercing howl. Almost makes me wanna roll a warrior and try to perfect it.
---
What do u think about this? https://youtu.be/FDTymYK2wDU
---
Just want to say i love you : )
---
Level a mage.
---
When they pruned abilities (due to the MoP button bloat), they should have just given the game a quick haircut - not completely decapitate the poor bastard.
---
Depends on how many engineering items you plan on using.
---
Couldn't tell which town this was, but also could.
---
I‚Äôve always thought they would just go with vanilla server names. But now that you mention it, dungeon names would be kinda cool, except probably not enough
---
Man fuck sargeras! An absolute believer of the "cant beat em join em" what a min/maxing pwussy boi
---
As an EvE player... what's a good price so people take the bait?
---
I also play on potentially playing the double game.
---
I mean you should always strip before you suicide to save the repair bill. The walk from the graveyard is several minutes though. I remember it being a pain.
---
I'm not actually sure it adds enough time to make you take longer to do the number of resets you get per hour, but I could be wrong there. Because of that reset limit, the walk back isn't that impactful. For priests, DME lasher farming is still more efficient than righteous orb farming or any other method I know of, even without /camp. I could be wrong. I haven't actually tried anything else that was better.
---
My second toon was a gnome lock. I only found out that all the cities had different AHs (so essentially one because no one would use the less popular ones) a day or two ago here lol. 
---
Considering how much time I spent in the AH, buying bulk mats from farmers, LFG this blows my mind.
---
PvP Realm (1)*
---
RP-PvP Realm (1)*
---
PvE Realm (1)*
---
That's not the OP racial.
---
Iirc they said they would not be reusing realm names
---
There's a Hercules RP video that's pretty good.  That song may be in there somewhere.
---
Absolutely worth a watch either way.

This will sound like blasphemy, but plus healing isn't as important as it seems. Good mana base and rationing is far more important. You see plus healing is just a chance ie +22 means 1-22 evrry heal so its not as good as it seems on paper. So having less of it but better int plate for spell crit or mana can be better. Just a quick two sense, typing on my phone and not enough time to give a complete answer, hopefully someone can fill in where I leave off.
---
Understandably, I was aware of that too. Was the best I was able to do after a few attempts. 
---
There is nothing like it. Yeah dude, that's me.
---
Doesn't mean anything IMO.
---
Not our place to say they should or shouldn't invite anyone, Blizz's testing needs are unknown to us.
---

---
You lost me at the whole ‚Äúwait for it to update‚Äù part. 
---
I enjoyed buying PC and console games at midnight releases, especially since I lived in a small town. The only GameStop that even did midnight releases was 30 minutes away. 
---
But waiting for updates...? That was the worst lol. It was fun until you read through the manual 5 times and saw that you still had to wait 2 hours.
---
ohhh
---
been in beta since near the start, havent played it in a while, went back to pservers. they should def invite way more people, the worlds dead and not much is getting done
---
This is exactly what I'm seeing then. I've been experimenting with some mage/shaman aoe.
---
maybe ask your family not to come to gamestop with you next time?
---
What are you talking about? You didn't like gearing up your alts in LFR Siege of Orgrimmar, followed by Flex Siege of Orgrimmar, then hop on your main to clear Normal Siege of Orgrimmar and then jump into progression on Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar?
---
Flex raiding was awesome - it should have just been combined with normal/heroic (whatever the fuck its called now), Mythic should remain for the more hardcore players. LFR needs to be purged in righteous hellfire.
---
You can hold 100 ammo per bag box.  so if you have a bag with 16 space thats 1600 ammo.  I played a hunter and progressed with one back in vanilla wow before TBC and only time I ever ran out of ammo was aq40 towards the end if I didnt prepare for it.
---
I tried as high as 10g... you get the most bites around the 1-4g range. Its about volume really. I stopped doing it when Blizzard threatened to ban people for it lol
---
Frost is your survivability spec, fire for burst, and Arcane for teh lulz.
---
Honestly I wouldn't even write any of that for normal suboptimal specs, it's just this jpg "guide" is so ludicrous it might as well be trolling.
---
If someone doesn't want to heal as shaman, and has a friendly raid... just get good melee gear and raid as enhance. farming mana gear so you can auto-attack then demand a raidspot is just offensive.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rttXIFcLv2o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rttXIFcLv2o)
---
But that probably suits them, they don't want to make people working on retail at blizzard feel like they have to compete with a previous version of the game that would have more viewers on twitch and servers full of active players.   
---
If they were to mass invite people, you can be sure 1: people who were on the beta might come again seeing that there is more activity, 2: some people are interesting in playing the beta non stop no matter the lvl cap 3: some people obsessed with finding bugs.
---
I might do something where I list something like Small Radiant shards on the AH and in the WTB channel I would request the same item for an exorbitant payment and see if people take the bait.
---
You could tank a lot of them but the issue there is that you are going to be blowing a lot of gold on respeccing.
---
The meta goes deep.
---
They don't want more people getting burnt out before it's released again.
---
Imo this is the best answer. You can also do righteous orb runs or princess in mara, but neither of those are as fun as BRD stealth runs.  With a rogue you should be able to do almost all of the bosses. You can also do stealth runs in LBRS and DM when it comes out. Lots of fun to be had.
---
&gt; 3: some people obsessed with finding bugs.
---
is a good thing.
---
Hey man, I plan on maining Warlock. I love bringing support while bot being pigeonholed into healing. I personally like the thematics.
---
In raids, at least, my rotation will be...
---
Hit shadowbolt.
---
If you are looking for a fairly intensive rotation, play feral dps. You likely won't top, but neither do warlocks for a long ass while. However, there's a lot of resource management and a higher skill floor for dps. It takes some ingenuity, and a healthy dose of cheese, but seems so fun.
---
Fair, I was leveling druids, so I had no reason to kite and never noticed.

Yep, this is the most detailed video in existence.  I just wish it was in HD.
---
They grow underground in fields and last a long time. During the Depression when men would travel around to find work they would tie an onion to their belt so that they would have something to eat should the journey be long. They could find them in fields even after they had been dug up, so the food source was generally available for the walking man.
---
I don't tie an onion to my belt because we live in a land where we can acquire food in many places and we have food that is so well preserved that we don't have to carry stuff like this anymore. And besides, most of us don't go wandering the countryside looking for odd jobs, thank goodness.
---
Blizzard killed it by leaving it capped at level 40.
---
I ate mages for lunch back in vanilla, just got to know how to fight them and don't let them catch you flat footed.  Same with rogues. Hunters were more of a hard counter to mages than rogues back then. Regardless of what these private server kids tell you today. Most of the hunters now really dont know how to use them, and I'm mainly talking about the private server hunters. You chew them up easy with your bow.  They dont have all the counters like they do now.  I remember watching them ice block only to die moments later countless times.
---
It will be dead. No changes doesn't have a very big fan base. 
---
Some classes need balance changes, and there are quite a few QOL changes that are needed.
---
Sadly the No changes people are going to whine till they get their way and Classic will be ruined because of it.
---
I thought it was more to give a nod to the amount of Asian players in the game at the time.
---
Yea, it‚Äôs been in the game since tbc.
---
I say make sure you are in a guild that will assist with dickheads. Getting camped? -call for backup, and help the lower level members just the same.
---
Also, don't forget the world is big.  If you're solo, with no friends readily available to help you out you can always farm, grind, or quest in another area. There will almost always be one or two more options for your level.
---
God that music in the video is awful and annoying. But I guess that‚Äôs par for the course.
---
We don't know yet, it will depend on how different things are from pservers.
---
&gt; Some classes need balance changes, and there are quite a few QOL changes that are needed.
---
This defeats the purpose of a classic server. Some QOL changes would be okay but classes don't need to be touch.
---
They will fix it.  Would suck just to level a hunter just to use the class to tranq a boss.
---
Not even a good try
---
Sorry bud, but that‚Äôs incorrect. Margin of error is, ‚Äúan amount (usually small) that is allowed for in case of miscalculation or change of circumstances.‚Äù The smaller the margin of error, the less deviance from perfect play is allowed. Therefore big margin of error === easier to succeed.
---
As a pure physical DPS enhancement Shaman on pserver, I approve, however pure physical gear instead of hybrid gear does more DPS if you can afford to have Flask of Distilled Wisdom every raid. You can get 9% hit pretty easily but it's important to hit that crit soft cap for Enhancement which is 33% (without totems). That way Flurry will be up nearly 100% of the time. Fully buffed, my shaman has around 48% crit chance, and does around 650 to 850 DPS on long fights. I remember once I windfury'd Patchwerk 3 times in a row, and I came super close to pulling off the tank and potentially wiping the raid lol. Oops, well that's RNG for ya.
---
I'm playing 8.2 instead of the beta.
---
Plus someone has to read all those bug reports. Having 10,000 people report the same bug instead of 5 doesn't necessarily help them.
---
My case is made. Thank you for your contribution.
---
On top of what others have said about aoe, it's also by far the spec most fit for survival/tankiest spec -- final talent is ice barrier which is absolutely pog and then you get ice block and cold snap a bit earlier in the tree.
---
Really great talents for leveling especially on a PvP server 
---
If I were playing a pve server id consider going fire cuz it can also do solid aoe, but you don't get that imp blizzard talent
---
Hogger RP-PvP  :(
---
What you mean the 100's of "layering sux my dick blizz, fuck you" reports aren't helpful?
---
Thanks for sharing a video from November last year.
---
having emotions. beta as FAK BOY
---
This is a sound plan. 
---
The one thing you might want to do is keep skinning till 60 and get some devilsaur leather for yourself to have a lw make you the set, but you may be better off just buying those pieces and having engineering earlier. It will help you out in the wPvP while leveling in tanaris lol.
---
Every time i pass by Jersey mikes, which used to be a gamestop, i think of standing in the line wrapping around the building for BC. Everyone in line just talking about wow and the new expansion, good times.
---
Yeah, I never said we couldnt have our own opinions. Opinions can be discussed, which is what we were doing. If you don't want to discuss anymore that's fine.
---
Kill times and consumables? World buffs? What talent builds used? What was the raid comp?  This list is provides no meaningful information, because no context is given.
---
Dont worry too much about raid viability class wise. Even if you main one spec, every class can go as SOMETHING to a raid, and theres a LOT to do besides raiding. Even if you can't raid as feral dps, you can simply raid as heals and then respec and go for dps for dungeons/world pvp/batttlegrounds.
---
I have it and I didn't think it was worth the read. It's pretty amateurish writing IMO.
---
It sure does, from the perspective of Mr. Ashkandi himself. 
---
I am Sir Lothar, Armsman to the Brotherhood of the Horse, and a warrior in the King's service. I feel it necessary to inform you of the events that have led us to this time of conflict. The tale of our battle with the Orcs begins some forty years in the past. I tell you of these things so that you might glean some understanding of our plight, and gain insight into our enemy. As a student of history and battle, I have found that only through understanding the past can we make well-thought decisions for the future.

All has been peaceful for many generations, and the reign of King Wrynn III is a prosperous one. The constant bickering and infighting that marred the rules of former Kings has no place in the court of Wrynn. The child sorcerer Medivh is born of a coupling between the court Conjurer and a mysterious traveler. After the child is born, the woman disappears, and the baby is taken into the court as a ward of the kingdom.
---
564
---
The child prince Llane is born to King Wrynn and Lady Varia. This is their first and only offspring, but the birth of a son marks the continuation of their line. It is a grand day in the Kingdom that is celebrated by great feasts and tournaments. King Wrynn proclaims the day to be a time for festival for the duration of his rule, and to mark the occasion, gives each citizen of Azeroth one gold sovereign.
---
571
---
The marking of the Age of Ascension from childhood to adulthood is one of great anticipation for both parent and youth. Medivh attains that time and is expected to be given the title as Apprentice Conjurer to the Court. On the eve of this occasion, the boy's sleep is troubled by dark dreams of figures giving chase through deep chasms. Waking in a cold sweat, Medivh makes his way to the bedchamber of his father. As the Conjurer reaches out to touch his fevered brow, a burning fire ignites in the child's eyes. This backlash of power must have reached as far as Northshire Abbey, for within the hour over one hundred clerics arrived at the castle.
---
Only by combining their abilities with the powers of the Conjurer were one hundred enough to contain Medivh. As magiks unimagined poured forth from him, the boy screamed in unholy pain at the energies that were channeling through him. Hours passed, perhaps even days, for time seemed to stand still as the onslaught grew in fury.
---
Then, as simply as one snuffs a candle, both father and son crumpled into a heap. The Conjurer lay dead, drained of all life, and Medivh fell into a deep sleep - his heart barely beating, and only the faintest of breath escaping his lips. After long discussion, the King and the Abbot of Northshire agree that Medivh should be taken to the Abbey for the safety of both child and kingdom.
---
577
---
Llane reaches his Age of Ascension, and the full station of Prince of Azeroth is bestowed upon him. At this ceremony, tens of thousands of devoted subjects come to offer their wishes of support and long life. During the evening feast with family, and those close to the crown, a cold wind began to chill the air. A gentle breeze at first, it grew in intensity, until the doors to the great hall were blown off of their hinges. As the guests leaned into the wind, a figure entered, riding the winds like some great bird of prey.
---
The torches set about the great hall ignited with blue flame and the visage of Medivh was revealed. As he set down in front of the King's table, the guard sprang to their feet. A mere pass of his hand kept them motionless - frozen in their places. The sorcerer, now a man, explained that his years of sleep had ended. The years of constant tending from the clerics of Northshire Abbey enabled him to gain control over his powers. When his spirit and body became attuned, he awakened himself, and set out to Stormwind Keep at once. Medivh explained that he had come to repay the court for the kindness it had shown to him while he was in their keeping, and to acknowledge the occasion of the Ascension ceremony for Prince Llane. From within his flowing cloak he produced an hourglass, crafted of deepest obsidian, with sands as white as undriven snow. The young prince looked closely, but although the sand seemed to constantly sift from top to bottom, the lower half never filled, and the top never emptied. Medivh claimed that these sands represented the people of the kingdom, and so long as the glass never emptied, the reign of King Wrynn would not fail.
---
583
---
Six years passed, and the land slowly grew sick. Crops began failing in the richest soils of the kingdom. Children were stricken ill and never fully recovered. Even the moods of the subjects of Azeroth seem dark. The weather would become unseasonably cold during harvest, and the summer sun scorched the earth and made working out of the shade almost unbearable. Neither cleric nor conjurer could fathom what could be the cause of this change in the lands. More and more people became disheartened, and what once would have been looked over, now caused bitter argument.
---
During a bleak morning, Prince Llane rushed to his father's side, carrying the hourglass. During the night, the sands had run down from the top, and it was near emptied. King Wrynn took the glass into his hands, and a chill ran through the very core of his being. As the last sands trickled to the bottom of the glass, a great crashing sound was heard at the gates of Stormwind Keep. Suddenly, the grounds were filled with hideous creatures. Gross deformities, a cruel reflection of humanity, they swarmed over the King's guard and tore them to shreds. King Wrynn sent Llane and Queen Varia with an escort of knights to Northshire Abbey, promising to call for them when the foul beasts had been destroyed. That day has not yet come.
---
584
---
At the age of twenty years, Llane is pronounced King of Azeroth. His task is clear - to rid the lands of these creatures. The few that have survived battle refer to themselves as Orcs. When questioned, they will tell little else, and prefer death to releasing information. They are cruel, sadistic and vile - making no distinctions between soldier or child, warrior or woman. They will slay anyone who they encounter without a second thought. The only humans who do not fall to the Orcish blade are those who are taken to the swamps that have festered in the east, where the Orcs have made their encampments. What they do with these people is unknown, though the worst is feared for none have ever returned.
---
593
---
Nearly ten years of skirmishes and raids along the Borderlands have kept the people of Azeroth wary, but the Orcish hordes had been beaten back into their swamps. King Llane has found that the Orcs, though incredibly strong and vicious, were seldom well-trained in combat, and always disorganized. This has been the key to holding them at bay, and is the weakness he hopes to exploit in the future. The mystery that no Cleric or Conjurer had found the answer to, though, is the origin of these creatures.
---
In the tenth year of his reign, King Llane is visited by the mysterious traveler. She has come to the King with a warning that she hopes will aid him in his fight against this nemesis to his land. The coupling between the King's Conjurer and herself was intended to create a child that she could pass her knowledge and power onto before leaving this place. She did not count upon other forces in this, and other, worlds that would seek to dominate the child. He has now become a beacon of mystic power.
---
She sought him out only a fortnight before, and found that the powers that course through his veins have twisted him, making him insane. Realising the threat he now posed, she was forced to attempt to destroy him. He all but slew her.
---
The battle left both combatants drained, but Medivh held enough power to banish her from his sight, and command her never to return. His magiks were strong enough that even she cannot break this bond, and so can offer no aid in his downfall. The traveler also informs King Llane that it was Medivh who was responsible for the coming of the Orcs to Azeroth. During the battle with his father, he inadvertently opened a gateway to the domain that they, and many other foul creatures, call home. The Orcs are disciples of chaos, however, and not even Medivh has the power to control them.
---
Although the battle has Medivh in a greatly weakened state, the traveler warns that there will be a time when Azeroth will be forced to deal with him. Her parting words to the King were of her hope that the sorcerer would not become so strong, by that time, that the whole of this world would suffer.
---
Stirrings of war now come from the swamps. The attacks upon our settlements, once scattered and poorly-executed, have become more organised. The King has found it necessary to send footmen and archers to protect settlements along the Borderlands. Rumors of the rising of a great Orcish War Chief have been heard about the land. He is heard to be a harsh leader who has gathered the feuding Orcs under one banner. King Llane's scouts and spies have found him to be as cunning as he is bloodthirsty. This foul creature's name is Blackhand, and his control of the Orcish hordes could spell doom for Azeroth. The King has ordered me to seek out new recruits to train in the rudiments of combat, for the time has come to call upon the people of Azeroth and prepare the kingdom for war.
---
Felt very stagnant
---
Has the open beta started yet? I‚Äôd loved to at least log in and see if my Mac can run Classic.
---
Everyone rushing so hard. Do the ne quests while leveling, when you can turn in cloth do so. When aq war effort starts you can get these turn ins that give a shitton of rep iirc. Then you just turn those suckers in to night elfs and get a big cat mount, by that time you may have also got one from winterspring if you want the pink one or the drop one from zg. Totally reasonable to have a cat mount on a non night elf but there's no rush on it if you're worried about that.
---
god ur gonna keep doubling down are u?
---
A lot of the raid bosses are already realms, so that's out.
---
Here's my idea:
---
* PVP EU 1 - Alchemy
---
* PVP EU 2 - Blacksmithing
---
* PVE EU 1 - Enchanting
---
* PVE EU 2 - Engineering
---
* RP EU - Herbalism
---
* PVP US WEST - Leatherworking
---
* PVE US WEST - Mining
---
* RP US WEST - Skinning
---
* PVP US EAST - Tailoring
---
* PVE US EAST - Cooking
---
* RP US EAST - Fishing
---
And then if they have to add any servers and offer realm transfers, call it Operation First Aid and name them:
---
* Linen Bandage
---
* Wool Bandage
---
* Silk Bandage
---
* Mageweave Bandage
---
* Runecloth Bandage
---
And whenever enough transfers have happened, change their name over to 'Heavy'.
---
this video is one of my favorites, mage aoe farming from 20 to 60

Except raiding isn't the ONLY end game, there are lots of things you can do. I barely touched raids back then and still had lots of fun, you just wont be in the absolute best gear (though pvp gear isnt terrible by any means)
---
Hardiness is just better. The stun resistance really can't be overstated its so stupid good
---
Should be old vanilla guilds that were famous.
---
Death and Taxes 
---
Elitist Jerks
---
Nihilum
---
Risen
---
Etc
---
Now some numbers : 
---
EU token price : 
---
180 000 g
---
winter's kiss/anchor weed farm in EU with one account jumping between 2/3 phases ( it's really random when you're solo since you rely on other players doing world quests ):
---
 \~20 000 g/h
---
Now the same farm with a 5-man multiboxer, abusing the hell out of the system and able to jump easily between 4 phases anytime :
---
**\~400 000g/h**
---
If multiboxing is a ‚Äúproblem‚Äù blizz will just disable follow in world pvp like they did when bfa launched. This was at a time when it was becoming a bit of an issue with the massive amounts of gold you could make easily with many max level characters if you knew what you were doing at the end of legion. 
---
There were tons of clips going around of people in 40+ multiboxes taking over towns for hours. This was possible in legion because of how poorly aoe scales against huge groups. After like 5 or 10 targets aoe diminishes significantly so a competent multiboxer could easily out heal any aoe and destroy any unorganized group. 
---
This will not be possible in classic because there is no diminishing returns on aoe so no matter how many characters they have, 3-5 people can charge in and sapper and insantly wipe the multiboxer.
---
No one exclusively does PVP in Classic. You have to be at the forefront of PVE progression or you're not going to be able to complete with those that are. Therefore, Orc is the right choice.
---
they should use streamer names
---
Do we know if that Spell paladin build (ret but with on hit effects and spell power) actually works on classic?
---
You can easily get it at 30 with 5 people
---
i doubt the game will be wildly popular after a month or two. It'll level out and start to lose more players then it gains until it hits a final stable pop around 6 months in. Classic WoW has pretty bad attrition (at least throughout pservers), the 30 wall is real.
---
Not this?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhJeP1BT2JA
---
Wrong.
---
Back in the day I used to farm leather with a feral Druid in one of the zones above org, can‚Äôt remember which one now. Was pretty mindless but decent money (I was a warlock)
---
/r/World_chat
---
&gt;It would be one last awesome piece of nostalgia if somehow we all had to go out and get a physical copy to play classic
---
I prefer the free download.
---
I want one for couch play so bad. I have a laptop but it's still cumbersome.
---
Blizzard don't care if people get burnt out or not playing, that's completely up to the person
---
Any night elf druid that lets you get that close to use a warstomp is not a good druid.  In vanilla no matter what spec the druid is they should not let anyone in melee range period.
---
I hope you're kidding
---
When I say this I‚Äôm always told they have 10k pop from launch through Nax... what gives?
---
&gt;Kite bosses? (well, *not really* on the last 2).
---
As a lock that reminds me of a time were we were in the process of wiping against garr, but he was almost dead. I got aggro and just popped a swiftness potion and just placed all my instant cast spells I could on him. Ended up dying, but I like to think the couple seconds I bought us was what we needed to kill him with like 5 guys left.
---
&gt;And a free portal to Gadgetzan is nothing to scoff at either.

&gt; **Lets be real, Private Servers are looking better than Classic right now.** 
---
Bye, Felicia
---
Priests are great levelers. With the spirit tap talent and a good wand, they are really good.
---
The max number of people that can gather a node in bfa is 10, and the shard hopping isn‚Äôt thaaat abusable because there‚Äôs no guarantee any nodes will be up where you are when you change shards; also it can be a pain to try to change shards because the game tends to try to make you stick to a shard once you join it. 
---
I multibox 40 characters and just farm mobs all day and make 3-4x what any person gathering can make :P
---
They don't. ND the largest has about 4.2k players rn. 4.2k with no region lock, so its the entire world very much including CHYNA and their bot army.
---
&gt;This is embarassing, how can a multi million dollar company lose to some European on his basement hosting a private server? Because all these people are providing a better vanilla experience than blizz. 
---
Nice bait but you got too obvious in your comment replies.
---
Selling savory deviate delight.
---
What on earth did you just say? **Blizzard doesn't care if you're subbed to the game**?
---
?????????
---
oh noes pvp scary :(
---
It won't be "easy" and it'll take a long time on a fresh server. You would need to farm 30x Bloodscalp Tusk, 8x Burning Charm, 8x Cresting Charm, and 8x Thundering Charm. You have to farm these items for each Warrior. So if you have 3 Warriors you'll need to farm these items essential 3 times.
---
If your group is Alliance the better option is just to wait until 34 to get the Bonebiter.
---
Sonii
---
Even if they did change it you will make wayyyy more farming dm
---
Absolutely although There were some great compilations of hunters seeing how many people they could fool or using that assumption to pull really clever tricks back in the day.
---
Did the post specify if it was a pvp or pve server? With limited time, prioritising efficiency and parenting, pve is a decent call. 
---
On PvP its more about how often you can get away with a quick afk which will depend on server pop/ faction balance for the realm or more directly, the area (and what that area is) and luck.
---
Don't get me wrong I agree with you that most people won't mistake the hunter for someone doing a corpse run. Even some of the old strats like dying in aggro range of a bunch of mobs to dissuade opposing faction players of similar levels are useless if a warrior pulls out a gun to check.
---
It's basically just trying to improve survival odds for someone wanting to be a NE hunter.
---
I mean, maybe? I was in two pretty hardcore guilds (the second which cleared naxx) and it just made more sense for us to use warriors. I‚Äôm very curious to see how the research done by the p servers transfers into classic though. Being able to clear bwl in 20-30 minutes would be game changing
---
Am I the only one that just logged out and played an alt if I had absolutely no help and was getting camped that bad?
---
There's still ways to quickly reset the instance while teleporting to the beginning. It's not as simple as just doing /camp but it ends up being roughly the same amount time spent resetting (assuming you have WoW installed on a SSD).
---
What are those ways?
---
I have this right now. I wouldn't recommend it unless yiu are really short on cash. As the table, in my opinion, is really bad.
---
It's worth spending the extra for the bekant series.
---
How do we reserve names?
---
Sounds like it is time for new friends and family ;-)
---
Great Idea! It's good to see some thought going into this. I hate streamers.
---
I remember this! I hope it'll make it to the Classic client. I remember trying to add this to a UI I was using.
---
I like fairly minimal UIs but I also still like to stylize the UI elements lol.
---
Whoa, massive thanks for the gold! it really means a lot.
---
No. I'm just saying that they were good at pulling stuff from the lore.
---
What they did with what they pulled from the lore is a different story...
---
Yea, but your case is flawed. Classic is for people who want to play the original WoW as close as possible. Leave the class changes and balances to anything that may come after unless it's TBC.
---
Both are really good, but hardiness is better.
---
As long as the quest level isn‚Äôt 6 levels below you, you‚Äôll get full rep.  You don‚Äôt HAVE to go to shadowglen at level 1, but if you accidentally ding 7 along the way you start losing rep for the level 1 quests.
---
for =/= of
---
Yea, "margin for error" is not the typical idiomatic english phrase, and you're right in your description of the typical phrase and what it means.
---
For and of here being essentially opposite prepositions contextually I feel like OP is not wrong, it does mean IMO that there is a lot of room to fuck up.
---
You're right, we should name them after our favorite players.
---
* Asmongoldshire
---
* Esfandia
---
* Sea Dew Harbor
---
* Staysafe Bay
---
* Sodastan
---
* Payola Peak
---
* Quinswana
---
* Ongee Summit
---
* Tipsouth Valley
---
This used to be possible. I don't know if the vanilla API allowed it, but the 3.x API did. They broke it in Wotlk or Cata. Classic is based on the modern client. This will not be possible in Classic.
---
He he
---
Why does everyone forget survival hunter? I'd rather boomkin over some meele survival nonsense
---
Play Warcraft III
---
Thanks for the source. I really hope that applies to Classic.
---
Oh, lol I feel silly now
---
You sound fun. I'd much rather play with someone with that attitude than the tryhard mentality.
---
Come on my guy.
---
No it isn't. Vanilla is already as close to original as Classic. Blizz will have to sweeten the pot by fixing quite a bit of garbage to get a significant amount of people from Private.
---
i hope that was an arrested development reference lol
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov-HJkqowZs This is what I used, it's actually pretty sweet, requires skinning.
---
Damage done for what, exactly? Also, if the man wants to play ret, let him play ret. Classic is for having fun, because the raid content isn't going to be that difficult until maybe AQ40.
---
That sounds badass actually.
---
1) Make a group with both your main and an alt (requires second person to set up but after that they can leave).
---
2) Clear dungeon as per normal. When you're finished log off main and on to the alt.
---
3) Reset dungeons on your alt and then log back in to your main.
---
4) You are now at the start of a freshly reset instance on your main.
---
Takes roughly the same amount of time as the /camp method. It does require help to get it set up but once the group is made you can grind for hours without needing outside assistance again.
---
Was that a cheeky Carl weathers reference
---
You‚Äôd have similar gear if you were grinding dungeons to 30
---
Yeah I adjusted the numbers with those handicaps, I took the gathering example because it was once viable with one account. Needless to say it's useless to farm your Token on mobs with one account if you have a life outside the game lol.
---
Hey, nerd, we're trying to play ultimate frisbee here, get lost!
---
Haha could you imagine? 
---
Hey guys done pooping. g2g. Thx 4 run.
---
If your trying to use druid in melee pvp your doing it wrong.  Your strength is to stay at range and keep them rooted for others to kill. Every melee class will own you in melee range even in cat or bear form.  This is vanilla wow not TBC or later where cat form and bear form could hold their own well in pvp.  You will learn probably the hard way.  Now using the tauren's stomp to stun them so you can get away is good but then again you already messed up letting them get that close to begin with.  Tauren stomp is allot stronger for melee classes and not druid's in vanilla.  You should never choose that race just for druid alone.  You should choose horde cause thats where your friends are.  A seasoned pvp druid will not even miss that stun nor need it, someone who is new to pvp and the druid class might cause they havent learned how to properly used the class in pvp yet.
---
The fence gives it away. Such a fucking useless fence. Also, Brill is the greatest town, but nice painting nonetheless.
---
No context on what fight/raid , is this beta ? Private server or what?
---
Well, you're certainly wrong there. Private servers will be dead after classic. There will be a minimal numbers who stay but the majority will leave.
---
no lines at wal mart.  All the dumb kids drove 30 mins to gamestop to wait an hour in line.  I went 5 min to walmart, and was already going.
---
The midnight release also helped with congestion.  Not many idiots up past midnight to play a game.
---
If u join raid u are expected to carry ur weight. Sure raids can be done with few leechers but there is no point inviting them.
---
these are full raid clears
---
You are a man of refined tastes.
---
look up staysafetv he has a good guide. shouldnt have issues like that.
---
Im in a similar situation. Working 60-80 hrs a week wont leave me much time to level. 
---
What characters are u planning on playing?
---
I played alliance years ago mostly as healer. I want to go horde this time... thinking rshaman or druid
---
Honestly, WarCraft 3 is the best prep for classic, through and through.
---
The Knaak ones were very solid, even if you weren't a Warcraft fan.
---
Lol you're right. Everyone should just roll a warrior/mage/priest and call it a day. Why play anything other than Bis right?
---
Wow nice long story bro very lecturing, have you ever done flagrunning before?
---
Will it be possible to turn in cloth in stages 1 and 2?
---
Skipping school after grabbing an expansion pack to play all day is something I miss dearly. 
---
Edjakayshun can wait.
---
Carl Weathers?
---
That is up to the future ton decide.
---
I remember back in vanilla wow in our raids we would only have one rogue that would be 5/5 master of deception just for the supression room.  It was frowned upon by all the other rogues to be specced for that if you were not the person doing the supression room.  That extra 5 points made a big difference in dps and most if not all rogue officers who were in a progression guild would not tolerate a rogue with a bad spec.
---
Sauce on the prot warrior pvp build? for science.
---
I don't understand why there have to be names per se, when we were younger we named our dogs: Vovve (Swedish for dog), Ettan, Tv√•an, Trean, Fyran etc (First, Second, Third, Fourth etc). 
---
The first one, the alpha dog got the name of dog, while the rest just got numbering, perfectly easy to keep track of them and really easy to call them out. I have since then moved out and will be getting a pup during the summer, I will call him Dog.
---
Your a dream husband
---
Thanks.  I'll try to get there by LVL 4
---
Everybody considering playing PVP, consider that people play the game - OP
---
What onions?  Were you eating onions?
---
I've heard stories of 25 people carrying the other 15. Perhaps not past BWL but then at that point they'll know that he's not someone just looking for a free ride.
---
Thanks you kind person
---
&gt;or a meatshield in AV.
---
Someone's gotta tank Drek.
---
It goes both ways.  You don't have to be in the best guilds, but don't get mad when even average guilds don't want people playing meme specs because there is no excuse for rolling this stuff when Classic launches considering we have known it is bad for 15 years now.  The game has been broken down and everyone knows what to roll now.  If you want to ranged dps raid you roll a hunter/mage/lock.  If you want to melee dps raid you roll a warrior/rogue.  If you want to heal raid you roll a shaman/paladin/priest/druid.  If you want to tank raid you roll a warrior.  All the other specs are cool for leveling or 5 mans or pvp or farming, but trying to raid as a meme spec is just selfish considering we know everything now and are starting fresh.
---
What if they‚Äôre a really funny guy? Or respectable? A joy to be around/play with? Stop acting like Vanilla Raiding is this do or die scenario.
---
So bigger regions excludes Australia? Where does it say that?
---
Oh and even he was forced to heal and spec a certain way, though I'm guessing thats how he specs anyway otherwise he won't get a raid inv.
---
Alot of people who played wow had no idea pandern where a thing because they didn't play warcraft.
---
Well, I think everyone is aware that ret isn't a great spec for pve, but who really cares unless you're trying to be at the very top? Reliability and personality go a long way to getting raid spot.
---
Best bank alt is a lvl 35 druid. You have travel form and teleport Moonglade. The teleport is good because you can level tailoring on it for the Mooncloth transmute, which requires a moonwell to use. And you can take Alchemy as your second profession for the transmute and make a ton of money passively.
---
Just find an RP community on another server. If there was enough of you to make a server work, there will be enough of you out there to have a community on a non-rp server.
---
No context.  No information.  Can lead to zero useful discussion.  Yep, it‚Äôs a shitpost alright.
---
Tbc was my favorite; I quit in wrath and came back for siege of .org and I reeeaaally enjoyed it.
---
What?  Every class has a role in raids, we all know what they are now, there is no excuse to play a meme spec.  If you are a hunter/lock/mage you are ranged dps, if you are a warrior/rogue you are melee dps, tanks are warriors, and druids/shamans/priests/paladins are healers.  It is all very simple at this point.
---
I don't know much about either class at 60 because I only got to 60 as a mage. But just remember that if you plan to play for the long run you'll have to be okay with healing. Spriest raiding spots are very hard to come by unless you get into a guild that's clearing raids for alts.
---
PVP Dwarf
---
PVE Human
---
Surely you jest... there is not place called Chyna... there are not bots on ND.
---
Lol I couldn‚Äôt keep it going...
---
Hey man, you're in a really unfortunate position but if I had to give you any advice it would be this:   
---
When servers get announced, pick one that has a guild or group of like-minded people that plan on playing in your ideal timeframe. I can only play at late hours of the day and recently found a great guild to play with. They are a few timezones behind me but it works out because of my schedule.
---
My first thought ya. This is rather not new but it's a nice package of info.
---
Who cares? It‚Äôs vanilla.
---
It's fairly safe to assume that, based on the following:
---
1. There's no retail RP servers in AU currently.
---
2. Ion used the terms "larger regions" when asked if and where RP servers will be made available.
---
3. Australia is a fairly small region. The server count for retail is currently 8.
---
With that in mind, I fairly hope that I'm wrong and/or that they'd change their mind.
---
This is a deal breaker for me.
---
full raid clears, even with AOE packs ret is trash
---
DPS standing in fire taking the time to type in caps "HEAL ME!" instead of just strafing. \*rolls eyes\*
---
I‚Äôll bite. Why would a level 1 need to get to Everlook? Timbermaw rep? Furbolg Medicine Pouch? Some other reason?
---
This. Engi literally everyone in a raid. 1 armorsmith, 1 axe, 2-3 enchanters, priest/mage/lock tailoring for some time, alch on lvl 35 alt for transmute/crafting, leatherworking on 35 alt for cooldown/crafting, skinning if below 60, mining only if doing DME jump runs with warrior/shaman or something.
---
I hope you are wrong also. An RP server for Aus is very small potatoes resource wise.
---
Nice. What‚Äôs the mouse mat?
---
I mean, I know your mind is already made up and further confrontation won't likely matter, but why do you think people will stay on a private server when the official publisher is opening a server? 
---
Another thing, people LOVE fresh starts.
---
Ohhh yeh
---
You know what really hurts? I'm a druid main and don't see a single orange bar in this entire list. Feelsbadman.
---
When I was on a PvP served I never really had a problem with people ganking me. If I got ganked I would just quest elsewhere. If someone was camping me I would just quit the game and do something. It was what I signed up for.
---
I also remember local defense actually being a channel people paid attention to. I would say some ganker was at so and so place and a level 60 would eventually show up to fight him.
---
imagine thinking gnomes, talking cows, and male night elves are less ridiculous than pandas
---
I'm thinking of nightelf hunter, then human warrior, or alternating between leveling the 2.
---
Once the warrior gets T2 gear or higher there is no competition, if your a rogue and you dont run away then your toast.  Warrior will laugh at your hits and then two shot you.
---
I like this meme format but don't like the content. Plz try again.
---
you can beat ret pallys by quite a bit with MCP
---
Thank for you being a first responder.  Appreciate your service
---
You're going to have a hard time getting into a raid with both an ele and a shadow priest.  However a spriest can actually net a DPS increase and I suspect most guilds will bring one.
---
I wouldn't let that be your deciding factor though as ele shamans are pretty cool when played well.  Spriests are madmen, but also somewhat simple to play at decent skill level.  They are such different classes, so I'd go for the playstyle you prefer the most. 
---
You could also try them out on a vanilla pserver and see which you prefer.
---
It only takes a few days to level an alt to 35, and that allows you to get 2x max professions on it. You can then set them up with Alchemy/Tailoring for Transmutes/Mooncloth. This nets you a decent amount of passive gold, all you gotta do is log into the alt once each day and click a button.
---
Girlfriend bought it for me on amazon, said she searched "World of warcraft mouspad extra large"
---
Because it will be pretty much the same thing as Vanilla but with slightly better graphics. Someone already playing Vanilla would be hard pressed to pay 15$ a month for just a few more pixels.
---
Definitely. I think that if there's just one - one! - they can definitely fill it up.
---
The cost of compute powers these days is small and can be dynamically allocated, since Blizzard hosts servers in the cloud (IIRC Warcraft sits on AWS or GCP?), and doesn't have to order dedicated hardware of their own. 
---
I imagine they have concerns I'm not aware of, but still - roleplayers live and breathe the Warcraft universe, they're important to the community. RP servers often inhabit many non-RPers too, just because they like this kind of environment.
---
Nobbel goes into some detail in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFZuhtcjRDQ&amp;t=1303s) video.
---
Rogues are less gear dependant than rogues.  If the person here wants a class than can jump in and dps good right away rogue is the class they should use.  If they can wait with warrior, and get bwl gear and on up then warrior is the top dps by far.  Eventually DPS Warriors become god tier and leave rogues behind.
---
Vlabie?
---
Assuming 33% Nightfall uptime and not being able to count any magic procs from rogues or warriors, going column by column:
---
1. 679.6 DPS (slot #15)
---
2. 271.3 DPS (slot # 22, though I don't think he was DPSing this whole fight)
---
3. 426 DPS (slot # 12)
---
4. 401.3 DPS (slot # 13)
---
5. 384.7 DPS (slot #22, though I don't think he was DPSing this fight)
---
6. 277.9 DPS (slot #17, though same as above)
---
7. 648.2 DPS (slot #14)
---
I think Ret isn't good, but let's at least acknowledge what it's used for.
---
No politics until Barrens chat please.  Gotta keep that stored up until then.
---
Beta is as beta does. I'd personally love to see more people invited but we have to remember that beta is first and foremost used for testing and not viewer entertainment. I just can't wait to play in 2 months!
---
Assuming he was using Nightfall, he out-damaged several pure-DPS classes in a lot of those fights.
---
In 05/06 the game hadn't already been theory crafted to death the way it is today. With what we know today about raid and class mechanics, we can clear content with a group composing of half "optimal" raid specs and half non-optimal. That's my point. Enhance is a blast and nobody should be discouraged from playing it because a couple of tryhard twats say it isn't 'optimal.'
---
When I went to my WotLK release event near me at my local gamestop. While waiting in line for over an hour a large man pulls up in his Dodge Charger with techno blaring. Gets out of the car with a sunglasses(?), sombrero and a jersey on. Starts screaming in excitement then pulls out a box of wine. You think you see where this is going but then he pulls out the bag of wine from the box and STABS the bag with a knife and chugs/splashes about half the bag on himself. My friends and I are both stunned and amused. The doors opened about twenty minutes later. Once we got back we turned that dude into a inter-circle meme. Then proceeded to get addicted to my favorite expansion. Good times.
---
If you're going to raid, that sword skill benefit is pretty huge.  But for fighting rogues and other warriors/rogues stoneform is sexy af.
---
Your logic is cold, but sound.
---
I have fond memories of waiting in line for 3 hours with my friend for burning crusade, installing the discs on my MacBook (I know) while I was driving home, stopping del taco to pick up the fiesta pack and playing all night and day on the carpet til we past out. One of the best nights ever.
---
Is that program hard to learn/use?  Your background looks awesome!! :)
---
Amen.
---
Not saying I like it, but it's inevitable once classic is fully released.
---
I like wotf tbh and I don't like orc rogues they look too chunky to be a rogue lol but that's just me, the min max would be orc
---
Just go nf conflag, it‚Äôs 10x more enjoyable and versatile.
---
As a kid playing I had all the time in the world, as an adult I don't have much free time anymore :\
---
That's why I'm rolling on a comfy PVE server.
---
Just because your guild isn't a top tier guild doesn't mean they don't want to kill bosses.  It's all fun and games until you get stuck on a boss, or wipe at 1%
---
no way its super easy! Just go to steam and download "Wallpaper Engine" and launch it via steam (its in Library software drop bar not games)  
---
Once launched add all kinds of backgrounds and apply them to yours.  
---
Search Ragnaros EzPz
---
Non playable factions
---
\*2
---
I always put my most used spell on 2, it's closer to the natural WASD finger position.
---
I have no idea, but it is possible on the beta.
---
Can't wait to spam two buttons and be top DPS, just like retail! AWWWWWWW YEAH!
---
Your case is that because a months old extremely exclusive beta isnt active anymore, its bad news for Classic.
---
And its stupid.
---
If you're going for pure aesthetics, I've always been a fan of Dwarf rogues. I see them as less of an assassin and more of a treasure hunter/outlaw kinda role. 
---
(and their Stoneform is also good for practical use)
---
The vast majority of private server players want official blizzard servers and are happy to pay for it.
---
Most of the "purists" are just people who are really poor, or cheap, and never want to pay for anything
---
I think it would be cool to re-release the same original server list.
---
My GameStop has smelt like onions it's whole existence as it's always been connected to a Subway sandwich shop, the smell of the new games-sandwhiches makes for the most recognizable smell I've ever known...
---
You need better gear with destruction. With soul link nightfall you dot and kite the target while running and jumping 180 degrees instant shadowbolts.
---
Probably this. Although perception can be nice in rogue duels stoneform is more generally useful, especially as a rogue. Popping stoneform then vanish can get you out of a lot of bad situations when you're stuck out of stealth with deep wounds/rend/etc.
---
That said, I'd personally go human. The rep bonus is the cat's meow.
---
But everyone else was waiting too. So it wasn‚Äôt a big deal, it‚Äôs easier to suffer together than alone.
---
That's a lot of filters.
---
There's a vendor that has limited supply recipes. One in particular is Pattern: Runecloth Bag that only spawns once every several hours.
---
Everlook will be empty for the first 100 hours, and very sparsely populated for the next 100 hours.
---
If I have a level 1 parked there, know how many patterns I can stock up on before most people get there?
---
‚Äú‚Äù‚Äùeasily‚Äù‚Äù‚Äù
---
Yea, I'd be expecting to heal as Shaman 100%. I'd hope to sneak a Spriest spot in a rising guild if I could, but if things got dire, I'd heal if it means a shot at getting Spriest gear.
---
It‚Äôs the best
---
Also rogues were a dime a dozen back in vanilla wow, even on the private servers.  Thats probably why it was harder for you to find groups cause there were so many.  While holy paladin was the best single target healer and they were really needed in raids but there were less holy paladins than rogues by far. (at least what I heard) I hear druids are not needed as much but I still plan to play one.  I'm also being told that Druids are harder to find for raids even though you only need 2-3 per raid at the most.  Was a hunter in vanilla wow and left the game in the middle of Naxx.  There was always plenty of rogues and hunters, in fact even a line to get into the raid and even our guild. Was horde so cant personally confirm about what I said above about paladin.  Plan to play a druid this time cause I want a different experience.
---
I know it's almost playable, but I'd play on Defilers or Warsong Outriders (maybe just Warsong?). I would also play on Zandalar or Timbermaw or what have you. That's a pretty good idea!
---
&gt; who really cares unless you're trying to be at the very top
---
There's not being at the top and then there's being right next to the tanks.
---
Totally did. You had to install and update, some people could do it faster, was way less strain that the entire internet hitting your servers at the same second
---
But you still need 8 with good gear. Not Naxx good but at least T2 good.
---
Yea, I wouldn't be expecting to raid DPS as Shaman. Probably heal, get plenty of caster mail as I'm only competing with my fellow Shammy's, and pvp 30/0/21.
---
Seems like the big issue would be keeping a schedule for 5 guys and not having anyone jump ahead when the group couldn‚Äôt play. Otherwise very cool. No idea why so many downvotes.
---
Yep, the server ticks every 2 seconds I think, even when you're full energy. There are addons that can show you this tick so you can account for it
---
not heterosexualllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
---
*but i want 95+ parsing players only, no meme specs, all 30 of our dps must be warriors/rogues/mages or u dont get invite!!111*
---
These players are in for one hell of a wakeup call come Classic launch.
---
Magic Dust farming
---
There are elementals that walk around Westfall, they have a high chance of dropping an item that's used a lot in dungeons/pvp, each one sells from 30-40 silver, and on PVP servers would sell out VERY quickly
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/item=2091/magic-dust
---
Sweet, that actually makes me feel a lot better. Assuming the Paladins would coordinate with each other on who is buffing what, and even if I had to overwrite Salv on warriors with a regular 5 min blessing thats not bad either, just a smaller group to deal with. Thanks for the info!
---
I found this really helpful : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sI38mG46k&amp;t=15s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sI38mG46k&amp;t=15s)
---
Mained a Dwarf Rogue in Vanilla. Had a blast. However I told myself that ifbinever got the chance to fo it all over I would roll human for the racials. I didn't pvp much so stone form wasn't used to full potential. The human rep racial is just so stronk.
---
Epic story. Mine was I was the guy who left his lights on for wotlk so when I finally got out I had to beg someone to jump me off so I could get home. Couple hundred people.
---
Fast forward 120 days, you finally log on your level 1 gnome Warrior feeling proud you got such a cool name and proceed to farm boars for the next 10 levels because Classic hype is real and every other spot in the game is camped 24/7.
---
You decided you slaughtered enough boars for day and go for a walk to Ironforge to show off your cool name, passing dozens of layers and hundreds of players with whatever leftover bottom of the barrel names they could get.
---
"Poor casuals" you smile to yourself as you climb on top of Ironforge bridge and /flex, drawing attention and admiration of surrounding players. 
---
But suddenly you see a gnome warrior fully decked out in Battlegear of Might and decide to inspect her, but you freeze in shock when you see her name "Kneecapper"
---
You ask her how did she do it, how was she able to reserve such a name AND play the game, and she smiles at you "I like your name kid, but to do what I did you need to make 200 IQ plays, something only a Rick and Morty fan like me would understand" turns around and leaves
---
But anyway the most surefire way to reserve a name is to autogenerate a character on 2nd account, and delete that character a moment before you create your actual character on the original account. You can also do that with a friend, you reserve each other's names
---
Dude, when I was a level 56 paladin, I had a level 60 fury warrior in full grand marshal gear agree to go to UBRS with us as often as we'd like, so long as he got his Valor shoulder. He wasn't even tanking -- but I assure you: having him along made life a lot easier.
---
Take what you can get man. And as long as it's agreed in advance? It's fine. Take who you can get. Make alliances and deals with whoever you need to.
---
If I didn't care about racial abilities at all, I'd go Dwarf Male. They're the only race the Horde really has any respect for and it's because they're the best of The Alliance. They're also the Alliance race that needed the least work done in the model update, because they already looked good. Except females, they never will.
---
If you sit in feign death for the full duration of the timer you actually die lol.

each engi spec gob/gnom can make a teleporter to either gadget or winterspring iirc i forget which is which

To be fair they just opened a new server a week ago which has another 3.3k players. Right now they have almost 8k people online between their three servers, which isn't *that* far from 10k.
---
&gt; probably not enough
---
They only need 11 names.

Why are your profession icons so prominent lol. Do you really need to see the icon for first aid right near your character?

Curse of Agony does 1044 over 24 seconds. If you have 500 spell power, it does 1,544 damage.
---
COA + Corruption, with 500 spell power will do 2,866 damage over 24 seconds.
---
Does the enemy have less than 2,866 HP? Then yes it will kill them. Average geared 60 will have a fair bit more HP than that tho.
---
So no.
---
except we weren't pirated server shitters with zero integrity, so we didn't corpse camp lowbies.
---
Bummer so I guess damage over time is weaker than I thought
---
No I mean the NPC feel soulless and bad
---
Yah that is true. I guess depending on how close 0hases will be together will depict this. I suppose we dont know yet. Hopefully 4-6 months at least kinda like 2004-2006
---
Orc for both PvE and PvP.
---
All rogues are assholes change my mind.
---
&gt; What if they‚Äôre a really funny guy? Or respectable? A joy to be around/play with?
---
The fuck does that mean? How do any of these even matter during a raid/dungeon?
---
There is a vanilla addon called pallypower that does exactly that.  A class leader will assign which buff per class that each paladin is supposed to use and then gives a number beside each class for anyone missing buffs so you know if someone is messing shit up.  I don't recall if the vanilla version did or didn't but the TBC version would communicate back your talents so that the leader can see  who has improved whatever.  
---
I am not sure if that exact mod will work if ported, because it would allow you to cast your assigned buff by clicking a dynamic button, something modern API blocks, but I am sure a somewhat equivalent addon will be developed.
---
I've been lit up by warlock dots very often as a Druid. Any layered hots on me easily counters them for the most part. Dots are great against low stam builds who can't heal. The moment heals enter the situation warlocks cry. Affliction tends to not be the late game build for pvp for them.
---
An underrated dot class is the Hotw druid build. The bleeds and magic dots usual cut even high stam classes in half alone. But like a warlock and Shadow Priest, they have to back it up with some DD.
---
There's a such thing as caster mail?
---
Considering you hit 2 buttons, instant cast, and do that damage, they are NOT weak. Toss in a Siphon life, and the damage will certainly kill an average 60.
---
Dunno if you know this, but if you‚Äôre wiping outside of naxx it ain‚Äôt cuz you‚Äôve got a ret in the raid
---
your comment made my smile merci
---
Are you pretending to not know that gamer nerds typically have bad hygiene? I played a lot of MTG when I was younger and I've been to several WoW events. It's not an exageration that when these nerds swarm, they stank. Gamers are typically very nice, friendly, helpful people. But they stink. Badly. Maybe you don't. Maybe you smell like lavender oil and peppermint. Maybe you smell like a freshly glazed ham. But typically gamers, especially in a tight space and even moreso when they're collectively excited, stink.
---
&gt; Can you get to a certain gear level that two dots like CoA + Corruption can kill average geared level 60 players over their duration?
---
No.
---
Since you added rogues in the last one you probably want to remove it unless your talking about a class thats not a warrior or rogue since rogues will have the same gearing problem.
---
Proud of you
---
I disagree with the replies a bit. Levling as prot leaves you very little downtime. Sure stuff dies slowly, but with imp revenge, you never do. You'll also get groups for dungeons and qs real quick. Mage is quicker, but warrior is not as bad as some make it out to be. Also, prot is by far the most fun gameplay imo. You do what you feel like, then level the other after
---
Do computers even come with disc drives anymore?
---
Pretty sure they aren‚Äôt increasing it any more (thankfully).
---
Imagine being that salty about not being able to kill a dragon 15 years ago
---
Let it go man, let it go...
---
Selling cockroaches under a bridge...
---
Dude, yes. The midnight release of Burning Crusade was so memorable. I waited outside of Gamestop with of few of my friends and 100 other random wow players. It was so cool to talk to all of these other wow players who lived in my city. I'll never forget driving home, installing, then logging in around midnight and playing as long as I could keep my eyes open. Good times!
---
Blizzard has a separate Alpha going on to test end-game content, it's highly unlikely we'll see a level 60 Beta.
---
No. There probably won't be an open beta.
---
lol well you just said the tank dont get to roll on dps gear so the other warrior will be fine since he's just there for the dps gear.
---
Ahh I see the private server community is starting to give us shitty memes too
---
AM feeling sad today, Hope you are not kind stranger, all the best
---
TINFOIL THEORY: Blizzard deliberately "extinguished" the classic beta for now because 8.2 launched and they hope that by keeping beta "content-less" they will make some people try out/come back to retail.
---
Once everyone buys their 6-month sub mount, the classic team will be *allowed* to increase the level cap to 50 and/or invite more people for further testing.
---
Or because the game is capped at 40, people know their characters are gonna reset in 2 months, and they'd rather just wait for release?
---
A keg isn't a panda, check.
---
I think nuetral factions would be necessary those that are friendly or enemies of bith horde and alliance so there isn‚Äôt faction imbalance
---
It's really not just a few more pixels. It's guaranteed stability (outside launch) more players, less lag and a level playing field.
---
I mean they never were going to allow raids to be streamed. I really doubt they're going to increase the level cap anymore. 
---
The assumption is that they don't want their customer base vicariously experiencing the entire game before its even out. Its just not good business. Give them a taste, but not the whole snack.
---
You're assuming Oceania gets servers at all. Germany is 270% your playerbase and they're not getting their own servers.
---
I‚Äôd guess this is under NDA
---
Damn, it'd be so cool if each shard had the name of the player/creature it was taken from.
---
Found the democrat
---
Awesome! I‚Äôll give them a try, where should I start? The universe is huge!
---
It shouldn't be too surprising that people here prefer pvp servers. Growing up, there was just no such thing as PvE servers on mmos. All the things people frown upon like corpse camping weren't seen as a bad thing, it's just the way things were. Players have gotten soft, and that's fine. 
---
I won't be playing on a PvP server this time around. I'm older and I don't have the time for it anymore, unfortunately. But it is really strange that people will choose to roll on a pvp server and then complain about the negatives (realities) that come along with it.
---
Guess I'm making a druid now too.
---
Free time, my friend, I'm sorry for what I'm going to do to you.
---
Maybe but in classic/vanilla leveling up as a warrior you will still think they are overtuned anyways.
---
Who plays male Orc???
---
Naxx raiders
---
Based on Blizzard's decision not to give Germany their own realm, it's doubtful that they think Australia has the playerbase to sustain even one Classic realm, of any type.
---
Damn, you almost had a good insult. Almost.
---
Me and my friend were the only alliance waiting in line; I recall being a pair of 22 yearold guys at midnight taking huge shit from a group of Middle Aged women ragging about how we didn‚Äôt play horde like real men.
---
Was hilarious at the time, and it‚Äôs one of my goofier but treasured memories.
---
I've seen plenty, one if the best rogues on my server was one
---
Its just a filter over someone's art. Brill is better though, everybody knows that
---
A hunter?
---
If you wanna have a good time it do
---
Are hard/physical copies more expensive than going digital for a company or something?
---
It's the circle of life.  Just go back and gank lowbies later on.  Pay it forward.
---
I remember how I read my first wow book (circle of hatred) and then I run around Theramore and looked for Aegwynn. It was during TBC (I have not played vanilla) and ofc I found nothing. Guys is she in Theramore in classic? (I need to know if I should spend another day running around this time).
---
Nice! Thank you a lot.
---
You must be keeping a lot of useless junk in your bags then.
---
When you go out to quest the only things in your bags should be Hearthstone and trade tools(skinning knife/pick/fishing rod) *Maybe* one stack of food(if you're a warrior)/water(if you're a caster)
---
If you're saying that a hunter should be the one spamming Wing Clip to keep Nightfall up, yeah, good luck ever convincing someone to do that.
---
At least there are people that *want* to play Ret.
---
probably not cool enough\* sorry
---
I remember going to Best Buy at midnight on a cold November night in Canada. It was come and snowy and I was looking forward to the same in Azeroth. Great memory! Thanks for bringing it back!
---
Cenarion Circle would promote too many druids ;) I still wouldn't mind playing on neutral factions! Thorium Brotherhood is a retail name, but I'm not sure Zandalari / Zandalari Tribe is, etc.
---
omg warcraft guides thx for the new content
---
Except none of that is really a factor if you are trying to run dungeons.  I played pvp servers my entire time and it was rare that I've ever been stopped from going into a dungeon.
---
I'm doubting some of you played back then. PvP servers were absolutely filled to the brim with people camping low levels. To be fair, they were not the star players of the servers. It was usually badly geared hunters and rogues who couldn't raid and would get stomped in bgs, but let's not pretend corpse camping wasn't part of the game. It happened constantly in world pvp on pvp servers AND at the GY in bgs.
---
Some good memes finally from this subreddit, this one + the wojak one 10/10
---
You're not understanding.
---
A Warrior tank gets all the melee DPS gear a Rogue can't use.
---
A Warrior tank gets no DPS gear if they bring another Warrior.
---
No matter how funny or nice or respectable someone is, in a raid/dungeon they're not cracking jokes, "being nice" or garnering anyone's respect since only words spoken are "pulling" "wait" and "mana"
---
pro tip- you can dislike ridiculous nonsense without being a democrat :D
---
All good points.
---
I always make sure to have an alt or two I want to level for whenever someone decides to corpsecamp me. More than happy to let them sit around my corpse while I level another character.
---
If you are good at powershifting you will do fine. Also the other melee will love having your extra crit buff.
---
Not to spoil your fun, but Shadow Priests mostly heal too.
---
bullshit.  People believed you could be banned for camping lowbies, because griefing is in the tos.
---
Good joke. Let's keep shitty American politics out of Azeroth.
---
I play live on a PVP server, and aside from events like invasions, the Nazjatar/Mech opening weeks, PVP is uncommon, especially to this degree. Almost never get corpse camped. Death squads happen, but they usually move on after the kill. 
---
1v1 most people won't start a fight. People just want to get on with their days.
---
Carefully
---
There is one universal answer to any Blizzard question:
---
"When they are ready"
---
AV is the worst honor per hour I thought?  You get the most by actually completing BGs and AV lasts too long.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=4983
---
very slightly worse than than whirlwind axe, takes 5-10minutes to get for a 5-man level 30 party.
---
I played a 60 UD lock in retail Vanilla, and a bit on other servers so here's my take on it. Formatting will be rough because I'm in mobile. Basically there are 2 top specs for PvE that I've played that I'll discuss here. SM / Ruin and DS / Ruin. With either of these specs, you really will never have to re-spec at any point throughout vanilla, which is one enticing reason some people lean towards warlock. Alright here we go.
---
Shadow Mastery / Ruin - 30/0/21 
---
Basically you spec far enough into affliction for the shadow mastery talent, then go into destruction down to the ruin talent. With this spec, you get all the goods from the affliction tree. Siphon life,  imp corruption and curse of agony, things that help you solo, and of course shadow mastery for the increased shadow damage. This combined with the ruin talent for 100% increased spell critical strike damage. 
---
Pros: 
---
-Great for PvP, unlike the DS / Ruin spec you can have your pet for extra utility. Succubus charms, felhunter purges, this stuff is kinda huge in PvP.
---
-Great for solo play. I actually spent a lot of my retail vanilla time farming select bosses in BRD with this spec, good for kiting with dots.
---
-Great for 5 mans. Allowing your imp to be summoned for blood pact, even if you dont have the improved blood pact spec (from demonology) it's still going to be more appreciated than sacrificing your pet and not providing the buff at all, which would be the case with DS / Ruin.
---
Cons:
---
-This spec will do less damage than DS / Ruin in a raid environment and heres why. Shadow Mastery will increase your BASE SHADOW SPELL DAMAGE BY 10 PERCENT. Where Demonic Sacrifice will increase your TOTAL SHADOW DAMAGE BY 15 PERCENT. This is important to note that you technically get more shadow damage from DS /RUIN. 
---
Demonic Sacrifice / Ruin - 7/21/21
---
With this spec, you have a little more freedom with leftover talent points, however I find most warlocks tend to put their last points in getting improved corruption + life tap from affliction. Anyways, you spec far enough into demonology to grab demonic sacrifice, then into destruction for the Ruin talent. I think you can see where we are going so here are the pros and cons.
---
Pros:
---
-Great in a raid environment. The warlock rotation is pretty straightforward. You spam shadowbolt, while sometimes being responsible for keeping a curse or banish going. This spec is utilizing the most out of your shadowbolt. 
---
-Great in certain PvP scenarios in which you could stay in the backline uncontested (Alterac Valley for example).
---
-You spend quite a bit of talents in the demo tree that go basically unused. Talents to increase the power of your pet, just to get to the demonic sacrifice talent. In my personal opinion, you are sacrificing much more than your pet. Abilities, utility, among other things.
---
-Not nearly as strong in general PvP as SM / Ruin, however both pale in comparison to the Soul Link build which I did not include here as you said light PvP. Soul link is basically the PvP spec, and that's about it. If you are PvE'ing in soul link spec your damage will more than likely be pretty terrible.
---
So it basically comes down to preference, but I personally love the SM / Ruin spec. You get the best of both the affliction and destruction trees, in PvP scenarios starting with a succubus charm + soul fire. If you get a huge crit, you could even death coil + shadowburn and hope for 2 more crits. I've 3 shot people who had insane gear advantages with this spec and I could never go back to Demonic Sacrifice. However I will say that in a raid environment the DS warlock will more than likely out DPS you, but not by a super significant amount. Technically it's more raid dps, imo that's the only aspect of the game DS / ruin is better, but that's if you're min maxing everything and whatnot. I'd recommend SM / Ruin to any new warlock as the end all be all spec spec. Just my 2 cents.
---
&gt;caster mail 
---
XD
---
Where did you play in vanilla? I started playing a few months after release and was corpse camped every step of the way. My first WSG ever was my first introduction to "twinks" running around with fiery swords and I remember being genuinely scared of them. Maybe on EU servers it wasn't common or something, but it has always, always been a part of WoW.
---
Crossrealm wasn't in for BGs for a long time, several expansions at least.
---
I don't understand those images. The second one only shows 19 players, where are the other 21?
---
I was just reminiscing about super jail with my friend today. Love it.
---
There is no discussion to be had, ret is a meme spec for raiding, this was just a post to laugh at it.
---
We plan to go for: https://classicdb.ch/?item=4983
---
Found the liberal.
---
Lol, you must be fun at parties.
---
Pro tip: If you /w a member of the opposite faction and they're offline it will say no players found. If they're online it'll say you can only whisper members of your alliance.
---
This is the only good post. Ever.
---
You‚Äôre very welcome, glad you‚Äôre enjoying the throwback lore.
---
No they aren't.  Anyone playing a hybrid that can heal that thinks they aren't a healer are the ones in for a rude awakening.
---
There will be too many hunters as is so they better be willing or they will have a hard time finding a guild after bwl.
---
+healing is indeed the king of stats for pve holy paladin, as it allows you to substitute holy lights with flash of lights, meaning +healing gives both a hps increase, but also a massive increase in the average heal per mana.  Resulting in far more then you could ever gain in int/mp5 focused gear setups.
---
For pvp the +healing is far less important as you spend far more of your time casting other utility spells and far more of your healing is done via holy light since you will typically be without without blessing of light, the bursty nature of pvp damage, and debuffs like mortal strike will make flash of light insufficient in a lot of scenarios.
---
So if you pvp and pve a lot, you typically have a 2 sets of healing gear. 
---
 
---
The Pvp set of is focused on int/stam heavy gear that only has +healing as a side stat along mp5 and crit.  With added value for having a bit off offensive stats and higher armor.  This is basically exactly what the paladin raid tier 1 and tier 2 sets look like with you only wear less then plate early on before you collect your full set from raiding.  
---
The other set for pve raiding is focusing on +healing #1, mana stats like int, mp/5sec, crit being 2nd tier, with stam being an afterthought, and armor being wholly irrelevant.  There are only a few early plate pieces that look like this so you will almost always be downgrading armor tier.  While losing that armor hurts, realize there is no raid fight situation where you should be getting meleed.  In the rare other pve cases, like hectic trash pulls or doing 5mans with suspect tank realize that wearing a shield alone is so much armor as to put you in a plate-esque level of physical damage redux.  You can swap on a shield midcombat so it is only a button press away.  
---
Then tier 3 naxx gear blows everything out of the water by being the marriage of both of these stat priorities and being perfectly itemized for both types of content.
---
just starting to?
---
No, they really won't.
---
TIL, I should stick to easier terms. 
---
"its easy to fuck-up aoe grinding."
---
You are underselling it.
---
Having somebody who keeps the moral high for the other 39 people is really important when the drama starts
---
After this post gets deleted someone is going to take this format, remove the politics, and make a killing in Karma.
---
If you could add r/AzerothNoob that would be great!
---
They can be all that, but with everything we know now, why did they choose to play classic as something that sucks?
---
It could have been a 20-man raid...
---
You don't understand, people don't want to carry meme builds, they want to be carried by OP builds.
---
Lets you mind control mechanical creatures, on a 3min cooldown. You lose control of your character and gain control of them. Their allies will turn on them, and some have cool abilities you get to use. Makes gnomeregan a lot more fun.
---
Has a chance to fail and make them hate you (so tank will have hard time getting them off), so I'd take it on a hunter or rogue that can drop all threat. Enemies kill by a mech you control won't give loot, nor will the controlled mech drop loot if it's killed while you control it. Can use it to soften up a mob pack and drop control before it dies so you don;t miss out on any loot.
---
Shame nothing ever came of that.
---
Orc

---
I would rather carry a fun guy like Esfand than a tryhard nerd that makes everyone miserable.
---
Yeah, better have them bugged when release comes eh?
---
a 20 man raid were the other images shows +25 people
---
We know everything going into classic, You can be reliable, have a good personality, and actually play a role that your class is good at.  Go for 3 out of 3, not 2 out of 3.
---
Dark side of the moonkin
---
Because "nochanges" was always code for "just like my favourite pirate server" for most of them.
---
A few people carried the torch for patch progression from 1.1, which was always a pipe dream.
---
But they all screamed and threatened to shit the bed at any suggestion that maybe Blizzard, if they were going with an eternal 1.12, might want to rebalance the raids to suit that patch. Because the pirate server crowd are used to gearing up by speedrunning an ezmode version of BWL and MC which never existed as progression content in real vanilla, and they never wanted an authentic vanilla experience, they just wanted an officially sanctioned pirate server.
---
So stealth runs are lucrative due to boss vendor-able loot, I'm assuming? As well as a chance for profession recipes, boes, and AH-ables?
---
Did midnight release for WoTLK - showed up around 11:45 so I was 30-40 deep in line.
---
The first 3-4 dudes all came out with their game together, they got in their car leaned out the window and started shouting something stupid like "Enjoy waiting in line fuckers!" and peeled out of the parking lot and fishtailed onto the highway - only to be immediately lit up by the police and pulled over not 50 feet from all of us in line.
---
They were still being ticketed when I had my game was driving home.
---
There were plenty in private servers so we will see. I'd rather have no ret if possible.
---
Clearly,  but I suspect a good majority of us grew up and played when physical copies were faster. Downloading a 40gig file was almost a 2 day affair back then.  I once walked to some random dudes house I met at a party once that I knew played and asked for the discs because it was gonna be a solid 12 hours downloading that shit and I wanted to play!
---
Yes. And not every 40-man raid needs or even wants 40 people. You can pretty much 20-man everything up to AQ40.
---
I didn't even think about this. Sounds like a great tip!
---
It's used for leveling, and a little pvp, maybe some farming.  It should never be used for raiding.
---
Wait don't you mean another horde willing to help you?
---
Yeh those November releases. It was cold, the memories bring back the warmth
---
Shaman, mvp horde
---
And thats why blizzard allows it
---
Hunter then warlock seems to be the rule for first to sixty, followed by druids. Mages could be fastest if they were guaranteed all the best grinding spots uncontested, maybe, but they are a long way from the fastest if they have competition.
---
&gt;get plenty of caster mail
---
I'm pretty sure you're looking at Esfand's private server DPS parses. The joke is just Ret sucks and is piggybacking of Esfands name to catapult into the front page.
---
I'd bet $100 OP is going to be one-man spamming Esfand to check /r/classicwow
---
Why would anyone want to raid as ret considering everything we know now.  They just want to be carried?
---
Ideally one of you is an enchanter. There's also chests and dark iron ore deposits, and the relic coffer.
---
So, if you can do raids with half the people, and still ask for top dps, you are asking to be carried.
---
But people don't like suboptimal builds because they carry those.
---
ROFLMAO
---
So hilarious that‚Äôs legendary. Nerds flexing getting a fucking wow expansion and hit with a driving recklessly ticket. I bet they probably sprouted pubes that night.
---
no changes /s
---
I've been debating this same choice. Either tauren ele shaman or a troll spriest. Not interested in hardcore raiding as I don't really have the time for it so I'll be doing dungeons, wpvp and BG's.
---
Assuming he was using Nightfall, he actually out-dpsed a lot of pure-dps players in these raids.
---
fair, but its literally the entire world on two servers and a gorillion chinese/bots
---
Good meme 5/7.   
---
But keep the garbage american politica out of here. We already hear about it enough, no need to force feed us this shit any more.
---
Yeah, I was pretty confused why u/mightymorp thinks bags will be full when you go out to quest. I can definitely see them filling up faster while you're out questing but that's a whole other matter. (And you could argue that two gathering professions would let you buy bags more quickly thanks to that extra cash money.)
---
They don‚Äôt need a beta full of people to determine if the most basic of encounters ever designed in WoW‚Äôs history are working correctly.
---
Classic raiding isn't difficult. Jesus. I can't wait until the min/maxer crowd burns out and goes the fuck away.
---
Implying that Classic consists of only dungeons and raids.
---
There's a lot of fun shit you can do in Classic even with such a tight schedule. You can quest with people, chat with guildies, run BGs.
---
Really tired of seeing the posts with someone elses art, just with a stupid paint filter. Can you be any more creative?
---
Your just doing this to pick up girls
---
no you didnt
---
it was mathematically impossible by design
---
pserver maybe
---
I used to agree with you, but upon further thinking, I'm on the need-on-boes train. Why?  
---
First, what's the difference between bop and boe items? Sounds simple, but it's important: Bop items can be worn or vendored. Boe can be worn, vendored or traded.  
---
The value difference between wearing and vendoring is very large. 1-3g for vendoring a blue provides almost no value. Equipping an upgrade is huge value. Hence we need/greed on bops. Just because of the large value disparity between vendoring and equipping.  
---
Now, Boes. Boes can also be traded. The value for trading = value for wearing. Why? Because that's the market price of the item. Everyone would need on a 300g drop, because everyone gets equal value from it. A boe is a pile of money, interchangeable, this is only because you can trade it. As a result, the value from wearing and the value from trading is the same. Hence, we roll need on Boes.
---
This is are very valid points. Back in the days, i was playing a LOT. On pve and on pvp realms. PVE is a way better experience overall. PVP can be fun, but most of the time it isnt. 
---
PVP realms attract all the human scum, thats only there to grief and make other people¬¥s life miserable. 
---
I remember clearly, i once rerolled on a fresh realm (German realm terrodar, i joined and leveled on its opening an alliance). 
---
It turned out to be 80 % Horde. 
---
As alliance warrior , i tried to farm some trolls for the whirlwind axe quest in stv. 
---
I went on stubborn mode, and counted the ganks and the time i needed to reach the stv coastline where the trolls life, from darkshore entrance. 
---
I needed more than 3 hours and 37 times ganked to make a way that normally takes you less than 5 minutes.
---
  This was on a fresh realm, the guys were not higher lvl or whatever.
---
Iit was just that every few meters, there was a group of horde hunting every single alliance they met. Pvp realms become unplayable if they get out of balance pop wise, and over time, nearly every single wow realm in history became out of balance factionwise. 
---
 My Main realm from classic for example has over 20 k max level alliance, and less than 50 horde characters, which mostly are twinks.
---
 Pvp realms will, over time, always end in beeing basically one faction dominating the other, and wiping the weaker faction out. Most of the times, the weaker faction will be alliance, because of will of the forsaken beeing the biggest gamechanger in  wow. Half the classes use fear as their major defensive, and horde pvp charakters are immune to fear baseline. thats why all the pvp kiddies and gankers will be on their ud rogue.
---
Now, if u want PVP in terms of Skill and show-off your mastery of your class and gear, than u can do this perfectly on a  pve realm: Duels with high caliber players, bgs, u even can enable /pvp on pve realms, so that u can fight against other players, if they agree.  Pve realms offer everything that pvp realms do, minus the gankers wasing your time.
---
Did you do this on a pserver? Because I think they are right that you couldn't do this on retail vanilla. Unless it was changed in a patch but I didn't see anything in the patch notes.
---
RENT
---
FREE
---
You're not wrong but keep in mind that for a lot of people the game doesn't begin at level 60. Engineering is by far the most fun profession and you lose out on a lot of that fun if you don't level it alongside your toon.
---
I remember the BC release. Walmart didn't do pre-orders so it was first-come first-served. We went to a Walmart deep in rural country. We were the only ones there and walked out at 12:03AM with our copies and a short 15 minute drive home to install. We passed a Gamestop on the way home with a line around the building of people waiting to get their copy. Felt good.
---
Did you actually think I‚Äôm saying your bags are going to be full every time you leave town? No, your bags are going to be full when you‚Äôre out doing quests, because they are going to be full of a variety of shit after 10 minutes.
---
Yes
---
holy nova farming is OP
---
It's a support class. If he's using Nightfall, he wasn't really carried. And yes, people will bring other people THEY LIKE into raids, regardless of their spec.
---
I'd rather spend 3 hours in a raid with a Ret Paladin that's a solid guy, makes the raid fun and enjoyable, and feels like a friend than some no-life, shits on everyone that isn't min/maxed to the teeth, Rogue/Mage/Warrior only, piece of shit that complains about loot not dropping and mentions how everything was different on PServers every fucking 5 minutes.
---
That isn't what you said, though. You said his bags will be full every time he goes out to quest. You can go back and reread your post if you'd like.
---
Even a lot of the people that did play warcraft didn't like it because it went from being a little joke to being a full on expansion.
---
Why on earth would your bags be full if you just mailed/vendored all your shit?
---
Because the legendary axe that shamans use it going to be used on a hunter in an alliance raid.
---
use two accounts
---
I'd rather take a Ret Paladin I like than you who demands a Hunter just spam one useless ability for hours every night.
---
Classic isn't difficult. Stop trying to min/max every tiny little fucking thing like it is.
---
Contacting my attorney as we speak
---
You tell me. That's what the rest of us are saying. If you meant that he shouldn't take two gathering professions because his bags will fill up faster, sure, you have a good point. But what you said was that his bags will be full when he decides to go out and quest which is.. a weird thing to say.
---
Why does less downtime matter if you kill less mobs in the same amount of time as arms/fury would've? Also, as if tanking while leveling with arms isn't perfectly viable. Rage management and stance mastery are really good.
---
TFT is still warcraft 3, mate.
---
If you decide on a pve server you are most likely gonna regret it once you hit 60. All the negatives are worth it when you're 60. If you get corpse camped. Take a break, or logg another character.
---
Raid/dungeon testing is most likely being done internally/F&amp;F.
---
Can‚Äôt you just log out in the instance and sign back in? You‚Äôll pop up at the front entrance unless I‚Äôm mis-remembering.
---
They are getting their own servers though...based in EU with nice low ping. They‚Äôre just not getting language based. Big difference. Also what are you even basing this number off? How would you even know oceanic population lol
---
No it isn't difficult, is that an excuse to play a meme spec and get carried?
---
&gt; Did you do any calculations on how long itll take?  
---
One does not gaze into that abyss and keep their sanity intact. 
---
2 years to get all to 60 is my estimate. Could do it in 1 but all the crafting, fishing, messing around, that stuff will eat up a lot of time. That and having some life outside of the game, so maybe 3 years.
---
I mean, you said it. Why would someone leave town with a full bag? No one would, so why on earth would I be suggesting that?
---
Cenarion Circle and Warsong are already realm names.
---
Yes, they instead had an increase in stealth detection. But Diplomacy has been in since launch and THAT is the most OP racial in the game. An extra 10% to all rep gains? Yes please.
---
I'm rolling a mage first to have the option of aoe grinding. Playing the AH will be a big part it because that is what I have always done. I use to make a lot of gold off the patch notes and how it changes the demand of items, so I'll try to do that with the content releases.
---
&gt; i just cant stand other classes and specs in wow
---
What's awesome about holy priest?  
---
I'm in love with holy nova, myself. Was really disapointed when they took it away.
---
There is a twink tag, but as you have noticed, the site is very new, so no twink builds yet. When more builds have been added, you can search builds by tag and only see twink builds.
---
On mobile when you tap on an item it will take you to a fullscreen tooltip, but there is an x in the top right to close the tooltip view. Let me know if this is not appearing.
---
Since you mentioned twinking, I wanted to make sure you knew that you can change the level on the BiS search. So you can look for the best items for whatever level you are twinking at.
---
Isn't release the worst time to be doing this?
---
ooops
---
Regardless of the intention, Kung Fu Panda was a Panda that did martial arts. MoP introduced.... Pandas that do martial arts. The theme is too similar imo, and made it hard to take seriously. All my friends quit in wrath/cata and there was no way I could get them to come back for the "Kung Fu Panda" expansion, even though it was a good expansion.
---
Ret Paladins bring more to the table than just their DPS. I'm pretty sure they have the highest proc rate for Nightfall as well.
---
Why would someone be talking about private serevrs every 5 minutes in classic?  This is oddly specific.  Nightfall is for a warrior.  I'd rather play with the guy that knows ret is retarded, is still a solid guy, makes the raid fun and enjoyable, feels like a friend, and doesn't want to be carried.
---
Illidan wasn't an established villain... Yes, he did turn himself into a demon which is forbidden by the night elves.. but he kind of also saved them and did some really good work against the burning legion. He was chaotic good. He still did good things and was a good character overall, even if he broke the laws and traditions of his people.
---
&gt;Of course you're going to mail shit to an alt, that doesn't change anything. Your bags are gonna be full every time you go out to quest. 
---
Do you not remember saying this? It reads like you could have meant one of two things. 1.) That your bags will be full when you go out to quest, which is a weird thing to say. Or 2.) That your bags will quickly fill up with all those things you've gathered and you'll have no bag space. But considering that is exactly what you want with two gathering professions.. it's a weird thing to say. No one ever says, "Oh no! I have too many items gathered to sell! What will I do with all this gold I'm going to make on the AH? Woe is me!"
---
If he was using Nightfall in these raids, he wasn't the one being carried. Many of the pure DPS was.
---
 üëÄ
---
it's not too bad if a guy gets 1 or 2 levels ahead if something like that happens - off time is also great for leveling professions. 
---
I've noticed this subreddit really doesn't like content creators.
---
They had perception, rep and spirit bonuses, and the weapon skills. All pretty strong racials.
---
Alliance only. Horde has no equivalent.
---
Yes. I'd rather carry a friend and know everyone is having fun than deal with someone that thinks everything in their little Classic bubble has to belong on a spreadsheet somewhere.
---
We had a large group of friends going to a GameStop during wotlk. We were so pumped. 
---
We go to our 7-11 down the street to buy our drinks and snacks. We notice... For some fucking reason. This 7-11 had the physical copies of wotlk. Obviously we all bought them there. Then went home and pre downloaded it. Couldn't play until release. But we were ready for it. We had a little nice head start. 
---
Now obviously now I'd rather do a big physical copy event. But that was a moment in time when we found a unuiqe opportunity.
---
Actually lol‚Äôd
---
I already told you, ret is a meme and is always being carried, there is never a reason to have one unless you are desperate to fill a spot, nightfall or otherwise.  Your warriors can nightfall, problem solved.
---
Just because someone doesn't like a game doesn't mean they are retarded/braindead or whatever. 
---
First impressions are important in video games and, let's be honest, Vanilla doesn't meet those standards in the modern world. 
---
It will be very hard to pull anyone into Classic who is used to instant gratification.
---
Yeah, woe is you. Good thing you‚Äôve got a portable AH bot and mailbox following you everywhere you go so you won‚Äôt ever have any bag space problems. That‚Äôs the entire point. When you‚Äôre out questing with 2 gathering professions you **will** have to delete items with regularity to make room. If that‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt want to fuck with, consider not rolling with two gathering professions.
---
Stay mad and downvoting my dude, doesn't change the fact that ret is a meme spec.  Plenty of us will be having fun in our raids without one.
---
Because many players will not know that the spec sucks, and will have dumped 30+ hours into a character they would rather not waste. Sure, they could roll holy, but if I built a paladin because I wanted to be a holy warrior, I‚Äôm going to play as a holy warrior ‚Äî despite how shitty it really is.
---
You can view active playerbases seen in the last 30 days for almost every week. Germany consistently has 2.5 to 3 players for every 1 Oceanic player. And there's no argument that Oceania is going to have more players return for Classic than Germany, so yes, the percentages are relevant.
---
And you have less than a 200ms ping to LA. World of Warcraft considers anything less than 200 to be "good", especially in a game where the server has a 400ms artificial heartbeat to mimic 2004.
---
I hope I'm wrong and that Oceania gets a server, but I doubt I am.
---
If only you'd been this clear from the beginning. No one is disagreeing that if you're gathering twice as many mats that your bags will fill up twice as quickly.
---
That's not true.
---
It‚Äôs called social interaction. People want to associate themselves with people they think enjoyable. Surprise, but it happens in vidya gayme communities too
---
I was pretty clear about that point if you weren‚Äôt trying to pedantic solely for the purpose of trying to argue. Context clues, get em.
---
Most of that gear isn't available until the end of vanilla.
---
They won't know the spec sucks even though it has been proven to suck for 15 years and theorycrafted to death and all they would have to do to save themselves a ton of wasted time is google it for 5 minutes?  Ok.
---
Great info, thank you.
---
I believe the reputation will be available in phase 1, but the quests will not be.
---
Flex does work in normal and heroic now and mythic is scaled for exactly 20 players.
---
Yeah if your raiding experience was completely mundane and non-interactive, which implies yours was. I apologize
---
No solo life, holy priest are group, as in in high demand. You will have groups
---
He doesn‚Äôt go to them
---
It's a game. An easy game at that. The most important thing is for people to have fun with their friends. I get that the beta and the game's pending release has everyone stir crazy, but if people don't stop trying to shit on everyone else for doing what defines fun for them, then all of your servers are going to be empty and Blizzard will just shut Classic down.
---
You want all the noobs, you want all the meme specs, you want Retail players. And none of them really want you.
---
people love this Warrior leveling circle-jerk. 
---
My main in Vanilla was a Warrior, it wasn't terrible at all. Slower leveling than some other classes for sure. But it's just become a thing for people to go on about.
---
As great as +ws is for raids if you go dwarf then you can just prioritise daggers instead and have an (arguably) easier time fighting for loot.
---
I'm not trying to argue with you, Morp. If I had to guess, you're one of the, "race to 60" guys, though, right? If I had to guess a second time, I'd assume OP is not. Two gathering professions is absolutely fine and acceptable for more casual players and is a great way to make gold while you level or to store mats for later on. And your wording absolutely was ambiguous. 
---
&gt;Your bags are gonna be full every time you go out to quest.
---
&gt; here is never a reason to have one 
---
Wrong, it's called enjoying the company of someone that plays Ret.
---
That's the only reason you need in Classic because none of the min/maxing fucking matters. It's the easiest WoW that ever existed.
---
As much as I wish that‚Äôd happen I don‚Äôt think it will
---
I wasn't suggest you play 30mins every day, I'm just talking about the average. You play and hour here and there during the work week, and a few longer sessions on the weekend and you can get your money's worth. 
---
Also if you have friends or a guild you can schedule stuff and not have to wait around. In my guild that I have with friends I've known since TBC, most everyone has families and jobs, and so we'll usually just schedule when we're all going to be on so we're not wasting time.
---
all of the people invited were subscribers.  Meaning they all were to a degree still interested in BFA, and thus its not surprising when 8.2 comes out that most would abandon beta for 8.2.  Particularly when they've wrung the content out of beta and are sitting on essentially BIS setups.
---
To think I watched that cinematic almost daily given how epic I thought it was, to manage to wait for the xpac itself.   
---
It felt even more horrible when I realized that max level content was Alterac Bus 2.0 and /sit in your Garrison waiting for your dudes to return.
---
Boring as hell
---
I don‚Äôt give a rats ass about racing to 60. The average joe is the one that‚Äôs going to struggle with bag space. My wording wasn‚Äôt ambiguous at all if you‚Äôve actually bothered to read the first line where I openly acknowledged that you would be clearing out your bags (mailing shit to your alt) every time you could. If you were doing that, how would you be leaving town with a full bag? Cmon.
---
I bought an origin access basic pass for 5/month which gives me access to titanfall 2, BFV, and Battlefront 2. Pretty fun games so far.
---
BG II
---
IWD
---
Total War Warhammer 1 and 2
---
I don't even know what that means.  Ret is a proven terrible raid spec, that is the bottom line.  Why anyone would want to raid as it, I have no idea.  If you want to play with friends who want to raid as that, cool, have fun.
---
I played CoH when it "came back" for a bit. The game is basically a light distraction though and it's community is like seeing a Furry at a convention ... you smile politely, while fighting the urge to run far, far away.
---
So, it's nothing until launch. I reduce mmorpg playing in summer anyway so it's fine.
---
No, more likely is their toxic "we need every tenth of a degree of DPS from every single person in the raid" is going to drive out all the noobs, all the casuals, all the Retail dabblers, and all the meme spec good guys.
---
And then they'll be left alone, complaining that Blizzard never gave Classic a fair shot after they announce they're shutting the servers down after 2 years of ever-dwindling playerbases.
---
The leveling was good actually but ... it's like they ran out of time to do anything interesting for max level.   
---
Because /sit in your Garrison and farming the same 16 Apexis dailies isn't content.   
---
I mean I kinda expected Netherstorm to be a max level zone introduced in a later patch. But ... nah. Never happened.
---
It does annoy me that people throw out ret paladins as completely unviable for raids. Do you want more than one? No. But one isn‚Äôt going to kill your raid.
---
Off healing, lay on hands, self heal, more health+armor, etc. make them decent in a raid.
---
I think Classic PvE will actually be a bunch of cool older guys who value their free time and have their priorities straight. And I like that. Personally, I‚Äôm inclined to play PvE also due to all the ‚ÄúPvP for life‚Äù rant. If people know PvP is clearly the way to go, why do they lose their time showing disrespect to players who don‚Äôt share their view... I don‚Äôt say it‚Äôs always the case, but it makes me think the idea of luring more and more casual players so there‚Äôs enough fodder is a distinct possibility. Either way, good points op.
---
I have no idea why you'd be leaving town with a full bag. That's why we were confused. We can't read your mind, only your words. Have a good night, Morp.
---
When I've leveled prot I usually start going for anger management, then cruelty in fury to lessen ragestarving (i feel like these are a must in every build) before going into prot. It doesn't matter a whole lot, I guess it's just a preference and I don't like dying hehe. All I'm trying to say is that a lot of people are trying to make warriors out to be a worse leveling experience than I feel they are. And if you're like me, slow and steady wins the race, then deep prot is fantastic for leveling
---
Not everyone who will play classic lurks r/classicwow and/or has played the game for 15 years. These will be realizations made all over again.
---
What matters to you might not matter to someone else.  Ret is mathematically proven to be a terrible raiding spec, if that doesn't matter to you and you want to play with people who want to play it, have fun, more power to you.  Many guilds won't even allow it.  Many guilds will.  Doesn't matter to me, but you can't say it is a good raiding spec, and that is the point of this post, that ret is shit and it's funny.
---
I‚Äôve been playing Teamfight Tactics
---
*woman
---
It is so extremely annoying and sad. People are either playing alts (I am), or not logging in at all. The level cap has destroyed all motivation for the remaining players. You cannot find any groups to do anything. If you group up once for questing, that is a once-in-a-lifetime event, since normally you spend 1-40 completely alone.
---
There is nothing on the AH - want to test if Goblin jumper cables really "scale with engineering skill", like some old comments claim? Better level mining yourself. Invisibility potions supposedly can make you lose aggro in instances, but would you like to test that? Better level herbalism, cause youre not getting any herbs on the AH.
---
Or tre classic warrior discord has a lot of things to test rel√∂ating to weapon skill, Berserker stance crit suppression on +3 mobs, but there are literally only five people with beta access and they get burnt out from all the +weapon skill testing and logging thousands of hits in every single situation.
---
Amd mobs are missing spells
---
Not wanting to compete with themselves sounds fairly plausible actually.  Hmm...
---
A good portion is the same player base.
---
This ^
---
The problem is you didn‚Äôt read all the words, just whichever ones you found convenient enough to make an argument out of. The exact same you did when you just ignored my statement about why it would make no sense that I‚Äôd be suggesting your bags would be full when I already admitted you‚Äôd be mailing stuff to alts.
---
But I understand it‚Äôs easier to dodge than to admit you missed it.
---
Football manager
---
Then help spread the word that ret is fucking garbage, save people a headache.  Do your part.
---
Nope, they don't have a spam able attack for more chance at procing it like wars a d hunters do.
---
When TBC was announced, but the new races were still not announced and speculation was rampant, lots of people were speculating pandaren. Blizzard came out and said padaren were never going to be a playable race.
---
Destiny 2
---
They already confirmed the fact that there will be Oceanic Classic servers of some sort. 
---
We're in the bottom of the planet, pretty far off US and EU, which makes latency-sensitive gameplay difficult. I imagine they were attentive to that.
---
am a straight chick - may have been partially trying to catch the attn of geeky dudes; no shame
---
Why would there be a demand for Princess runs?
---
&gt; They already confirmed the fact that there will be Oceanic Classic servers of some sort.
---
Do you have a source for this? Because I went looking HARD after they made the EU announcement and found nothing.
---
For day drinking?
---
&gt; Flex raiding was awesome - it should have just been combined with normal/heroic (whatever the fuck its called now), Mythic should remain for the more hardcore players.
---
That's.. how it is. Normal and Heroic is flexible from 10-25 players, and Mythic is a strict 20 man so the new mechanics can be designed with that strict scale in mind.
---
You know it
---
As someone who has played PoE for years and years, yes.
---
If you are taking a hunter for your main just take 2 more warriors, 1 pally/shaman, and a priest healer.
---
Private servers
---
And yet with Nightfall, he was doing more damage than several mages, rogues, warlocks, and warriors.
---
OR I can let people play the game however they want? Yeah let me go ahead and force new players how to play and force their experience to adhere to what I think is ‚Äúright‚Äù.
---
Man you‚Äôre just an uptight angry man-child aren‚Äôt ya. Go to sleep you slimy little cockroach
---
I wasn't trying to make an argument. I didn't even respond to you initially. Someone else did and I piggybacked on them because it genuinely sounded like you were saying your bags would be full (of who knows what) when you decide to go out and quest. I read that you said you'd mail stuff out, but it sounded like, in spite of that, you were saying his bags would be full. You easily could have said, "With all the materials you gather, your bags will be filling up and you will have less room for quest items which will slow your leveling down." But instead you said, 
---
I understand now what you were trying to say, but it wasn't clear from your posts, especially since that was never my experience while leveling up as a skinning/herbalist druid in vanilla.
---
Accept whatever appear, just get the name and try to remake it later carefully (gambly ~)
---
I agree.
---
Oh man I love PvP! and world PvP. The uncertainty of how a fight will turn out, if someone else will show.. It's a blast!!!
---
I just wanted to offer my point of view on PvP servers after playing on one. W PvP will happen even when you don't want to. From my humble perspective many people didn't think about that when rolling on one.
---
If you go dwarf know if you join a progression raiding guild you'll likely be pigeon holed into daggers.
---
Gul‚Äôdan will always be my favorite Warcraft character. He‚Äôs got an incredible presence and a mind of pure, self-absorbed evil. I love a good, psychologically complex antagonist as much as the next guy, but in a setting like Warcraft there really is nothing quite as delightfully terrifying than an orc that would sell out his entire people for even the slightest sliver of power.
---
I even loved him in WoD and the movie. But, I think it goes without saying that Old‚Äôdan is best ‚Äòdan.
---
Dota underlords and Don't starve together
---
Honestly i never ready any of the books in my 10+ years of playing wow. I starter listening to audiobooks on my way to work or before i slept etc. Its an absolute game changer man. Makes you understand so much more about why the people are who they are in game. Highly highly reccomend to audiobook the books if your not into physically reading. You can find alot of the books on youtube for free. Seriously a game changer
---
Warcraft 3
---
I‚Äôm subbed and ready to test at any time. They should expand the beta but not bring cap to max.
---
I aim to be a world raid boss and kill everyone all the time.
---
Yeah, but good luck convincing a Warrior or Hunter to sit there and spam a no-damage attack for every fight for 3 hours.
---
If you liked the illidan...check out arthas...such an amazing read. Loved illidan too btw
---
This is a great guide, especially regarding totem twisting.  I remember using this twisting technique not only in WoW but carried it over to Rift when I raided as a bard/support soul.  Twisting to ensure up time and buff overlaps was really rewarding and hilarious when the fury warrior would shoot out the top of the threat metre because he couldn't control his aggro with windfury.
---
My first two mains were priests and I never did the respec dance. I don't remember being holy as being that big of a deal. I wasn't in a progression guild most of the time so I didn't do the consumables grind and that helped. I opted to do more instance runs than grinding for gold. I did tailoring and enchanting too. 
---
I probably lost more open world PvP than I won, but it wasn't so bad that I would hide from it either. I was a real anoyance in battle grounds but most battles were decided by who got reinforcements sooner. Being a pocket healer for a warrior in AV was always fun. 
---
I will roll a priest again but I think it will be my second main this time. It wasn't bad as a priest when that was all I knew, but I became an altaholic in later expansions and other classes make grinding easy mode in comparison.
---
I‚Äôm working my ass off and saving up money. Any game I play won‚Äôt hook me. I‚Äôm already sold on classic
---
It's not that they are "unviable", anything is viable, it's that they could simply be playing holy.  It is like a mage speccing fire in MC or something, why are they doing it?  Every class has their best raiding spec (except warriors who are vanilla gods and both the best dps and best tanks) so unless you are absolutely desperate to fill a dps spot, you just want your paladins to be holy.
---
But it's Chuck Norris who made the dinosaurs extinct.
---
Just level an alt or something, man.  
---
The fact that you can't just mindlessly walk around the world is one of the primary appeals of a PVP realm, man.
---
AY MON STAY AWAY FROM DA VOODOO
---
oh no!  I‚Äôm doing it completely wrong then!  hah.  Paragons is the only Warcraft book I‚Äôve read prior.
---
I suddenly became hungry for Warcraft lore early this year - in anticipation of Classic.  I‚Äòd been really enjoying lore podcasts, but realIzed there were so many references I didn‚Äôt understand.
---
I‚Äôm greatly enjoying Chronicle thus far as a wide overview of mythos &amp; history ‚Äî then, I suppose, as I come across certain events or characters that I find particularly fascinating, I can seek further literature on those.
---
*I will not be denied.*
---
This line really stuck out to me as a kid. Gul‚Äôdan is going to get what he wants. It‚Äôs not a question of if, it‚Äôs a question of when. He will accept nothing less, and will gladly burn the world to ash in the process if need be.
---
Lok'tar Ogar, friend!
---
but you need 5 tokens worth of gold, so you need to divide the 160k by 5 to get 32k /h. So overall you can make 60% more gold per hour relatively.
---
Pandaren were literally first announced as an april fools joke between WC3 and its expansion.
---
While I know this, they still would have 1000% made a better neutral race than pandaren
---
I‚Äôve heard the name, I‚Äôm sure there will be a version for the classic launch. Will have to keep an eye out for it.
---
Where do you fit the spouse and kids
---
If you're running loot council, warriors will beat rogues.
---
If not, whoever has top tier weapons first generally will be top dps.
---
Warrior in BiS is top dps.
---
I still remember the WotLK release pretty well.  Did the whole thing, got there late, waited in line, made my purchase at 12am.  Then promptly went home and played for six hours straight before going directly to work.  Ended up falling asleep at work for like an hour in the store's office because I was so exhausted from playing all night.  Good times!
---
Don't listen to that guy. If you're smart about mailing stuff to an alt and always cleaning bags when turning in and picking up quests, you'll never have a problem. Sometimes you'll have to destroy a grey item or two but who cares?
---
Skinning is game changing for level 40 mount.
---
I don't think anyone who remembers being on a pvp server sugar coats it at all. Why do you think people call stv stvietnam? Maybe I've just been in a different subreddit this whole time
---
Not really, very few people ever saw this.
---
The lore, environment, and artstyle felt VERY out of place. It was a fun expansion but it just felt so strange. Plus it really went deep into the time travel bullshit that ruined the lore of wow (it started with cata but it wasn't until panda that it really started going off the rails and into the clusterfuck that was WoD's 2-universe lore).
---
It was the Warcraft version of anime filler. Literally nothing important happened. All the events were self-contained and it was very clearly PANDARIN (ha) to the growing Chinese PC market.
---
If you download the linked files they will work in Classic when it comes out. I have tested it a little in BFA and on PS. Some of the textures drop out in BFA but on the PS they are all good. I intend to test it in Classic on the next stress test to make sure. I will update the files if necessary, so you can check back if you want.
---
You can give them the information and let them decide for themselves, at least they won't have an excuse that they didn't know when they find out there is no raid spots for ret pallies.  I didn't do this.  This is just the way vanilla WOW is.  Stay mad at me though lol
---
Just finished Warcraft 3, now onto Mario Maker 2. Messing around a bit on PS as well. If I need something else, might pick up Judgement and/or Fire Emblem in July.
---
False, it just works differently. If you are in a party with your own alt (use a guildie as proxy to invite alt):
---
1.  Log off main
---
2. Log onto alt
---
3. Run resetinstances script
---
4. Log off alt
---
5. Log back in. Main is teleported to the front of a reset instance.
---
Glad you like it! Is that a shot from BFA? There are some parts of the main menu bar on the right that must be named differently in retail. The pieces around the bag slots (the metal ones) will use the correct textures in Classic.

Man I love booty bay!

Is there a good build that works for both PvP and PvE? I‚Äôve seen a 20/0/31 build that seems to work well, wondering if there are any other ones that work as well. Going to be relatively casual overall and planning on hitting both PvP and PvE and don‚Äôt want to have to respec super often. 
---
On a related note, if I do end up wanting to go harder into things, do I need to spec full Holy? Or does a hybrid still work?
---
Have fun struggling in naxx because you want to being useless people to raid.

I‚Äôve been playing BFA. It‚Äôs actually... really fun. I‚Äôm surprised how different some things are and sometimes I feel like there‚Äôs just so much to do I could never play it competitively or as a completionist, but I‚Äôm still enjoying it.
---
Classic brought me back, but after a year or so, if Retail launches a new expansion that does any sort of reset or compromise to attract Classic players, I‚Äôll probably be one of the one‚Äôs to switch. Which is exactly Blizzard‚Äôs plan.
---
Don‚Äôt worry I will. You sound like a real queef to be around
---
With totem twisting you can drop both totems, as windfury buff lasts 8 seconds if I recall correctly.
---
Uther and Arthas's conversation in that book about being ready / worthy of the light is quite possibly one of my favorite conversations in WoW lore, so cool! üòç
---
A Dwarf rogue with find treasure on , sneaking past 20 mobs to grab a chest deep in an enemy stronghold while other players laboriously fight their way trough mobs and get there too late...it just feels so right. Add Stoneform in the mix and I feel like it's a thing of beauty.
---
You‚Äôre competing against thousands on that two weeks before release reservation day. So what would you rather do, customize your character and waste valuable seconds to lock in your character name...
---
or 
---
skip the customization at that time and just name your character, then on release do the customizing.
---
One of them has a lot more risk to lose your character name. Seems pretty logical which is the right choice. Unless you‚Äôre saying to not customize on release day at all and wait a couple days before doing so... but wtf would you wait a couple days to play your character unless you don‚Äôt care about not playing on release day.
---
Honestly, I feel like Blizzard uses april fools jokes to gauge reaction to things they actually wanna do. How many things that were previously april fools jokes ended up being real at some point?
---
The best part of vanilla wow was camping lowbies for hours on end with my decked out rogue. Knowing they still cry about it 15 years later is the icing on the cake
---
Why do you people turn WoW into a job instead of a game?
---
love this anecdote, thank you for sharing - will definitely look that one up.
---
Yup. And druids, and ele/resto shaman
---
Lmfao literally nobody has ever had a reputation ruined for killing too many of the other faction. This is made up 100%
---
If people are that afraid of WPvP then I guess they should all roll paladins. That extra mount speed aura got me out of being camped countless times back in vanilla.
---
BFA only for the sole fact to grind battered hilts in order to purchase tokens before classic launches.
---
lolret
---
I definitely felt like a dope lugging this thing around - but worth it
---
the community in general liked them in wc3, that was the reason why they were included, nothing to do with Jack Black (?) especially considering what happened in mop
---
So Warlock then.
---
back when esfand was on pservers he had his whole guild dedicate PI infusions on him to boost his DPS.  
---
The majority of people in the guild were just utter crap. 
---
They ended up disbanding before they downed chromaggus in BWL.
---
Also,  the person that's been constantly advising people avoid "Illegal Pirate Servers"  NEVER STOPPED PLAYING ON THEM  sooooooooooo.............

It sounds like this guy is afraid everybody will roll on PVP servers leaving him in the dust with his underpopulated server.  Why do you care what server I play? Its very clear you are trying to "persuade" people to roll PVE.  
---
The true vanilla experience is meant to be played on a PVP server, PVE is for carebears, getting ganked is part of the fun.  Don't want to spend time Wpvping? ok then corpse run and avoid getting ganked.  Nobody is gonna gank you specifically for 2 hours straight, they cant even if they wanted to, just run into the dungeon you are trying to do.
---
Or be the raid leader!
---
I really do not enjoy PVP in any way, shape, or form. But PVP servers will still have a higher population of players, so thats the deciding factor for me.
---
How long did it take you to choose the background song?
---
I played a while on a PS, from lvl 30-35ish people began /w me to join dungeon runs, as well when I hit 60. It‚Äôs a pretty neat future of player interactions where I felt appreciated and needed in such a huge world.
---
Closest thing I could find was an old list of restricted Hunter pet names from 2010 compiled by curious programmers. I‚Äôm pretty sure the filter list is crazy long by now and Blizzard will never release it.

Imagine thinking you‚Äôll actually get banned for buying gold lmao. Really, think about it for more than 30 sec. You really think blizzard gives a shit? Or that they could identify gold buyers without a huge number of false positives?
---
bruh
---
Really? So they just dot up for sw and then heal? I mean I could live with that if I'm getting dps gear still.

Hi, /u/Maxlu96

Unfortunately your post has been removed by our AutoModerator because it was thought to be low effort.
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c79w43/when_does_being_oom_as_the_different_healer/). 
---
As much as I like wpvp, my only hold back on playing a pvp server is the main I‚Äôm going to be maining a priest and doing healing. Never pvp server with a healer so I‚Äôm inexperienced with it.
---
I absolutely can't believe the amount of people that were upset about this. The game was online and required CONSTANT maintenance and it was pretty blatantly obvious AND they added a fair amount of content over the years.
---
If it costs lots of money to keep my game running well and to add content over time then I'm happy to pay a sub and keep any cash shop shit out, that stuff ruins my immersion.
---
I cant hate on a man for having fun.  Some people only care about numbers and raidlogs, when vanilla wow was never about numbers or clearing this raid 15min faster.  Maybe the same type of person that judges a person based on the type of car they drive.  Lets stop telling eachother how to live their lives.  I hope classic reminds people what online gaming is all about.
---
What? Literally never seen anyone multibox more than 2 people on a pserver. Even dual boxing is rare as any form of multi boxing is banned on most servers. 
---
The only people that multibox this many people are the occasional rich retail players.
---
I was gonna play a wow song which i should of but this was on the YouTube recommended and it‚Äôs been a pretty nice summer soooooo
---
and the few who did get that sword went on an endless goose chase trying to transform it because one NCP said that a son was still alive in Outland. The devs even said it was a mistake.
---
But the Idea of going back to low level dungeons for cinematic stuff is rather engaging.
---
Same exact race choices for me too
---
I'd be down to raid a decent amount though. Mostly to get gear to pvp tho.
---
The whole WoW Classic is a repost from 2004
---
You obviously have never played on classic/timelocked/progression type servers before.
---
In general, i do agree. but its not really what i am after here.  
---
Guilds are fun and social, but it does consist of a bigger group of people, when i am in fact mostly looking for a select few to be closer with. lvl, do dungeons and pvp... the sort.  
---
While a guild could provide an enviroment and a way to acess a "pool" of people i could develop such bonds with, they are in my experience way more fleeting - in contrast to a more tight knit personal bond
---
Funny meme but I give it only 9/11
---
I have the dungeon companion, it‚Äôs actually a pretty decent guide book to vanilla. I‚Äôm looking forward to putting it to use with instance content.
---
I don't know if I'll be selling the potions, but I'm hoping to make a good bit of gold selling Oily Blackmouth.
---
It's exercise, and at a lot of places it can be quite exhausting. Exercise REALLY helps with your mood and mood control. Martial arts also help with body control and learning to control your body helps you learn to control other parts of yourself like your mood.
---
Hollow Knight, Cave Story+, and Mordhau

5 ele shamans used to be strong for 5 boxing. Chain lightning x5 and Chan heal x 5 is pretty powerful. I can‚Äôt remember the forum that I used to browse. 
---
Google search it, had lots of info.
---
It was a sarcastic question, with Horde only having two classes with any use at all for spell damage mail.
---
Remember when Beta was the finished product (minus a few bugs that they quickly  fixed when discovered)  and was used to advertise the game ?
---
I can guarentee you it will go live with an excessive ammount of bugs that will disrupt gameplay.
---
&gt;tfw no pet named megatron

LOTRO, trying to get to max in the meantime. It's slower than WoW
---
It's not a mid life crisis if that's just how you live. You probably won't have that because I would imagine those tend to have something to do with pent up frustration over not making the choices you want in order to have more stability.
---
Bookmark the download link at the top of this page. I intend to keep it going for Classic and if I need to make any updates I will place a new version in the same location.
---
No other race lets you sport a ridiculous hot pink villain stash and pointy gelled hair. Roll a gnome, become the Pink Pulverizer, and strike fear into the hearts of the Horde.
---
Do you need to do the quests while they are level appropriate or can you go back to them?
---
There‚Äôs a guy named Furyswipes that 40-boxes on Pservers all the time. His YpuTube channel is full of tutorials and people asking him detailed enough questions to suggest they do it as well.
---
To be honest their models did not help. They were definitely more Po-like than the warriors from Samwise Didier's artworks.
---
Not sure if epl is 40g/hr.  First, the bats cast terrible debuffs for melee players and they slow and fear.  Other stuff is true though
---
Interesting, I'm starting to wonder if it's accurate now. I can only find non-blue posts and streamers confirming it on twitter, but that's not much. The only official word I can find is that Sydney launch time was mentioned specifically in the launch schedule here:
---

I really hope that's not just wishful thinking of us all here down under.
---
I‚Äôve been playing Conan Exiles. One of the best online survival, conquering and building games out there. Better than ark, better than rust and better than that new pirate game. It‚Äôs ridiculously fun, almost too fun which is why I need to stop. I feel obligated to play in case I get raided so I stopped playing for good two days ago. If you just like building and casual PvP though, there is pve-conflict which is no structure damage and just combat between players.
---
That and risk of rain 2. I‚Äôm amazed how I still find that fun. All games will not be touched as soon classic comes out lmao
---
Except a lot of the things in those books is retconned by Chronicle 2 and Chronicle 3. This list is not a good source of material at all.
---
There was just last week
---
Ya'll should just hurry up out of the PvE closet.
---
Personally, I've done both and I think ya'll have a bit of a romantic view of PvE servers, they get boring as hell at 60. Also, there is griefing the other faction can do to you where you have no recourse on PvE, it sucks.
---
Spriests don't get to DoT, on account of their debuff limit. Their brought for shadowweaving, so each warlock in the raid can have a 15% boost in dps.
---
That's the entire appeal of an mmo, that the world is an unpredictable dynamic experience. You're expecting a living mmo world to function like a static single player experience.
---
This is the same line of thinking that eventually turned wow into the hand holding traincar experience it is today. An mmo shouldn't be about having unrestricted access to any content you want at any time, it should be about taking part in a dynamic world and fighting against whatever challenges that world may throw at you.

Broken draenei are way more interesting than space goats out of nowhere.

Yeah, the launch time is all I found too. And that could simply mean when you‚Äôll be able to login to US West servers.
---
They look to be in good condition
---
I remember being harassed by a shadow priest in Black Rock Mountain that would MC people and run them into the lava when they were trying to do BWL or MC... he single handedly force entire raids to run in groups. Great times.
---
I like to imagine that if you weren‚Äôt joking, this guy would just have the worst next week.
---
Like his wife would be like, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs wrong honey?‚Äù.
---
‚ÄúOh.... oh sorry did you say something? It‚Äôs just... it‚Äôs just this guy didn‚Äôt know something about classic wow... it‚Äôs a really common piece of trivia and he just didn‚Äôt know it....‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay honey... you haven‚Äôt touched me in days, I just don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs up if you don‚Äôt tell me-‚Äú
---
‚ÄúI want a divorce Lisa.‚Äù
---
/moo
---
Yeah I really need to , the keys have lost their text . I always take out the caps lock though , fuck that key .
---
They should've held a closed beta and saved the streamer beta a month before launch. Then incrementally raising the cap to 50 a couple of weeks before launch and boom launch, everybody is playing. Intact hype train.
---
&gt;Every single raid up until Naxx was balanced around much more shitty itemization, talents, mechanics, and even entire attributes not existing.
---
Ever heard of AQ40? By the time patch 1.9 rolled around, most things were functionally extremely similar to how they later were in 1.12.
---
Fairly sure that someone linked a list of reserved names from datelining, but I can't remember where.
---
But it was Keanu who made everyone breathtaking
---
That‚Äôs the ENTIRE point of PvP servers..... you are missing the point.
---
You get corpse camped/contract cancer. That‚Äôs how it works. You choose how to handle this situation. Log off, try to fight, quest somewhere else.
---
Such are the ways of the closed beta
---
I think it is more because people don't trust blizzard to do it well... You let them make changes and you'd end up with LFR, perma sharing, every class having an escape, cc, self heal, some gap closer etc. Etc. And it just doesn't end up being fun. Personally for me the TBC (with toned down DKs) was the best era of the game when it comes to talents . However classic with #nochanges was FUN and that's what people care about more
---

I will be playing a paladin, so bubble hearth is my Friend
---
I think being 80DPS below the tank is a dealbreaker for many.
---
Having somebody do 200DPS its better to leave that slot open and give that gear to somebody who will actually be a contribution when hard times come up.
---
Raid leads will bite themselves if they keep wiping on 1% on Loatheb. Now they wished they had done Ragnaros with 39 people and gave Onslaught Girlde to the warrior and not to the lolret being 280DPS while the guilds tank is at 360DPS.
---
If you buy them on GOG you are guaranteed to have them forever
---
Pretty nice, cool handmade map too üëç
---
Nope, if you do that you log back into the same instance at the same place you logged out. It only puts you back at the entrance on Pservers.
---
Each realm should be its own discrete world, and that is compromised if people can just transfer from other realms. It is impure. That is my opinion.
---
Thanks I actually have some zones drawn out to but their sizes don‚Äôt line up, was hoping to make a huge map frankensteined together
---
PvP is part of the game when you roll on a PvP server. Consider it WoW+. Try to separate PvP from the leveling experience, and you will hate it.
---
When you roll on a PvP server, you are saying ‚ÄúI would like to take longer to level, because this is a more hardcore way of playing the game, and has more content.‚Äù
---
It's been a while since I played TFT, but IIRC he's portrayed as kind of selfishly pursuing power despite the warnings of everyone else and gets corrupted by it.  And then he flees to Outland.  So maybe not pure evil like Arthas but he's well-established at least.
---
I should probably replay TFT because I'm realizing now how much I forgot from that game.
---
Where's the duel flags?
---
Like others said, Warcraft 3 is the best, but there‚Äôs also one book that fits in between WC3 and WoW and that‚Äôs Cycle of Hatred. It‚Äôs by no means required reading, but it‚Äôs short and not a bad story. It‚Äôs about the burning blade.
---
Looking forward to it.
---
the world really is not black and white. there is slacking with consumes, playing tauren fury, so you are behind 5% and then there is lolret being below the *tanks* in damage.
---
In every activity in the world you would have a stern talking to if you stroll across the pitch, not carrying your weight.
---
thats what a lolret is: *below the damage of the tanks by 80DPS.*
---
I agree that for AQ40 and Naxx things should get more strict. A raid leader who is okay with bringing a ret for MC or BWL should make an agreement that the paladin will go holy for higher-end content.
---
Yeah, Pandas have some kind of positive symbolism and the artwork was very generic Asian inspired.  I think in many ways they kind of overdid the "Asianness" of it.
---
It has nothing to do with kungu panda. Adding pandaria to wow made as much sense as introducing talking rats. It would still suck, regardless of any movie beforehand.
---
Haha like at Blizzcon when they announced Diablo on phones
---
I mean do you really want a WoW2? How would that even be different from a major expansion?
---
It seems like the entire spirit of this sub revolves around there being an original magic that cant be copied into a sequel or xpac.

Some stuff is retconned, but most stuff isnt. What books in particular would you say are kot worth reading because of this?
---
Lame ass
---
Ok you found one guy? This isn‚Äôt a pserver phenomenon
---
Super lame dude
---
There will probably be a Ret Paladin that completes every raid before you and is always better geared than you and has a much more enjoyable time in the game than you because he brings greater value to a guild community than numbers.
---
Get over it scrub.
---
No offence, but they are books for children / young adults, of course they're going to seem amateurish.
---
All classes are awesome, but some classes are more awesome than others.

Someone got banned in the twitch chat

i think the stereotypical gamer is pretty well defined at this point.
---
So many people talking about alex the person and not enough on what he said.  This subreddit has been overtaken by retail and younger players who dont know they have being taken advantage of by blizzards decisions and choices, and instead take it as the norm.  
---
Blizz has fucked every game in the past 10 years.  Retail, you already know.  Diablo on mobile.  Overwatch is toxic af and lootboxes.  Hearthstone is online gambling targetted towards 13yr olds.  Activision.  Laying off support staff.  Relabeling sharding with a blizz friendly word.  
---
I dont agree about delaying classic, but yes we must keep pressuring blizzard to not fuck things up, like they continually do year after year.  Alex is not a good dude by any stretch, but he cares more about the game than most.
---
He does selfishly persue power, but I dont think he necessarily harms anyone in the process. Tyrande and Malfurion get mad at him because it goes against the night elf ways. I havent played it in a long time though so you might be right. IIRC though he was banished from the night elves and kind of had to do what he could to survive which may have included some less-than-moral things.
---
I wouldn't recommend it. Yes you could make it work, especially if you plan to just PVE or RP. Wow isnt as intense as shooters. However, the constant latency (probably 200ms+) will definitely be noticeable, especially in pvp, when those split seconds matter for dispels and interrupts. If you intend to raid, scheduling through timezones might be an issue as well.
---
This.
---
Idk what people expect. It‚Äôs fuckin World PvP. Shit happens.
---
Where were these babies when Diablo 2 was out? Try getting camped by a Teleporting Summoning Necromancer that has so many minions he crashes your game as he corpse camps you. This kind of stuff is STANDARD. How are you not used to it by now?
---
if you're in to 19s my friend is the 2 time back to back hollywood video bathtub woldwide WSG champ on every class. Here is his BiS 19 lock vid. He's also the radioshack belt holder for end game classic raids. https://youtu.be/5vwB2k4hGGo
---
Wotlk, Rust, D3, WC3
---
Ench shaman can still carry their weight. Like I said above, 4 warriors and 1 ench shaman is better than 5 warriors. If you are improving the raid by being there, how are you not carrying your weight? 
---
Yeah, resto shaman might be better in that slot but those are not always available and you are the next best thing. 
---
This goes back to the argument of bringing rogues. DPS warriors are better so why would you bring gimped class like a rogue to the raid? I don't understand players that want to raid as rogue to purposely not carry their weight in a raid.
---
99.99% of Vanilla players experienced this through YouTube, not World of Warcraft. That was a mistake on Blizzard‚Äôs part and one they learned not to repeat.
---
Isn't that pre-16 raid debuffs though, or am incorrect? Would seem like they could with that many slots, but I'm not totally familiar with vanilla tbh. I do understand they're there for shadow-weaving though.
---
Nice videos, you're one of like 5 people ive subbed to ever. Grats. Been looking for a good video or write up on this allday as i was pretty intrested in dungeoning as a warrior.

The problem is that it is understandable when the ret demands gear. 
---
Esfand on his toon [https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643) has *highly* soughtafter gear and Onslaught the most prominent one as Ragnaros can be cleared with 20 knowledgeable people.
---
Any raidleader who starts a guild to actually raid from MC to Naxxramas will have to ask themselves if memespecs who most likely will have to be cut once the hard content starts (Chromaggus and onwards for many a guild) will be worth it to carry for the first 12months only then to tell them: "respec or goodbye".
---
So now you fed topnotch gear to a retpally who will in 99% of the cases be cut in hard progression and people will question your leadership letting a full fury warrior's gear go to waste on somebody you knew from the getgo would not be eligible for content in which the gear actually starts to matter.
---
Yeah, I always saw TBC as having really great endgame, but it fails in so many other ways.  Theme being a big one.
---
Are the signatures printed or hand written?
---
Chuck norris is a homophobic piece of shit and keanu is a fucking treasure. The two arent even comparable.
---
Yeah well I‚Äôm playing on a 2011 MacBook, being poor sucks.
---
Yes, read the comments, there are far more people attempting this and doing this kind of massive multi-boxing on PServers than there every have been in Retail.
---
LOL Dan, shut the fuck up.
---
Tons of people partaked in the theorizing of where you could find or cleanse the ashbringer. And this specific context sure it was under represented, but there should have been nifty items like this in every raid they release, not just one off.
---
Atleast I wasn't 80DPS below a TANK.
---
yikes

Right after you grow up &lt;3
---
Can't wait to take my 60 and no life gank in STV for hours on end. For the Horde!

I‚Äôllidan tried to save the world and save the people under him while dealing with a Tsundere stalker and a demon wanting his ass.
---
Isn't that before it was raised to the 16 raid rebuffs limit? Or am I misunderstanding that? I don't really fully understand raid rebuffs prioritization outside the bare minimum tbh.
---
He is not using nightfall.
---
well Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the chatspam from MC as well as Quel'Serrar with Onyxia do something similar.
---
I love your comment thank you stranger
---
whats funny is that LK also had a digital release too for launch
---
You're not wrong. But there's going to be so many of us, hard to feel unique or stand out among the Horde's 3rd most popular class.
---
These are all player driven - and you could have done more work ahead of time to solve these issues. In retail, you *literally can't change how fast you get things*. THAT's people's issue. You can't log in one day and do 8 hours of farming, you have to do an hour a day for 8 days and god help you if you miss one.
---
Factorial with PY mods. Just finished circuit 3, moving onto yellow science. Have 200+ hours into this map so far.
---
Honestly if there's one change I'd be perfectly happy with for Classic it's adding a questline for cleansing Ashbringer.
---
And why does that mater? How does that make them worse then Yongol, Rukhmar Adherents, Void Elves, Blood Elves, Night borne, Dark Iron .etc
---
Well prepared
---
Ya
---
You can do DMN if that's what you're worried about
---
https://youtu.be/dXryjmPySkw
---
I'm curious as to why they say you'll hit 60 in 4 days /played. The world record 60 was 20 hours longer than that in Vanilla.
---
Alright well there‚Äôs already [Chuck][Nourish] so what do we do for Keanu Reeves?
---
I never see this accounted for in DPS discussions.  If your boomkin is in a party of mages, part of those mage's damage can be assigned to the boomkin for giving extra crit.  Everyone seems to only acknowledge the damage you do directly..
---
Would make no sense to not give us one when we already have servers located in Sydney. Germany still get low ping, local servers.
---
The unaligned monitors is triggering me.
---
Calling a person homophobic and a piece of shit without citing any source is not cool man
---
Um... yea... Norris worship was sarcastic... Keanu is *actually* badass.
---
So for the people sending me literal death threats over this, it was a joke thread poking fun at this thread, I'm surprised people got so angry over this :\
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c6okz4/painting_of_the_greatest_city_in_warcraft/?st=jxilvd4p&amp;sh=d6192a3a
---
Yeah tell me about it . I got the thing that holds your monitors and one of mine didn‚Äôt have the screw slots in the back so now they don‚Äôt match what so ever and is quite displeasing to the eye . I apologize . :(
---
Does the class design not bug you? That is my biggest issue with BfA right now, the classes are just so simplified and I dread combat...
---
If I remember, the name can't contain ranks, captain, sergeant, etc.
---
I NEVER understood that argument. 
---
1) it‚Äôs the same art style
---
And 
---
2) Why would the architecture and culture for a foreign nation with little to no contact with the outside world be the same and Magic Medival like the rest.
---
That‚Äôs actually why I find Valoran/Runeterra a more realistic world. The cultures are actually different, along with the empires and the people. Noxian, Ionian, and Friljordian architecture all all completely different and all 3 have completely different beliefs and cultures. Really only sharing the fact that Noxus exists in their borders because they invaded both countries.
---
I cannot take credit for this joke. I first heard it from Crendor and I'm sure he read it somewhere else
---
Also, pretty much all mats aren't gonna sell at the beginning, and even if they do, not for as much as if you wait a month or two. No one will have money with all the skill and mount buying they will be doing.
---
16 slot debuff limit. Dots do stack and corruptions and deep wounds will not only fill up the 16 slots but also push each other off. Shadow word pain isn't as strong as other Dots so you'll be told not to use it in raid.
---
Looks like Goldshire.
---
Sign me up &lt;3
---
What do you think the monk class is? Some form of magic? They literally created a hand to hand skill to make a fucking kungfu panda. At least make the new skill and new story line something unique.
---
You seriously chose talking rats?
---
Something that was literally in the game Warcraft was ripped off from (Skaven) something that IS CURRENTLY IN THE GAME AND WAS IN CLASSIC??? Cause the kobolds in WoW aren‚Äôt lizards or dogs.
---
And why are Rat and Panda people worse than Cow, Pig, Bird, Goat, Monkey, fish .etc
---
One that I did on a fresh pserver was get enchanting up to enough to make the first wand. I could usually buy the mats or low level greens on the AH for cheaper than I could sell the wands, and people buy low level wands like CRAZY on a fresh realm.
---
Aye, Norris is a religious fundamentalist. That's not particularly *bad ass* if you ask me.
---
And then made canon in said expansion.
---
The classic human kit is extremely generically European and the classic Tauren kit is extremely generically native American.
---
The three classes I‚Äôve played so far at 110+ all have more interesting utility and rotations than they ever did in Vanilla.
---
[It's been common knowledge for a long time now.](https://www.huffpost.com/entry/chuck-norris-boy-scouts_b_1629377)
---
TBC pserver.
---
This. Is. Perfect for my druid! Thank you!
---
It would be a cool idea, but current lore would put them against each other since Thrall turned a blind eye to his warlocks.
---
Those servers aren‚Äôt owned by Blizzard, they only pay for what they use, so there‚Äôs no benefit to Blizzard by putting a realm in Sydney if not enough people will use it.
---
Ah okay, gotcha.
---
So essentially I'd just be cycling through mind flay to get SW Procs, and then off-healing when I can?
---
And how do you know that?
---
Speak for yourself, Zandalari are elf like and I love em.
---
I can't really take huffpost seriously they're known to smear celebrities that don't align with their political agenda
---
We weren't admiring the guy, we were making fun of him.
---
Reevesjuvinate ... god i'm bad at this
---
Using Nightfall, he beats several pure DPS classes in these parses.
---
Hard to tell, having a warlock for summons may slow things down compared to a melee cleave but save a heap of time traveling back n fourth trying to vendor, specially in places like SM as alliance...
---
They will. You guys still get decent EU servers. I think the problem was that EU covers so many languages. German, French, English, etc. It'd probably be too expensive to open servers for each.
---
OCE is Australia, NZ, Singapore etc. I used to raid with a Singapore based guild. I'm not sure which Asian based servers exist.
---
We already have OCE servers for retail, so it's fair to assume we'd get Classic servers as well. The data centres are already here and in use.
---
Jesus fucking Christ no. Gazlowe or I burn Classic Orgrimmar down so it gets swapped with Cata version.
---
&gt; there should have been nifty items like this in every raid they release
---
They did start putting major lore into raids, once they came up with a system that allowed more than a tiny percentage of players to experience them. It is called LFR.
---
Yeah, I think they learned their lesson with the tram. Moving geometry + players + pets + spells + enemies = not fun time for anyone. Just like how Spine of Deathwing is also a stationary piece of geometry with the clouds and stuff moving around the players.
---
https://www.ammoland.com/2012/06/is-obama-creating-a-pro-gay-boy-scouts-of-america/#axzz1yvquyC6z
---
There are some pretty good cheap mechanical keyboards on amazon
---
Personally I wish we were a part of Gazlowes cartel. I hate Gallywix.
---
I played pve in vanilla and loved it. Would toggle /pvp if I wanted the possibility of getting ganked, but none of that getting camped when leveling. (Although they can still kill most npcs I think)
---
To each their own though. I'm not sure which I'll do this time around.
---
I feel like you are exaggerating this waay too much lol. Yes these things happen, but nowhere near how often you make it out to be.
---
Those were great things. I love all of them.
---
You did this for 15 years and plan to do it again?
---
First thing that comes to mind is what your life outside gaming look like üòÆ
---
Depends on what you want to do. For organized PvP, deep holy is the strongest build. If you want to do lots of solo world PvP or don't care about maximum efficiency in battlegrounds, go either 20/0/31 or 21/0/30. 25/26/0 was pretty good on private servers, but it's likely not going to work very well due to the way Reckoning works on Classic.
---
You may be asked to put 30 points into holy when you get to harder PvE content (AQ40, Naxx). I personally think that it's not necessary if you use enough consumables, but your class leader may think otherwise.
---
What the hell are you talking about lol?
---
Also, there are some very clearly artistic differences in MoP vs before. Obviously there are a lot of examples of things that are similar to the rest of the game's artstyle but there are a TON of examples to the contrary. The Klaxxi or whatever the fuck they're called, the Mogu, and a lot of the cutesy farm shit is so out of place in the context of pre-MoP wow. It fits in BfA and I get that they had to take it in a different direction but it was really jarring when it first came out.
---
That's not to say it was bad looking, it just felt very out of place sometimes. I mean just look at vale and tell me it doesn't feel/look way different than the rest of the previous iterations
---
Nice mental gymnastics.
---
A lot of them were niche. Like Destro was just immolate, incinerate, conflagration, chaos bolt, havoc and RoF.
---
Does that work on classic wow or is that a private server thing
---
Where can I get this from?  I can't find it anywhere.
---
Oh, no. OT and tranqbots got beaten. :O Quick, start the presses!
---
Private servers have been known to just sell gold to gold farmers behind the scenes, so they didn't have to spend the time farming it themselves.
---
Always played on RP PvP or PvP serveur from 2005 to 2010 and later on biggest private servers which were really tough because 24/24h PvP and 5k/10k players Always connected. I would say PvP adds salt and dangerous living on your gameplay. When you kill and win a fight you are happy, when you loose you want revenge and analyse why you loose and try to improve. That's why PvP servers players are better than pve players. If i can i will play on a RP PvP serveur as ever. Greeting from France
---
Yup, that or a 10-20 min break usually did it
---
Jesus Christ it's like you're a legend
---
A rogue can do nothing but melee dps.  Raids bring rogues because raids drop rogue loot.  If you could just bring warriors and raids dropped loot to accommodate that, trust me, some guilds would just bring warriors.  It just isn't feasible because of gear.  A shaman can and should raid as resto, so if they are enh, they are actively gimping themselves.
---
How will they make a bunch of money from layering with the internal cooldown?
---
You went so far just to play WoW?  That sounds aweful. I wish I would have been healthy enough to go to school during WoW launches.
---
But coincidentally I was sick at every release...  \*cough cough\*
---
Blizzard doesn‚Äôt own those data centers or the hardware inside of them. Every clock cycle and megabyte costs them money.
---
The servers are all virtualized now. It costs just as much to have 5000 players on one realm as it does to have 1000 players on 5 realms. Not giving Germany a server isn‚Äôt about cutting costs, it‚Äôs about sustainable player populations over the 2 year lifecycle of Classic.
---
And if 20% of EU‚Äôs playerbase wouldn‚Äôt be enough to warrant a server in there own language, which is 270% more players than all of Oceania, there‚Äôs no reason to suspect Blizzard is going to treat you any different.
---
It‚Äôs still WoWs cartoony look. It‚Äôs just looked brighter and more colorful than what we‚Äôre used to since we were dealing with Tundras, Desserts and a plane of floating prolapsed anus rocks for last few years. 
---
Also none of that has anything to do with my main point, that having a culture that‚Äôs isn‚Äôt the same as the rest of the world is fine and actually improves immersion. Like look at our own.
---
Gnomish to gadget and goblin to winterspring, both on a 4 hour cooldown.
---
Pretty easy to find information indicating his homophobia. If you're too lazy to do a simple google search that's your problem. He supported the ban of same-sex marriage in California, supports discrimination against gay people in organisations like the boy scouts and supports politicians who advocate gay discrimination laws.
---
That‚Äôs why you roll Zandalari on an RP server and shame the De-Evolved degenerates.
---
Also point and make fun of the Tribal trolls like the Dark Spear.
---
All elves are descended from trolls, not the other way around.
---
And rogues and mages and warlocks.
---
You have to buy BfA to play it tho. Tons of us are simply never going to do that.
---
The army at the Dark portal were actually cardboard cutouts. Even the iron horde had problems.
---
Trying not to sound like a jaded asshole here, but since the team has decided against adding the unarmored mounts.. I really can't find it in me to care about what I ride. It will be an epic mount, but probably just a horse.
---
No prestige in the standard epic mounts.
---
I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the sexual tension in this picture.
---
Shado-Pan are pretty much what their rogues are. And well WoW rogues and the shado pan have magic.
---
I mean, it would be quite different from a new expansion.
---
There wouldn‚Äôt be 500 mounts, meaning the few cool ones would mean more.
---
The economy would reset, meaning no goblins with millions and millions of gold capable if buying literally anything.
---
Early on gear would feel like it had meaning again I suppose, in the current game you replace everything each patch.
---
You could remove features that are harmful to the game, namely LFG, LFR, Transmog, Flying Mounts etc... which simply cannot be done in current wow due to the major backlash they would receive.
---
At that time no one was really trying, the world record holder didn't have any real competition. That world record is basically a formality at this point, 4d20 will get beaten even by warriors on launch day from what we've seen of people's test runs.
---
Ya what they are doing is killing the hype. There's a bunch of streamers saying they should just close the beta.
---
Nah, the graphics in this game are shit for 2019, but that's ok, no one will be playing it for the graphics.
---
bloodborne
---
It is more perfect because it uses the system as intended. Wanting money is greed. Wanting an upgrade is need. In your attempt to make it more fair you literally start acting like a ninja and expect everyone else to as well. 
---
It is not irrational to vendor the item though. It is just lazy. Just because it isn't your way of thinking doesn't make it irrational. Ultimately a game is played for fun and I don't have fun playing the auction system. So it is perfectly rational for me to not look up the auction house value and just vendor it. Sounds pretty damn logical to me. 
---
I think trying to explain your greed doesn't make it any less greedy. You literally don't need the item, you just want it because you see dollar signs. I don't think need or greed is the ideal loot system for you if you can't see why your greed is not need.
---
All you have to do is look at the number of cutscenes and lore-related dialogue in raids during Vanilla+BC+WotLK, where there really wasn‚Äôt any, except some in WotLK, and the huge amount of cutscenes and lore-related dialogue in raids since to know it‚Äôs true.
---
Resto gear is still serviceable if you play 30/0/21, shaman spells have decent base damage and you can still easily kill most classes 1v1 as long as you play as a hybrid. 
---
If you're committed to solely blowing people up you'll have to join a pvp guild like other people are suggesting.
---
Well they have 12 oceanic retail servers, 1 is full &amp; 5 are high pop, so there would be no reason to think classic wouldn't have at least a PvP &amp; PvE server worth of continuous players
---
??? The Pandaren Models were so good they forced Blizzard to update the classic models. And the panda models still shit on the Cata models.
---
i hope you have a lovely day stranger
---
A lot of people believe that that record will be crushed, Joana included. I think he wants to hit 4d +- a few hours which would absolutely smash his current WR, and he totally believes it‚Äôs possible / will be done in sub 4d
---
People have apparently also been banned for that.
---
for?
---
Battlenet website, you can buy it for 20 bucks.
---
Because 5 mages would still be better than 4 and a boomkin, that is why they don't get any credit...or any raid spots.
---
Sounds boring.
---
I only got to 24 in beta, but when I tried leveling today it was REALLY dead, world chat had pauses between 10-15 MINUTES before someone talked
---
I just think they should of sent out more invites.
---
I can't believe this has to be stated.
---
How much would you typically sell the sets for?
---
I mean as much as the classes are simplified it‚Äôs still more engaging than classic IMO for most classes. It has its flaws though in its social aspect and for me personally the catch up mechanics. Catch up negates the progression of your character completely. If you didn‚Äôt play bfa till now you will get 400 ilvl and 46-50 neck in no time. In a few weeks you will be 430.
---
The beauty of classic is time = reward and it made it feel way more rewarding. Bfa = instant gratification but it doesn‚Äôt work for me personally and from the look of it it doesn‚Äôt suit the majority of wow classic players
---
Why, though? They Dan's right.
---
Its not random 1-22... it depends on spell cast default cast time. All spells above level 20 with 3 sec default cast time get 100% spell "power" efficiency (healing or damage).
---
Spells with default cast time above 3 sec get more than 100% from spell damage/heal. For example pyroblast gets maybe 200% from spell damage (example, dont remember exact number).
---
While the lower the cast time the less the spell power %. For example instant cast spells get very very little spell damage/healing. Arcane explosion for example does not benefit much from spell damage.
---
Garrosh and a group of blood elves stole a magic item from Dalaran and used it to make a magical nuke that when activated wipes the area from all realities. She showed up at the site only to watch her apprentice crumble to dust in her arms.
---
What a care bear.
---
But if no-one takes blacksmithing who are you going to buy it off?
---
Well they have 87 German retail servers, 3 are full &amp; 12 are high pop, so there would be no reason to think classic wouldn't have at least a PvP &amp; PvE server worth of continuous (German) players.
---
And yet...
---
But what about the thousands of dollars I've spent on Steam in the past decade?
---
print screen is your friend
---
Is it always SoR instead of SoC if your weapon is below 3.5 speed? 
---
Seems like there isn't a great amount of weapons above 3.5 speed whilst leveling. Even the mighty Verigan's Fist is 3.2. 
---
Is there a point where this isn't true and SoC is better than SoR? Perhaps at certain times when you get a new rank?
---
The main problem for non-multiboxers is the obscene amount of ressources generated, leading to massive prices drop. We're in a dumb situation where the demand is diminishing every month because Bfa is a flop but it has no effect on the supply ( For example on my server there is about 31 000 winter's kiss posted daily but only 8700 get sold). 
---
Ofc it affects multiboxers too but the big losers are us casual players. If you take into account the others gatherers you now need \~12 hours of night time nonstop gathering in addition of your regular playtime to get a token. So most of us gave up the f2p model and came back to p2p ( or just left the game )
---
Esfand is a famous streamer and an outlier, most people trying to raid as ret are just straight up retarded.
---
IDK how much shadow priests off heal. I think their BiS is the +spell power instead of the +healing.
---
pandas was never a problem. I liked mop more than cata or anything after
---
Ok, I‚Äôll trust your opinion on private servers since you haven‚Äôt played on any and I‚Äôve played on all the major ones of the last 3.5 years.
---
You linked my video ‚ô•Ô∏è thank you friend
---
You say people have  rose tinted recollection but you appear to just have a bad exaggeration of how "bad" it can be on PvP servers. Shit coating the experience isn't doing anyone any favors either.
---
Wow. Thats an epic story haha.
---
&gt; Literally never seen anyone multibox more than 2 people on a pserver.
---
*didn't know about the guy that streams 40-man boxes and sells the accounts on many major Pservers*
---
Yeah, okay kid.
---
TBC midnight release, GameStop in Camarillo, CA.. lots of people!
---
That's all true but without world pvp there is basically no pvp at classic wow... So if you want to pvp you have to play on pvp server. Ofc if someone don't care about pvp - pve server is the way to go.
---
You know what else bring more to the table? A holy Paladin.
---
Arthas did nothing wrong.
---
Thrall cheated in Mak'gora.
---
Snape kills Dumbledore.
---
Keanu Reeves could slam revolving doors.
---
A progression model that doesn‚Äôt involve expansions, only regular patches, only a subscription fee, and without content updates that nullify previous content (+10 max level cap rendering previous max level cap content meaningless).
---
Hell, if they could find a way to ditch leveling all together, that could possibly fix a lot of progression problems. Things like that are what needs to be looked at in a WoW sequel.
---
Additional question: does canninalize have any inpact on PvP/PvE or is it just a ‚Äöconsumable‚Äò like ability?
---
Divinity Original Sin 2, DOOM (2016), and Resident Evil 7
---
Great content as always!
---
Only concern is how does the gold compare to solo grinding and questing? Will keeping up to date with mandatory skills + mount at 40 be possible?
---
Ret is utter trash, no guild that's not complete garbage would ever bring one to their raids. What's worse is that Esfand is misleading a lot of potential WoW players into thinking that Retribution is actually viable which will lead to a lot of frustrated players being forced to play Holy.
---
If you're thinking about playing a Retribution Paladin you should roll a Warrior instead.
---
It‚Äôs handy to have, but wouldn‚Äôt tip the scales by any means.
---
Well tbh there‚Äôs nothing to do.
---
People who got bis at lvl30 only needed 3-4 upgrades. 
---
There‚Äôs few reason to run dungeons. 
---
There‚Äôs no raids.
---
BGs are barren because there‚Äôs no reward for playing it.
---
And ofc there‚Äôs:
---
People leave -&gt;less to interact with-&gt;nothing going on-&gt; people leave 
---
It‚Äôs just how it is once they raise cap to 50 and add more players it will revitalize itself
---
I will most likely want to mainly pvp but due to only playing a few hours a week I won‚Äôt have the best of gear.
---
What class can shine in bgs even with less than optimal gear? Is healers the way to go? Or what about a hunter?
---
Thanks!
---
Have you ever experienced a WoW beta booming with life?? People don't put too much time into it since it's a temporary character.
---
Yes.
---
If I wanted instant gratification, I wouldn‚Äôt be playing an MMO in the first place.... kinda contradictory, no?
---
I‚Äôd play a First Person Shooter/Hack n Slasher/platformer
---
This may sound stupid, but what is the purpose of two monitors? Do you have two separate computers side by side?
---
You are talking absolute nonsense you utter moron.
---
It's cute that you wrote it off without even glancing at its content. If you'd looked at all, you would've immediately seen that they cite [this primary source](https://www.ammoland.com/2012/06/is-obama-creating-a-pro-gay-boy-scouts-of-america/#axzz1yvquyC6z) written by Norris himself.
---
He's also [written in support of young-earth creationism](https://townhall.com/columnists/chucknorris/2008/04/22/win-ben-steins-monkey-n1170312), because he's a religious fundamentalist.
---
The guy was in some decent movies, but that's about it. He certainly isn't a positive role model for anyone.
---
They were implemented for alliance so they could farm shards close to SW locks since horde locks had a short trip to azshara from org. Fun fact there is a 40 man raid boss there that you need for scarab lord chain quest. I had no idea up until recently, if your bored waiting for classic I suggest you look up the scepter quest and read what needed to be done. Includes unique stuff like killing a (40 man) shark in the middle of the ocean in Azshara.
---
Hmm, I can't agree with this at all. Even something like warrior I have to actually pay attention to my rage in Vanilla. I have to switch weapons to do an interrupt and the interrupt is important. In BfA it's just button mashing depending on what lights up, really. Completely unengaging to me. I remember just getting depressed at how few abilities there were, there's like, what, 7? Where are stances? Just sad.
---
I mean, the source is right there in the article: https://www.ammoland.com/2012/06/is-obama-creating-a-pro-gay-boy-scouts-of-america/#axzz1yvquyC6z

Here's the [actual article](https://www.ammoland.com/2012/06/is-obama-creating-a-pro-gay-boy-scouts-of-america/#axzz1yvquyC6z) Chuck Norris wrote that the HuffPost piece is about.
---
With my fianc√© ;) and spending as much time with her before I go mia for 6 months
---
in regards to seeing if u can run the game it is.. peabrain
---
So then you would be happy to play with 200 ping?
---
Germany still has a server that provides them with under 50 ping..
---
Yeah... that‚Äòs what I thought. Thanks! *rolling on orc rogue*
---
IDC whether that is true to vanilla or not, that shit needs to go.
---
That's why they need to fix leeway so I can kite for my life.
---
You‚Äôre asking for theory crafting test. That‚Äôs not going to happen as they aren‚Äôt doing class balances like in a traditional beta or ptr.
---
YES. FINALLY SOMEONE WHO ISNT DELUSUONAL. I‚Äôve watched a couple minutes of BFA streams and I the first thing I notice the the lack of skills on the hot bar. Totally unappealing. I fail to see how there is more depth and engaging combat in Retail when theres literally 75% of the buttons missing.
---
lol, funny
---
Nice ad hominem. Betas are usually for having the testers find bugs, and stress tests are not usually considered an "open beta" by the MMORPG community.
---
The difference is your connection to the EU server from germany is fine with low ping, theres no reason to give Germany its own server when connection is fine.
---
Oceanias connection to america is high ping so theres more reason to make a server since it improves our connection.
---
Why is this an argument ? Germany has there own servers its called the EU server... 
---
Server location and server language is 2 different things lol.
---
It's like he wants you to be his daddy!
---
Fuck that weather is nice
---
Does it matter if they gimp themselves if the result is still good enough?
---
Hypothetically:
---
Lets say fury warrior does 1100 dps
---
Lets say rogue does 900 dps
---
Lets say that 2h warrior does 1000 dps
---
Bringing arms warrior would still be gimping the raid compared to bringing fury warrior, but its still better than rogue and still very beneficial to the raid. Yes, you are not playing 100% optimal spec but it is still good enough to not be waste of space. 
---
You don't have to optimize everything and HIGH majority of raids will not. Not only because they don't want to, but because they can't. Player quality &gt; character quality. No one is forced to take you to the raid, but you would be a fool to not bring enchancement shaman if he improves your raid power. Why are you so hateful about someone not bringing their very optimal setup? There are players who can afk in raid and still have more impact than others just by leading the raid. 
---
And that is what matters. What you as player / character combination bring to the raid. Its not about what you could bring in another universe, but what you actually bring with the way you have chosen to play.
---
If the enhancement shaman player is consistent, shows commitment and plays well he can be better than your random fury warrior that can't join every raid, makes more mistakes and is negative impact for mood of the raid by bitching about others.

I've been playing on a pserver that only has PvP servers. I haven't enjoyed the world pvp aspect at all. I like to make sure I'm getting the rested bonus when I log out. I've been doing what you talk about and just leave the game or zone when a ganker shows up, but on top of the annoyance of not playing that character, I tend to also lose money to repairs (resing at the spirit healer does a lot of durability damage) and I, perhaps stupidly, keep my hearth set to Orgrimmar so I tend to also spend extra on traveling.
---
But yeah, my preferred way to play the game is just level in peace and occasionally group up with strangers. If I had a bunch of IRL friends that played together I'm sure pvp servers would bother me less. Sharing the experience would make it a lot more fun.
---
but how do you know how many of those players will be playing classic
---
I agree that PvP has its problems and I'd prefer to roll PvE but will roll PvP to stay with my guild. 
---
But a most of the issues you have pointed out (other than being ganked by a higher level) could be resolved by playing accordingly and grouping up.
---
There is no reason to run to BRD alone when you could just meet up and travel together. And if you can't clear MC in a massive 3 hours raid time because your rabble is too disorganized to travel together, you frankly don't deserve to clear it.
---
Germany still gets low ping to EU server .. they have a server ffs.
---
Server ping and location is different to server language...
---
Pandas always seemed an idiotic joke.  Then, they actually did it.
---
The villain swap in TBC made no sense with who Illidan was. Yes, Illidan wasn't particularly a good guy, he did a ton of terrible shit but he didn't do it because he was a mustache twirling villain, he did it for various reasons like jealousy, lust for power, desire to be seen as a hero and wanting to protect his people.      
---
    
---
Then in TBC he did stupid shit like attack Shattrath for no reason - he had no conflict with anyone there and was always really self serving in his motives, he was absolutely the kind of person who would want to remain on good terms with another polity that had the same enemies he did. Illidan in WC3 was kind of a bad guy because he was a flawed asshole who meant well but ultimately pursued courses of actions that most benefited himself, Illidan in TBC was generic evil insane bad guy #54.

one computer can support 2 and even 3 or more monitors , I would love to have 3 but I'm limited to 2 as I dont know how to mess with the BIOS . I like having more than 1 monitor because I can use the other monitor to watch YouTube videos , Twitch , set up Guides , etc .
---
I don't wanna give huffpost ad revenue they're a disgrace to journalism
---
https://www.wowhead.com/npc=55891/kaanu-reevs
---
Ah okay. How do you have the monitors seeing two different things on only one computer? Wouldn‚Äôt they both be showing the same thing?
---
That was patronizing anyway if it was their motive.  What if there were a lot of Australian players...Make a Kangaren race?
---
There's a larger list of EU players on the forums saying that they are going to subject themselves to a higher ping to play on US servers so they don't have to deal with non-English speakers than there are people asking about Oceanic Classic servers.
---
Germany and France have had their own servers for 14 years. You've barely had yours for 5.
---
How should they have remained high elves? We spent an entire campaign in WC3 with them already as blood elves watching the alliance betray them. What's next, should Arthas have remained human?
---
Looks like he's about to [gank an enemy stand](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/jjba/images/c/c5/JosukeProfile.png/revision/latest?cb=20190117181938) user tbh.
---
Confirmed.
---
Thus making them elf like and elves troll like.
---
I love wows graphic style, I think it‚Äôs one of the games biggest charm
---
All the AFK LFRaids do not confirm this.
---
Nah, it wasn't there until Cata. Many classes still wore other armor types even in ICC, such as the cloth spellcaster boots (BiS for moonkin and ele shaman along cloth users) or leather wrists (Halion's one was BiS for enh, while DB leather one with armor pen was BiS for most physical users, including platers like fWar and fDK).
---
Wtf.. worst comparison.
---
Dude, I don't know what to tell you about all that, our raid is competitive enough that we don't worry about stuff like that, no one is going to want to raid as a meme spec with us anyways, so we don't need to go down the rabbit hole about it.
---
So you're shifting from just "can't take them seriously" to "don't want to give them ad revenue"... okay. Get an adblocker and whitelist the sites which *do* pander to your political tastes, maybe?
---
At any rate, do you now concede that Chuck Norris really is a bit of a prick?
---
Look in other of this posts messages , we talk about Wallpaper Engine , it's downloaded through Steam ! and is very easy to work with .
---
I hate dungeons runs lasting for longer than they should. I want to be the best dungeon tank for overall speed and efficiency and hopefully off tank for raids and can‚Äôt decide between Druid and warrior. I will play with a full time healing priest 99% of the time.
---
And yet Blizzard prioritized supporting German and French and other languages and giving them their own servers for over a decade before they ever considered giving Australia local servers.
---
Blizzard only cares about the macro scale. If they had to choose between half the Germany playerbase and the entire Oceania playerbase, they'd choose Germany.
---
And yet they screwed Germany so hard, the largest forum thread to ever exist on their forums in the history of WoW keeps growing.
---
Australia better get ready to be screwed over too.
---

---
Between the skills being split up between 3 specs and pruning, none of my DPS specs have full bars anymore. And they all pretty much amount to build, build, spend. 
---
The new animations and spell effects look fantastic, but they definitely went overboard removing things. Even my friends that are still die hard fans of retail agree that the classes don't feel great right now.
---
Stop moving the goalposts and Google it yourself dumbass
---
Mana.
---
Those were two different groups of High Elves. All the WC3 Blood Elves left for Outland. In Vanilla, the only High Elves were either neutral or with the Alliance, mostly Jaina and the Kirin Tor.
---
Can someone explain me the cultural fenomenon around Keanu Reeves?
---
Generally you want 3 classes at most. They need to synchronize well together.
---
Keanu takes down mythic raids in greys, look!
---
Now they've screwed Germany so hard, the largest thread to ever exist on the DE forums in the history of WoW keeps growing.
---
i was arguing about that aswell, most pserver Players say Orc.
---
But if i watch Beta streams, it seems that most rogues get feared into oblivion all the time.
---
Maybe u just dont notice the stun resist that much? 
---
I remember that WL is a hard counter to rogue (if played well) so Wotf could be handy here.
---
On the other side, there will be lots of alliance Rogues and every single one of them has a better racial for Rogue 1v1 than UD Rogues. Orc on the other hand just need to resist one stun and its gg most of the times. 
---
What u need to think about aswell: Rogue Insignia doesn¬¥t break stun but fear!
---
Female Orc Rogues look pretty nice (especially in endgame gear) and have nice animations...the sounds are...lets say you maybe need to get used to them
---
UD just looks nicer.
---
Thats my few cents, can¬¥t really decide aswell :D
---
If your raid is competitive enough that you don't have to worry about it, why are you so against it happening ?!?!?!?!?!??
---
Also to be honest the gearing argument is also quite weak. There are a lot of overlaps between rogue and warrior gear and pre raid warriors are almost equal / better than bwl rogues (or anyone else for that matter).
---
Currently reading War of The Ancients myself as I wait for this to arrive my door! :D
---
Haha, honestly my daily routine involves crafting a BUNCH of potions - for all my characters. So I just leave it there. Slightly OCD so removing the bags would frustrate me a little also.
---
Ele Shaman or Spriest
---
I love all the control Ele brings, but it seems like there's a lot going on at once. Will be a huge learning curve for me. But it's two-aided, as once that learning curve is passed, I have huge control I've true battlefield and a ton of utility, which I love.
---
I have a solid grasp of Spriest I think l, and it really draws me in due to how unique they are in both their actual spells and the rarity of players playing the spec in general. Seems like a great Spriest could make a name for themselves on their server, while you'd likely have to be a R1 Glad to stand out amongst the vast number of Shaman there likely will be. But just like Shammy, it's two-aided as there's a reason Spriest isn't played much, it's not highly desired in raids or premades.
---
Balance. Something on the left, something on the right.
---
Tag a bunch of mobs, 5-10 or however healty permits with moonfire and insect swarm. Gather them, barkskin and hurricane for aoe
---
Look at the meme again
---
I never lose
---
I saw what he wrote and honestly it doesn't surprise me, he's from a time where these were the mainstream views, doesn't make him a bad person in my eyes
---
Shadow priests just arent that great in BGs. Mostly because of mana but when it comes to defending well most people running flags are druids anyway and priest has no mobility. What are you gonna do to stop him? You wont be able to kill a druid that fast ad yeah you can fear him to gain some time and then what? He'll just run away. I dont think there are many dps specs worse at defending than shadow priest tbh.
---
Because rets, ele, enh, boomkin, are all a joke, they aren't "just a little behind", they are garbage barely beating the tank behind.  A rogue isn't even comparable to that trash.
---
Not bursty at all, easily avoidable cc, easily broken cc, dots cleansed away if horde priest, purged and one shot if alliance, gets destroyed by most classes 1v1, doesn't contribute literally anything a disc or Holy priest wouldn't, getting disrupted during a shadow spell means you're literally just going to have to stand there grooving on it, doing nothing.  
---
  Also I think you meant WSG? Unless you mean aRathiBasinbattleGround? xD
---
Look at what Keanu did to the guy who killed his dog... Dont tell him who killed the dinos.
---
I've been playing World of Warcraft Classic Beta in the meantime.
---
Hey I'm Keanu and I'm a Hunter
---
Cut to him taming the entire internet
---
Plenty of more useful somethings.
---
nice one bro :)
---
No they didn't. The ones that left for Outland were the warriors Kael took with him when he traveled south, it's not like he took the entire blood elf population with him.
---
Now this could be a Mandela Effect or I simply played WoW at the VERY start of release to witness this, but before Chuck Norris it was "Vin Diesel" jokes. 
---
AKA, stuff like "When Vin Diesel does a push up, he pushes the earth down" stuff. 
---
I know very shortly later it was adapted to be Chuck Norris, but for a smidgen of time it was Vin Diesel. It was leaked he was a D&amp;D nerd, and Chronicles of Riddick released sometime in 2004 so people rode the wave.
---
For raiding: If you are healing as a Shaman, there's a very high chance your guild will want you to spec for Mana Tide. It's too good not to have.
---
Honestly, Shadow will be more likely to get a raid spot as their main spec. Since they are starting the game with 16 debuff slots, if there are a good amount of Warlocks in your guild Shadow Weaving is awesome. And Shadow does semi-decent damage as well. 
---
Elemental, unfortunately just can't cut it in raids. Not enough mana regen, no threat dump. Bursty damage. You'll be low end on the meters, then you run out of mana and quickly tank toward the bottom because you have no damage going out. You'll pull Aggro because you got a couple crits in a row.
---
WoTF. You'll spend most of your time attacking clothies, 2/3 of them have Fear and the other clothie (mage) won't be countered by any Horde race.  
---
In raw numbers being an Orc will benefit you more because there are so many other Warriors, Rogues and Paladins out there, but realistically speaking how often will you open these 3 classes? Not nearly as much as classes that use Fear as their primary defensive tool.
---
72 is close to life expectancy? Do you live in Syria?
---
Path of Exile. New league is pretty darn awesome, and I really enjoy my Ice Shot Deadeye and her 36 projectile Void Shot volley
---
So? There's less than 10 Blood Elves on Azeroth during Vanilla. There's at least 10x that many High Elves on Azeroth during Vanilla.
---
There is nothing special here I don't know why you're posting it.
---
2 monitors are the standard for the majority of people now.
---
Is this why internet points are a thing? I wonder if reddit would be dead forum if there were no points
---
OCE will 100% get servers. We weren't given Retail servers until what, Cataclysm? The Oceanic community was biggest during BC/Wrath and has only ever gone down since. The fact that those servers are still running, including servers for D3, HotS, SC (even though that Australian server is beyond dead) bodes well for those hoping for OCE Classic realms. My estimate is 1x PvP, and 1x PvE.
---
And yes, of course Blizzard doesn't own the data centres. They pay to use them. And they're not going to pay to use them in half or more of the countries of the European continent.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but Germany doesn't have official servers right now, do they? It's just EU servers as a whole right? Same for France, UK? I know that South/Central America have their own servers too, but it's not separated by country either.

All four of which are pretty clearly violated by attacking LGBT people, and calling out Obama and authorities in the Boy Scouts in the process.

There's difference between words and actions
---
&gt; it‚Äôs about sustainable player populations over the 2 year lifecycle of Classic.
---
Just curious, did blizzard officially state that classic is only supposed to run 2 years?
---
They're not though are they.
---
Just finished Prey, and I'm replaying Divinity: Original Sin. Literally just trying to keep busy for another two months lol.
---
Personally, I am glad that achievements are not in. They create an entire meta layer between player and world that takes out a huge amount of mystery, and with it, potential for exploration and discovery. 
---
For me, it's enough that *I* know that I did something. I don't need some cardboard badge stating it - especially if those badges otherwise spoil what I value about the game.
---
That's the joke.
---
I mean you have Fear and MC. There really aren't too many classes hard stopping a druid anyway besides a rogue, or a really well placed hunter trap (as in it doesn't hit them on the way in).
---
But definitely a good point as far as lack of burst.
---
I read chronicles 1 and 2 while being on vacation few weeks ago. Really good!
---
No idea, but people love him recently. He went form being known as a meh actor, to that guy from the Matrix, to not much interesting for a while, to loved.
---
Take away the ability to view and link achievements, and I'd be on-board. Linking achievements as a measure of someone's skill is really bad and leads to the whole "I can't get invited to a raid because I don't have the achievement, and I can't get the achievement because they won't invite me to the raid" situation.
---
Yea mostly talking WSG
---
You're not wrong about most of that except the 1v1 thing. Spriest is the best 1v1 class in the game.
---
He‚Äôs a great actor that has recently played a fan favorite John Wick, not only that he‚Äôs a really *really* good human being that makes people really love him. Not only all of that, recently it was revealed he‚Äôs going to be in cyberpunk which has everyone going apeshit. Hope that clears it up :)
---
You weren't given local servers until right before Warlords of Draenor.
---
&gt;  but Germany doesn't have official servers right now, do they? Same for France, UK? 
---
In Retail they do, in Classic they don't.
---
&gt; I know that South/Central America have their own servers too
---
Latin America and Brazil both have their own servers, but guess what? They're still hosted in Los Angeles today.
---
&gt; OCE will 100% get servers
---
You simply don't know this and so far what we do know of Blizzard's decision making for Classic servers points to the opposite.
---
He does. There are 2 questions about Classic answered there.
---
Makes sense. But 30/0/21 ele is beloved in BGs and they have equal if not worse mana sustain.
---
OF course they bring a metric fuck load of utility, but they'll also likely be on offense 90% of the time.
---
I would use it. But what about offhand? What should I get or it doesn't matter?
---
38 would be the halfway point for a North American male. It is only marginally better in countries with higher life expectancies and is not 41 or higher for any country.
---
Warriors I can‚Äôt say for sure but 70 percent of the classes are easily more engaging in bfa than classic. I love classic way more but classes are definitely not it‚Äôs strong point
---
But for real a hardcore mode separated from the original one would be very nice imo.
---
No, but Classic only realistically has 2 years worth of content and Blizzard will be looking for an opportunity to convert Classic players over to Retail with the next expansion.
---

Try Terraria or Stardew Valley. Both very cheap games with excellent reviews. You can spend hundreds pf hours playing these games.
---
I recently started replaying old Bioware games - Baldur's Gate, and Neverwinter Nights. I am surprised about just how well BG holds up, and just about how much frustrating jank was in NWN.
---
He's a pretty awesome guy who has done some pretty awesome things.
---
This is just my opinion, but I think it's because he does his own stunts stays out of the BS media/TMZ pretty standup dude (I never hear anything bad about him) keeps a low profile. He makes fun of himself in some cameos. Does his own stunts and was freaking Neo from The Matrix.
---
I'm sure I'm missing a lot, but this is literally from the top of my head and it's all good things. I think he probably donates to charities too which wouldn't surprise me.
---
Tranquil air totem by itself is better than full rogue if you have four fury warriors that are threat throttled. How could rogue compete with ench shaman that brings more than just that one totem?
---
Hahah yeah. So he's a rolemodel? Cool, thanks man :)
---
Yeah, because we are all breathtaking!
---
Hunter for lvling, less gear dependent, but if you want it more challenging go rogue, is even better, but harder to level . On the other hand a blessing in wpvp
---
Yea by Ele I definitely mean 30/0/21 healing in raids.
---
But that's tough if I'll have to be full resto for raids as well. I figured Shamans will be in high enough demand, I'd be able to find a guild that would let me go with the hybrid and just kinda keep me with the melee's provided another few Shaman have the totem.
---
I'd also hope to find a guild that would want to PvP together, so hopefully they'd see the viability of me going 30/0/21.
---
There were fuck all blood elves in vanilla because there was a limit to the amount of content - you'll notice they didn't even try to implement quel'thalas because they wanted to do it in full later. Almost all surviving high elves became blood elves, the only ones that didn't were the ones that hadn't returned to quel'thalas and the ones exiled from it.      
---
     
---
Since during vanilla pretty much every blood elf is either in quel'thalas or outland neither of which exist yet, and all the high elves are outside it in places that *do* exist, obviously there are going to be way more high elves around. That doesn't mean that they outnumber blood elves, almost all remaining elves are blood elves - the high elves are a remnant of a remnant.
---
I feel like this is the best approach because then it would allow retail players the ability to get legacy achievements and basically give more reason for retail players to stick around.
---
Is it possible to flag myself to PvP on PvE servers and opt-in and out whenever I want? Or is world PvP 100% nonexistent on PvE servers?
---
I'm right now at my.... I think sixth attempt to play through Baldur's Gate 1+2 now.
---
I leveled as a prot warrior on a PvP server back then. I was a bit late, so there were plenty of 60s on the server already when I was still leveling. I very rarely had any really bad experiences during leveling. Even STV wasn't to bad. Either I was just very lucky, or my server was really chill.

LFM EMP RUN, IRONFOE RESERVED
---
If you don't see a need to do it, don't do it! Pretty easy. 
---
That's why I don't like achievements in modern WoW. You do things you would never do because obviously it isn't fun for you. You do it just for the badge to show other people "look what I've done"... But I guess this is the instagram society nowadays. Glad it wasn't like this back in 2004.
---
The raw numbers aren't useful, but the percentages are. There's no argument to be made that any one region will have a larger margin of returning players to Classic than any other. If Germany has consistently had almost 3x the number of WoW players over Oceania, it's a safe assumption they'll have roughly that number in Classic.
---
only a complete aspie would so thoroughly ignore context 
---
&gt;I‚Äôd loved to at least log in and see if my Mac can run Classic.
---
kys
---
&gt;  the classes are just so simplified and I dread combat...
---
I played BfA for a month or two, and the issue about combat for me was that it has no variation: Every fight feels the exact same, it is mind-numbing. 
---
At least in Classic, different mobs had me use different approaches. Combat, while "mechanically simpler" actually felt a lot more varied.
---
You bring a fucking resto shaman in that spot, you don't bring an enh, you don't bring a another rogue or a warrior, you bring a resto shaman, stop trying to justify a spot for an enh shaman, there isn't one in any raid that is trying to be optimal.  The warriors have their spots, the rogues have their spots, and the shamans have their spots, play the right spec, not the meme spec, it's really simple man.  But you are right, casual guilds and pugs, let people play gimpy ass enh shamans all they want if that is fun for them, I don't get it, but more power to them, who cares.
---
Weird anecdote. I made a Mage on a private server and got to 20, bought ALL spells my mage trainer had to offer. Got back to questing and realised I didn't have blink, went back to my trainer and it was available.
---
I've just started playing on a different server, got to level 20 and done the same thing. Learnt ALL spells and didn't get Blink at 20. Going to go back to test if I can buy it. Possible bug with pservers.
---
&gt;  So I would want to do some testing to see if it would be better dps.
---
What do you mean by this? It says right on their 2%/. It's not like it's a chance on hit and we do not know what the proc chance is. We have enough information to compare them.
---
Shouldnt this be part of the stickied "what should i play" thread?

People would hardly leave the cities without a group, and the requirements for a raid would be vastly higher than they already likely will be.

---
I still have no idea what you were talking about. Is runeterra and all that other shit supposed to be something in wow or another game?
---
I have 0 problem with them exploring different cultures--WoW is packed to the brim with references to just about every mythology and culture in the world. I'm just saying it felt out of place. It has nothing to do with culture or color palette (well, at least not on it's own) it's just that they didn't seem to have much regard for sticking to a similar style. It's like if you inserted Simpsons characters into Futurama. Both have a great artstyle and they obviously have some similarities but side by side they would look super out of place. I feel like that analogy explains my point pretty well
---
It's better when players have their own personal achievements that they make. You don't need a tab that says you did something to enjoy it.
---
Most important question: did you prepare early enough? Is your child old enough to farm for you?
---
Sadly in 1.12 outdated :(
---
That doesn't really matter though. The entire story of the Blood Elves joining the Horde happens after the Burning Crusade and they TRIED to join the Alliance first.
---
There was no Vanilla lore preventing Blizzard from having Blood Elves / High Elves for the Alliance and Goblins for the Horde in TBC.
---
It's war out there son, and if you can't handle that you'll be better of on a PVE server.
---
with that logic there‚Äôd be no reason to test the most basic quests or dungeons, yet we‚Äôve found bugs there
---
Oh it's definitely not impossible. You'll just have to compete with the other Shamans for the privilege of being one of the couple that don't need to spec Mana Tide. So it depends on your guild and the rest of the Shamans you raid with.
---
right, so assumptions. we don't know.  
---
I was just wondering if you had any numbers. thanks anyway
---
rofl
---
sigh
---
So are you going to bring 8 resto shamans, 1 druid and 3 priests? I doubt that, priests heal better than shamans so that is not optimal either. There will be groups without totems. 
---
I am done explaining this to you. In my opinion you are being extremely dense / close minded about this instead of even giving it proper thought.
---
Nice hold OP. They look great.
---
I'm a collector. If you ever consider selling them, send me a DM.
---
MC doesnt work on druids

The numbers come from here: http://www.warcraftrealms.com/
---
The only thing we do know is that Blizzard decided to go against 14 years of practice and policy by not giving Germany their own realm for the very obvious reason of wanting all the EU players on the same realm for server population stability.
---
So it's not too far a leap to suggest Blizzard will decide to go against a mere 5 years of practice and policy by not giving Oceania their own realm for the very obvious reason of wanting all the OCE players on the same realm (as the US) for server population stability.
---
Oh shit, you're right.
---
ya, I agree entirely  
---
I read your first comment on my phone and I think I misunderstood you entirely, rip
---
You don't seem to be the type of player who should be playing on a PvP server, you have too much of a victim complex. I personally will enjoy wiping out people's world buffs when they try to get to raids, corpse camping a player dozens of levels lower till they take rez sickness or log out, why? They chose the wrong faction, forge yourself in the fire of pvp and grow a thick skin or stick to a carebear server ya fairy.
---
The sense has nothing to do with ping. It has to do with population stability. If blizzard feel that there wont be enough of a population to support a server past the first few months, then they likely wont do them
---
Keanu Reeves offered a seat to a women with a lot of baggage on subway.
---
Also he ate a selfmade sandwich on a park bank.
---
Interesting, I feel completely the opposite and that class design is Vanilla's big point of appeal while since at least Legion retail classes feel streamlined and boring.
---
I've played Hunters, Priests, Warlocks, and now Warrior in various portions of retail. Shadow Priest in Legion was cool, that's about it.
---
Yeah it's tough, seems like either way I go I'll be having to negotiate for either the sole Spriest spot, or one of only a couple hybrid Shaman spots (if even more than one).
---
Almost seems like the Spriest is more cemented in their role funnily enough. Although then you also have people saying you don't even need shadow-weaving unless you have 4+ Locks, so meh.
---
I played since the very beginning of vanilla, not once do i remember Vin Diesel jokes, in vanilla he had barely done any movies yet. And FOR SURE it was never ever a thing before Chuck Norris jokes.
---
Really?
---
I get the oom aspects, but ele kinda suffers the same curse.
---
But I haven't heard about them getting hard outgeared that hard? I've honestly only heard good things about their R12/13 gear. And they don't really compete with mages/locks for gear as their more focused on spell dmg.
---
Is this a result of Spriests simply getting less raid opportunities to even gear up as the content gets harder? Or does their best literally just scale worse than mages?
---
BFA and just got Battlefront 2 since it's only $5 on PC. Having fun with that.
---
:). Thing thing about defending is that being good at 1v1 isnt enough because it wont be a duel. The fc is not trying to beat you, he is trying to get the fuck out so being able to slow him down is i'd say the most important part because 99% of the time you wont be able to kill him alone if he is a druid and knows what he is doing.
---
Was a paladin who switched from alliance to horde at TBC launch. Was fun as hell having the raid leader curse up a storm at how stupid OP paladins are. Did help though, that the first dungeon Kharazan was almost custom made to play to paladins strengths. 
---
You could remove Moroes bleeds, ignore maidens aoe disorient, survive/ignore/bubble out all the stuff shade throws around and the rest consisted of either heavy amounts of tank heal or random adds that would go for healers. For the paladin dps and tank contingent half the instance was undead or demonic. 
---
Back in the Alliance days it was funny as hell watching horde kill videos and helpful tipps. 
---
"We need to place the tremor totems there and group this and that there but watch out for range" - Fear ward, problem solved.
---
"Wing buffet reduces aggro - allow the tank extra time to build up aggr-" - BoS 
---
Another spell with stupid utility that was way underused: BoP 
---
I lost count of the number of tank changes I forced that failed due to resisting a taunt. You can also save kiters that where unlucky or made a mistake and you could dispell a large amount of mortal strikes and physical debuffs like bleed on the tank. 
---
And then there was the Divine Shield pull when the mages where not available.
---
You tried, OP.
---
Bane is required even as Destruction. You want to shave off 0.5 seconds from Immolate just for Conflagrate.
---
Not the important part but I love the depth of your desk. Totally helped me make decision on a new desk! And I have the same speakers.
---
I bought it, stared, and was kinda disappointed tbh. 
---
It's like a history book, stating facts as they happened one after the other (there is no story), only just the history is made up (WoW history) so it gets boring.
---
But maybe it's just me getting old idk :(
---
I dont see how that is relevant to his question because even if that wasnt the case and doing only pvp was just fine orc would still be the better choice
---
If you can't handle the heat get out of the kitchen.
---
He‚Äôs a good actor that doesn‚Äôt let his head get to him. He‚Äôs not flashy, in fact he‚Äôs very humble and seemingly doesn‚Äôt care to show how much money he has made from his jobs, which is becoming more rare in today‚Äôs world. He‚Äôs also an extremely nice and kind man, where if you research enough, you will find tons of things about him being a wholesome human that also seems to be diminishing among the general population (people aren‚Äôt really nice nowadays). 
---
All that, and if you google ‚ÄúKeanu Reeves is immortal‚Äù it strengthens his persona even more. He‚Äôs just a damn good, kind human being and an actor that really care about other people.
---
Your yearbook is stupid.
---
Sonii is missing and you got some errors in spelling.
---
Other than that that‚Äôs a pretty good list to work through till 27th Aug.
---
Thanks for the effort!
---
What‚Äôs your game?
---
The map keeps track of explored zones.
---
At least some of the ones you posted already exist in retail so they wont exist in classic
---
No, in a PVP-only scenario, there's an argument to be made for both Undead and Orc. Neither is objectively superior. Both of their racials will turn fights into wins that the other might not.
---
yeah I love the desk , and it's sturdy as an oak . Weights and absolute ton though xD
---
I made the mistake to buy BFA, never again, the sole reason i'll buy a sub again will be for classic. There's shit ton of people that don't care about BFA and can't have access to the beta..
---
transcendent
---
People always liked Keanu. 
---
He came into public attention with the Matrix. But he had good movies before that as well... Point Break is one, where he played with Patrick S.
---
He had some unfortunate events in his life where some close people died and he was lonely for a long time   
---
(lonely Keanu as the meme was). 
---
We also have some clips and stories where he is really humble and just a nice guy overall.   
---
One that comes to mind is when he takes the metro and he gives his spot to someone else. It's really breathtaking. Seeing a celebrity taking the metro and then being so humble.  
---
The guy overall is a nice dude. This is mostly where he gets his whole love from the audience. 
---
Keanu had ups and downs in his career, Between the Matrix and John Week it was a bumpy road.
---
I like the guy for being a nice human being, at least in public :) but his general reactions suggest to me that he is a nice guy in private as well.
---
Reminds me of Johnny Depp with women.
---
lol SP is an atrocious defender. Every FC will just run past you lmao. SP is decent in offense but easily replaceable by a Mage, Warlock, or Elly. That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs usually no spot for one unless you‚Äôre well known.
---
Mage would beat spriest 1v1 at higher gear levels most of the time. Warlocks are probably strongest 1v1.  There‚Äôs a reason in all duel tourneys there‚Äôs always been a warlock in the final 2, or even in one it was lock vs lock
---
But I haven't heard about them getting hard outgeared that hard? I've honestly only heard good things about their R12/13 gear. And they don't really compete with mages/locks for gear as they're more focused on spell dmg.
---
Is this a result of Spriests simply getting less raid opportunities to even gear up as the content gets harder? Or does their gear literally just scale worse than mages as tje raods progress?
---
lol nice false equivalence
---
Just because a shaman has 30 points in elemental doesn't mean they aren't there to heal. Shamans are an incredible premade tool because they heal well, bring insane totems and have very high burst on demand.
---
Shadow priests are bad in groups because they're slow, clunky, only serve themselves and have a single school of magic. People in 2019 know this and you'll be drained of all your mana but not killed so you're worse than useless for your team. Enhancement shamans and ret paladins are equivalently bad, only they're melee and get terrorized even worse.
---
All of this gets amplified by the fact that healing priests are arguably one of the best, if not the best class in the game. Why drag your team down with a spec that's objectively bad when you could be providing an amazing hybrid mix of both offense and defense.
---
I care about my reputation with the opposite faction why? No one from my faction is going to care if I kill the enemy lowbies lol
---
Why are you still comparing language based servers with country based ones? Germans still have EU servers with great ping, while oceanic players would have to deal with 250ms if they didn't get their own.
---
Hunter sees spriest.
---
Hunter gets an erection.
---
Please god no
---
No. of mail caster items that have close to proper caster stat allotment compared to cloth for PvE DPS per slot:
---
Chest: 1 - tier 1.5 [Zandalar Augur's Hauberk](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.3.5#0-2+1)  
---
Boots: [None](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.3.8#0-2+1)  
---
Gloves: 1 - [Draconian Gauntlets](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.3.10#0-2+1)  
---
Helm: 1 - [Coif of Elemental Fury](https://classicdb.ch/?items=4.3.1#0-2+1)  
---
...I could go on. My point is that if you take a closer look at these items almost all of them have penalties to caster stats because part of the item budget was spent on phys DPS attributes like str, agi, phys crit etc.
---
In classic, epic items ARE your achievements!
---
I played on a PvE server in Vanilla and we had plenty of open world PvP, but it was all by choice. We would hardly ever see flight masters killed because that would often get you /gkicked. People had etiquette.
---
There was always this one doofus showing up to BWL entrance while flagged, causing chaos because of trigger happy members of other raids jumping the red name. So plenty of chaos ensued there too. But if you had world buffs and were disciplined, at least you had the option to not lose your buffs and progress on Nefarian.
---
Tarren mill raids also happened, a lot. But if you got sick of it, you'd wait out your timer and move on with your play session without having to waste time on corpse runs during questing because some incel on their 60 rogue thought it would be funny to camp Ness in STV.
---
If you think people have matured and PvP won't involve petty nolife campers, think again. Just go play Rust and witness how toxic people can be in an anything goes PvP environment.
---
I mean Chuck Norris jokes originated in the 80s or so, long before wow or Vin Diesel
---
Isn't Purgation Isle filled with 57 elite mobs due to the 0.5 armor quest?
---
nobody is answering ur question as to why he‚Äôs recently got so randomly popular but I think the cyberpunk game thing kicked it off then worshipping him just became trendy
---
Some raid bosses kill at least a person or two guaranteed, so nope.
---
They‚Äôre non-elites ranged from lvl 30-34
---
I like this idea. Would move us more towards dnd set ups. If classic wow stays alive in the long run, I hope they implement this!
---
Why do you keep adding 50ms to that number every time you bring it up?
---
[The average ping between Sydney and Los Angeles is less than 150ms](https://wondernetwork.com/pings/Los%20Angeles/Sydney).
---
And I keep bringing it up because Blizzard has historically cared more about language based servers than they have country based ones, and yet they're not making any language based servers for Classic.
---
This is actually not true and pretty blant.
---
How does re Kooning differ in classic from private servers?
---
Are you trying to compare pirate servers made by amateur or the company that literally created WoW?
---
This is the second time I've heard about mages eventually outgearing Spriest. Of that's true that really sucks, but are you sure it's not simply a case of Mages being taken more often in the higher tier raids and therefore having more access to better gear than 90% of Spriests?
---
Also with Spriest being played so little, and Lock/Mage being so applicable to basically every aspect of the game, don't you think that could impact people's choices in duel tourneys as well? A legit Spriest was a rarity in classic, is my understanding at least.
---
Why do you think lock is best 1v1? Soul link that OP?
---
Mostly unrelated but our hunters back in the day used to name their pets after our MT/OT so that raid alerts would fire when the pet died.
---
I‚Äòm gonna be honest, I will absolutely play on a PvP Server and will take every fight I can take, I even admit I will be killing any low level player I see, maybe 2 times if they happen to be on my way again, but i never understand that corpse camping, like what is actually fun about it? I‚Äôm absolutely fine with anyone ganking me, even if it‚Äôs 3-4 times, but corpse camping, i don‚Äôt see the point in wasting the time. When I see someone does that to me, I simply go AFK and do something else irl, let only the corpse camper waste his time.
---
I used to MC unlucky travelers off the lifts between Barren and 1k Needles lol.
---
(I'm a terrible person.)
---
Tbh you won‚Äôt be very effective at dealing damage until T2 set with spell power. Before that you can go crit and plate with retribution to be a watered down arms warrior or do your duty and go holy and be unkillable and best pvp healer in the game
---
Thanks to  [/u/AthenaNosta](https://fr.reddit.com/u/AthenaNosta), [/u/Eversora](https://fr.reddit.com/u/Eversora) and [/u/Teeb](https://fr.reddit.com/u/Teeb)  for making the map.

---
Like him its a 120x90 print.
---
I never stacked pure spell damage mail.
---
I rolled with 5/8 tier 2 (crit bonus), zg augur chest piece, primalist off pieces from bwl, class trinket, malistars and the dagger from zg, coupled with the class trinket, made me very dangerous in PvP and also a good healer in the same situations as 30/0/21.
---
Adding to what other people said.
---
On top of the already existing love for him as an icon of the cyberpunk genre, the recent surge and "breathtaking" memes comes from the recent E3.
---
CD Project Red (developers of the Witcher series) hired him to play one the main characters in their new game Cyberpunk 2077, they did a good job in keeping it secret and people found out at E3 during the presentation where Keanu made an appearance.

The bare necessities.
---
why you standing like your about to ask for my manager
---
Lmao you know I‚Äôm right.
---
Elemental shamans need the mix. If you‚Äôre a non raiding pleb and think dracorians and elemental fury are good items then omegalul at you.
---
The class trinket. Tier 2 and zg stuff, make us potent crit machines and excellent healers. 
---
But good luck to you.
---
I had nearly 6k armour, 5k hp and 6k mana rolling around AB dealing 4K instant burst every six seconds.
---
This is awesome, any chance you‚Äôre going to do Mage?
---
I played from day 1 on a PVE server all the way through to WotlK and not once did I or anyone else I played with regret it or feel like we were missing out.
---
In fact I have some great memories of open world PVP battles.
---
I did consider switching to PVP servers for classic as I do enjoy PVP but I am also not someone that attacks every horde I see or that gets any enjoyment from griefing other players.
---
So after giving it plenty of thought I will be rolling on a PvE server again.
---
I genuinely think most of the people on this subreddit believe that there is no world PvP on PvE servers at all and it's simply not true. There is. You just have the added option of opting out of being griefed and ganked which is desirable for a nice guy like myself.
---

I think spriest will actually be ok (not great or BiS)  for defending nodes , especially dwarf priests. Being able to not only have the first enemy fear countered but also stoneform a blind could be game saving , or just buy enough time for reinforcements 
---
I think spriest will be sleeper op, but will also need to be played around a lil bit
---
It's funny how this post is purely about aesthetics, but 50% of the answers still talk about racials.
---
Back to topic: I would go night elf (female) rogue all day every day:
---
* Size similar to human, so equip is very visible
---
* Animations are really great (this is why female &gt; male NE)
---
* Mounts are amazing: Black saber for a rogue? Hell yeah!
---
* Night elves already look very dexterous (front flips!)
---
Let me guess, you actually like the pandaren and you just wanted to be mad at something right?
---
Goblins were neutral, there were too few high elves to make any sense as a playable race and the alliance betrayed Kael'thas and sent him to die.
---
Resto shaman x1
---
Warrior tank
---
3 mages 
---
Go 20 into arcane on mage and full resto on shaman 
---
Warrior runs in and gets aggro on the mobs for a solid 10 sec. Mages in and spam arcane explosion. Rinse repeat.
---
I suppose someone could make an add-on for it, the difficulty with that you would need it active from the start. 
---
I've never been an achievement hunter. Its not how I play games, but in WoTLK I was absorbed in them. It was a lot of fun, so I could see how someone would miss them.

You link that like its actually true or everyone lives in Sydney... I've played WoW since vanilla and as you keep pointing out, I've delt with american servers for vanilla &amp; 4 expansions, never have I had an MS under 200 and low 200 is rare which makes the game an awful experience.   
---
They do care about Germany servers because they haven't removed your servers or made you connect from another country, as everyone has already pointed out if blizzard doesn't have language based servers (they should) Germans will just pick 1 server and it will become the "German" server, you'll still get to enjoy the game.
---
If you spend that time doing something profitable that‚Äôs not too much hassle you‚Äôll have a better time and more play time.
---
Ds is only one of the pve specs. There is also the sm/ruin spec which is less represented due to debuff limit, but still needed and viable. Also that's not even counting pvp specs

Crits forced by sitting down don't proc Reckoning. Esfand has confirmed that there's a way around it by abusing batching iirc (if you stand back up at the right moment, the attack will still crit but your character will be registered as standing), but it remains to be seen whether the average player can do it consistently enough to make reckoning a viable build.
---
Err show me where tier 2 and primalist/ zg spell
---
Mail has strength on it? 
---
Strength is also a shitty enhancement stat anyway. 
---
You‚Äôre out of your depth.
---
I mean this seems to be the default response of anyone that is pro PvP. If doing this is a worthy sacrifice you have to make for an overall more enjoyable gaming experience then that's fine but there is another option which may be better for some players.. play PvE.

I'm pretty sure you've managed to completely miss what I've been talking about the entire time
---
Yeah that's my thought as well. Just seems like the spec shines in such a niche way and has been so underplayed, there has to be some undeveloped potential somewhere.
---
Go out and download it off the discs while I'll have it pre-installed and be able to play minute one. These memories are heavily distorted by 'Rose tinted glasses' it was a beautiful time of our lives for all of us. I'm sure there'd be some people who would love to wait 90 mins to get it at midnight but that time for us, and the world, has passed.
---
There is a difference between aesthetic quality and graphical quality. The newest AAA games have great graphical quality but terrible aesthetic quality which is why in 2-5 year's they always look terrible.
---
WoW has okay graphical quality (same quality as most Indie Games) but superb Aesthetic Quality.

Aww yiss Fury latex warrior!
---
But in raid you have healeers who can ressurect right?
---
Maybe perma death is only when you release spirit. Anyway playing hardcore mmo would be really...hardcore :O
---
There‚Äôs new games with great aesthetic quality and there‚Äôs new games with crap aesthetic quality as well.
---
Same goes for 2004, some great, some crap.
---
Is that a [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]???
---
This is just my opinion from what I've read.
---
SM/Ruin is a raiding spec that is okay at PvP and farming. If you were focused on raiding and doing some PvP then it would be a better choice than DS/Ruin if you didn't want to respec. You could drop Fel Concentration for Amplify Curse, Curse of Exhaustion and Improved Curse of Exhaustion, and I'm not sure exactly how many points you really need in Suppression.
---
The Destro build you linked is a PVP spec with some utility for farming and dungeons. It won't be good at raids. It's lacking SM/DS for optimal DPS, along with crucial talents in the Destro tree, like Improved Shadow Bolt and Bane - much of your DPS in raids is from Shadow Bolt, especially in the start when many mobs are fire-resistant. There also aren't any fire spells to spam in raids and it isn't a given that you'll have a debuff slot to use Immolate since there is a 16 debuff limit in Classic.
---
A better spec, IMO, would be: [7/10/34](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IV0bZfxZxx0trMtt)
---
Instead of SM or DS for raiding, this build opts for the utility of Improved Imp and Improved Healthstone (depending on guild you might only have 1 in this or none). Most guilds would like a Warlock in the MT group for Blood Pact, and SM/Ruin won't have Improved Imp and so you bring something useful, especially if your other Warlocks would rather go DS/Ruin. You're only really losing the 10%/15% damage from SM/DS over a raiding build and you can swap the 4 points in Intensity/Pyroclasm around to suit your needs, along with any you don't use in Improved Healthstone.
---
Nope. You made a false statement in your OP stating that spell power mail has melee stats budgeted into it when quite clearly the actually good items you want (BWL tier 2, Zg mail) don‚Äôt.
---
Some of it does. A bulk of it doesn‚Äôt. Most ele shamans I know pvp with 5/8 tier 2 on because it‚Äôs actually good, supplemented with primalist pieces from Bwl (no competition), class trinket (no competition), malistars (no competition) and generally a spell power dagger from ZG, or if unlucky the mace from MC.
---
Been doing this a while man. My paper doll has white strength and agility when I‚Äôm geared.
---
What if you could still Rez, but permadeath if not rezzed within 5 mins?
---
Well blizz said it required an active sub and no one I seen got in without a sub.
---
Zug zug.
---
You mean like Deadmines, THE most ran dungeon in the game, which ended up with no water?
---
Can confirm
---
Hey, at least you get to feel special and like an underdog.
---
Can't see any death threats my dude.
---
Multiboxing is an instant ban on all of the popular private servers.  
---
That guy runs his own server because he has created addons/his own multibox software for other multibox players to play on and test his product.
---
I bow before you, /u/MrBobSquatalina, Shaman god and self-proclaimed expert of all things mail caster gear.
---
I ask myself this question every day, your guess is as good as mine bud.
---
Do yourself a favor and just roll on a pve server.  All of the pvp you want will still be there, minus the ganking and more importantly minus the streamers.
---
Lmao whatever dude.
---
Thats true, but Soul Link isn't a spec you'd use for BG's and especially not a premade.
---
How to make moving wallpaper on windows?
---
Are you sure?
---
&gt; Before patch 1.10, the mobs on the Isle were only level 20-30. Now they are 57+ elites, and have become part of the Tier 0.5 armor quest.
---
The only thing that a pvp server has that a pve server doesn‚Äôt have is ganking.
---
All this hate for oceanic people being optimistic that blizz will hook em up. Blizz will stop being silly.
---
Go away grumps. 
---
To answer your question westcoast rp server will be your best bet. This is for everyone conforming to rp servers rules.
---
Otherwise go on the oceanic classic discord and look for interest in a rp guild on one of the oceanic servers. You will get ipwnux running around but you will have a community to rp with.
---
What, you can talk yourself up but I can't point it out is that it?
---
you make sense more than the rest love it
---
This is far more informative :P

The class vs all column tells you all you need to know, but I'm sure with full T2.5 and MoM he'll be turning some heads in MC when the rest of the raid is in pre-raid BiS ;)

Hadnt been posted here yet and between all the memes from 10 years ago I found the quest log thingie quite funny (and cringe).

Mt disconnects
---
&gt;how many points you really need in Suppression
---
All of them? At least in the early phases, as we don't exactly have any other +hit stuff.
---
&gt;and it isn't a given that you'll have a debuff slot to use Immolate
---
You won't get a slot for it.
---
The only choice I'm struggling with now is Tauren or Orc.. Warstomp or Sun Resist. Decisions decisions
---
TBC with death knights? Something seems a bit incorrect.
---
You must be fun at parties :)
---
Tell that to the 5k+ players on the new Silver Hand server, practicing runs, testing characters, gearing twinks or just plain fishing for the fun of it. Everyone knows they won't play those toons in two months, yet the server is full. What is your motivation to play vanilla if not for the love of the grind?
---
What? I‚Äôm pointing out your narrow view of elemental gearing options. Your response is in you.
---
All if the people invited were streamers. Fixed that for you.

Thug shirt or footpads shirt.

There aren't going to be enough servers for Germany to pick one and dominate it.
---
If I go with your reasons I'll only play a few weeks. Won't be long till MC is cleared for everyone.
---
He only out damaged pures that died early, discipline/holy priests doing off-spec dps and the odd tank here and there (but mostly not even those)  
---
And I don't mind him playing a bad raid spec or the raid carrying him, it's their business.
---
Angwe
---
I don't really like Achievements. They make something a goal without meaning. If I want to explore the map because I just do, I will. You can use flight masters as your evidence. :)
---
I believe I stated that mail spell damage gear has a bunch of non caster stats on it which makes it worse than cloth.
---
Which lead to your diatribe.
---
I would realy like a statistics screen. 
---
How many mobs killed.
---
How long i played on each level.
---
How often i did a dungeon.
---
How many ore/her nodes i gathered.
---
etc....
---
no achievements, no internet points, just the numbers
---
Well, since this post can be considered very retarded, I tried to put even more stupidity into my answer and I truly though, my intention will be clear to everyone
---
From what I remember, paladins aren't awesome :(
---
That's awesome! Are you going to hang it near your PC?
---
What's different on a RP server? I can't believe everyone role play on the server. What is different then just having a RP guild?
---
Server was full during launch. Now Days its been low to medium. Server came out a few days ago Only
---
I've already 100% decided that I'm playing either warlock or rogue, possibly a paladin or a shaman, depending on what my friend picks, and a quick alt for either hunter or a warrior. Also I've designated druid as an alternative choice if I suddenly felt like healing.
---
So true. Love every minute of it haha
---
You are wrong. There's other ways to get your wow fix.
---
Only those that died early in the fight
---
Wallpaper engine - search for it on steam.
---
Either way it would be fucked and most people would bail on the idea. Pvp servers would certainly be dead.
---
120hz ultrawide is the sweetspot.
---
&gt; What is your motivation to play vanilla if not for the love of the grind?
---
Permanence and character progression? That's always been the motivation with the genre.
---
I think hunters with downranked wing clip have the highest proc.
---
You have no evidence to support that.
---
Would be the worst idea in the world on a PvP server.
---
I'm looking for full playthroughs, not some arbitrary wow fix though.
---
Gameguide post number... 394?
---
Indeed which is an incorrect statement.
---
Thus my diatribe.
---
&gt; All of them? At least in the early phases, as we don't exactly have any other +hit stuff. 
---
Sorry, I meant for PvP. I think that it is 3/5 for 6%. If it is, then you could take 2 of those points and 3 from Imp. CoA and have both Fel Concentration and CoE.
---
damn it this is good
---
Idea is cool, but you are right.
---
Haha
---
They might not increase the beta to 60. If people can see all the end-game content on Twitch they might not want to play anymore. Specially since the end-game on this phase is so incredibly easy.
---
Until about mid day :)
---
Thank you. I've loved reading my first world of warcraft book. Seeked out some of the stuff that happened ingame, it's absolutely amazing
---
&gt;These are all player driven 
---
That is a very good point actually, you could always just sick call the raid, but now way to do that with Blizzard's system.
---
Good point.
---
Eh, if the entire game or server was predicated around that concept I'm not so sure. It would likely be a fairly regular thing that people reset.
---
An spriest has nothing a real priest cant do, while not being able to heal. Its way too easy to CC a single priest. They can easily be sapped or polymorphed. They have no burst damage, a druid can easily outheal your "burst".
---
Do yourself a favour and avoid oceanic servers full stop.
---
I think people are talking about different things.
---
When I talk about Vanilla being harder, I'm absolutely not talking about raiding, I'm talking about leveling and maybe dungeons, and it's not really things like rotations.
---
There is no point for a war to be the nightfall guy because he loses more personal dps than what nightfall gives in raid dps.
---
I can hardly wait for that ending. Already banned from r/Wow for being too toxic.
---
Ah I see what was happening now - when it loads the item or whatever, it was slightly scrolled down (not revealing the X), if I just scrolled up, there it was - awesome (I was admittedly at work and distracted when viewing this initially).
---
Yep, did the BiS search per max level - looks great man. Great job.
---
Couldnt you skin critters(deer,rabbit) in vanilla? and has this been brought back in classic? cause just started playing bfa, a druid with leatherworking couldnt skin critters thought this was possible.
---
I know I'm a sick and evil man.
---
As you say enhance is viable but not optimal.
---
Sure you can have fun pvp, pve, but if you wish to raid it's a no. Sub par dps. Plus resto shammy will bring the totems so why bring you.
---
Reading Stormrage and gonna have chronicle books soon !
---
Eh, I'm not so sure. A druid would get rolled in a 1v1 with a Spriest. A good Spriest would be able to rot several players in a BG, as well as having extremely strong single target.
---
The real counter to them is their own mana pool. A druid isn't outhealing a Spriest's focused target.
---
No
---
PvP hit cap is 3% plus 1% hardresist. 2 points supression is the amount that is useful for PvP. Since affliction spells in PvE are only curses and maybe (big maybe) corruption, you usually dont take points in supression. 
---
With SM/Ruin you always take amp curse, CoEx and 3/4 imp CoEx
---
&gt; It is more perfect because it uses the system as intended.
---
I place zero value on this. What someone intended is neither here nor there. All that matters is the outcomes.
---
&gt; In your attempt to make it more fair you literally start acting like a ninja and expect everyone else to as well.
---
"Acting like a ninja" is only a problem if you are unethically exploiting the rules to get an unfair advantage. If everyone agrees that the rule is for everyone to roll need on valuable BoEs, nobody is a ninja at all, in any way that matters. Nobody *can* be a ninja.
---
&gt; It is not irrational to vendor the item though. It is just lazy.
---
That depends on your definition of rationality. According to some definitions throwing away (virtual) money is by definition irrational, in the same way that throwing away real money is irrational.
---
&gt; Ultimately a game is played for fun and I don't have fun playing the auction system. So it is perfectly rational for me to not look up the auction house value and just vendor it. Sounds pretty damn logical to me.
---
I would say that it is indeed totally logical, if you have no desire whatsoever for any of the things that in-game money can get you. Otherwise it's fucking idiotic.
---
But I do wonder what you are even doing playing WoW if you have no desire whatsoever for any of the things that in-game money can get you, because most people like upgrades or improving skills or wearing snazzy outfits or *something*.
---
&gt; I think trying to explain your greed doesn't make it any less greedy. You literally don't need the item, you just want it because you see dollar signs.
---
If you are going to twist words that far, nobody "needs" anything because the game goes on even if you never get any loot at all. So you don't need it. So if you click "need" you are a lying liar and a thief. Shame on you. You didn't need it but you clicked "need". You are a monster. I don't think need or greed is the ideal system for people like you if you can't see that.
---
The other guy was very thorough, only thing I'd have to say is, personally, I feel like WL is the perfect class to go Tailoring/Enchanting. With his awesome grinding capabilities by mass doting and the free 40/cheaper 60 mounts I'd never bother with herbalism. Leave that to druids and shamans, who have mobility but can't farm effectively.
---
7/10/34 is an insanely bad spec for PvE to be honest. Imp Imp gets you 12 extra stamina on blood pact while losing 10% damage. A tradeoff that definitely isnt worth it.
---
I somewhat liked MOP but there was a lot of gating and we actually did joke about Pandaren.  They started as a Bilzzard joke.
---
So pity Gandalf is on the list, I tried to make a character with this name on every fresh pserver so many times
---
Just no. What is an spriest supposed to do in a BG anyway? Run around dotting random targets to prevent any kind of CC?
---
A druid is out of your range after your first mindblast.
---
&gt; I think it is more because people don't trust blizzard to do it well... You let them make changes and you'd end up with LFR, perma sharding, every class having an escape, cc, self heal, some gap closer etc. Etc.
---
As I have remarked before, this paranoia is massively irrational. The whole commercial purpose of Classic is to make money off people who liked vanilla enough to pay for it again, but who do not like modern WoW enough to pay for it.
---
Seriously, if you are that far gone in lunatic fear and hatred of Blizzard, just don't play their games. Don't delude yourself that you are casting a magical spell with reddit upvotes that controls them and stops them instituting LFR, sharding *et. al.*
---
&gt; Personally for me the TBC (with toned down DKs)
---
Toned down what now?
---
Retailer's shouldn't be able to get legacy achievements at all.
---
Its been removed for a long time. I forget what patch it was removed.
---
I hate these so much.
---
I hope you‚Äôre feeling okay come August 27!
---
This is probably going to get me laughed at but here goes 
---
I‚Äôve got a 3 year old ‚Äúgaming‚Äù PC I built myself. It‚Äôs obviously nothing special anymore, but it runs WoW very easily.
---
I was going to use my partners 2015 MBP to play / quest occasionally, so I can still be in the same room as her
---
My question is thus -
---
Can I copy my WoW client from my PC, directly onto the Mac (or an external HDD) to play? Or do I need to DL a seperate, Mac client specifically for WoW? 
---
I‚Äôve literally never used a Mac and clearly have no idea. Thanks in advance.
---
Make sure you play with a group of friends cause they probably wont mind bringing a meme spec along, but finding random dungeon groups/raids at 60 will be pretty impossible
---
*has 4k monitor* takes picture on potato.
---
Looks like titan mod (the border) and xpearl ui.
---
Goblins weren't always neutral. And the story can be spun either way. To the elves of Quel'Thalas, they could just as easily believe that Kael consorted with the Naga, was arrested for treason, committed murder in his escape, and then fled to Outland to serve Illidan, abandoning the majority of his people.
---
There's really no reason Blizzard couldn't have had the Blood Elves join the Alliance and then do some version of the Cataclysm volcano/kaja'mite story to have the Goblins join the Horde.
---
gating? lul wut, I think you mean legion, but okay.
---
This will be me heh. Back then i was young and eager to prove my worth, played a ton of pvp whenever i could but this time i just want to enjoy my time and level in peace, not at some no life's mercy.
---
Classic 1st week
---
I second that. I normally don't read, except on holidays. Big characters really come to life and you get a better feeling with some classes. Like Thrall becomming a shaman and Malfurion becomming a druid or Khadgar becomming a badass. 
---
We got about 57 days to prepare. I'm preparing by reading the books.
---
But why I ask because it doesn‚Äôt make much sense, that a man of my stature should have to wear a dress.
---
Dme farming
---
Our guild did that and still struggled in AQ40. Naxx it was really telling, and I am glad we had loot council.
---
I mean of course the druid could run, no doubt. But I don't think any single healer is outhealing a single target the Spriest wants gone. Either they run away for dispels or likely die.
---
A Spriest has two strong CCs in MC and fear. Has strong single target and potent DoTs. Another person to mana burn, taking pressure off your healers, especially important in Horde comps with a greater prevalence of Shaman healers. They aren't the GOAT class, far from it, but I think they definitely get underrated.
---
I think you can but you need the mac version of the wow.exe it‚Äôs the wow.app .
---
Severely underrated and the main reason I'm going NE over Dwarf for my Hunter even though I much prefer the look of Dwarf
---
Don't they have it at GoG?
---
Laughs in Paladin bubble
---
I really expected a Bard class until they joked about it. =/
---
In the end, the game is about progressing your character and wpvp is just content that will delay that process. 
---
I have zero judgement to ppl who chooses not to add that content to their game cuz afterall if you want to fight the oppossing team there is plenty of other (and better options)

well nothing special... Hyjal duo is together again this time saving not world tree but one bull. His majesty the boy king dont want to lose his penfriend and green jesus wants to shine again so he took his fathers rusty axe and came back.
---
they removed the possibility in wotlk iirc
---
Yes it's BiS for shadowrpiests and any healer for that matter.
---
Any healer can outheal the damage an spriest does. You need to CC the healers if you ever want to kill the EFC. Scream is a good CC, but you wont be able to catch a good druid in it. MC wont work vs druids and is easily interrupted.
---
Would you prefer it over nothing? Because vanilla data is MORE inaccurate. That's what I literally said.
---
I wrestled with this choice myself, and ultimately settled on Dwarf. We have very different opinions on the pros and cons of each race though. Remember that you can't change emotes, you can get another mount, you can't change animations, and armor is for you, not other players. If you ever get tired of how a Dwarf look, you can eat a delight or take a noggenfogger.
---
You just pull this out of your asshole or do you have sources? If you have beta access you would know much of the 45+ content isn't even finished. Go to Tanaris and watch the pirates shoot missing textures at you or go to the plaguelands and look at the shit missing there.
---
What is your "burst"? Mind blast that does shit damage compared to any other ranged nuke? You dont have 2x crit, it has only 43% sp scaling.
---
It worked in vanilla, I do not not if it works in classic.
---
Play what you want, you can clear the content with 20 meme specs in the raid, it literally doesn't matter.
---
You must not have beta right? Otherwise you would know this isn't the case.
---
For dungeons def not impossible. And even without friends you can find a guild that accepts weaker specs (within reason).
---
Spouse? Kids? I am unfamiliar with these words... Now where did I put my english-wow dictionary so I may educate myself!
---
What about getting to exalted by 60?
---
I didnt try super hard as a human on private server and got it by 47 i believe. What about if I was a gnome and would only care for level 60 exalted, can i skip spillovers?
---
I still expect a bard class :(
---
No stances? Is this serious... Wtf
---
Okay, I don't care how "good" a model is, I don't want to stare at a big feet big tittied panda bear. I hate female taurens to but at least its just one race
---
No but I am Honored with the Bloodsail Buccaneers, and Exalted with Booty Bay, Everlook, Gadgetzan, Ratchet, Darkmoon Faire, and Ravenholdt. üòé
---
Very satisfying.
---
This is true, and much more viable if OP is happy to lead a guild or put together his own pugs. But people are going to choose the more obvious picks if they have any sort of choice in it.
---
Yes but i believe there was cooldown to when you could switch out of PVP mode.
---
But basically if you attack another faction that is pvp enabled yourself becomes pvp enabled, so wpvp events on pve server was easy to make happen.
---
yes.  world pvp exists on pve servers as well.  Attacking an enemy player or npc will flag you pvp, as will entering an enemy city.
---
Darnassus rep in beta is like half of what it is on many pservers. I‚Äôve easily gotten exalted by level 43 on a pserver solo (wasn‚Äôt able to do a few Feralas quests at 40). On beta you‚Äôd be lucky to hit revered at the same level from what I‚Äôve seen. So plan lots of runecloth turn-ins or wait until the AQ event.
---
Yeah, it's really unfortunate. The end of Wrath was basically the beginning of the end. :(
---
I want my Ner‚ÄôZhul back. Literally chose it because he became lich king and I loved WC3 lore.
---
Okay if you judge every beta like that then every beta has been exactly the same. BfA beta was slam packed during its first week too for example and towards the end it was basically empty because people had seen what they wanted to see.
---
Must.... play.... special.... snow...flake.... claaasss
---
It is now!
---
So what you‚Äôre saying, is that potentially within the WoW folders copied from my PC, should be a mac version of the .exe that I can run?
---
Leadership and personal fit being equal is it better to join a very big vs normal sized guild?
---
Thanks for tip.  Bought it right up! 
---
Darn im so hyped for this
---
Oh i see. Thats sad, the spec is really fun and i heard that the pve content is easy
---
:( thanks man, sadly none of my friends is playing wow
---
And still doing 3 times the damage of a shaman xD
---
Warrior or warlock? Ill play as a maniac the first months then casually 10-20 hr per week.
---
I‚Äôve never player warlock at high lvl but I know what maintaining a raiding warrior means.
---
Help me decide :)
---
If you get in a good guild, you'll never have to play solo, even when you just want to chill. There will always be someone online willing to help you out or join with you for something. I mained a warrior in vanilla so solo was difficult to do, but I was a liked character in the guild so I always had people to play with. Even when I didn't want it. The game is 100 times better with others, even when you feel you may want to be alone or do something no one else could possibly want to do. The only thing you will ever have to truly solo will be your benediction/Anathema quest :-)
---
Crusader Aura was a level 62 spell so it was in Burning Crusade and later.
---
Did that guy seriousy take a picture of his screen?
---
Just use Joanas levelling guide but take it at your own pace, mix in some professions if you feel burned out. It‚Äôll give you an optimal levelling route but most importantly it will tell you when to do your class quests.
---
"Blizzard And The Betrayal" 
---
Chapter 1. Killing Azeroth with a sward was easy.
---
I dont know just plays like a amazing healer. 
---
In warhammer for example you have healers that need to make damage to reach their full heal potential.
---
Dark age of camelot you got 10 buffs and whatnot ontop of healing. 
---
Wow prist is simply healin and he is very good at it and has many options on how to heal.
---
All other wow classes stress me out. Play any kind of tank and you have DD that fuck up your aggro management if you dont play the quickest way possible and because of that you can run after mobs all the fucking time. 
---
The DD classes boil down to press xy buttons in the same order over and over and over.
---
Paladin mount speed aura was added TBC.  If you were ret you did get 8% from talents, but that was actually less then spurs + carrot+ glove enchant was faster and didn't stack with the talent.
---
It‚Äôs rough depending on what it is you are trying to do. Killing mobs around your level is doable but not nearly as efficiently as any dps spec / class. You don‚Äôt really have good pvp solo potential as a holy priest either. You can always farm gathering professions though
---
Why would it matter if we play retail or not? We are already paying subscription.
---
Planning to casually play a mage. Will be focusing on world pvp, and some dungeons with my friends. 
---
Haven‚Äôt decided which professions I‚Äôll choose - some say that engineering is mandatory, and some that tailoring is mandatory. However, I do think that engineering has to be paired with mining since I‚Äôm playing casually. Don‚Äôt really want to spend all my future gold in purchasing mats, or having an underleveled professions. What should I do?
---
I am guild enchanter. Now what?
---
for the horde!
---
You can put anything that way. 
---
‚ÄúIn basketball, you just put a ball through a hoop. Easy.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOnly‚Äù ganking completely changes the way you play the game.
---
The trick to world pvp as a paladin is to find some terrain you can los on and turtle for so long that your friends show up.  If his friends get there faster, you've got bubble hearth.
---
And what if he is still there when you come back?
---
This is why i understand ppl who just dont want to bother with this.
---
The streamers promote pvp servers way too much as the "only choice if youre true gamer" etc. but they dont have to fear some loser just delibretly wanting to ruin your game experience. And i think well see much more of this this time around cuz ppl think its more fun to troll ppl now than 15 years ago.
---
You are on about the wrong bats :) https://classicdb.ch/?npc=8602#abilities these just silence you.
---
As for the money, it's hard to say bc it's private server data. It could be wrong but from pserver droptables:
---
Sleek balt pelt, 31% drop 12silver
---
Evil bat eye, 28% drop 20silver
---
Bat ear 31% drop, 8silver
---
Large bat fang, 26% drop 16s
---
So yeah lots of good trash drops along with skinning, makes it pretty decent cash.
---
What is this book? Is it sold in the US only? Can I buy it at my local lib?
---
Can't swap trinkets twice with SF either :(
---
If you spec and gear as a healer during raid hours it's perfectly viable.
---
 No one mentioned this yet, but Apex Legends got me hooked!
---
What... pvp things happen in pvp server?!?!?! How is that possible???
---
I‚Äôm think of picking either Druid,
---
Warlock or Hunter for classic. My main goal is to pve (quest, Dungeons) and i have very limited time for raiding. 
---
I wanted to go Druid But mainly feral dps but it it seems to work out very poorly and require A lot of effort to be competitive.  
---
I‚Äôm I better if picking warlock / hunter ? 
---
Thank guys!
---
It doesn‚Äôt add content.
---
I was wondering if i can raid as enha. Changing specs for every raid would be expensive af
---
Engineering is pretty cheap to just buy out actually. 
---
However if you plan on only doing world pvp and dungeons then don't worry about tailoring. Tailoring is only used for pve minmaxing with https://classicdb.ch/?item=14152 which certainly won't help you in PVP and it's not that big a deal for just doing dungeons.
---
I love pvp but yea the "just dont play the character you want to for a while" argument is silly.
---
Usually a raid will bring 1 enhancement shaman which was common in the PS scene mainly for Nightfall, other classes can be Nightfall users but with improved totems in the melee group it tends to lean onto bringing the enhance. The best bet is to find a guild early on and just be a good reliable player who bring theirs pots and flasks and utilise your support abilities while not being afraid to swap to some healing gear for some boss fights and you can have an enjoyable time. Just be aware BiS items will tend to go to the pure dps classes until the main raid group has the items before you will have a look in it the guild uses loot council which they should.
---
The move has worn off and people aren't interested in putting in that much effort into a temporary character.
---
There are ofc more multiboxers on pservers because you can multibox for free...
---
Stream a 40 box raid on literally any big pserver and you get banned in 5 minutes.
---
You would have to download the mac version on the mac.
---
Are you planning to roll on PvP or PvE server?
---
For minmaxing, if you plan to focus on PvE, then human, if PvP then dwarf.
---
if I remember right... Gazlowe is from  Steamwheedle Cartel, the one which have been part of horde in second war. But hey... goblins should be in horde since vanilla. I always adored those Gazlowes boys in Kobold tunnels in orc campaign.
---
Why would you take a picture of this on your phone? How do people not know how to screenshot in 2019?
---
Yes you can on classic.
---
I really enjoyed MoP for its environments and the fact that I finally got to be able to use fel fire!
---
But I'll agree it didn't feel like the rest of WoW.
---
WoD was cool if you ignored the story (an iron horde could've been so good without the shitty time travel) but it felt like a mobile game and an excuse to have Gul'Dan back for Legion.
---
My friend and will be leveling as a duo Hunter/Priest. Not so worried about movement speed synergy as we will be taking our time, but wondering if anyone has leveled like this and if there are many benefits? 
---
I assume PW:S on my pet will be pretty handy and along with both being able to heal should allow us to tackle had mobs/quests.
---
This is great, and up-voted, but I thought that poisons *did* scale with spell power. I feel like this has been the case at some point, granted it's been a while.
---
Lotro is still pretty good
---
Ah. Probably not. Maybe in a really bad guild you'll be able to get away with it but I can't imagine that being fun.
---
Hey but what about a 30 21 spec which will allow me to dps and also heal when needed?
---
That's there as an alternative to the 7/5/34 spec, which is worse for PvE. I guess I should have prefaced that option as, "If you want to mainly PvP as Destro and want a less-than-optimal build that your guild might accommodate for raiding, this would be a better option."
---
Warlock are not able to play aff for raids due to the limited debuff slots but how about 5/10 man dungeons? Will I be able to multi dot or is it the same? What about tank aggro?
---
Thanks üôè
---
Roger that. Thankyou
---
Hardest part is being on at the same time or one person wanting to play when the other can‚Äôt.
---
hey Goblins and Gnomes are engineers of their factions since WCII... they belongs to warcraft.
---
There was an insane amount of gating through farming in MOP, but it got so much worse later you forgot or never knew.
---
Yea thats the problem, there will be a lot of "better" specs and classes outthere
---
Do the professions you want. Only worry about min maxing if you want to be top of the totem pole.
---
Doesn't gatherer exist for vanilla?
---
I mean you can literally just run away from a shadow priest and heal / get cleansed. There you lost the flag buddy now you have to go get it back which you can't because you can't get close to the mage/druid flagcarry.
---
30/21 build being the common elemental spec or enhance? I don‚Äôt have a lot of knowledge on enhance specs mainly raid composition
---
You mean operation landfall? Yea that was gating
---
dOnt yoU guYS hAVe phoNeS??!
---
But what about a 30 21 spec which will allow me to heal and also dps and using windfury totems in a raid?
---
Shouldn't a problem for us. We've both talked about having regular times to play together and will have capable solo alts for when it's not possible.
---
30 enha and 21 resto
---
Without stormstrike since there wont be enough debuff slots
---
Plop twist : will play alliance !
---
Love the map on wall ;)
---
Move her into the room of your PC?
---
From a min/max perspective its Human for raiding and Dwarves for PvP.
---
Personally I dont like the accents or the way dwarf titties flop around with every step, so I've never rolled one despite them being so good.
---
The gear squish doesnt bother me. I'm used to playing on Horde where 3/4 races cant display all of their gear anyway.
---
Yeah adding. May I know why his Twitter is banned?
---
0/22/29 is actually a preferred spec for the improved totems but you're still a healer and you'll get healer gear.
---
With speed on boots and engineering mages are truly a cakewalk.
---
Ele shamna has all the benefits of shadowpriest in the world and can also premade pvp.
---
Human males are so fucking jacked tf
---
You can use addons like Questie. It doesn't tell you what to do but it shows all the available quests in your level range on the world map. So instead of following a step by step guide you can make your own routes and change zone whenever you want while keeping a decent leveling speed.
---
No, it was only ever a bug on some private servers. Rogue Poisons have never scaled with spell power in WoW.
---
You group up with a warrior who sucks alone too, and farm like crazy.
---
Yay lets make everyone able to play fuckjng illidan.
---
Hmm. But will i be able to casually so dungeons and pve as dps?
---
Same mate, felt like the big daddy when I was like "Yup, I'm ready to go Mofo's, been grinding Scholo for two years!".
---
Is it though?
---
Voodoo and curses astetics with Trolls which live in bamboo like huts, shamanistic and spiritual healing with Tauren who live in hide huts, industrial advances with Goblin &amp; Gnomes who got flying rocket ships, helicopters and can their gadgets can change your material size.
---
There's floating cities filled with wizards of Dalaran. Religeous Cults(erhm i mean the Holy Light).  People who follows all actions of a alleged Fortune Teller(Draenei) which are goat squids from space.
---
Is Asian Pandaren so very out of place in a place filled with the previously mentioned?
---
 You had to rep grind to unlock rep grinds to unlock rep grinds. That kicked off the non-alt friendly time. It has probably all been removed by now, I don't play retail so, I have no idea,
---
PvP enh is capable of something once you get gear around r14 + Sulfuras. Then yes, it is viable, otherwise chances are that you will be a free HK.
---
In raiding, enh is probably the worst DPS spec you might think of. I won't go into the details, since it's been discussed hundreds of times. 
---
tl;dr just don't roll enh if you want to experience 40man content and be a valuable member of battleground's groups.
---
 Because the mtx are all ok retail bud.
---
Wow
---
AM feeling sad today, Hope you are not friend, all the best

Hi, /u/AFlyingFridge
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7bnx8/best_class_for_class_quests/). 
---
Then yes that would be the correct spec to be useful in a raid setting.
---
If you can cover these aspects then you won‚Äôt have any issues, ascending in hardest to achieve.
---
- Find a guild that doesn‚Äôt already have 1 enhancement shaman.
---
- Farm enough gold to be able to bring a Nightfall.
---
- Learn how to totem weave to increase melee group dps. 
---
- Farm pre raid bis gear as most of your set is bis for warriors/rogues/hunters
---
I suggest looking on forums for guild requirement early and secure your spot, once classic releases level as quick as possible so they don‚Äôt replace you when they are ready to start raiding. Be a reliable raider with a friendly attitude and don‚Äôt let it frustrate you when BiS items go to others during progression.
---
Absolutely. It's only in raids that Enchancement doesn't work. Every other aspect of the game they're completely fine.
---
Well that goes for every class in the game. What class is going to burst a feral druid without cc'd healers?
---
Hardiness is better. Orcs have a 30% chance to resist stuns, and that's a passive ability that always doing its thing.
---
Personally, I still roll Undead anyway just cause I think they're cooler Rogues and it's not like WotF sucks just because something else that's better exists.
---
Thanks for the response :)
---
NGL, thought the same thing. No faction specific mechanics or loot! It still does my head in that Alliance cant get the Viking Helmet from Uldaman.
---
We had a R13 feral who offtanked for us.  Feral seemed great for farm content and pulling trash fast, that being said, literally all progression fights he wasn't good enough to bring as dps.  He respecced and we ran heavy of rdruids or he sat until we had the boss on farm status.  
---
Anyways there are a lot of odd drops only a druid would want.  No one else in naxx is gonna make use of that +feral attack power weapon, and there was always more druid teir drops then druids in a raid, so it made sense to bring him if only to balance out the loot a bit.
---
This thread reminded me of this
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8UzwM1Zt3M
---
Pom Pyro, WL soul fire have chances to do so. Ofc it is hard to burst vs a healer, but mages can sheep the healer, warlocks fear and CoT.
---
5/10 man dungeons are fine, there aren't that many debuffs flying around.
---
Thanks for the response man. I will keep thinking about it and your answer helped me.
---
Bruh, look at it from the other perspective.
---
You mean I can use my abilities, gear, and progression I've worked countless hours to TERRORIZE the ENEMY?! And that ENEMY is an actual PLAYER? Hell yes! 
---
Man, school/work/whatev really, really SUCKED today. I have no friends/family, no gf/bf, no hobbies/responsibilities, bla bla bla. Let's de-stress and cause some real fun havoc! Instead of shooting up a school/workplace/movie theater, let's do some virtual MURDER instead. Since that's not against the law and will get me locked up for eternity. 
---
Oooh, a level 20 mage in Redridge, and I'm a tier 2 fully geared level 60 rogue? Now... this WILL be FUN. Unlike those STRESSFUL raids with really bad guilds. Man, I wish I could get into the good guilds, only if my social abilities weren't stifled from going to a crappy public school and being raised in the poorest area IRL. Dang. HAHAHA! This level 15 mage can FEEL MY SUFFERING as I gank him endlessly! This is truly EPIC! For once in my life I am IN CONTROL and POWERFUL over SOMEONE ELSE. It sucks being born poor, uneducated, and not having any friends or peer groups to do productive things in life like lift weights at the gym. As a 120 lb adult male who didn't grow to his full potential height due to undernourishment and constant stress of living in a ghetto, the only place I feel powerful is World of Warcraft on my level 60 undead rogue. 
---
What's that? Stood up on a date again? Might as well spend my Friday night ganking NORMIES and CASUALS and CHADS for STEALING MY POTENTIAL GF AWAY. rrrrRRRREEEEEEE!
---
Wanna know what's fun? Fuckin' with people. See that level 20 mage? *Stab* HAHAHA he ate dirt. Let's see how long I can sit here and cause problems in this zone until his friends or random strangers show up. *2 hours later* WOW look at the carpet of BONES holy crap LUL this is poggers easy clap. 
---
Shit, just got /gkicked cause I made an e-girl mad. Since I can't raid anymore I might as well spend all my time in Redridge ganking people. :)
---
Dawg, there's no new content. I'm fully geared, trade skills maxed out, nothing to spend gold on, so I'm gonna sit right here in Redridge and just stab everyone that crosses this bridge. 
---
*Kills level 20 mage* *Dopamine hits* *Laughs IRL.* Haha, just like Grim total Annihilation. :) :) :)
---
Oh well, looks like back to horse rather than my spotted cat :(
---
There's also a whole lot of "racist" names you can't choose. My favorite from the banned list was, "MoonCricket"
---
I dont think you played mop, there was rep grinds, tho they were quite easy, there were alot in the beginning, but they added tokens and so many ways to grind rep, plus most the early rep items was worse than dungeon items, people complanined about the early rep grinds, but it was only the first raid, otherwise it was the same as in the past.
---
On fucking point.
---
I still can't believe how they animated Draenei
---
You don't need a ton of burst, they can still get plenty of damage in a short window without it being the insta-nuke of an ele shaman or mage.
---
Eating SW:P ticks, into a mind blast, followed up by a full charge of Mind Flay kills most classes in the game.
---
It very well if you brought several meme spec dps classes.  
---
Although at that point your raid leadership is so suspect there is likely other issues abound as well so maybe I agree with you.
---
As long as you cant transfer from a pve realm to a pvp realm, sure.
---
You will need to download the client in its entirity for the Mac. The addons folder is cross compatible so if you need to copy that you can.
---
Path Of Exile
---
If you don't plan on raiding, I don't see why you can't play feral druid. You'll even make it into PUGs for the easier raid content after a while if you really want to.
---
Classic makes you invest a lot of time in your char. Play what you really want.
---
none from retail vanilla besides joanas
---
Goblins were always neutral. There was a single faction of goblins allied  with the horde, and since that fell apart for obvious reasons they were all neutral again by warcraft 3. And yes, the story *can* be spun in a bunch of ways, but that doesn't mean it should. You can justify anything if you try hard enough, but considering we saw the alliance try to kill Kael'thas who on earth would blood elves joining them please?
---
So many people quit playing and im just sitting here angry at them wasting the special access they were given :/
---
pls pm account info xd

Yeah sounds really cool man. Good luck with the streaming! However there's 0 content yet. So I would ask you to first have some output be4 I add you on the list. As if we would widen it to the promise of content, the value of the list would severely decline
---
You very rarely exprienced "good" world-pvp. Usually you are getting ganked, 1vs X, you are fighting same char on same place over and over and gets old very fast. At Blackrock Mountain bigger group just doesnt allow the smaller group to get inside easily, and made your raiding last even longer. But once on awhile you feel the rush and use all your cooldowns, and get rewarded.
---
I played only PvP-servers in vanilla, and absolutely loved it back then, had lot of fun with Spriest in Hillsbrad Foothills.
---
But when I played on private server, it just didnt feel the same, maybe it's rosetinted glasses or I have outgrown it, dunno.
---
But that I know, that I will play on PvE for my mental health and time's sake.
---
&gt;How about a lvl 60 bank alt?
---
I could see that happening. A year or three down the line.
---
‚ÄûIn need of testing‚Äú = ‚ÄûI want to play‚Äú
---
Thanks. Got a link to that?
---
Thanks!! This is the most important reply I got, haha
---
IIRC druids are great dungeon tanks. They are also very difficult to get raid groups for. So you will have a very difficult time getting gear at lvl 60.
---
That would be dope.
---
I liked Clitorism
---
What? No, my boy is only 11 months old, haha
---
Dont you get dishonorable kills from specific npcs only?
---
That‚Äôs a tricky thing to define, but form my experience - RP servers gather very different communities than PvE or PvP servers. If you‚Äôre curious, I recommend on starting a level 1 character on Wyrmrest Accord US Horde, or Argent Dawn EU Stormwind, and walk around in Stormwind or Orgrimmar during peak hours. Install the add on TRP3, so yuh can recognise other roleplayers and see their character descriptions.
---
IMHO RP servers have more mature players, people who are passionate about Warcraft lore, old school tabletop games like D&amp;D, etc. 
---
Not everyone role plays, not everyone lives by the rule that out-of-character text shouldn‚Äôt go on /s, but many do. 
---
From Blizzard‚Äôs perspective, the only difference is that they enforce character name policies.
---
https://www.joanasworld.com/azeroth.htm
---
The site is easy to navigate just select your starting zone and your class then once you move out of the starter zones follow the main guide.
---
Right, but they'd still need set up from their team to be in a position to do that damage. Just as a Spriest wpuld.
---
I'm not here to argue that Spriest &gt; Mage/Lock, two of the best classes in the game. But if a Spriest is able to get off all 3 of their damage abilities, it's more devastating than even those abilities (except PoM otro, but that's legitimately broken lol)
---
As far as CC a Spriest can fear multiple targets, as well as MC the healer, possibly bring them out of range, or out of position for a pick, to set up the kill in efc.
---
I wish I was in it lol.
---
I've got the hardback Atlas and the dungeon companion. Had them for years. So glad I kept them. Going to come in handy when Classic is released.
---
Almost every spec has BoEs they could buy though. It's about utility. Only a few classes can get real utility out of a BoP. The others just vendor or shard it. Everyone in the group can get real utility out of a BoE gear or profession recipe. Me being a warrior doesn't mean I'm the only one who can use those Stockade Pauldrons. Everyone can use them. With recipes we all have friends or alts that can use those things.
---
Yes, Soul Link *that* OP. And Master Demonologist on top of that. 
---
I did some experimentation on a T2 level geared Warlock - with the right items they can effectively reach \~15k HP (and SL on top of this), without notably compromising their damage. Improved VW and double Sacrifice is nearly 5000 health alone, and against classes with weak interrupts like Druid or Paladin, you can just summon another one - while you're still in your bubble and DOTs are ticking.
---
But a large part why Warlocks shine 1v1, is their reliance on having the right pet out. Warriors are either incredibly hard with your Felhunter out, or incredibly easy with your Succubus out. In a duel environment, having the correct pet is easy - in more dynamic settings like group PVP, it's more uncertain.
---
Purely from a healer perspective:
---
If you like WSG druid is amazing, if you like wpvp druid is maybe slightly better then priest.  In other pvp and all pve content priest is better.  You really have to love the aesthetic or shapeshifting to do shitty damage to prefer druid.  
---
The only redeeming factor is that druid is pretty consistently the least played class, so they are so rare, and healers being rare in general, that you can kind of default into raids/groups and get loot no one else wants.  
---
This might not be the case come as one of if not the biggest streamer plays rdruid and very well may influence more first time players into going druid.
---
Ive pretty much settled on priest. I love healing, and being able support (strong buffs, res, dispel etc).
---
Now, im a bit worried that gold farming, and general solo content at higher levels, Will be a pain. Is it as bad as I fear?
---
If you wanna go crazy you could dungeon grind all the way to 60 and it can be one of the most efficient ways to level
---
Showering with Cardinal Pell
---
Rogues shine without gear. But they are very cool down dependant. You will be able to take down other people with better gear, but you'll have a down time in between.
---
Unless you play with headset you could improve your sound game.
---
OP has never had fine wine.
---
For a game that relies so heavily on a player base, it's hard to keep playing it when it is almost nonexistent. Even when it was booming it was still far less populated than a typical "low pop" server which made economy stabilization difficult as well. 
---
I would have loved for them to have continued to give out a lot more beta invites, I guess that ship has already sailed though.
---
I'm pumped to twink again, too. I wonder which server(s) are going to be best for that.
---
Yes, and most hotw druids on the other hand will put 5/5 into improved stealth because the same talent also increases your threat in bearform, which is great if you have to farm a dungeon or even offtank boss adds in raids.
---
Hey!
---
Mage is a tricky one, because thay have open faces on all sets.
---
Maybe with cutout
---
I went to buy my partner a new laptop and I was looking at them and asked the nice dude helping us "wait... none of these computers have DVD drives" and he asks me "Do you need a DVD drive?"
---
I then became a little distraught because the world was changing around me and I was growing old at a disturbing rate, and started mumbling "We don't need a DVD drive anymore..."
---
If you read the guide it says to auto attack woth the Nightfall and totem twists.
---
That makes it a 2 button rotation.
---
Imagine being this lame.
---
I‚Äôve been thinking about this myself . Player reputation and guild reputation will uphold like a government in classic . I personally believe at launch joining a large social guild is best to learn other players you can depend on and get to know each other . A very large guild at start and some nice social behavior will land you help on class quests , free enchants , friendly invites to dungeons and over all , a better and yes more efficient leveling experience.
---
That being said once I reach level 60 . I will be waving so long to the large social leveling guild and keeping close contact with the friends I‚Äôve made along the way , all while seeking out a new more focused guild on pvp and raid progression . 
---
Hope this helps (:
---
With 500sp a mindblast crit does about 1.4k. Mind flay does 800 damage and swp ticks do about 285 per tick. Most classes have 4-5k hp in that kind of gear. A druid in bear will have way more. Assuming you get 3 ticks done you only dealt 3.1k damage so far.
---
Heres my pros/cons list of PVE/PVP servers.
---
**PVE:** 
---
Pro:
---
* Level in peace
---
* Choose pvp on your terms
---
* No delay on dungeon or raid runs (from pvp)
---
* The opposing faction is harmless.
---
* Immersion is gone (Two fighting factions that cant fight)
---
* No threat at anytime, game experience can get dull.
---
* You can't do anything to an opposing faction player taking your mining node, herb etc.
---
**PVP:**
---
* Fear for your life (adrenaline is good)
---
* Enemies can now be personal (you might meet the same person later and win a fight=feels great)
---
* You will learn your class limits vs other classes much better.
---
* It unites your guild or group that much better running out to raids or dungeons together (it really is a great experience as a guild running together to onyxia fx. rather than just run there AFKish with no danger)
---
Con:
---
* Levelling will be much harder and longer.
---
* You dont get to choose if you face a single fight 1v1 or a gank squad that has nothing better to do than block your progress for hours end.
---
* You risk a imbalance between factions rolling on a server, horde could be heavily outnumbering alliance and no chance of ever fighting back is pointless.
---
I didn't downvote, but he seems to say something like "in pvp servers there's pvp". Not too weird I guess. I agree it's not too useful to roll on a pvp server if your plan is only to run, hide and power level, but there's so much more.
---
Venezuelan gold farmers are surely cheaper than the old chinese ones, right?
---
Imagine how fucking hardcore tanks would be in this scenario. And the angelic friend you have to heal you at all times. Would be crazy.
---
A heal priest can do all that while actually healing his team. MCing people isnt easy especially in prem PvP.
---
In t3 prot war pvp is a blast. Very difficult for even a full bis fury war to drop ya and 1.3k shield slam crits? Yespls. Dont forget shield slam is a dispell also, can drop mages/priest if you can line it up.
---
pay2win btw imagine imagine
---
Pretty much
---
I don't want to be another rogue, warrior, or mage man. Too much competition for gear, and you're just another min/max class.
---
I want to be viable in classic, but I'm not here to jeopardize my enjoyment of the game so I can get invited to a guild consisting of only warrior, mage, and Lock DPS.
---
Seeing this picture I realize I like the old faces more than what retail has now. There‚Äôs just something so lovable about the lower textures.
---
Do you honestly think that the people that are waiting for classic, when not given beta access would play retail and buy those outrageous overpriced mounts/pets in a game FULL OF MOUNTS AND PETS?
---
How bad is leveling with Tailoring/Enchanting as Warlock?
---
I am not going to be speed leveling, so time is not an issue. And I really want to keep Tailoring up to date with my level, so I will take that for sure.
---
For my second prof, I am between Skinning and Enchanting. I want to pick Ench, but everyone says it‚Äôs really expensive.
---
Does anyone know roughly how much gold I will spend leveling Ench, along with how much gold I will miss out on by not taking skinning?
---
Thanks
---
Since many people reply Warcraft 3 to you, I still have to say, Warcraft 3 is great and the lore it covers is one of the best in WoW's lore, but in the end it does not cover much compared to the entire lore. I played warcraft 2 and 3, and while playing wow I was convinced that I knew everything I needed to for some reason (was young). And therefore the lore appeared pretty simple to me.
---
Then a few years ago, I started getting interested in the lore, and just realized that I understood barely anything in the grand scheme of things, despite having played warcraft 2 and 3. You really need to read books or summaries/wiki that you can find on the internet in order to understand the basic lore, and what are the true stakes of warcraft 3 and wow stories.
---
You think so? Seems like Spriest does more damage and definitely brings more CC to the table.
---
Seems like a melee cleave levelling group would be way more efficient on horde with 4 warriors and a shaman healer, for Windfury. Once they get Sweeping Strikes and Whirlwind, I can see it being pretty damn good.
---
r/woooosh
---
Engineering is good and all for pvp but as a warrior I‚Äôll be going mining blacksmithing to try and get some pieces of gear above the rest quicker , there‚Äôs plenty of time to go back and pick up engineering to enhance my pvp .
---
Keep in mind that the record is based on solo leveling as not a lot of "spd runners" for vanilla content had some kind of "group" setup to make these spd leveling runs.
---
Also there will probably be a lot more competitors for this spd run challenge than what there use to be on pservor or back into vanilla days.
---
Careful not to use the term Viable when referring to anything outside of progression.
---
New (well newish) PoE league, Team fight thing from Riot, and 8.2 probably keeping people away. 
---
Plus there is only so much people can do on the beta caped at 40.
---
You have to start them early. Not like he can walk around or anything; park him in front of the PC.
---
Not really excited by the cookie cutter mage, rogue, warrior meta. I just want to ensure viability, so I can enjoy the game without being excluded from.cwrtain aspects. I have no delusions of being the best, or topping meters by playing a class I don't enjoy
---
Dota 2, World of Tanks.
---
Yeah I tought about this. However i'm thinking about the right order. Alphabetical was my first tought aswell. However imo it would make it more boring to search trough and if you look directly you can just use ctr-f.
---
Are you interested in pve or pvp?
---
Still looks pretty good though, if you can actually get that immediately on hitting lvl 30.
---
Okay, so if you want to play shaman you need to understand their role. They are among a few of the "support" classes.
---
You won't only be healing, you will be putting some of your focus towards totems. Some of them are 30 seconds buffs and you'll be managing them pretty hard.
---
I also feel like a shaman has an easy time getting into raids, it's not uncommon for a raid to bring 8 shamans, one in every group.
---
Priest is your traditional healer. It's by far the best healing class is the game. I've played a holy priest in TBC, and I must say they're pretty boring. And I bet they had more utility in TBC vs classic
---
So you will play alliance?
---
I know the warlocks have quite a few class quests that's for the pets , armors , weapons and other misc items. I believe a trinket also! My guess would be for the most üòâ
---
And it's quite hard to get through - it's really heavy and dense with information, so it's not like a light novel or something. More like a Wikipedia page.
---
Tried TemTem, refunded after an hour, bored me to death.
---
Yes, but they have to stop healing, dispelling, or mana burning to do so. Whereas a Spriest can keep DoTs on several targets while also working to CC the enemy
---
Yeah my little 5.1 stereo is sadly worn down to just a working 2 main front left and right speakers :/ 
---
I really enjoy this headset because of the red wire that accents all the red I have going on :3
---
If you look closely my monitor has a strip of red trim on the bottom of the frame, as well as red interior computer lights .
---
I will play alliance only to enjoy the development of a new rp realm/community later on after launch (:
---
Why is that racist?
---
&gt;and launch it via steam (its in Library software drop bar not games)
---
Does Steam still do the whole "In-game: &lt;software app&gt;" on the friends list, because that shit was fucking annoying!
---
Nice. Just what I'm looking for.
---
you need to specify what BG and on what patch/phase.
---
I ordered this after watching [this interview](https://youtu.be/SqtaWXBAyW0 ). The book is absolutely fantastic!
---
If your heal priest goes around mana burning, you do so something wrong. I already said that dotting multiple targets is not the greatest idea. MC has 20y range and 3 second cast time, you barely ever manage to get it done.
---
In theory for 2-3 out of all classes it can be just a bit slower than following joanas guide and much slower for the rest. Much slower for the rest.
---
But i guess if you already have 5 people that login ans log out at the exact right times and are the right class combo then yeh it can be efficent.
---
PvP for the most part, but I'd like to PvE to gear up. So that obviously means raiding. I'd likely be healing on Shammy (if I have a shot at getting PvP gear) or being the Shadow-Weaving Spriest, ideally.
---
I mean what did you expect? Beta was and is for testing and theres only so much you can do.
---
This is why most streamers now have started rolling alts cuz theyre running out of stuff to do.
---
At this point i feel bad for them cuz theyre sitting there, actually playing the game but being lvl 40 capped and not able to progress any further must be hard.
---
It had to be explained to me, too. They said it's because back in the slavery days they'd come out at night to sing.
---
I've been hard at work doing one for undead rogues but after doing it FIVE TIMES I don't have a solid route as some of the tests were done on "fresh" servers and the other were simulated on overpopulated servers. 
---
Essentially I've boiled it down to maximizing monetary gain while sacrificing leveling speed.
---
I can be 20 levels below the server's top rogues but WAY, WAY more wealthy. I have a route that maxes out every trade skill in the game in raw materials, gets you to 60 in about 10 days /played, enough raw gold from just vendoring greys for an epic mount, but takes me about 80 IRL days. 
---
I have another route that gets a rogue to 60 in 5 /played days but leaves you with no trade skill progression, nothing to show on bank alts, and barely enough to afford level 60 garbage greens off a fresh server AH.
---
For my final trial I'm going to try a strategy of doing quests six levels below your current level to see how fast or slow that will progress a rogue. 
---
So far my favorite route is: 1-10 grind w/ skinning / mining and vendor EVERYTHING buy 2x swords and sword training in Undercity. (Grinding beasts, occasional humanoids for first aid progression, grind spots near copper nodes.) Skip dagger quest or just buy one sword and offhand the dagger. Smelt copper for 65 into mining for tin. Go to Silverpine and grind till 15, quest to 16, grind to 22, go straight to Barrens and solo quests. Lockpick quest, grind to 26 in Tarren Mill,  if ahead of the pack, do BFD for outlaw sabre if you can get summoned AND it's a good, fast group you know and trust. If not, grind to 27, Thousand Needles grind to 28, poison quest, do quests in Thousand Needles + grind to 30, do Shimmering Flats quests + grind if alliance isn't hoarding the areas, otherwise grind in Thousand Needles till 32, buy full set of upgrades for gear, then grind / do the fast quests in Desolace till 40, get mount, then just do every quest you can + dungeons. Use huge early economic boom to buy everything you need. (Krol blade, devilsaur armor, etc.)
---
I left out a lot of deetz of exactly where to grind but it maxes out first aid, mining, skinning (swapped at 60 for enchanting for specific farm.) Around your 30's you're gonna have your server 1st 60's (mages, hunters.) and the no-life rogue who has a group to level with that plays 20 hours a day will be in the high 40's low 50's but you're gonna be WAY, WAY more wealthier than anyone else on the server and won't have to waste an evening power leveling trade skills. 
---
Joana's leveling guide sucks shit for rogues, as rogues need to grind mobs 2-4 levels under them for efficient farm / exp per hour. Missing your 5 point eviscerate six times in a row = you're dead.
---
Hmmm not quite sure what your talking about . The software drop menu is connected to the library on the steam program , just right click library and click software . I think haha
---
Says alot about the quality of this since it's still making rounds. Great work. Someone else commented that WF is not PPM based in classic. Do you know if that's the case?
---
[look](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=F9frydWyhL8) at this Video if you want more details m, and he has a pretty fast alliance guide
---
The very moment stuff goes on farm guilds will be accepting weird specs left and right.
---
1.12
---
Whenever BGs are available, so phase e I believe?
---
And this can be applicable to any BG. Though with several arguments here, I would probably say it's at best supplementary on WSG.
---
Yeah not much to do in Alpha atm.. tops 10-20hr of gameplay usless ur into pvp and shiny (luma) hunting..
---
Mordhau
---
Repost/Shit posts and cosplay are the store mounts of this sub.
---
That‚Äôs black and white thinking. Not every healing paladin has to be deep holy. That‚Äôs all my comment was about.

No need to go in depth here since it‚Äôs not worth the effort.
---
Hakurai. Jame??
---
Link to where blizzard said it required active sub to get beta access? 
---
They clearly stated that classic will come with your subscription but never said any requirements for getting into beta.
---
Fairly certain some of the streamers did not have active subs and were invited anyway. Mizkifs girlfriend had never played WoW before and she was given an invite.
---
Ah okay, I'm fairly sure at one point when you launched software apps in steam, it would show on the friends list as "playing game: &lt;software name&gt;" or "in app: &lt;software name&gt;". But this was a number of years ago, and turned me off of using software through steam.
---
Do you have to launch the wallpaper engine app every time you restart your PC?
---
Hello (: I play warrior
---
As warrior we get our first class quest at level 10. On horde side that means we gotta loot 5 singing scales from thunder lizards .
---
The quest then chains into a hand loot quest that rewards a very nice blue chest piece.
---
Later on at level 30 you begin the class quest for berserker stance which involves going to the island near ratchet and contesting multiple npcs in a brawl of sorts . 
---
Followed immediately by the infamous whirlwind axe quest 
---
(: the class quests for warrior are both fun and very challenging
---
No one really knows because everyone launches at different times, like how many are going to be playing EU at midnight compared to 8am Australian launch, what they plan to do with layering, how many servers ect
---
If you really want "something to react to at all times" you should play a holy paladin in PvP. You have a lot of options to defend your team, your healing spells might be limited, but you'll be stunning the enemy, blessing friends to save them from CC, you can play reactively by giving team mates an immune shield at the most strategic of times, lay on hands, sacrifice, etc.
---
Your PvE kit as a holy paladin is the opposite, you'll just be spamming heal and buffin the raid non stop.
---
Oh TIL. Cheers!
---
I have levels 1-39 stream VODS public on my channel at the moment for a combat sword undead rogue. I have to private the 39-40 segment due to bad manners in the chat.
---
Actually, no I had to get rid of some of the VODS due to bad manners in the chat so I have levels 1-32 as combat swords, 24-30 hunter, 36-39 hunter public. Just google my name if you're interested. I was gonna stream full 1-60 runs but due to the fact I'm homeless I don't feel like streaming when I'm stealthing in a van as talking might alert anyone outside on what I'm doing.
---
I'm not sure what you're asking, you want a build for PVP, except you're gonna raid so you want a PVE build?
---
SM/Ruin is *the* spec for PVE, and functional in PVP too. If you're looking for an all-rounder that's your goto build. Since there's no Incinerate, going deep Destruction for raiding isn't an option, every point beyond Ruin is completely wasted.
---
And Destruction shines in PVP (especially late-game), but that build is pretty weird. Bane is a must-have, Intensity and Pyroclasm not so much, and both Cataclysm and Improved Life Tap are abysmal (Life Tap has no scaling in Vanilla).
---
Here's a slightly adjusted Destruction PVP build: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVZoxZxE0tMxtt](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#IVZoxZxE0tMxtt)
---
To what?
---
I do not have to relaunch every time though that means it will always start up when you boot your computer . It can be reached when you right click your tools near the clock in the bottom right . And sometimes the backgrounds will have music or sound clips attached and you‚Äôll have to right click and mute it via that tool thing mentioned above .
---
What do you mean?
---
The only QoL are UI related (mailbox, character select screen etc).
---
The rest of the game should be unchanged.
---
Ashitaka must have been banned long after classic, as that's the main character from Princess Mononoke, and I had a toon that used that name on a hunter, AND the pets name was the same (to mess up pvp targeting macros.)
---
Jew. 
---
Lol
---
No pandas
---
Priest is the closest thing to paladin.
---
Played enhancement in vanilla an tbc and unless you have a guild which accepts your weird choices you are going to have a hard time. Personally enhancement is great for pvp and I have some fond memories of it. This time I am planning to main a warrior for pve and enhancement shaman for lulz pvp moments.
---
Idk how people can complain about new graphics being better... Just imagine to go back 15 years, wow is about to come out and it has the modern graphic. Would you enjoy the game more or less?
---
The game isn't about graphic, I agree, and there's a powerful nostalgia now, but imagine to be able to play wow on good graphic from the start, would it be bad? There are so many beautiful areas, epic bosses, great castles... good graphic can only help giving them depth.
---
Lol @OP delete this cringe post and gtfo of the internet and go back to your safe space.
---
If you need a better map this one is good:
---

---
I'm still not (and never will) pay for it.
---
what kind of quest did priests have?
---
Just speculating here but I think you‚Äôll be fine as enh, the raiding content isn‚Äôt hard, most guilds won‚Äôt be optimizing for the ultimate perfect min/max group. Their challenge will be just getting 40 players together to even be able to raid, people will be happy if you just show up consistently.
---
I‚Äôd say go for it.
---
If you want to do a single book, I would recommend:
---
Horde: Rise of the Horde (orcs before coming to Azeroth)
---
Alliance: Arthas (deals with WC3 from human perspective)
---
All of this is self evident.
---
Roll PVP you will encounter PVP.
---
If you have qualms about PVP then there are PVE servers.
---
Simple.
---
Shamans have mail and shield, making them somewhat tanky vs melee just like paladins. They are offensive instead of defensive though.
---
Closest to unkillable would be resto druid though. They arent great PvP healers but rather FC though.
---
I hated it because it had that asian meme music
---
Yeah I actually started drawing out every zone starting with the human area . It‚Äôs pretty hard work but the in depth detail will surly be of help later on . Especially since on paper I can write in area names myself and other POIs
---
I will surely have an enha alt it seems. I will think about maining it ans thanks for the response btw :)
---
&gt; Leadership and personal fit being equal is it better to join a very big vs normal sized guild?
---
TL;DR - Long post - In vanilla, large guilds have a lot of advantages for gearing up quickly for MC and Ony.
---
I played on launch day, leveled a rogue to 52, then re-rolled as a mage (thanks to Otherguy's pvp videos) and leveled to 60 before most of the server was in their 40's.
---
The rogue was in a very small guild (maybe 20? or so people), but I aligned myself with one of the largest guilds on the server - by unlocking lock boxes for a lot of their members, or via running instances with them (CC through sap and mage's sheep were actually useful in vanilla).
---
When I switched over to a mage, I applied to the mega guild. Since a LOT of the members knew me on my rogue, getting in was easy and I stayed with the guild a LONG time as we had the member numbers to run instances non-stop to gear up for MC and Ony. I think by late Feb or March 2005 we were slowly breaking into MC. After that guild imploded, a bunch of the core raiders re-formed into a dedicated raid guild, and we were 2nd on Horde side to clear MC and Ony.
---
For me, I liked the social aspects of a large guild but YMMV.
---
I felt the exact same way!
---
I mean, you said it yourself: you don't like non RP servers and you don't want to play on different timezones, so there's only a solution. Move to EU or NA and you're gucci.
---
&gt; Link to where blizzard said it required active sub to get beta access?
---
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule
---
&gt;To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we‚Äôll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. **Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.**
---
Skinning gets you a bit gold on the side, but just skipping it and farming at 60 is just as good.
---
Enchanting on the other hand is really expensive and doesnt get you anything, unless you get MC/AQ enchants, which only 1 person per guild gets usually. Unless you are close to the guild lead, they wont trust you with these enchants.
---
As a lock I'm not sure if I should spec ds/ruin the moment I hit 60, what works better for 5 men/pre raid content?
---
Looking at spriest classic toolkit, I can see where you are coming from.
---
I am completely serious when I say consider making one and testing around.    ultimately it may well be a class doing a role another class/spec would do better, *but if you enjoy it*, why not?
---
In dungeons you just dot everything and die because the tank cant hold aggro of all the mobs.
---
Then you afk until the healer rezzes you and repeat.
---
you can just youtube classic leveling and get 500 videos, lots from actual veterans of classic
---
Ahah, I did the same! My alt rogue was there all day
---
Now is a good time to finish some single player games
---
Shadowpriest is BiS PvP - if youre going priest though. You can easily heal dungeons all the way to 60! :-)
---
This is great!
---
I have the big Atlas and an original guide. I also  have the original lore books floating around.
---
I'm just not willing to invest that much time into a temporary character. For me, the whole appeal of Classic is having a permanent identity. I haven't even hit 40 for this reason.
---
Carrot on a stick it is then!
---
At least until you get ganked by a warlock
---
Hmmm well there is a very early on quest when you have both lesser heal and PW Fortitude ; you have to heal and buff a near by injured guard .
---
These were really nice moments. People stare at you like in an idiot if you mention world of warcraft, but in these events, there were just wow nerds, loved it. It all disappeared with cataclysm launch, because you could just download it.
---
As a former DDR tourney-kid I really wanna get into Beatsaber but my arms are far too built to have any sort of finesse anymore. I'd have to completely stop lifting to even be able to do that.
---
Listen to yourself. Not all of your ideas are bad, but getting rid of the level cap chisels away at the very essence of what wow is. You could make the argument that that‚Äôs good game design but at this point you‚Äôve strayed so far from the original intention that the comparison is irrelevant. You could make a game with no levels but also a persistent world and sure it may be engaging but at that point it‚Äôs a different beast entirely. That concept sounds like GTAO but with dedicated servers, which, like I said, may be a good experience but is antithetical to the concept of classic wow.
---
But what may I inquire? When you where thinking on this day, when you conjured up for a man like me and oooooo I look so gayyyyy *gnome chorus*
---
I've never played any other game that gave me such high adrenaline rushes like wow in the cases where I get attacked from nowhere and I manage to fight back and win. Also playing hide and seek can be quite the fun at times. There are the annoying cases too, but no other game can offer such dramatic fun experiences like random world pvp that happens in wow. If you want to experience the game, really feel the tension between the two factions, PVP server is the way.
---
PvE is like booking on one of those all inclusive trips instead of hitching around to shabby hostels like an idiot.
---
All of these reasons you list are what I call an impetus.  It's the driving force that makes players want to get stronger, pull smarter, play with groups, ect..  Without these elements the game feels so hollow.. there's nothing pushing you to be better except the essence of betterment.
---
Priest, your main set of gear is a dress. Just like a pally :)
---
If you're in communication with your team, you can DoT multiple targets. Not everyone is going to be sheep/blinded, and generally only really the healers and efc.
---
Also, if your healers aren't mana burning, then there's a mother perfect role for a Spriest in a BG
---
it was working in beta last I saw someone check
---
Ok ty for the reply :) I‚Äôll take your suggestions into account~
---
The Beta was always pretty dead, there are just not enough people invited. I always played during EU Times and I had a hard time finding people for Quests or Dungeons.
---
I got to Level37 and stopped. My Mainreason to play the Beta was to do all the Warlock Classquests again and get a rough idea on my Levelroute. I don't want to spoil myself the Release and play multiple chars so I'm not already tired of leveling in August.
---
Yup, this is reasonable. Thanks
---
I am in without a sub
---
It wasn't saved on beta
---
Bro I loved through STV on a pserver with a 8k+ population. It was rough, but also a lot of fun. Blizzard level populations won‚Äôt be even close to as bad. People are just hyping this shit up out of boredom. PVE rollers want to justify their decision and PVP players want to remind everyone that their version of the game is the ideal experience.
---
I think this will fall on deaf ears. However, I think you may be wasting considerable time and resources on making this, since it appears to cost money. 
---
There are about 100 free websites that will be larger due to the mass contribution. 
---
This is not the same wow 15 years ago. Although it is probably just a joke anyways.
---
Why would you put a priest in windfury(melee group)?
---
Please don't downvote. Mac question. 
---
Anyone on Beta or Stress test were able to try the Classic client on a current Macbook Pro? What was the performance like and what graphics settings and FPS were you pushing it on?  I have a 2018 MBP and, while I know it will be fine running classic, I am wondering how much I can push graphics at and at what FPS?
---
where can i get these animated wallpapers?
---
Dude taking a picture of his 4k monitor in fucking 2019

Did PvE leveling in Vanilla, played on PvP servers multiple times in private servers over the last few years. Where as the anecdotes you used in your post did happen or variants of, it is anecdotal evidence. I played Warrior easily one of the worst to level and deal with world PvP solo, as long as you are playing smart, you should be fine. On route 1-60 on a PvP server, high levels corpse camping me outside of STV is rare, if I die in 1v2 - 1v3 its again rare that those people will hang around to kill you more than once. On private servers I just have not seen people outside of STV wasting their time on lowbies, for every hour of your time they waste, thats an hour of their time wasted. I'd personally never play on a PvE server in classic again, its dull, especially at 60.
---
Same. I was a 26 priest and keen to do a BFD run... /who 23-33 brings up one tank total who didn't want to do it. Wish I was alliance for the higher population
---
As you can see from the comments on this thread and others like it, it's just a preference thing. Orc has an edge against rogues, druids and paladins. And as undead - priests, warlocks and warriors. Remember your trinket wont always be up to get out of fears but at the same time a resisted stun will win you the fight 80% of the time (breaking a fear will too). My advice would be to simply go with the one you think has better looks, because you can't go wrong with either.
---
Hey guys, look at me reading a book. I'm going to take a picture of the book and post it online so you know it really happened.
---
Fraps is free. Great for screenshots and you can assign a hotkey that works in game.
---
There are some raid bosses that guaranteed will kill people. No-one's going to be keen for that. Leveling to 60 is another thing.
---
&gt; the fact I'm homeless
---
That took an unexpected turn, I hope it'll be better soon for you!
---
Change to "Execute", I feel ya.
---
When you have a lvl 42 bankalt or a 60 as someone in the comments suggested, you'll have a lot of items you want  to keep and not just delete, which will make it so you have less bag space than a lvl 5, which is the best lvl because of disenchanting, leveling a druid solely for fishing is retarded as your main with a mount can have it
---
Friends&amp;Families invites didnt require a sub
---
I'm your opinion, what would be a Spriest's best role in an RBG Premade?
---
Talking about 4k and taking a picture with your phone. Ah reddit, never change
---
It ages like fine wine, but at the time of creation it was the best damn wine there was.
---
No one else playing Diablo 2 PlugY?
---
Funny, I play during eu times and I'm also 37. Bout ready to call it quits.
---
As a paladin that will primarily heal, what professions would you suggest? I have never played vanilla but am very much looking forward to it, will level at my own pace. For leveling I was thinking skinning and herbing. Stash the herbs and level alchemy later? But now I'm a bit interested in engineering too. Maybe I could take mining blacksmithing while I level to craft some gear along with stuff to level engineering later. In the end I guess it comes down to being self-sufficient with consumables or having a bit of fun with engineering and crafting my own gear.
---
You're pretty spot on about what you need to do. It is a little harder to get exalted but ultimately it's just a whole bunch of cloth turn ins for the final stretch.
---
As for the PvP mounts you could actually use them as any rep at some point in classic but I suspect it might have been the pre TBC patch. Someone else will know better.
---
As undead you can ride anything, it's worth noting though that if you're a Tauren you can't use the undead mount.
---
They definitely have to juggle between the 2 different games. This seems plausible, even if not in an evil genius kind of way.
---
\*raises hand\*  
---
I'm waiting for classic, playing BFA and bought 6 month mount..  
---
My rationale was I was going to play BFA while waiting for classic as it's fun enough to play with my friends that still play.. so I'm going to pay for a sub anyways.. 6 month sub is discounted and I'm definitely going to be playing for the next 6 months with classic coming.. why not get a free shiny mount for people to laugh at me on?
---
What are people talking about with the corpse camping for hours? I've played since 2004, I leveled 3 alliance priests to 60 and a few other classes. I've never been corpse camped so ruthlessly as I keep hearing about. Yeah there was PvP, yeah sometimes I got back to my corpse and killed again, but nothing more than that. Go elsewhere or make a tea or something, they're gone by then. Unless you actually did something shitty to them in the first place, them you deserve it really
---
yeah yeah i mean 'in contravention to blizzard's acceptable usage policy' or whatever you want to call it :P
---
I quit when I was in Alterac and didn't find any people for the Elite-Quests there.
---
Everything you said was correct, except warlocks being a hardcounter to rogues. Even a bad rogue can stunlock a warlock to death, warlocks have no way to break stuns in vanilla.
---
i've never seen or heard of a fov change in wow though and i've been playing for years...?
---
&gt;should of
---
reeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
isn't that just how far you can scroll back?  the guy in the vid looked like he'd widened the field of view (as well as being able to scroll back further)
---
see here: https://youtu.be/j4gsk4MNn0k
---
around 1:20 for example.  he is not that zoomed out, but when he rotates the camera you can tell that the FOV is wider than default
---
yeah i think i got that wrong. i think the ppm based windfury was implemented in tbc or wotlk and i just got some wrong information. some private servers were running on a tbc client and had the ppm mechanic on wf, it seems like its not blizzlike tho. 
---
still, since wf is a big portion of your damage, faster attacks means more proccs, thus making attackspeed still very valueable.
---
It's probably going to take me at least 3 months to level to 60 so at least I have that going for me!
---
i wish i'd known about the camera height thing when i played a tauren last year haha
---
he looks more swole than ever
---
Elder scrolls online. Holy shit best 10$ I ever spent. It‚Äôs so fun as a stand alone mmorpg but if you‚Äôre a fan of the series you have to play. It‚Äôs so fun. Going to be hard to stop for classic üò≠
---
And it's not meant to be played seriously. It's there to be tested hence the level lock.
---
Playing work 8h/day and family for couple of hours in hope that I will be allowed to play classica at the launch date...
---
I'm thinking either tank paladin or demon warlock, I played tank pally in regular WoW but would it be worth switching to Warlock in anyone's opinion
---
You guys are just lying or just smoked too much weed.  You might have been ganked, but not camped.
---
wow has a screenshot hotkey and yet you take a photo with your phone? explain yourself OP
---
Not at all.. if it's separated from original gameplay and everyone is hardcore why would that be? Let the best win! And there's always pve servers.
---
So initially I was going to respond to your post with essentially some gate keeping comment that older gamers like us are more interested in game experience than graphics. Then i remembered that DOOM3 came out in 2004, and a big selling point of that game was the fidelity of the textures and lighting. Essentially, people who are attracted to games just for their graphics have always existed, and there are simply some people that prioritize game play over visuals. These people are the ones who will enjoy classic wow the most, but its not like people who seek graphical fidelity are a new breed. Sorry for the rant, I just thought it was interesting.
---
seriously this is the first result when someone googles 'wow classic beta announcement' and it's directly from the official wow website.  There's no disputing this is what they said.  I'm so tired of people saying provide a link when it's literally the first search result if they spent 10 seconds on a search engine.  
---
Now it appears to be the case that they didn't hold to their word on this as there have been several reports of people getting in without a sub, but honestly the burden of proof is on those people to prove they didn't have a sub when they got it.. not the other way around.  It is established this is what they said so why are we having to prove it?
---
If the warlock is proberly specced &amp; geared He survives your stunlock, but its been 14 years so could bei wrong
---
Not going to lie but, this guide is really bad info for people trying to get into enhance shaman... 
---
Yeah some information is fine but the gear is all bad. You need hit gear, and you need flurry uptime to up so getting 33% critical is crucial. Yeah sure your damage I'm won't be up there like other classes but you need to be up there and trying to do the most damage as you can wh I le being the totem twister. Otherwise you will be doing bottom of the barrel dps and will get kicked        from the group. Your Main damage is white hits so what if you get glancing blows all melee classes get them.
---
Having looked at a few guides, and done some 1-20 testing, i notice that there are class specific differences, for example a guide might tell you to do 12-14 in loch modan without going to the lodge for the timed quests which will get a rogue daryl's shortsword, better than feral blade from the thelsamar vendor and you dont have to pay 24s for it. One guide misses this, and misses that the feral blade exists, another says buy the feral blade then go for daryl's quests as well; a waste of silver.
---
There's other things, like sending you to goldshire to train at level 10 then also to SI:7 for the class quest and train skills again while still level 10
---
I'm wondering if i should even use a guide as more than a general guide, since there's likely to be other discrepancies of this kind at later levels; like if a guide says i need 1300/2500 xp before hearthing, but I've handed in a quest because it was right next to me, im wasting time.
---
Thoughts?
---
I've levelling to 60 on 3 PvP private servers. I definitely won't be choosing a PvP server in Classic.
---
I don't mind wPvP between people of roughly equal levels ( +/- 4ish ) and there's some good fun to be had from those fights. The problem is that these fair fights were the exception, not the norm. Generally, if someone attacks you in wPvP, they're only doing it because they're 100% certain they'll win. Which means either a massive level advantage, or 3+ vs 1. 
---
The latter is fine, because it's easy enough to just get your own group of lvl 24s together to fight back. But I think wPvP would be so much more fun and less frustrating if there was a limit on attacking lower level players.
---
But it really doesn't matter to me, since I'm rolling on a PvE server so I can quest in peace and do BGs when I want to get my PvP fix. It's not as organic as wPvP, but it means I can avoid most of the griefers.
---
rouge\*
---
Not with pre-bis gear though. Maybe when most of the raid has good gear, then yes. It's still going to take you double the time though.
---
Orc looks cooler
---
Looking at raiding and I've always loved WSG. So I'm thinking druid so I can carry the flag and heal in raids. I'm just not sure what type of gear your suppose to use for flag carrying. Would resto raid gear be fine?  
---
As for professions engineering and mining is what I'm after but since WSG wont come out for a while should I just start with herb and alch so I can craft my own potions/flasks.   
---
I also wouldn't mind holy pally cause it looks super easy for raids. They also pair really well with warriors for pvp and I'd feel more useful in the other bg's. That said their a bitch to level and I'm guessing farming gold would be a huge bitch?
---
Rogue
---
Don't need any software for it. In windows you can just press the printscreen button and paste it in paint, or any other image processing program.
---
Just pre-ordered myself a copy, hyped man.
---
in all seriousness, watch world of roguecraft.  the movies function as a hit-piece on rogues, BUT the fights with stunlocks etc. vs other openers is interesting.
---
Well there's defensive stance which is a pvp talent that reduces your damage done and taken until you toggle it off.  There are no difference in abilities you can use during it though.
---
Need a big carry as mobs are l40+
---
You clearly didn't play vanilla.
---
As 31-8-12. If I remember right, open woth cheapshot on most targets, ambush on mages.
---
Cheapshot, backstab, gouge. Kidney shot, backstab, gouge, eviscerate.  If they trinket or are still standing with plenty of health, blind and repeat. Let your stuns run their full course, and practice locking them down to really control a fight.
---
You'd be able to do it easily with the 5 man group he's using. Murdaloc isn't even elite. People were doing SM Cath at lvl 30.
---
if you don't know the reference for "rouge" just google it, since this is about going back to the roots.
---
Probably not wrong tbh.  Imagine if they increased the level cap to 50 in the beta at around the same time as 8.2 launch.  Literally no one would be streaming 8.2
---
This at least worked in TBC (not sure about Vanilla), there was a repeatable quest in Ratchet that gave some Org rep as an alternative to cloth turnins  \^\^
---
https://youtu.be/V9sI38mG46k
---
How? Isn't it still being Kickstarted? Where'd you play it on?
---
This used to be my signature for the official forums back when they had those:
---
A PvP server is not fair. It does not wait until you are ready, it does not let you choose your opponents, and it does not care if you don't feel like PvPing today.
---
I feel like career mages post this to dissuade people from rolling (arguably) the most powerful class. Having a boring rotation for the first 3 raids is a small sacrifice to pay for the personal freedom a mage has versus other classes. 
---
It's not like playing a sword rogue has that much more of an interesting rotation and the QoL of a mage versus a rogue is night and day.
---
I don't follow, why would I not be serious? Retail does not have Warrior stances that I can see, which is going to reduce the complexity of the class unless something else is added to replace it.
---
There. Take my upvote dude :‚Äô)
---
I dont think a huge part of the playerbase plays both retail and classic tbh.  But it is a big overlap in twitch streamers.
---
you mean like rouges and  durids?
---
Uhh dude they're going to get a server. EU will get some servers. Na will get some servers. The issue is fragmenting regions into realmtypes and languages, not whether a region has enough interest in the first place, there is plenty in all as long as you keep people in the same pile. That's what blizzard decision  making so far shows and it's appropriate. You can argue now, but check this comment when realms are announced as if you're right then I'll give you all my gold.
---
Thank you for your constructive comments. Have yourself a good day.
---
Dont think it is a joke, but when can get one for free like Joana's(that I will be using) I can not see a market for a payed one.
---
It‚Äôs not it‚Äôs just sonii
---
Sure, but you are not the majority.
---
Most of us waiting for classic are either not playing, playing something else or playing pservers.
---
Do you have any links on sub 5 days Warriors? That seems excessively fast for that class.
---
Yea some cock missed an escort quest I started on a private server and took it waaaaay too personally, logged on his 60 opposite side char and kept ganking me, so I just went somewhere else and kept him waiting there. If you get camped by an asshole, just go somewhere else, he has nothing better to do.
---
Or you could use VanillaGuide, WoW-Pro Guides, Joanna guide which all 3 have Addons and are free lol
---
Why do you think there's not a single druid on that list? Use your logic please.
---
What's wrong with names like knight or their.. Tony, simba? A lot of these seems weird
---
yes I do.
---
you're welcome!

---
Not really a beta test just hype train, so small scale when comparing to other games. Not surprised if the release is huge mess with bugs and exploits.
---
Hey guys its my turn in 3 hours, just need to find some pics of them online.
---
Wallpaper Engine doesn't show up as playing in the friends list beyond first launching it, and there is an option for it to launch automatically at start up.
---
It does however take a nice chunk of GPU power to run, so be sure to set it to stop when not looking at it, also an option for that in the menus.
---
*should have*
---
Exploits only run rampant on private servers because packet injection is so much easier.
---
It's doesn't add PvE content, because, duh, it isn't PvE. But it is content.
---
Blizz rushed out tbc too soon after naxx. There just wasn't enough time
---
You can't raid without at least two hunters. Sarcasm needs to be somewhat believable!
---
Why play undead if you don't like them?
---
Sap&gt;Garrote&gt; cheap shot&gt; kidney&gt; blind&gt; restealth and repeat. 
---
Sometimes you can cheap shot&gt;garrote
---
I know it is, but this comment is talking about druids.
---
Their cat form is the same size, male or female and they can squeeze through.
---
They are playing females because of the supposed smaller hitboxes mainly.
---
But testing on the beta found that there isnt a noticable difference.
---
Cringefest deluxe of a song, go and play with barbies bro.
---
What content is added by being on a pvp server?  All of the same pvp is available on a pve server as well.  You can so bgs.  People who want to world pvp can go to TM or just turn their pvp flag on.  There is no extra content on a pvp server.  All it is is a forced pvp flag.
---
We had a trend going on the server of naming canines "Cat" and felines "Dog" etc, but this is miles better.
---
doesn't garrote break stealth on beta?
---
Especially in BRD when you jump down a ledge and the pet pulls half the instance.
---
Yeah, you'll clear it. But your raid group won't have nearly all the needed gear from it.
---
No need to be overdramatic.
---
Is this the same for protection warrior?
---
Maybe because he wants do to pvp and undead are the best race for mage in pvp?
---
I mean, there's still 12k+ people playing across all the LH servers, including 5k people playing SH right now which just launched and will literally close in less than 2 months.  
---
So there's plenty of people willing to level chars that are gonna be deleted shortly.  The problem just is that blizzard hasn't enough of these people.  None of them would be on LH if they had beta access.
---
If i click on the link of his YT channel it's refers me to [https://twitter.com/account/suspended](https://twitter.com/account/suspended)
---
Is it a troll?
---
How about just using the Screenshot Hotkey thats been built into wow since forever.
---
Why exactly are pandas bad? They were in the lore since WCIII, and I loved Pnadaria.
---
You remember people getting WOTLK early due to clueless store employees. I remember a friend of mine bought WOTLK from like a gas station or 7/11 and was like one of the first 10 people in Northern on the server lol
---
Key word is "can". It's not that PvP servers have extra content, but the PvE servers have less of it as you don't have to interact with the opposite faction AT ALL if you so desire. It might not even exist if all you are interested in are the raids etc. Where as on the PvP servers you still have to keep them in the back of your mind at all times.
---
Blind and Pyro? That's not the Presence of Mind icon (which I assume you were looking for?)
---
Having limited time to play I don't think you should be rolling an alt. Just keep grinding on one character!
---
stop being an ass
---
bliz has already said there will be classic oceanic server
---
sorry you dont get one in deutschland lol
---
go away
---
The best gear for an enhancer is hybrid gear (t0.5) with loads of MP5 from what I've seen, as you need to totem twist your air totems a lot, providing a permanent windfury and Agility totem uptime. 
---
No Stormstrike of course, and you'll probably wear Nightfall for that proc as well, if you're fine with that, then you might be able to find a guild, sure. You'll be a support class, and you won't deal decent DPS, ever.
---
If you're fine with that and fine with getting declined a bunch of times until you find a guild that'll take you, then I believe you might be able to have some fun, sure. Be ready to be mocked regularly though, it'll be an uphill battle.

Perfect yeti hide or pristine yeti hide

---
You can focus allies and enemies at any time - no primary target needed.
---
I‚Äôm not quite sure where he‚Äôs going with this - I rarely use focus target and I still do very well in current retail.
---
I‚Äôd say focus targeting is pretty simple and offers very little performance boost to a new tunnel-visioning player.
---
My advice; keep your eyes focused - not staring at a spell on your bars.
---
Make sure you are prioritising targets - and that you are playing defensively.
---
75% of all deaths in PvP (arena and BG) are due to over extending.
---
Practice against one class - over and over again - and again, and again. 
---
Until you can win against a moderate player at least 5/10 times.
---
Then take it out into the real, open world and learn how to duel that class in an environment with distractions, aggroing mobs, CC other players to kill your target.
---
You‚Äôll rarely perform a 1v2 as most dps classes - but with enough practice against competent players - you‚Äôll be able to pull it off on your average players.
---
Also - get passed that heart racing moment in PvP - learn to not panic when challenging people - and exposure to those situations is the only way.
---
I think it is a huge overlap. Maybe a lot of people don't play retail actively at the moment but I'm sure that more than half of the people interested in classic played BFA at launch.
---
How do you figure?
---
Shaman quests seem really dumb, just lots of running but for 15 years old me playing the game for the first time  it felt really mystical to find those hidden places that only shamans know and learn their unique spells. I am still amazed how something so simple wow devs managed to turn into an epic experience for me.
---
Oh no OP didn‚Äôt spend $100+ just for a keyboard that types annoyingly loud how dare he call himself a gamer
---
Raid healing always means using pots. So Herb + Alch is always good.
---
I think There are a huge overlap actually. The people playing retail wont spend much time on forums though.
---
I didn‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt need to be tested, I said they didn‚Äôt need to be tested by a beta full of people. You don‚Äôt need hundreds of people to tell you deadmines doesn‚Äôt have water, thanks for providing me a great example.
---
I will alt one enha in my time when im playing alone i guess. Thanks a lot. Ah and also. What proffesion made Nightfall?
---
Running into enemy groups and use Psychic Scream.
---
Theres no cookie cutter meta. Each. Each class has one role they can do well, thats about it. That being said elemental shaman and spriest are both very strong in pvp, but you will have a hard time getting gear for it (for a shaman theres no pvp suited gear until aq)
---
 I can confirm that the names CLINT and FLICKER were allowed.
---
Highly suggest getting an addon which shows the ticks, there are plenty of specialised ones and some frames have them built in (LUA Unit frames for example)
---
That'd be a Blacksmith https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=23653/nightfall
---
Focus: I didn‚Äôt say they didn‚Äôt need to be tested, I said they didn‚Äôt need to be tested by a boatload of people. They are being tested, by F&amp;F and internally. The purpose of a widespread beta is different.
---
You will be able to convert leather from skinning into auctionhouse gear more efficiently than mining ore, and making your own stuff with blacksmithing. 
---
You can always take mining/engineering, have a lot of fun with engineering and sell ore to buy consumables later on. 
---
I'd go skinning/mining initially and bank the ore, drop skinning for engineering once you've got enough ore to level engineering to the point you get fun items. Or keep skinning permanently and sell leather to buy ore for engineering.
---
Is it that hard to craft it?
---
This is what I noticed from the payo's twitch stream. He is always about to log off and go to sleep and then plays 4 hours more :) I want to experience this as well.
---
Could it be seduction + soul fire too? I think that might be the classic icon for seduction
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear why they got backlash, most people think adorable animal at the zoo or Jack Black movies when you say panda.
---
You put that as the headliner of an xpac and that‚Äôs what‚Äôll be thought of first. If you have to try and convince people it‚Äôs not like the first thing that comes to their head by any means, you have a huge marketing issue.
---
Oof, druid seal form quest. That was the first and last time I ever tried to swim around the continent instead of just running thanks to the level 55 orange murlocs off the coast of Azshara.
---
I don't think OP knows what "aging like fine wine" really means. But indeed, it's not the graphics that matter.
---
For sure there are people who seek graphical fidelity, no doubt about that, but I'm also pretty sure that this feelings come from nostalgia. I remember playing Prince of Persia back then and I thought it had amazing graphics. I remember watching the 2nd Matrix movie and be impressed by the special effects, etc.. watch them now, and they suck.
---
The point is: if the graphic style stays the same (for example Borderlands is a game with a very distinct style and it's hard to imagine Borderlands with a hyper-realistic GTA-style graphic) the eye gets used to the new graphic pretty quickly and can enjoy better views later on.
---
I don't know much about DOOM3, but from what I can see it's far from having a graphic like the old DOOM, yet as you said people liked it cause it wasn't changing the style (Dark Souls did a very good job too about this imo).
---
Counter-proof: let's say that you had a crappy PC in 2004 and you could only afford to play Vanilla wow on super low settings, and even then you had only 20 FPS. Good memories right? What a blast that game was. Now back to 2019: you can play the same exact game, but your PC now can keep UP with ultra settings (maybe not too many options at the time, but better water, shadows, textures, lights, etc...) at 60 FPS stable. Do you do that? Or do you still play on low settings cause that how you remeber the game?
---
This! I was gonna go Night elf priest. (Even though everyone is going on and on that dwarf priest is the better choice) Solely for shadowmelding in stranglethorn Vietnam while my daughter is tearing out my computer cables again. Then my stupid friends decided to go horde...üò¢ I guess undead it is..
---
This means two options:
---
* Leveling fast as a warlock and having a 60 ahead of the curve. This way you can grind gold and leveling gear for the the warrior twink.
---
* Being one of the first warriors to hit 60, thus being asked to tank dungeons or raids.
---
omg im watching now! extermely helpfull! thanks !
---
r/SCUMgame
---
r/playrust
---
https://youtu.be/b-zU4a4R3TY
---
Not really going for the end game content or anything, I actually quite enjoy the leveling process. Will most likely roll on PVE server and not do any battlegrounds unless I've nothing to do once I hit 60.
---
I have to say, this way it even looks moodier.
---
So you will run into people saying "specc X is not viable" when they mean that it is not optimal, as viable means if its doable or not and a 40man raid doing 40 man raid content with a enhancement shaman is as you might imagine fully viable but not optimal. 
---
Vhe words Viable and Optimal is a bit of controversy as viable used to mean optimal back in vanilla, that has to do with peoples perception and knowledge of the game, updates to speccs and nerfs to encounters as you needed every bit of advantage you could get to help with the progression raids, therefore making retribution paladins, boomkins, enchancement shaman and elemental shaman not "viable" as it was hard enough doing it with proper classes with proper speccs. That will hardly be the situtation now making it fully possible for a semi hardcore or a casual guild to even be able to fit 1-3 hybrids with absolutely no issue at all (if that is the issue they have bigger problems then bringing hybrids)
---
Cheap shot and garrote are both openers... how can you do one after the other..
---
I cannot get through an 8 minute video to guess at context.
---
any synopsis?
---
Currently zelda botw. Will be getting Mario maker 2 soon though and probably Mario kart for when i want to play something with my wife.
---
Welfare WoW...ü§¢ü§Æ
---
Oh yea you are 100% correct
---
Imagine still paying for WoW guides in the era of WoW-Pro and AAP.
---
Not really, if your guild's progressing Molten Core, getting a Nightfall will be a priority for sure as the debuff's *really* good. Getting the Arcanite Bars is quite time consuming as that's a daily CD by alchemists, and if your guild is nice they'll provide you with the Lava Cores, they're rare drops in MC, otherwise you'll have to buy them off of the Auction house.
---
The rest is just mining stuff - Huge Emeralds might be somewhat pricey and Dark Iron bars need to be molten at the Dark Forge in BRD - So making a Nightfall is a moderately time consuming task but it won't take you months or anything.
---
remember, it is a video with winning fights.  I remain curious about what % of his naked/worn dagger fights he actually lost.
---
that said, it illustrates how one might work on cc, kite, open on warrior with cs/rupture run away to bleed them down, etc.
---
Okay, sap&gt;Cheap shot&gt; vanish&gt; cheap shot&gt; kidney&gt; blind
---
When my guild was getting ready to raid, we would get all the priests together and MC incoming Horde raids into the lava for fun. The mages and rogues would sheep and sap to help keep the priests safe. Good times! Especially for the priests...like me. :P
---
It‚Äôs pretty much ready to release and it‚Äôs beta + release date were chosen to not impact 8.2
---
If you pre-order on Discord you get into the testing until release.  [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cremagames/temtem-massively-multiplayer-creature-collection-a/posts/2543051](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cremagames/temtem-massively-multiplayer-creature-collection-a/posts/2543051)
---
What is that red wire? That wasn't there before....
---
From what I've heard Shaman usually just have a hodgepodge of cloth, mail, and leather  for the majority of classic. Hoping to get in a PvP oriented guild, so that I can have some priority to that year, even if I'm healing.
---
Spriest benefits from not needing crit gear, can focus on spell dmg (and even that isn't a big deal with their lower coefficients), mp5, and int gear.
---
So while neither is easy to gear for PvP through PvE, it's possible.
---
Nope, you‚Äôre right.  It‚Äôs why they lost 7 million subs.
---
take stormstrike, you can use it in non-raids. Whats the point beeing enha if you're not.
---
Thats really nice to hear that people can run raids with meme specs. Thanks for the clarification
---
Where's the patch notes for Classic?
---
That‚Äôs the wire to my headset , it nicely compliments the red horde mouse pad , red interior computer lights and thin red monitor frame trim
---
Oprah is unavailable
---
You reckon?  Wont a point in resto be more usefull?
---
Only reason I caught that is because I‚Äôve been playing lock for so long. Strange that OP chose these two abilities out of all possible combos, but it‚Äôs not wrong
---
Hells yeah...
---
I have a group interested in levelling this way once Classic releases. We currently have 2 warriors and a mage with experience doing this up to 40. Message me if you're interested in joining. (Australia East Coast/Oceanic Servers)
---
Look at the "gold making guides" that get sold for (no lie) $20 and contain nothing but advice copied and pasted from /r/woweconomy
---
Wallpaper engine via steam
---
&gt;you usually dont take points in supression
---
did you just casually forget that fear is an affliction spell?
---
Resistance gear, does it remain the go to for MC or once you start getting gear from higher raids does it become not required? I would assume nature and frost for aq and naxx youd never outgear the need for it, but what about fire resistance?
---
Ty, I'm definitely tempted to. It's between Spriest and the 30/0/21 Ele hybrid.
---
I'm just worried I will commit to Spriest and then basically have no endgame if I can't gear through raids. Then it would just be grind my ass off for PvP gear, which isn't really feasible, or just be done after pre-raid BiS, and eventually get left behind.
---
I do think you played, but that you have forgotten and are now saying that other players are wrong, when it is you that are lost.  It was 2012 when it came out, and you have let things fade into your misty past of fallacy.  There might be a hint of remembrance when you say "there were alot in the beginning", but that just means that you have forgotten what that means.
---
We used to have macros for certain boss fights that would whisper your target when you used an ability on them, eg 'Tainted core thrown to you!' on Vashj, that kind of thing.
---
One time somebody accidentally targeted a hunter pet with one of these macros and then exclaimed on vent, 'hey my whisper actually went through, wtf!
---
Cue of course the whole rest of the raid immediately trying it, OMG you can whisper pets now, does it have any effect, can the hunter see it? Etc etc
---
Of course it turned out that this particular pet just happened to have the same name as a random player on our server who came back from being afk to 100+ whispers from a guild he'd never heard of... he was rather confused.
---
I assume just numbers and this board will rage.
---
Classic PVP 1
---
Classic PVP 2
---
Classic PVP 3
---
You can sort quests by class on classic.wowhead to see all of them.
---
Warriors do quests to get Protection/Berserk stances, and the famous Whirlwind Weapon quest.
---
Shamans "run a lot" - who doesn't - to commune with spirits of earth, fire, etc. to unlock the respective element's totems. You actually can't use the totems unless you do the quest, even if you already learned the skill.
---
Rogues have a few... a level 10 quest about pickpocketing, level 16 about lockpicking, then level 24 about the Thistle Tea recipe which is both pickpocketing and lockpicking.
---
Priests get the early robes quest and then racial quests.
---
How do you plan to find a guild? Back in the day I remember most of the serious guilds had websites with forums and application forms. What are the chances for a person like me that wants to raid occasionally but might be missing for weeks due to personal and family reasons to find a raiding guild?
---
Forgotten what? The one instance of gating or??
---
Guess i could‚Äôve worded myself better. My question is really if 10-20 hr a week (incl raid) is enough time to farm gold/consumes on a warrior
---
Or will i have more fun with a warlock
---
Consider who is stunning, if you want a Rogue for Rogue VS Rogue, maybe.  
---
You‚Äôre already losing to paladins even resisting a HOJ
---
Rogue VS Rogue in classic is decided by who has the stealth detection goggles on.
---
There are some great YouTube lore summaries out there. The wikipedia is also great if you are looking for quick summaries of the events(or books). Other people have also mentioned audio books which is perfect if you are often in the car an hour a day or have a job where you can listen. 
---
If you only have time for one book, read Day of the Dragon. It will give you a solid background on the dragon flight politics going into Classic which are surprisingly relevant and easy to get lost in. World of Warcraft: Archive starts with this book and continues the lore train with three others if you find yourself hooked and hungry.
---
Isn't it like the hardest hitting ability, though? (not including Pyro/Ignite Dots; straight up front damage) So it'd make sense to take that.
---
I don't think you realize how weak DoTs are in organized PVP; especially on the horde side. You're going to go oom dotting one target just to have them all dispelled or cleansed.  A ret pally is probably more useful than a shadow priest in BGs.
---
As a casual and also having this enhancement shaman as an alt since im scared of being rejected, i might be slow with leveling so yea. Thanks a lot, i will have mining and blacksmithing while leveling
---
I keep seeing BiS lists for pally and it‚Äôs a lot of cloth is there a way to find BiS plate specifically
---
Aah, 16 times the detail and all new rendering, lightning and landscape technology with 4 times the size of fallout 4
---
Cross realm bgs are confirmed, sadly
---
Not sure if the graphics aged like fine wine tbh
---
Thank you.  
---
I assumed that at least the '(..) how rude (..) and 'your boy zircus' made it clear enough that I'm not dead serious about getting on that list.   
---
Yes, I sprinkled some self promotion on top tho.  
---
Since putting my name on that list would devalue it, i guess it's about time to apologize for a peasant like me for joking around like that. So if I offended any fans or the good lord asmongold itself, please let me know so I can write an official apologize for each of you. 
---
Please, in the love of God, do not let that list getting devalued with unworthy folks like me. 
---
Still, 'your boy' zircus
---
How costly is it to level Enchanting while levelling? I imagine the lost revenue from vendoring stuff is high.
---
Yup... you are ready
---
Actualy, healers being immortal started from BC (looking at you resto druids). I realy, realy, realy dont like that concept, so nah...
---
Uh yeah you can kill a druid that is trying to run away, I do it all the time on beta.  The only chance they have is to not run and focus on healing after the silence.
---
No cats?
---
seduce and soulfire icons :)
---
Basically once an SPriest is defending they will send two players or a mage to CC you when they take the flag.
---
For pvp druid you want int &amp; stamina. I believe the early pvp tier set gives you a bonus to movement which kinda makes it mandatory
---
They did not.
---
Joana's guide won't be free on launch I believe.
---
3 cats actually :3  
---
Unfortunately they did not make an appearance
---
is your phone in 4K or am i misunderstanding something here..
---
Mages shouldnt really get feared in wpvp/duel. In group pvp wotf is not that impressive. If someone dislikes undead race and mounts idk why play one (mage).
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
Tauren can only ride Dire Wolves and kodos.
---
Only Dwarves and Gnomes can ride Mech-striders.
---
And to use the Winterspring Frostsaber you must have both Darnassus and Winterspring Trainers exalted, unless you're a Night-Elf, as it requires Tiger riding training.
---
Boss dropped mounts require no training and be used by anyone of the appropriate level.
---
the PVP mounts use the same rules as normal purchased mounts, they're just MUCH cheaper.
---
You need appropriate training to use them and you can only buy the training with exalted, except for your race.
---
(training is per mount race, not a blanket Riding Skill as it was post revamp).
---
SPriest doesn‚Äôt get destroyed 1v1, they win 1v1
---
You sound like a salty pserver player
---
I still don‚Äôt get it
---
Hunter dies 1v1 even with wyvern sting
---
Reserved by gms and devs?
---
Only ever played through with 2h.  Don't have much time these days.  I'd probably try to find more professional reviewers.
---
If you're looking for survivability, it's probably druid. However, druids can't just facetank stuff while healing.
---
And by the way, disc and holy priest play exactly the same. The only difference is that disc has a bit stronger smite and power infusion, while holy has stronger heals.
---
you could take one to 29 or 39 and see how it works at that level.  if 60 pvp is your goal, that is a pretty hard investment risk without knowing how it will end up.
---
I suspect a skilled spriest could be effective in bg's, though possibly in ways you would only find through experimentation.
---
Celinedion
---
I did, but I rebought them.  The main one, that we all need, is at  chrome-extension://oemmndcbldboiebfnladdacbdfmadadm/https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template\_resource/LO0VQ46XB1281555957773363.pdf
---
hey at least its a video and not just a static picture
---
Reserved against being used for characters.
---
They pretty much all do with the possible exception of warrior tank. This sub went full circle jerk in record time though. They are simplified compared to Mop, not classic.
---
I think you‚Äôre right, I think it‚Äôs the second hardest-hitting ability (straight ability text, no other factors considered) after pyro
---
World PvP: you expected fun fights against people lvling in your zone, which are grossly the same lvl as you? Nope, you will get one shoted by random lvl ?? players who apparently have nothing else to do of their time than camp loew lvl questing zones.
---
I will look into the slight scroll down when you load the tooltip.
---
The BiS search shows you every item that fits your search and then sorts them based on what is best in slot. So the very top item is BiS, but if you want the second best item and so on, it is there too.
---
I will see if I can set all bop gnomish / goblin engineering items to 30+.
---
Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, "Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up." Man bursts into tears. Says, "But doctor...I am Pagliacci
---
Iirc, rogues only get one class quest (ignoring the sunken temple one), but it is a quite nice one:
---
* Poison quest is rather unique. You need to "learn" an emote (/salute) and use it on an NPC close to the quest objective to be able to talk to him. You have to use pick pocket on one enemy to get a key, kill an elite and open a locked box (on p-servers you have to pick the lock, but I think the stolen key is supposed to open it). Opening the box poisons you, which you have to get cured by visiting a certain NPC. As a reward you get the recipe for thistle tea and the poison skill.
---
* I vaguely remember there being a quest that leads you to the rogue-specific faction of Ravenholdt, but that could be part of the sunken temple questline, I don't quite remember.
---
All in all the rogue class fantasy is really great, so I feel like you don't need that many quests to feel unique as a class. You've got pick pocketing, lock picking, poisons and a unique cooking recipe (thistle tea).
---
Probably because it feels like someone is talking down to you, like we're so damned stupid we don't understand that PvP happens on a PvP server.
---
Obviously not. Do you know what‚Äôs required to get the rep to make it? Do you know the mats? I do. Stoo being a debbie downer. It will make me money when I get it though right? Yeah. I thought so.
---
Achivements is a grey area. I, personaly, think it is another installation of "collecting game" WoW is today, and I dont like that collections is the only kind of permanent progression left in WoW
---
SH does not need an invite and is free
---
Warriors can beat rogues in mc easy.
---
Ds is the highest pve dps spec. Warlock is a unique class when it comes to pve because sm ruin is one of its best dps specs is also great for pvp. If you get improved imp for the extra health it's great too.
---
I found ds to be a pretty boring spec and with 16 debuff slots you will be able to take advantage of nightfall too.
---
Like everyone else here is saying:
---
You have no clue what you're talking about.
---
Good times. Asked for Vanilla for Christmas 2006, was 13. Got it, but Dad didn‚Äôt know there was a sub. He spent an hour waiting and talking to Blizz on the phone to confirm it was $15 a month and made a big deal about it. Still ended up subbing for me, albeit reluctantly. Grades started to decline due to WoW, and then BC came out about a month later, went to Best Buy April 2007 with Mom, and she made a big deal about it when I grabbed it and begged for her to buy it for me. I will always remember opening the box to install BC at home. Later on, WOTLK came out, I was in high school now, and both my parents hated the game so much by then and my mom had the computer guy come over and block the ports on the router. Had a friend go buy it for me the day it was out and gave him cash I saved up over time. They all got to wait at midnight while I never had the chance to have that experience. Jealous. But I got smart and downloaded proxies to play and eventually got access to the router. I‚Äôm so happy I‚Äôm old enough now to actually enjoy it without any consequences or problems. Even my fianc√© likes the game and we‚Äôre very excited. Just wish my parents let me have those awesome experiences like waiting at midnight for something or playing it without giving me problems. Nostalgia.
---
Definitely makes sense. But isn't that a bit of a win for your team if they're having to devote greater resources to you got ale your flag?
---
I guess I'm just trying to find a way to fit a Spriest into Premades. I'm not even sure I'll play it, it's just in a very interesting position to me, as  one of the strongest 1v1 classes, and universally agreed as strong in PvP. Yet has no real role in BGs. Seems like there's some underdeveloped potential there, but I guess if 15 years hasn't found it, maybe it's not meant to be.
---
Min-lifer and max-gamer? ^^
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ee6qnw98khA here is a video about it
---
but the raid in 8.2 comes out in 2 weeks
---
Fuck putting enhancement in the melee group. I am putting them in the tank group with our feral. This way we can go DW/Defiance sooner and crush threat problems so our dps doesn't have to throttle as much during content.
---
To get stormstrike you give up Natures Swiftness and that‚Äôs a very useful ability when you‚Äôre healing.
---
SM/Ruin is a more versatile spec. You get to keep your pet and its utility without compromising your damage, and you get things like instant Corruption, Improved Life Tap, Siphon Life, Nightfall and Curse of Exhaustion, which can all be useful in dungeons and farming.
---
Basically what will happen to classic in a year.
---
Main warrior, level warlock when you're locked out of raids or not farming for raid consumables. With lots of rested exp leveling the warlock should be lot faster than it was for your main. 
---
You can give it lesser/greater magic wand starting out, big bags, buff foods etc to make it a great leveling experience. Engineering lets your warlock run fast with rocket boots while you dot up everything, mind control, additional combat pets, a teleport etc.
---
By the time you've leveled and geared your main, there should be less competition for mining nodes at lower levels. mining/engineering would make for a fun warlock, dropping mining at max for tailoring BIS chest if you want, after mining enough to afford the cloth to max out tailoring.
---
Outstanding, I only have two!
---
Hunter and priset get drops from MC (if I remember correctly) that are seriously epic. I never did the hunter one but it involves soloing very hard demons. The priests quest was the most rewarding feeling ive ever felt in the game though, you basically defend the back entrance of stratholm with a bunch of ghost. You have to cure decease, dispel, heal and kill a ton of mobs all at the same time. The damage is constant and you really need to come prepaired with all the consumables but most importantly combustion potions.
---
I think warriors get that compendium of dragonslaying aswell but i have no clue what it involves.
---
&gt;people claiming there were not enough invites going out
---
&gt;me and 3 other ppl i know not playing classic beta cause we dont gaf about classic
---
&gt;people not considering a lot of people that could play just... dont play cause they dont gaf about classic
---
&gt;people are eventually going to realize classic entertains ppl like asmongold that played classic for like 30 days, if at all, and tell made up veteranstories
---
jesus man, calm the fuck down
---
Why wouldn't there be a lot of overlap? A very large chunk of current players played in vanilla
---
What is the alternative? You're content for the gankers, deny them content.

---
My friends were always begging me to try this game and when I finally did I thought it was the stupidest shit ever.
---
just watch "world of crycraft" then you'll be sorted
---
I plan on using a combo of both. The problem with a leveling guide is the constant flipping back and forth to read the guide, somewhat taking you out of the immersion. Questie has been receiving a shit load of updates, and ought to be pretty well-tuned when launch happens.
---
I'm not Pro-PvP, I don't see the value in rolling on a PvP server at all. However my playgroup wants to roll on a PvP server.
---
Yeah, it doesn't take any time at all for 40 people to get all their loot.
---
If you give me your mom's number I can put her on the list to. Would also be a Classic experiance.. How long ago was it? Tell me son, what year where you born?
---
Most of the people *here* are doing that, due, but that's not most of the people waiting for classic.
---
Lynched? Get off the internet. We don‚Äôt want you.
---
My Rank 14 farm group brought a shadow priest and still won all of our games
---
I wouldn‚Äôt look to much into what unwashed pserver players have been doing for ‚Äú15 years‚Äù
---
Holy/Disc priests don‚Äôt have the mana or GCD‚Äôs to apply offensive dispells in team fights.  SPriest does.
---
Just talk to your raid and get the full t2 set. This set is full damage and healing set so you will have a lot of Spell power and healing so you will be able to do all kinds of damage. Then Rock the ZHC from ZG and then rock your pvp trinket this will give you plenty of stats and make you quite tanky with the ability to off heal. This is what one of our shamans is going to do for his ele set. As well as collecting other ele specific pieces.
---
Oh that is definitely true but those that aim for good aesthetic quality tend to sacrifice top tier graphical quality (unless you are grand theft auto), one of the traditional ways this is more commonly done is cell-shading.  
---
I think most people know what I am referring to when I mention AAA graphical quality behemoths.
---
Thats the authentic world pvp experience. You also encounter a nice same lvl fight once in a while. But those can be rare indeed. And its mostly "lol this guy is fighting a same lvl mob at mid life, time to kill him and waste his time." Ill roll pve.
---
This absolutely not true, lol.
---
Warrior (DPS endgame, tanking dungeons) or Priest (holy)...
---
Have done both DPS and healing in past expansion but can't really make up my mind right now. Going horde if that makes a difference.
---
Epic quest for Benediction.
---
There's no fun either.
---
Really whats the matter? Scandinavians plays on the normal realms with the british. Also they speak english.
---
This is my biggest concern with the private server crowd. They all seem to have some form of ADHD when it comes to servers. "FRESH!!!11" mentality isn't good for the health of an MMO, and that's not the type of experience they're designed for.
---
MOBAs, on the other hand, incorporate most of the MMO elements into an experience that's designed to be restarted constantly.

Why are you on this sub if you "dont gaf" about classic? Do you always go to events irl that you have absolutely zero interest in and engage with others there to tell them how wrong they are for enjoying said event? Just curious.
---
Been playing on vanilla servers for a while. As horde, you have to run like hell between your SM wings, because lvl 60 camp the hall 24/7 waiting for lower lvl player to cross and get CCed into death. We also have constant, all day long lvl 60 camping the hillsbrad fields to keep people from lvling.   
---
If thats quality world pvp content...
---
Everyone of those groups speak english.
---
The beta does not reflect gameplay at level 60
---
Racing home from Best Buy for launch and taking the boat to howling fjord and having that music kick in...damn that was awesome
---
Oh wow! That's right! I've got four of those too but different versions - I need to go dig them out!!
---
We just used it on the tanks.  It was more important to stop another rag submerge with more dps.
---
[Here is a screenshot](https://imgur.com/hm7i0cS) from the beta i took just now. 1440p, max settings. Classic wow looks/runs incredibly.
---
those kids are losers in my eyes but more power to them if that‚Äôs what they like
---
Can also confirm
---
Beta dead because it did it's trick... It's summertime and classic wow is released in 2 months. Go enjoy the weather.
---
You sound like a piece of shit
---
Warlock basically only has one bad matchup
---
again, this never stopped foreign language speakers on any realms in vanilla, there would always several languages in chat.
---
I mean what do you expect if most of the people dont have access? Played since cata until legion havent got key because not having active sub lol.
---
Feelsbadman not inviting those whos account were created  before 2010 so they could test it especially the veterans who left at the relase of bc or end of bc. Limiting the beta testers to active sub was a bad idea
---
this guy *literally* 2 weeks ago-
---
 I'm really looking forward to return to the REAL WoW game
---
I played private server and I think I could put all my settings on high with most stuff enabled on my macbook pro retina 2014! No fps lag except when 100+ people were on my screen (Orgrimmar mostly) otherwise smooth as butter.
---
While leveling it wont matter much.  The faster the better for poison procs.
---
I‚Äôd been playing on private server on a guild that was clearing all content weekly (KT every week) and they would take one feral dps and one feral tank.
---
Honestly the problem with those specs is not the spec itself but that the gear is limited. 
---
BiS for those specs is often random blues from BRD and shit and you just are like???
---
Boomkins could be amazing, but you basically just wear bloodline gear and it‚Äôs fucking weird.
---
I don't like it to. Since classic there are German/France/English server in the EU. But in 2019 it is not even possibly. Why? What is the reason. Give me one.
---
Not everyone in the EU speaks and writes English. There are a lot of people who are older than 40 and they can't.
---
FC spec isnt even feral. You only want 11 points inf eral. Rest is mostly resto which adds an insane amount of survivability. Instant healing touch rank 10 is like a instant full heal
---
lynched is a strong fucking word bud, you need to settle down. Scandinavians are some of the best friends i made from the private servers, even as an American i wouldn't have it any other way then meeting those wonderful dudes.
---
Trolls make fine mages.
---
Just because it's not in the beta doesnt mean it's not finished.
---
He could be the majority, we don't have any data for or against. 
---
Personally,  I'd be very surprised if a month into classic the majority of players didn't also have at least one 120 BFA character. 
---
My experience with BFA was 120s hanging out in trade chat wishing there was something to do. There are a lot of people looking forward to classic not on the sub.
---
Honestly, I love how Vanilla WoW looks. Sure there are some jank-ass models, but the art design is so good that it's easy to look past. It looks so crisp in HD.
---
Brags about a 4K setup, take a picture of his computer screen with his phone.

Op, how much did mom spend on your PC?

Good question, didn't check it there.
---
Playing mage, really don't like trolls, so undead is my only choice lol, wish I could play orc mage :(
---
I haven't played retail in a long time I'm just so baffled that they removed it, it was the core identity of the class. I knew homogenization was bad but wasn't expecting this.
---
I can actually smell the smoke from that burn.
---
I didn't notice the Hand of Justice also had 20ap like the Rune of the guard captain.  It was an oversight.
---
Have you explored the XP equations when party members are off level? I‚Äôve always felt blizzard did some really weird things once you drifted more than 1-2 levels but I never had an opportunity to test it. I‚Äôd love to see those numbers. 
---
And please keep posting content. Even if it sits at 70% we‚Äôll see it if we scroll :) You‚Äôre right that this community doesn‚Äôt like content creators for whatever reason. Josh at countdown to classic got downvoted into oblivion for months and even now still has bad ratios. I can‚Äôt imagine a more genuine, nice guy who‚Äôs just trying to make people happy and talk about classic. Anyway, really loved this vid. Keep em comin. The more numbers/data the better.
---
When you‚Äôre doing your 100th Molten Core run, believe me - it matters. I raided throughout Vanilla content and I can‚Äôt remember a single one of the tryhards in my Guild. What I do remember is the Swedish guy who pulled out a guitar and started playing while we were waiting for Nefarian‚Äôs 15 min spawn timer to complete. I get that raiding time is game-face time but come on. Vanilla raiding is not difficult until Twin Emps.
---
It was stated offically in a blue post or in their webpage
---
Getting beta werbased on active sub and when the account was created.
---
Streamers and family gets always invited to make the hype better that how it works even if they havent palyed the game yet.
---
Similar happend with tft beta where streamers who havent played lol got invite to test but veterans who has account since lol beta doesnt
---
I work outside for a living...
---
Do we know how leashing works in beta? I heard world bosses are going to leash but what about mobs? Can we kite all over the continent if we don't kill the mob like real Vanilla?
---
Your skills of print screening hasn‚Äôt aged well though.
---
4 People would be rough initially, until you get decked out from Armory - after that a lot of good blue plate and mail gear starts flowing in so managing four players is doable. I would say you try to have 5 for the first 30~ hours, then you could maybe squeeze by as 4, but 5 is ideal
---
What? I think kids are the little hobbit looking things I see when I venture out but what's a spouse?

needs to be lynched lmffao
---
Why lump Scandinavia in with those? You know they don't speak the same language, right? And the vast majority of them speak English.
---
Oh, lol, I misinterpreted, I thought you were saying stances were not important, haha.
---
They removed them, and, as far as I can see, quite a while ago...
---
You should have seen BM hunter in Legion, it was like 3 buttons.
---
At 60 SPriest is more powerful and my point is more true
---
Use realm names from Vanilla that aren't in use today.
---
Our vanilla guild was more pvp focused with raiding secondary. We created a culture and expectations that if a guildie is being harassed with nothing they can do to stop it, you drop what you're doing and go show up in numbers. The servers are small enough the guild tag starts making people think twice about messing with you, because they know twice as many will show up within minutes. Reputation was a thing back then. 
---
On the flip side it also attracts like minded guilds on the other side to show up in numbers. Which turns into some massive wpvp battles. Which we loved. Win win.
---
Moral of the story, find the right guild for you.
---
Dispel. Offensive on alliance side, especially.
---
If you can get  ~~a healslut~~ somebody to constantly play and level with you then go for a Warrior, if not then ~~be the healslut yourself~~  go for priest since you'll never have problems having to do dungeons or getting a group, and pretty decent leveling speed compared to Warrior which is a chore to level. Going Horde I can recommend undead, best animations and they look good even in cloth, but it's up to you, they have my favorite starting zone too and decent racial benefits.
---
Dude acts like there is one zone to level in, and it‚Äôs a pvp zone.
---
The majority of Beta players will surely be the ones invested in retail that have other WoW stuff to be doing with 8.2. There is still all the classic nerds that have characters on private servers that have no active sub to WoW that are just biding their time.
---
No I did this in Vanilla, my main was a human mage, but I made a level 49 twink shaman. 
---
The way you transfered gold was, you put up a really expensive item and bought it with a character on the alliance. Although that was 13 years ago, it might have been that I just used another acc to buy that item.
---
That being said, I don't remember that ever being a restriction.
---
Whatever. Keep living in your bubble
---
i dunno man, i just think ppl forget we're playing a game here, some ppl just want to play the game, not being forced not to, you feel me?
---
Paladins can really only tank 5 mans in vanilla. For raiding they are all pretty much holy.
---
The WoW Diary by Jon Staats
---
I could not possibly recommend it more (to someone who hangs out here :)
---
Right? Like this has to be a joke.
---
That's exactly what happened. Now I have to see a therapist.
---
Was digging around using wayback machine and realized that my old guilds first Nef kill wasn't until May 2006 or something like that. A lot later then I remembered and we were far from the worst guild around.
---
The lag alone before the entirety of Daggerspine EU transfered to Kazzak made add fights a fucking nightmare.
---
On private servers and classic every guild that raids will have Nef down within the first/second reset. Especially if they don't get rid of world buff stacking.. Hell even flasks were rare as fuck back in the day because of black lotus being soul bound.
---
The debuff limit is 16 so you should be able to use corruption in raids for nightfall.  In the dungeons you can use what you like, the real problem is how much mana it takes and how fast the mob dies.
---
No I won't actually lol
---
Damn, thanks for the advice dude it's a shame it's my favourite class and role, what classes are tanks in vanilla?
---
Its 2019 and Vanilla had a screenshot button in 2004.  (Plus even if it didnt the was, and is, the prnt scrn button.
---
Absolutely not, unless you buy the title from a hardcore guild.
---
What does this even remotely have to do with the discussion
---
wow-pro.com
---
I mean, it was kinda understandable that people did not knew how to take a screenshot in 2004. At least more so that today when everyone and their mothers has a smartphone/pc/tablet/whatever
---
Don't willingly spread miss information

There‚Äôs a map in game btw.

Spirit res and switch zone. Man y‚Äôall attach too much emotion and thought into being ganked. It‚Äôs as easy as:
---
‚ÄúWelp, got ganked. Guess I‚Äôll sprint res and pick one of the other 10 zones to exp in!‚Äù
---
Isn't there DBM?
---
Too.
---
Not a totally crazy theory, but unlikely.
---
We are ~60 (!!!) days out from release, and the devs have a crap load of bugs on the board to fix. Betas are for fixing bugs and tuning (in this case alsmot entirely the former). If they don‚Äôt need to surface more bugs, they don‚Äôt need more players. 
---
The simplest explanations are usually correct with stuff like this.
---
cant draw on it though D:
---
I'd argue that engineering is even more important for tanks than dps. Bombs are just incredible given the AoE dmg/stun once per minute. 
---
There are other perks too, but bombs are hard to compete with.
---
I walked about 5 miles for TBC release. Parents didn't want to take me so I started walking about a few hours beforehand and just dicked around in town until midnight.. Then walked home. Of course back in those days the server would crash for several hours after midnight so I wasn't very far behind.
---
You casually forget that you dont fear in raids?
---
aint nobody got time for that.
---
Language..
---
People like the OP are why gamers from actual PvP MMOs laughed at and called WoW players carebears. 
---
People get ganked once and throw a fit and get all worked up.  Damn, just roll on PvE.
---
No, I just casually missed where you said PvE.. carry on.
---
Sorry, I meant blacksmithing.
---
Engineering is guaranteed for me as protect
---
Vipersting. GL sheeping the fc druid.
---
From just looking at the database it seems like engi gadgets deal damage! Do they just not deal enough damage to be significant pre-60? 
---
I mean I'm bad at the same so I figure any help will be important
---
Thanks. Just checked, it's not available in the EU stores, so I guess it's a pass. I can't read books anyway.
---
Fire resi just for the tanks, I would as a meele just drink resistance potions in Bwl, if the healers aren't geared yet. 
---
Aq you are correct, certain bosses, you never outgear. Also don't forget shadow resistance for the warlock tank.
---
Not sure about frost, never went to saphirron.
---
There was no scarab lord title in vanilla.
---
Lol no
---
Not even close.
---
With what? Lol. No hardcore guild is going to let some casual from another guild ring the gong.
---
Ahhh, there it is. This whole post is a thinly veiled ‚ÄúI have a LIFE and a JOB and it‚Äôs not fair that people play more than me!‚Äù
---
It's almost been a decade since they removed the slow text option, so it would be understandable to forget it.
---
It really still does look great
---
Can confirm I am doing this, bags full as hell. On the plus side I‚Äôm rich because of it. So... worth it. I‚Äôve found the leather near worthless after I was able to make better money elsewhere.

Here‚Äôs what I did...
---
Sold ore and mining stuff on ah, vendored leather. This gave me a financial boost to be able to level first aid/ cooking and fishing

Then I started them to use money. Now I‚Äôm called a twink whenever I join a group because I‚Äôm all blues.

LMAO, no my friend.

Thanks! Yeah I won't be constantly leveling with somebody else, even though i'm already in a guild etc.
---
UD definitely if I go priest, Orc if warrior.
---
What about maxlvl gameplay, raiding etc?
---
Anybody know how ultrawide support is? a quick google search didnt give me much
---
That's nice. I'm on the friends and family list and in without a sub, as are many others
---
Curious, do you know ahead of time who your guild will be? Finding a raid willing to follow a profession plan sounds intense, and probably only relevant for world first races.
---
The transfering cost will always be worth it in comparison to starting fresh on another server again.
---
ive been sort of research abit today. from what i can see you want toi do:
---
VC(farm)&gt;quest hub or 2&gt;BDF(farm) &gt; The stockade(once for quests, no gear here) &gt; Smash duskwood &gt; ding 30 &gt; RFK(farm corpse makers) &gt; Gnomer &gt; prob smash some STV &gt; to SM, questing on the way there.  Path is pretty liniar after that, uldman, Zulfrrak, maraudon, sunken temple, BFD. not sure what questing to do inbetween them gotta do more research.
---
I'd be playing the shit out of beta, practicing levelling strats. maximizing speed, all that shit. if I had access, i don't have access and i'm not going to gamble paying a subscription until its august and i can simply secure my name
---
oh wow, yeah i got that one wrong lol. It was so long ago since i played it i thought they were introduced then! Sorry about that. I just kind of synonymize arenas with DKs. I do mean TBC however, even though flying was a bit of a bad move IMO.
---
Early on you'll have a disadvantage as a Priest if you want to farm gold via professions, crowded zones, racing for nodes against Druids/Shamans/Hunters. Early on the market will be low traffic since nobody has enough gold to consistently buy anything they want, also the popular gold farming methods start at higher levels or after DM releases in a later phase. This is why you should pick Skinning and not worry about any other primary profession, this way you can focus on grinding and secondary professions, just vendor the skins, don't worry about putting them on the AH since everybody and their mother will roll Skinning. Secondary professions as a Priest, now this is where it's at: Fishing and Cooking (do whatever yo want from the cloth drops form humanoids, I'll be leveling First Aid). FIshing can found your epic mount even, so focus on it. Oily Blackmouth is decent income early levels, later on stonescale eels or squids.  You can farm water essence in Azshara  via fishing (hello $$$). **You can farm mobs as a Holy.** When DME releases say hello to lasher farming as holy ($$$).  Until then focus on fishing, essence farming, righteous orb farming. You'll fine I guarantee it!
---
If you don't like the wait times couldn't you, yourself, join a different server instead of being a "I was here first" little crybaby?
---
Haha :)
---
No raiding casuals will not have the scarab lord title.
---
Hardcore raiders wont have it either ofc since it was added in TBC.
---
The free membership gives you the questing addon which is all most people will want. The paid membership is more in depth than just leveling.
---
If you don't care about leveling fast you should go do the early quests for the faction the mount you want.
---
It is indeed. Plus as prot with engineering you get the force reflective disk, which is good for aoe tanking (and maybe pvp?)
---
However, if you are your guild's MT or one of the officers it might make more sense to take blacksmithing. Guilds usually give the good crafting recipe drops to an officer or a MT, someone they know won't be leaving for awhile. Of course, different guilds have different styles.
---
It is indeed true, I wish they would have just called LFR story mode
---
same, just download it..
---
You may be playing in 4K, but you took the picture with a phone which produced something akin to 480p.
---
You may be playing in 4K, but that detail level is medium at best but looks more like the very lowest settings.
---
By contrast, when I played (stress test) in 4K on max details running around Mulgore was just... magical.   
---
As a bonus, it was really fucking cool how the cats were hidden by the tall grass. Super fucking authentic (and deadly!)
---
The post title is spot on, WoW graphics really have aged like fine wine in that the *atmosphere it creates* is still top notch. This picture does a piss poor job of showing it though.
---
Big yikes. Posts like this is why they mtx and shitty business practices continues. People will buy it blindly.
---
Thanks :)
---
I think that you need an optimized team grinding dungeons with you too make this fast.
---
Otherwise, you're going to have to wait for groups, wait for travel, wait for wipes, and just move slower in general. It probably won't be worth it time-efficiency wise, but it could still be fun.
---
I‚Äôm basing mine off spending years dueling/watching duels at max gear. With 1v1 there‚Äôs so many variables, mage with MQG and reflector will beat spriest etc. but then depends on player skill, what trinkets the priest has, all that shit. Just from my experience mage wins most of the time, at lower gear they don‚Äôt have enough damage to break through power word shield or tank priest dot damage long enough
---
&gt;blindly.
---
Yet I gave my reasoning why I thought it was a good purchase.  Blindly implies no thought process.

Thank you for the request, comrade.

I have looked through nowhereman87's posting history and found 2 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.

What? Survival hunters weren't melee in classic, so idk what you're talking about
---
Thanks for the kind words, I enjoy countdown to classic - I think part of the hate is blizzards fault for giving keys exclusively to content creators, but I didn't get a key so I'm screwed on both ends :P
---
The XP ratios are really wonky for differently leveled parties, we actually tried working on this a bit to get the values but it just turned into a headache to try and figure out what blizzards doing without access to beta, Might be something we try to figure out during the next stress test.
---
???
---
As a Warlock main in vanilla this frustrated me so much and is one of the big reasons ill be rolling mage this time around.
---
I believe most streamers usually end up rolling on PvE realms. Though I have heard of a few stating that they‚Äôd try PvP realms.
---
Thank you for really kind words I appreciate it!
---
Thanks for the kind words it really means a lot!

This ^ it's an epic quest for an amazing item

Thank you. This will definitely save me time in the future. Now I feel stupid for planning on killing myself and walking back lol

I don't play WoW. I quit in WoTLK when (IMO) it went downhill. I, like many others, are coming back specifically for classic, and probably staying till WoTLK again if they go that direction. I trust blizzard making the decisions, OLD blizzard - the ones who gave us classic and TBC originally. I don't trust activision blizzard.
---
And yes, i believe that (now) spells with reddit, twitter, twitch, and forums make a difference. When classic, and nearly every subsequent expansion came out, these websites weren't there and it was hard to get opinions to the true developers. Why do you think there is a classic in the first place? They think it will make money due to enough feedback from people asking, and private server numbers. pserver numbers really aren't that high for them to use that entirely so they must be getting feedback from somewhere.
---
&gt;The free membership gives you the questing addon which is all most people will want.
---
The questing addon is useless without the questing guides.
---
You only get limited access to the guides without paying.
---
I am a blizz fanboy, though it was going to be a cool book about wow... Damn.. the hole book is an experience in game design that I wasnt prepared! One of the best buys ever!!
---
The gold is really good from what we tested so far, the bigger issue is... actually picking it up. Everyone gets so into the kill kill mode that no one wants to loot 
---
If we put it on free for all and let the healer / paladin do the looting, greens are a pain to pass around - but on group loot people just leave the sparkles on the floor.
---
We have a plan to let the priest loot all of the tailoring and enchanting mats and use them during downtime - by downtime I mean that there are periods in which quests are being gathered up that are shareable - so one person goes to get the quests while everyone else chills in the major city doing errands and professions, and this can work for putting things on the AH as well. Anything is possible with teamwork! :D
---
If you have the privilege to choose, I highly recommend going with more Hertz. The overall 'viewing' experience is more pleasant more Hertz. This is subjective ofc.  
---
It will make a small difference, at least when you play PvP.
---
Love it, think I'll change some of the colors of my setup when classic hits üòä
---
Lol lynched...for a video game... You kiddos now a days are awful.
---
Can even paste it directly onto imgur.com.
---
yeah but horde are poopie brains
---
That's awesome. I've heard priests can also solo DM trib runs if they have engineering, but never verified it.
---
Touch√©
---
Thanks for the tips Madheart! I'm excited to focus on these things you mentioned, getting quite excited to jump into the game.
---
You get the whole map revealed. That is your achievement
---
this is some of the more stupid stuff i read on this sub, not gonna lie.
---
Offensive dispel is one of the main jobs of  an offense priest regardless of spec so your last point makes 0 sense. Spriest has problems sustaining mana, but many priests would run a hybrid spec with silence and blackout as it can come clutch in some situations. Being full shadow is detrimental.

As far as I know basically all of it is, except I think he was sued for $18 million and lost, not $25 mil.

Can warlocks gather mobs and aoe them down like mages at level 60?

StaysafeTV has some great warlock leveling runs from 1-40 on his Twitch (not sure about his YouTube) ([https://www.twitch.tv/staysafetv](https://www.twitch.tv/staysafetv)).
---
Im personaly working on something similar for Druids, but atm it's mainly 1-10/20 and some guides. Soon will be more ([https://www.youtube.com/c/YarTV](https://www.youtube.com/c/YarTV)).
---
Kargoz has a lot of speedleveling theorycrafting and some 1-20/30 runs. Not sure about runs that go beyond that ([https://www.youtube.com/user/jheldridge](https://www.youtube.com/user/jheldridge)).
---
I saw North the mage stream some speedleveling sessions. Not sure if he has any speedleveling vids on his youtube ([https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDfd5-GAk7LojVuiCvlbJOA](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDfd5-GAk7LojVuiCvlbJOA)).
---
That's what I know from the top of my head right now!
---
this photo is like drinking fine wine out from the bottom of a leaking trash bag
---
Yeah this is consistent with what I figured as well. Thank you.
---
"Windfury is PPM based"
---
I thought it wasn't? The tooltip flat-out says "20% chance on hit".
---
In vanilla Collectors edition had a panda pet.
---
I tried few leveling guides but didnt even make it till 25 and ditched it. As veteran its much more enjoyable to use questie and hop between zones finding my own route.
---
Optimal? No. Much more fun than guides telling me "grind here for next 2 levels"? Absolutely
---
Sorry for the delay in response - it's been a long week!
---
Had to dig in a little to make sure I answer this in a way that effectively communicates my thoughts. Hopefully this makes sense, whether or not anyone agrees with it.
---
When you ask if I "believe" in a duty to help, this makes me think of morals and ethics. Now, my understanding of morals and ethics, is that they have absolutely nothing in common. Ethics, coming from the Greek word "Ethos" essentially means "the understanding of truth" while Morals, comes from the Latin word "mos" meaning "custom" or, better defined in this context, as "the whim of culture."
---
I'm currently taking an Ethics class, so I expect to understand this much better over the coming weeks.
---
So to answer this question, I kind of see two parts: An individual belief, and a societal belief..
---
For my individual response, given this situation, I am: 1) Aware of the imminent death of another person. 2) Capable of saving that person from death, without risk or fear of personal injury or death. Given these two facts, for me to do nothing, would be wrong. It would mean the death of another person was a result of my negligence. Human life is a gift, and must be respected, protected and cherished whenever possible. This is a direct product of humanity, our circle of life, and interdependence as a symbiotic culture.
---
This individual belief is based on ethics. It is my understanding of truth. Based on the principles I have outlined here, unless someone disagrees with these, the "right" response is to save the drowning person, while the "wrong" response is to let him or her drown.
---
Morals, however, are based on cultural norms. In some societies, allowing an individual to drown may be completely acceptable. There is no requirement or expectation of any effort to save the drowning person. This is actually quite common. In other societies, it may be expected to assist, but not required. This is also quite common. And in other societies, it may be expected to watch, but not involve oneself in any way to effect a rescue effort. This is also common (unfortunately). And finally, there are cultures that may expect an individual to push the drowning person under, to help them drown faster (I'm speaking figuratively more than literally). What is "right" in these situations socially doesn't fit with ethics. It is a moral decision based on "the whim of culture" - and a reason why many people do ethically wrong things and think nothing of it.
---
...like sleeping with a friends girlfriend/wife. Or pursuing someone in a committed relationship, perhaps, depending on ones understanding of ethics.
---
I'm assuming this is where you were going with your question - if I have completely missed the mark, please let me know! This has been quite a fun conversation for me!
---
&gt; The newest AAA games have great graphical quality but terrible aesthetic quality which is why in 2-5 year's they always look terrible.
---
? it's not the 90s anymore
---
Just to clarify im not saying that spriests cant kill druids. Not only can they but its also one of druids harder matchups. The point is that if you are trying to defend the flage in wsg there is no way you can kill a druid before he gets away. Unless he is really really really bad
---
Dude, the undead mount is the best in the game. What are you talking about?
---
Now to answer your question, yes, you need exalted with the given city to buy a faction mount. There is no easy way to get exalted, you can do quests while leveling that give you some rep, AV hand ins give rep, you can turn in runecloth and the AQ war effort also rewards reputation.
---
Thank you.
---
Apparently it was added in BC patch which surprised me to learn so not really even a possibility
---
It's a beta that's over 3 months long and has a level cap with limited activities. This is probably intentional. Let everyone exhaust  themselves on the classic beta, then hit them with new content in live and get as many people playing that as possible. Then there'll be a content drought leading up to Classic's launch, which will only starve the playerbase and reignite the classic thirst. I mean idk about you guys but I feel like beta's been live so long that I'm losing interest in the 30/40 metas without even having played, as fun as they were to watch. Maybe we'll see a level cap raise to 50, a few weeks/a month before Classic Launch to spin everyone up again. Then after all those ups and downs and Blizzard tugging on our heartstrings, we will finally get that sweet sweet Classic cheddar.
---
I thought from killing grey players as well, perhaps I'm wrong though. I haven't played in a very long time and going off memory.
---
I really love seeing early images of WoW for some reason
---
They have more bugs to fix than they probably have time. The beta was an absolute success and doesn't need to live on. They're testing 60 content privately.
---
interesting - I don‚Äôt feel this way.  I get that it feels a bit like a history book, or that it doesn‚Äôt follow a personal narrative - but I‚Äôm finding it a rich and easy read to stay locked into.  I mean, it‚Äôs no Simarillion! (as far as density)
---
You don't break the sap and restealth in sap duration.
---
L2
---
I was wondering the same. I seen french/spanish/german/italians exhibit this behavior but never scandinavians. And I play with many of them
---
Classic items. 
---
Raid drops for PvE(ie: Great Staff of Atiesh, Thunderfurry, Corrupted Ashbringer, etc).
---
Profession items for PvP(ie: Gnomish Deathray, Arcanite Reaper, etc)
---
Quest items for RP(ie: Seal of Ascension)
---
I think mining might be my profession of choice.
---
He did mention french...
---
Ur obligated to level
---
Young french people speak french..
---
Combat? High pop server is a goal for me. Its the dead servers im afraid of
---
Amazing. This is great content keep it up.
---
Classic - realms that were around at the time
---
I'm already prepared for this sub to whine about that very subject in a couple of months. 
---
I mean most pvp players here, know what's up. But there are always followers, who just want to be edgy. 
---
I wouldn't warn them. It's much more entertaining this way.
---
Just noticed that I could download the Classic client on my account. But when I try to log in it says that no servers are available. Did they recently allow everyone the ability to just download the client, or are the servers currently down?
---
I'm not as annoyed by players who corpse camp or kill lowbies as I am by allied players who could easily help but instead will /lol or cheer the player killing you on. Traitors should be hung in Stormwind.
---
you don't? you temporarily move the shaman in the priestgroup to drop manatide
---
I play Atlas alot and french/germans/spanish dont seem to bother there. Though its true they do posess the skill, as I had friendlies who were french
---
I‚Äôm the type that does this with food too.  I hope this thread encourages some folks to delve into some lore!  (those who aren‚Äôt already crazy about it)
---
This really comes down to experience. Just play your class and test new stuff every time. You will find how to play on your own time.
---
On another note I wouldn't suggest seal fate build without proper crit, you need like 30% crit unbuffed to make it work. You could go a cold blood/preparation combo which simplifies the game an makes you a PvP god when you realise how to do proper stun locks and openers.
---
The most important things to start working on is stun lock and abusing sap with non-damaging openers to get combo points before they can act.
---
After that you work on how to open each class.
---
Then you work on how you make each class to not actually see you, rogue about opportunities, creating openings and making duels seem unfair. So you need to think like that, don't think like a warrior.
---
Honestly the damage is less significant than the stuns and Mana burn that some of the bombs do. And the gnomish death Ray is just darn fun. These things are all super useful in Pvp, don't get me wrong. But they take a ton of practice, and frequently macros and add-ons to maximize their use. Also these things are much more useful in BGs, which won't be available phase one, and really not accessable while leveling until phase three.
---
My argument is more that you'll get more bang for your buck by focusing on making money until your mount at the least and probably onwards to 60. Basically, unless you're more disciplined than anyone I know, the temptation will be to buy things from the ah just to get that next skill up. It's also not specific to engineering. I don't advocate leveling any crafting profession prior to 60 for the same reason. It's just so much easier to farm lower level mats at less time and gold for yourself once you're max level. 
---
That said, do what you enjoy. If blowing someone up with a death Ray or reviving someone with faulty jumper cables sounds better along the way than getting a mount sooner, then do it. But if you're after gold or an advantage in Pvp to assist your journey to 60, I advise you look to other options.
---
Tank for hire
---
you're worried about a word while op is promoting the death of people? okay buddy
---
Computers were not a knew thing in 2004 by a long shot.  Heck, the WoW homepage featured the "Screen shot of the day".  Google existed in 04.  "How to take a screen shot world of Warcraft"
---
Works the same way now as it did 15 years ago.
---
I'd be happy even if it came in Outland like it references. I think they avoided doing that since warrior has so many legendary options, and by that point they probably already knew Shadowmourne was going to be in Wrath.
---
Yes. Just don't do it, if you are in a raid, it will slowly flag everyone. Happened to us more than I care to admit.
---
But yes, we already plan on wpvp as soon as pvp system is introduced.
---
Death
---
Yeah, as a Dane is would rather not be in the same bracket as the Swedes, thankyouverymuch
---
And yet people still don't know how to take a screenshot in 2019.
---
Manriks wife RP-PvP
---
Dear god why do you have four monitors?!
---
Other user posted a link,  he is using might of menethil.
---
With Dire Maul patch Tauren could finally use the Baron Rivendare mount.
---
But your wrong in your notion that it was less known in 2004.  OP is just an idiot.
---
Warrior pretty much. There might be a few chances to tank as feral. Feral does excel in 5 man tanking.
---
As someone going into WoW Classic without having ever played, my one fear is knowing nothing about the dungeons. Do you recommend trying to snag one of these on eBay?
---
And the classic should change to Anal and we will be set.
---
Bought gta4 and 5, hadn't played a gta game since Sa.
---
While 4 was dull and not even the great main character could carry the SL, I'm having a blast with 5.
---
There is like content for months.
---
Have you seen the games from 2-5 years ago that attempted realism through graphical prowess and fidelity. They age like bread.
---
Imagine it would show the name of the person/creature you got the soul from. That would have been so great
---
You should try playing FFXI on launch day...no not the NA launch, the Japanese launch. I couldn't understand jack shit, and had to use Japanese/English online dictionaries because in 2002 there wasn't any translate service.
---
Suck it up...it can't be that bad.
---
If it was then nobody would care for it
---
Ahh shite I'll stick to Warlock never been anything other than a tank though, should be fun.
---
Thanks for the advice my man helped a lot.
---
I have been kicking ass, since the dawn of time. I am simply killing man, that reached his killing prime.
---
I think you overestimate how much people know/knew about what they can do with a PC and google.
---
Well, funny to call someone mentally challenged as someone who can't even read.
---
Sword  
---
Wand  
---
Mace

etc.
---
Looks like a disorganized cramp fire.
---
Soulfire has a higher base damage than pyro
---
I have a regular i5 PC, not gaming but not Celeron, just regular ol pc. 16mb or ram and a 1tb HD. 
---
Do you think I need to upgrade anything? Not sure if a graphic card would make it any better...
---
i mean what else did you expect from a crapple?
---
You need more monitors dude! ;P
---
Depends on how you wanna level. If you take it slow you could even engi/mining from the start.
---
If you are gonna rush just get skinning on its own and get profs at 60. In wpvp while leveling you will not need engi, you're a rogue. You get the luxury to pick your fights, if you don't like the odds just run.
---
Not the guy you replied to but it means that you are gonna pay 60$ more than the rest of us every month to get an unfair advantage over others.
---
As a warlock, can I trade people soul shards? Or just use them on people?
---
yeah im sure almost any computer these days can run WoW classic , it would be up to your speeds and worrying about lag if anything
---

---
It‚Äôs not a joke lol
---
Might want to add in Divinity Original Sin 2, fantastic rpg.
---
Theres a weekly "meet up mondays" where guilds post looking for players. All kinds of groups from hardcore players looking for server first to people playing super casually.
---
no its not
---
And who the hell is zygor supposed to be?
---
I'm surprised he didn't then put that image in a word document and send us all the link.
---
But that‚Äôs just it, it‚Äôs BiS or plate. Up until the later patches there‚Äôs not many options in the middle.
---
Hi surprised he didn't then put that image in a word document and send us all the link., I'm dad.
---
Idk man it just doesn't do anything for me, I like my mounts to be thicc
---
Do you hold shift to post in trade?!?!?!
---
You should check what you need to do to get that tittle. I dont even want it
---
It is 2019 and I still can't fathom why anyone would play human in this game. The character in the picture looks legitimately retarded lol.
---
yeah, pyro initial damage isn't even that much higher than fireball, but the dot is still insane.
---
Enh/Ele shammy has far better survivability, and damage. Shocks, totems, and the melee/tanking skills
---
If you‚Äôre going to go for a different mount, highly suggest making the track and start doing the beginner quests in Durotar.  Will be worth it!
---
No problem. Rolling warlock myself.
---
If you have an active sub, you can create 3 characters for WoW Classic exactly 2 weeks before it goes live
---
I can also make it with it.
---
But that‚Äôs just 6months sub. Not a 25euro mount you can‚Äôt use in classic. This is different.
---
I started so late in WoW I was always sad i missed vanilla, cannot wait for it's releas.
---
Even still, add in crit bonus from ruin, percentage fire damage buff from talents, and the percentage fire damage buff from the imp, and soulfire becomes incredibly destructive.
---
no.
---
As a swede, we humbly accept your request of not being in the same bracket as the Danes as we don't want it either.
---
That boss was a one-shot.
---
you get the mount for free with the 6 month sub..
---
They are not tradable.
---
How old were you 04, 8?  PC gamers in 2004 knew how to take screenshots. Gamers in 04 knew how to Google.  Everything you've said sound like someone who wasnt there.  OP is a moron.
---
Not 60 mobs. Not effectively.
---
As a swede, we humbly accept your request of not being in the same bracket as the Danes as we don't want it either. (Norwegians and fins, we're cool atm)
---
Hes not just saying "pvp happens on pvp servers" he's saying people who play with limited time should think about things like getting corpse camped while leveling or camped by a group of 5 when trying to enter BRM before they roll on one, world pvp majority of the time is not fair 1v1s. If you have a fulltime job or you're trying to finish collage it's good to know this beforehand.
---
Yea, it‚Äôs a pain to reverse engineer. But with a dozen reliable data points from streams we might be able to model it approximately. The problem to me is knowing the base xp with 100% accuracy. If you ever wanted to give it go I‚Äôd love to help. I do stuff like this for work (kind of).
---
The method you described above was what I was thinking of! (The form a party deal)
---
You can but it detracts from your point and is vulgar
---
What's that
---
did you take a photo of your 4k thingy? seriously?
---
If they raised level cap the population would go back to normal?
---
I liked that one üòÄ
---
Ah gotcha. It‚Äôs another conversation entirely, but is soulfire a common ability in a destro lock‚Äôs kit? I don‚Äôt recall ever really using it in vanilla
---
What's funnier is that WoWs textures aren't even in 4k resolution.
---
You do all of it because everything is interlinked. You need pve gear to pvp.
---
Our names almost sound the same.
---
You can buy Bronze tubes from engineering suppliers.
---
How much are PVP mounts compared to epic mounts?
---
Wheres my beta key REEEE fuck influencers streamer privilege rigged
---
I have seen videos of warlocks sacrificing  their voidwalker for the shield and rain of firing down lasher packs in Diremaul.
---
When should you have void and when succ? I'm unsure about that. 
---
Also can you tell me about "with the right items"? I'm curious what consumables and gear and stuff you recommend to reach this level
---
The super jail reference fits just perfectly
---
Well the main issue with elemental is the actual lack of gear, not the inability to obtain them. Hardly any mail items with spell damage on them. Hell, even no leathers. And running in cloth damage gear kinda defeats the purpose of shaman as every melee will tear you apart.
---
Many names are restricted due to game lore and names with copyright.
---
It‚Äôs a beta...
---
don't worry. you're not my target audience if all it takes is a bit of vulgarity to detract you from the point
---
It's on the official WoW site.
---
It requires a soul shard and it has a cooldown if I remember correctly. It used to be a very common thing for PvP (seduction -&gt; soulfire) as a burst tool, but wasn‚Äôt really used in PvE much (fire damage).
---
When used with the maximum damage talents and stacked buffs, the lock would be capable of one shotting any other player in the game, even in full T3 tanking gear. It‚Äôs kind of like an unwieldy version of Pom pyro, but the DS/Ruin spec it used still allowed you to be useful outside of the cooldown.
---
Bloodstained Ritual of the Night
---
Dude you threw down a pretty penny but man your neck probably hurts from shooting it around trying to get a glance at different monitors
---
I started right before TBC came out so I didn't really get to experience vanilla.
---
It mostly depends of the faction you pick. If you play alliance it's pretty much worthless as you'll face shittons of UD in pvp
---
Hunter priest is an amazing leveling combo, if you‚Äôre not coordinating spirit tap it‚Äôll be hard to beat a hunter on last hitting.
---
I will be going undead priest this time around and will be leveling as shadow until I hit 60 and was wondering about my professions. I will be picking up tailoring/enchanting so I can get my first wand and then after that I don‚Äôt know what will help me make the most gold.
---
The beta was mostly made of streamers. They got shiny 8.2 to stream now
---
Yes I know that. But you get the mount as a reward for paying the normal subscription you would pay anyway. And so it‚Äôs not part of the mtx crap.
---
I would not like playing on a Scarlet Halls server because that's not a dungeon in vanilla.
---
 I burn and I plunder as it suits my desire. The weapon of my choice is "great balls of fire".

Shadow priests are that good at 29 or 39. Well played mages have way more burst &amp; utility. And locks stacking shadow dam roll the dots and literally melt faces.
---
Yes, but do you want to¬ø
---
You do know the first week will be hell, you won't be able to complete a single quest from 1-10.
---
looks like it is
---
As a "scandinavian", i don't even want to play on a 'your language' only server.
---
&gt;Of course it turned out that this particular pet just happened to have the same name as a random player on our server, who came back from being afk to 100+ whispers from a guild he'd never heard of... he was rather confused.
---
That's a riot! 
---
*Are you happy? Is he abusing you?*
---
There's good points for both sides. Concidentally, someone made a thread about paid character transfers yesterday and user /u/FrozenMurloc made a lot of good points against them which made me reconsider my stance on them. 
---
I think, ultimately, they won't be too bad but I wouldn't mind if Blizzard disabled them for Classic.
---
Scandinavians? Weve always written in english while playing wow.
---
have u ever played vanilla before?
---
Really? It's taught in college courses lol. People who curse are perceived as less intelligent. It's been studied an documented.
---
It is not difficult at all, but when you can clear something in 1 hour instead of 5 would you do that? Sure slower clears can be fun, but after you spend 5 months into the same raid maybe some pace is not that bad...
---
The tier 2.5 gear from AQ is godlike for elemental
---
Yeah I know the title was added in BC, but people still refer to it as Scarab Lord, the mount is pretty sick, totally worth getting if you are not a warlock.
---
Everyone meets in Thorium point together. Raid mounts up and rides into BRM. Kill all the alliance along the way. 
---
This works great until you run into another raid and then you just cancel raid night and farm allies for honor.
---
Lol look at this guys post history. Just the kind of player we don‚Äôt need üòÇ
---
It's summer time.
---
Summer has always been the biggest WoW killer and many guilds struggled to form regular raids because people want to be outside.
---
Add to that it's just beta and players don't want to play characters that will get deleted 2 months from now.
---
Only streamers and bug finders care about beta, it's a pointless game.
---
However you need to be aware that this will also happen once classic is released. Not by this extent and certainly not this quick but it will. The game is too grindy to last in this day and age.
---
He's saying stuff that's common sense.
---
You said you didn't know something. I explained it. We obviously took away something different from his post, but now you know.
---
I‚Äôd argue druids are the squishiest healers. You‚Äôre only option is to go bear form, spend a ton of mana, and just eat attacks until your tank peels it off, praying that you, your tank, or your dps don‚Äôt die in that period.
---
Priests get inner fire/fade/psychic scream, Pallies have some stronger armor most likely, and shaman too. Meanwhile as a Druid, I‚Äôm normally in mostly cloth gear and NOTHING to defend myself. I really kind of hate that aspect of dungeon healing.
---
I have in fact played vanilla when I was a kid in highschool  
---
As well as Private servers as far back as nostalrius

Star trek online. Though... I payed to win and now I'm bored again.
---
We cool with Norwegians and Fins all the time (well, maybe not the Fins, no one really knows what they say)
---
They will speak with their friends then.
---
Kids, daddy is going "traveling" for a while, you won't see me until the end of September.
---
The best way for a new player to enjoy classic is just entering the world and discover it. Let it flow and everything will come at time.
---
But i also strongly suggest you find  a new/casual player friendly guild, the game is more fun with a small family. :)
---
how much effort do you think I put into my first comment?
---
Or maybe a severe penalty that is less than completely having to start over, like losing a level and dropping all the boe items on you (maybe having a piece of equipped bop gear permanently break as well). That way the game would actually be playable to beat raids, but would still be hardcore and punishing. 
---
Hopefully I can play the old EQ style of mmo when Pantheon comes out, which may happen in the next... 10 years.
---
That's a cute map of Azeroth :)
---
I agree, I can't see a solo warrior on a fresh server who is going to have crap gear all the time breaking the 5 day mark.
---
Thanks I cant wait to start marking them out as I complete the areas
---
I've played on many private servers and this was never an issue. Even with Chinese people you can come to terms if they want to communicate and they never write Chinese in world/public chat.
---
On live servers on EU you got people spamming in trade chat guild recruitment macros for Greek/German/french/Finnish and what not, but I don't see people being bothered.
---
What is this 1st world problem it has become?
---
It's like a party member that you're always grouped with that has a mic that's not on push-to-talk.
---
Because the joke got such a positive reaction from wankers.
---
Initially I will be doing that, but I'm also an 'efficient' player when it comes to games. Like for example, levelling from 1-60 on my own would be torture knowing that there are probably a thousand better ways I could be doing everything.
---
Through most of AQ40 you can heal raids in your pvp spect no problem. You will need a healing set and dps set though. Mana tide is over rated. Only gives like 400 mana or something. They will just stick you in a melee group. You will spam chain heal in raids. Spriest might get to dps but if you can‚Äôt once again just raid heal in your dps specs if your competent in your class people won‚Äôt care. Unless it‚Äôs a progress night in NAXX or AQ40 you‚Äôre likely a okay to raid heal in your dps spec. 
---
I‚Äôm in the exact same predicament though. I‚Äôm thinking spriest cause they are less gear dependent. There will likely be less priests than shamans too.
---
&gt; Literally nothing important happened.
---
The end of MoP was the culmination of Garrosh's arc which had developed from BC through Catacylsm and into MoP, it was literally the first time they told a real on-going (IE didn't introduce a character only to kill them within the same expansion, like Van Cleef, Onyxia, or Ragnaros) WoW-exclusive story that wasn't rooted in WC3. Siege of Orgrimar was quite popular from what I recall so I would argue it paid off. 
---
It's worth noting that the entire trajectory of "modern WoW" was established in MoP. While we consider the classic trilogy Vanilla + BC + WOTLK, Cata has more in common with the classic games, whereas MoP both mechanically and in terms of story telling was the start of the "modern WoW" arc (that looks to be concluding with BFA and opening up a "post-modern" era with whatever 9.0 is). Seriously, MoP leads into WoD via Garrosh + Kairoz leads into Legion via Gul'dan leads into BFA via Sargeras. 
---
----
---
All that said, I definitely felt like at least 80% of MoP was filler / pandering. It's really a shame, but I guess you have to acknowledge Cata was the first expansion that saw a downward trend for the game and Blizzard was in panic mode so they tried to go harder after a less saturated (Chinese gamers).
---
I started a few months before pandaria cause i was just into league, really regret it
---
Lxde with Arc theme. Hi, fellow Linux user!
---
When you down a raid boss are you subject to a week long lock on the instance, as per retail?
---
Did you play in TBC?
---
TBC heroics were pretty dull, there was just a lot of trash and the bosses were pretty dull - None of them were really memorable as interesting fights. 
---
Heroics in Cataclysm (atleast at the start pre-raids) were fantastic, there wasn't much trash but each pack had to be taken with care, following CC. There were a lot of areas where you had to pay close attention to the map, as well as ALL of the bosses all having mechanics to follow.
---
Brilliant
---
I think its ridiculous that gold has a actual real money price. This is why I'm going to play classic and not retail.
---
I wouldn't want achievements to be in the game at all. They are shallow content and don't add anything to the RPG experience of the game. They artificially stretch the content in a non-meaningful way. Personally, I never felt motivated to explore the entire world just to get a shiny popup and a few points that don't matter or do anything. 
---
I think you'd have to be a collector or completionist type of player to enjoy achievements and it's fine if people enjoy that but it's not something that belongs in Classic. Since around WotLK, Blizzard has been pandering to these types of players more and more with collecting mounts, toys, achievements, pets and whatnot. All of which I consider shallow and inconsequential content that shouldn't be the main focus of an RPG.
---
You didn‚Äôt turn in your TPS reports on time..
---
*takes picture at all instead of a screenshot*
---
Looks sick.
---
Battle.net balance for gold so I‚Äôll be spending like 500k a month from retail, it‚Äôs just an additional way to enjoy classic, it‚Äôs going to be extremely popular now that it‚Äôs grown and tech has advanced.
---
How does typical progression look like for someone? They just pve until they have max gear then they start pvping? And also, I was more talking about servers. PvE servers seems more relax, but also lame. WPVP seems really fun but I'm just worried of wasting so much time running from spawn/getting camped etc, especially since I know nothing and am a pretty 'efficient' person when it comes to other games.
---
Yeah just wondering if the core premise of the build works in classic (on-hit scaling with spell power)
---
On a scale from 1 to 10, you're an 11.
---
WF is only one extra attack from the totem, and two extra attacks from the Shaman's buff.
---
Add in SS and the hits per minute isn't very different.
---
We all know every multiboxer do it to compensate, Be god. like the other guy said have an unfair advantage over people who play the game as intended.
---
Clearly youve never spent a second on a private server
---
Pvp server is the real choice. No you don‚Äôt need max gear but some pieces but there‚Äôs a huge difference between even a fresh 60 in greens and a 60 wearing best in slot blues
---
damnit I regret not backing this book!  Also holy shit that picture of the alpha looks like Everquest!!!

I don't need luck. Never once in my PvE progression in Vanilla did I ever see a 2H go to a Hunter over a Warrior. (Unless it was an obviously good Hunter 2H as there were a few)
---
9/10 The Hunter would sarcastically make the meme joke "Hunter Weapon" the raid would laugh in Vent for a few seconds and then it would go to one of the Warriors.
---
good
---
Oh ok :)
---
I did enhancement shaman on a private server a year or so ago. I love it, but I was relegated to pre-raid BiS farming against other melee, spent most of my time in BG's and AV. I'd say its as viable as ret paladin; if you are going to be the guy that gets every pre-raid BiS early, have some cash behind you to fork out for Nightfall, or atleast contribute towards it. You turn upto raids with all consumes, then they will maybe keep you around for atleast MC/BWL. People keep trying to push the idea that you have to be the god of spread sheets, in Vanilla, your success comes down to your ability to network, its not what you know, its who you know imo.
---
One monitor per hotbar?
---
Why the monitor all the way to the left
---
I agree mostly except about STV, which was just a total cesspool of corpse camping 60s.
---
No just play WoW 8 hours a day, living off hot pockets and Mountain Dew. 
---
It‚Äôs Dew Time¬©Ô∏è.
---
Yeah I was gonna do that anyway, orc starting zone is way more nostalgic to me
---
Oh nice way of saying it. Would it be a good alt option then?
---
All this and people are also playing classic on their phonesüòÇ
---
I'm from the crowd who were adults when vanilla came out. I lost my dexterity to play MOBAs or FPS but I don't mind socializing and grinding. When you leveled your 15th toon including fishing, cooking. When you pugged naxx. When you still there 10 years after, doing it again, you won't mind doing it on any kind of server. I've got nothing better to do with my mates and I'd be happy to do it on the beta, no matter if it stays up or not.
---
Imo PvP servers are 90% grief 10% glory. The 10% glory can definitely outshine the misery of the 90% grief if you have the time to invest into the game. 
---
I wont have the kinda time i used to anymore, so I'm probably going to roll RP or PvE and enjoy the experience. 
---
I want to echo what OP said. Choose wisely. Consider the kind of experience you want and don't let people try and shame you into playing the server type that works for THEM.
---
Just throw on the tabard and do LFD. You got this bud.
---
Bro, you're not in the group anymore, stop whispering me.
---
What I did for work was relevant to the example I was providing to answer the question.....
---
All of this while you just need one screen to play classic :&gt;
---
How are you playing on your chrome book? Only way I‚Äôve found to so far is to stream it off my desktop
---
Depends, was there something already in the lore for Kangarean like there was with Pandas? Either way, moot point since Australia didn't have anywhere near the number of players as Asian did.
---
It's gonna be a while before skulls are camping you, the guys that rush 60 will be busy farming and getting ready for raids
---
I want to see the components of the PC. I had it more aligned before, infront of the old computer.  
---
Still need to elevate this monitor a bit more too, but its okey for now :)
---
Have they said whether or not they will support transfers? I cant imagine they won't since its extra income at almost no cost, but still would like to know if its been confirmed.
---
Something like that =D
---
That UI aint too shabby!

Thank you. Feel like the video quality was a bit shiet, but not used to uploading to reddit.

Arc Dark, but close enough.
---
It's a roundabout way of playing 1.12, but it needed every advantage it can get with it's limited resource availablity.
---
Man I recognize the desperation so much! I‚Äôve never bought a midnight release but when ur having tech issues during releases of games etc. You basically become this super productive brainstorming genius just to get to play lol.
---
759, actually
---
Haha right üòÇ
---
I think the FRESH mentality applies more towards pvp servers where everyone starts anew. It guves you time to get through redridge/ashevale/stonetalon without getting griefed by a guy who has been 60 for 3 months.
---
Repeat after me: The beta is not for anybody other than the developers.
---
Now show me the Praire Dog in 4k, the true beauty of Classic
---
Ya, I don't get this. Like, at all. I question whether you guys have ever played Retail. Retail, each class has like a *hundred* situational abilities. So many that I would run out of hotkeys. It was overwhelming, and ridiculous.
---
 Classic has much less abilities, and each ability has more impact. Each cooldown is PRECIOUS, so if you waste it or the opponent counters it, it's huge. Retail, you have 10 more cooldowns to cycle through til it's back up. Classic is far better, but I don't even see how the argument can be made that retail is simple compared to classic. Raiding alone, most classes press one button. Maybe two. PvP is a bit better, but doesn't even come close to the 50 buttons on retail.
---
I think you guys either didn't play vanilla, or you are confusing dying 2-3 times to being camped.
---
Stuck between Druid and Shaman right now, maybe Mage. More looking for fun than viability. I‚Äôm fine with doing any role, but healing is something I‚Äôll need to be a bit more engaging. I‚Äôve been a shaman in retail since BC, but didn‚Äôt play one in Vanilla.
---
Isn‚Äôt the final word no?
---
It's okey, with the chair I got, spinning around. Mostly using two front monitors. The upper left is okey to watch from a straight angle too. But the far left is just for misc at the moment. It was at a better position, but moved it until further notice.

---
Yeh, I will work on it...
---
Oh yeah they definitely planned this whole "subscribe to get into the stress test" timing. Now people have an active sub and nothing to do, so why not try 8.2 out. This will give an inflated "subscriber" count AND inflated player numbers for BFA.
---
You're joking right? When guilds are progressing in a fresh server and everyone is in questing greens and blues and an Obsidian Edged Blade drops in MC, it's not going to any hunters.
---
A Warrior equipping that and using it until they eventually get better Fury weapons is going to increase his DPS SIGNIFICANTLY more than any Hunters DPS would from using it.
---
It benefits the raid far more in the initial progression rush on a fresh server.
---
Think what you want, I haven't raided since WoTLK but I was part of many server firsts in TBC and WoTLK and wasn't too far behind in my guild on BDF in Vanilla.
---
I have no raiding experience in the past 5 expansions so maybe things have changed, but the "Hunter Weapon" meme was alive and strong in my raiding days.
---
That would be so awesome. I just kept a little journal by my desk with a layout of my bags showing me which was which.-
---
Always seemed strange to shit on enhancement shaman in a melee group.
---
WF and Grace combined is a ridiculous boost, the crit alone is about 20% more DPS for the group, and even more when factoring in melee crit synergy.
---
Sure, a Resto Shaman could weave as well with slightly worse totems, but a Resto Shaman doing so cannot count as a healer *and* support at the same time. Either the shaman is an unreliable healer (useless) or the shaman is an unreliable weaver (useless.)
---
I‚Äôm going to playing wow classic on my dell laptop, the mobility is underrated
---
Not all raid lockouts are a week long, but that‚Äôs the general idea.
---
Git gud.
---
On a serious note, how will world pvp look like in reality changes from server to server and the experience differs wildly.
---
PvP basically fully enables human factor and adds tension to open world which I enjoy - it makes activities that would've been otherwise bland busy work somewhat dangerous or exciting. And it adds another dimension to interactions with the other faction - sometimes people will work together, sometimes won't. PvE server just erases this layer of interaction and that's why I don't plan on playing on one.
---
Plus there is no guarantee PvE community may be better. Often ones that self-proclaim themselves as casuals and friendly turn out to be the most spiteful and judgemental part of the community no troll or ganker can stand up to.
---
&gt; Thunderfurry

(O_O)
---
Going to be avoiding THAT server, I've seen enough ERP to last me a lifetime.
---
True, but I'm not playing it... I'm gonna live there.
---
Pain is in the same tier as Deep Wounds and Corruption but does more damage for longer, so it doesn't get kicked off.  Deep Wounds will constantly kick off other Deep Wounds
---
That's embarrassing, good catch!
---
I waited in line at a GameStop walking distance from my apartment for the midnight release of WotLK. There were maybe 30 people in line before the end of it, all massive Warcraft fans. Some guy even made cupcakes and was handing them out to the others in line. I had a great time hanging out with other Warcraft nerds, it was an awesome experience!
---
Look at how blurry the photo is and the monitor bezel at the bottom, you can tell it is a phone picture of the screen. But WoW classic graphics in general are noticeably not good in general, not a bad thing just an observation.
---
That's the most contradictory statement I've ever heard.
---
"Everyone needs gold and no BoE is worth equipping"
---
So whos paying gold for a BoE not worth equipping?
---
You should be banned
---
To add to this, restealth after blind (don't vanish), sap, wait for full energy, and open based on class and how'd much health is remaining. Prep gives you 2x vanish, 2x blind, for 4 total restealths. The rogue 1v1 game is not about button mashing, it's about control.
---
but then you wouldn‚Äôt be able to see the 4k monitor
---
Shaman is better at facetanking while casting, but druid is overall harder to kill due to better mobility and CC.
---
Pandas are animals found in Asia. When you think of fighting and Asia, what's the first thing that comes to mind, greco roman wrestling? No, martial arts. Maybe they did think that the popularity of the movie would give them a little bump. But overall, Blizzard didn't sink a whole bunch of money into a WoW expansion primarily because of a movie.  They've touched on many different cultures in the game, so why not the culture that represents an enormous amount of players.
---
Yah, that won't happen.  This problem is already solved.
---
I was so mad...and determined
---
I love how anytime someone says someone is wrong now the response is just "you didn't play vanilla."
---
because it's great that you get one-shot everytime you enter black rock? because silithus is basically a perma-death zone? 60 is the least attractive part of a pvp server to me.
---
super smash bros until aug 26 fam
---
A man of culture I see
---
Apparently that one‚Äòs done in an early build of the WC3 engine, they actually considered that at one point!
---
Aesthetics wins
---
Yes. If you enter your first raid that week, MC for example, and you kill a single boss, you're tied to that raid ID for the rest of the week. If you then leave after killing, say majordomo, and they kill the rest, you are tied to an empty raid ID and can kill no more bosses in MC that week. Unless I missed some Classic announcemetmnt, ofc...
---
When is the next stress test? And how do we pre-download the game before the next test?
---
Ive done that on pservers and its not viable. The mages will burn all mana(plus crystals) in one pull and have to drink.
---
Since ignites stacks, its better to use 3 fire mages. They get shit done.
---
I played on a pvp server back in the day. I think there are lots of genuine positives to pvp servers. The tension is fun. Its also fun when you and another same leveled player both come across the same herb at the same time, and you end up having this epic duel over 2 peacebloom or whatever. There are dynamic emergent gameplay kind of moments come out of pvp servers.
---
But the "high level player ganking people who can't do anything about it" is so prevalent, so prevalent I'd say it will be the majority of your world pvp experience, out weighing the good  fun moments probably by 10-1 if not more.
---
Despite liking the good parts of pvp servers, I would probably role pve now. Bad people spoil things for everyone else.
---
Seems like there is a lot of arbitrary stuff on the list, since Duke is restricted I can never play as the dukeofpizza :(
---
Only quest giving NPC's and vendors give DKs.
---
This chromebook had a user replacable SSD, and a way to put it into developer mode to unlock the boot menu.
---
Someone else already noticed I'm using an install of linux, which is correct. *I'm using the MX Linux distribution.*
---
Other than that, I'm using [Lutris](https://lutris.net/) to manage my installs and easily configure settings, and select specific versions and patches for each prefix (or inststance) of WINE.
---
I wouldn't bother trying BfA on this though, it's got just enough to handle 1.12 as is.
---
Maybe 5 mans but no one will let you heal as shadow in any raid lol
---
Because feral is also for tanking, mixed with cat form dodge chances I'm assuming.
---
Well, my comment was more about PvP than PvE. You're right about 5-mans.
---
Alright. Dont listen to these guys, do it. 5man boxing in classic is amazing. I recommend using a warrior, 3 firemages and a shaman/priest(pref shaman).
---
The mages is fast at clearing and you can bind the blizzard for AoE
---
Jumping off of cliffs into water and seeing who can do the longest wheelie on a dirt bike are infinitely more respectable.
---

Launch day 2004.  The very first character I ever made (excluding beta) was a human.  I got through the starter area and the made my way into Elwynn Forest.  The zone chat was like those kids from Lord of the Flies if they had been sniffing glue and eating paint chips all day.
---
Deleted my character and rolled Horde and have never looked back.  Barrens chat has a reputation of its own, but I would wager that Elwynn Forest chat is way worse.
---
Horde is life.
---
Look like shit to me.
---
bUT LoOK At ThOsE LoW NumBeRs
---
was good until horde
---
To be fair, nothing hits harder than execute with half decent gear. Obviously it only being usable sub 20% is it's only downside.
---
There was no scarab lord title in vanilla, but you have a small chance of getting the black battletank mount at least.
---
Anyone who rings the gong within 10 hours will get it.
---
That's an utopia. It just doesn't work and is not possible to make. You can't add an endless supply of raids with none nullifying the previous. Imagine having all the current retail raids as lvl 60 where they are all somehow relevant and the gear level doesn't increase so much that everything oneshots everyone.
---
Chicago?
---
So no major majormajor
---
Theres a lot of pessimists here, probably not, but it can happen. Really all you need is for your guild to have BWL on farm by P4, which isnt too tough and farm time. I dont thinj it will be like pserver progression rates so youll have time to take down BWL, also the pop will likely be lower, so less farming competition. While it takes a LOT of farming, youre only limited in time by the war effort, some of the hardcore guilds will likely get 2.
---
All you need at that point is to farm a lot and a lot of it you can do yourself, it just depends how much your guildmates are willing to put into it.
---
It doesnt matter if you spend gold or real money. blizzard gets a cut on tokens se they are still getting more money. Not that it would make it any bether if they didnt. Paying real money to get an advantage is not really worse than usibg retail gold to get an advantahege. The point is that you are getting an unfair advantage (basically legal cheating), regardless of how you accomplish it
---
You're an idiot. It forces you into a more hostile world where you have to be on your toes. The amount of organic team fights that happen because people realize the adrenaline of questing out in Tanaris is dangerous is something your pussy ass will never experience.
---
Sunken Temple quest lines for all of the classes were awesome in classic! They also had awesome rewards as well. Plus it gave you another reason to do one of the most hated dungeons in all vanilla. Sunken Temple, personally i really like this dungeon but a lot of people do not like it at all.
---
It‚Äôs hard to take anyone that uses Hotmail seriously.
---
Nws!
---
Have you thought about which class you are going to roll?
---
And then it eventually reaches the same point, unless you think people will continue playing this 'WoW 2' for years and years with no new content (when people constantly whine that retail has never had enough content in its expansions).
---
too much money too little brains
---
Anyone that says paladins are bad in vanilla don‚Äôt really know what they‚Äôre saying.
---
Technically speaking they‚Äôre the best healer in the game from MC to Naxx.
---
If you look at sites that show the highest numbers recorded on charts, pallies are at the top of every raid. 
---
Realistically though priests are better until Naxx for 99% of the players.
---
That‚Äôs not content.  That‚Äôs play style.  And I‚Äôve leveled plenty of characters on pvp servers, tough guy.
---
What size is it?
---
Sweet setup thoü§ôüèº

---
Except the world buff exploits completely break pve, so not really anymore.   It's about as much of an achievement as LFR.
---
Of course we can. Lol back in Vanilla except the world record, barely any guild went to AQ and even naxx without at least a few offspecs. Same for consumes, most of good raiding guilds didn't use them except for the tank for which it was common.
---
Just relax, all of your concerns are only a consequence of a vocal community that is pserver players. They like to do everything as perfect as possible, good for them. But that's absolutely not necessary for a game like Classic.
---
You'll realize soon enough that gathering 40 regular people and be sure everyone knows / learns fast enough boss strategies will be the biggest challenges. Not your raid composition.
---
Dont take it as an assumption many still feel "why should I carry someone else's fun?", You are bringing less to the table so totem twisting or the likes are something you are going to want to be looking into. Try to be helpful in other areas like healing dungeons for people and the likes.
---
My guild won‚Äôt let people raid if they don‚Äôt have max engineering. 
---
Regardless of spec or class.
---
Yea but the joke is kind of in the overkill of the action. He could just wand shoot him but instead casts a 6(?) second hard cast power nuke. Execute doesn't put the same punch (joke wise) since it's literally meant to be used to execute low health targets.
---
I‚Äôd do the warrior first. There will be more people to level with and a warrior/healer duo makes the process far more enjoyable.
---
Ohh thats so hard now. Should i really main enha? God

Thanks that means a lot. Allllmost worth it to be called a legend 11 years later on reddit. üòÇ

wow, the "is classic dead?" threads started a lot earlier than i thought they would. i figured you guys would wait until the game was released, at the very least.
---
Yea it‚Äôs just Twitter.com/sonii
---
OP is showing off his setup. He‚Äôs opening himself for criticism. Using an old keyboard such as this, nothing to show off lol

You can still get 4K UI. Not sure about effects...

Pass. But thanks for asking. :)
---
Which isn't the worst thing in the world
---
Human females have the best aesthetics and animations imo.
---
Male undead and female undead tie up with female human.
---
Then night elf female.
---
Worst is gnome animations.
---
Didn‚Äôt seem awesome at the time, but I wasn‚Äôt going to be stopped. Still hate Comcast, they used to do that maintenance thing on our box like every month and it was always during a raid...(one of the problems of having a late-night raiding guild.)
---
So you are genuinely saying that, in wsg, offensive dispels are not one of a priests main objectives.  Sorry but youre retarded
---
He's not using Nightfall. Those are numbers that he achieved using Might of Menethil, the best ret weapon in the game.
---
Yeah but you bring more shamans than everything but warriors

I had to start playing on pserver. Couldnt wait any longer
---
Yeah Ik, was just replying to the "hardest hitting ability", obviously wasn't talking about context.
---
What‚Äôs the max number of characters for a guild name?
---
Some things in the game just straight kill you.
---
Damn you're right not added until 2.0.3
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patch_2.0.3
---
The title was added in TBC.
---
Yes, yes it is. Because the tone had been set from since Warcraft 2 that the setting was an amalgamation of WESTERN fantasy tropes ranging from low fantasy to steampunk. Asian is a whole different subcultural with different tropes and themes. It's the equivalent of releasing a Witcher III expansion in Final Fantasy FFXIV which celebrates Asian fantasy.
---
If someone offers you $10k you'd probably sell the mount
---
Whom did you raid with that the only conversation going on was pulling, wait, and mana? Please let me know, so I can heavily avoid them. That sounds like a nightmare.
---
I'm pretty sure the druid that was awesome at impressions help keep my guild together through burnout, and we would have fallen apart without him.
---
It's not hard to clear the channel when you need to get serious, unless your officers suck.
---
I‚Äôve been playing my backlog of games while I wait. Kinda just put classic in the back of my mind in the meantime so I don‚Äôt go insane waiting another 2 months for it
---
I hope you are watching crypto prices with all those screens!
---
neither of them make sense. they were both retcons with the sole intent of maintaining the horde-alliance dichotomy.
---
Heeey dude im that feral youve talked to :)
---
This image if from a 3-4 year-old post from another forum. 
---
Perhaps the poster here is the same person who created the original image, but if not it's a bit lame to let people believe that you created something which you did not create.
---
Lol, that's pure dedication
---
I copied a shortcut to a word document into my floppy and mailed it to you! Check your mail box!
---
Yea you're right
---
Where did I say I made it?
---
Why are you asking me?  Its not my UI.
---
HAWH HAWHHHH HAWH! HAWH HAWHHHHH HAWH...
---
If a druid equips correctly, we've had druid single tanking ossirian just fine with that trinket.
---
Just need a monitor on your tower's side panel.
---
‚ÄúLegal cheating‚Äù lol ok. It‚Äôs a 15 year old game that has been min maxed to hell, god forbid people find fun and new things to do. Layering will ruin the economy way more than one person being able to solo dungeons for gold/materials and a new challenge.
---
Some folks just haven't had to handle being disappointed in life I guess.
---
This is kind of what I gathered. Alliance seems to be either older guys or younger kids. Horde seems to be 'cooler'.
---
You have no evidence to support this.
---
Nobody cares about reddits addiction to print screen. Let the OP do they're thing!
---
Raiding is also a small fraction of the endgame at 60, even for raiders
---
I am remodeling a room, not specifically for classic but definitely going to be my office.  Its also 100% for classic.  Got a new desk so i can support 3 monitors because 2 feels great, i assume 3 will be better. 
---
Remodeling was done due to expanded bathroom and the other room is to small for anything.  It will have great lighting though, which i feel is very important.
---
Pvp content?
---
Guys, somebody call Dr. House because a mystery is afoot. How does a grown man have a case of the Mondays on a Sunday?
---
This is some end user level shit.
---
Me: "Send me a screenshot, please."  
---
End User: \*takes polaroid picture of the monitor, scans it, prints it out, scans it again,  emails it\*
---
Bringing along sub-par specs does not make raids take 5x as long.
---
It is a dumb mtx, just one tied to your sub :P
---
Where‚Äôs the link? And how would you know it was for these parses?
---
Mage quests are probably the least interesting and the least rewarding compared to any other class.
---
Do you even have links to these exact logs?
---
Your comments in this whole thread make me sad. The damned elitist people that are responsible for making people like you hesitate that much disgusts me.
---
IT'S A GAME FFS. PLAY WHAT YOU WANT, IT'S THE GOAL, HAVING FUN, REMEMBER?! Those guys are a minority. Don't be influenced by them.
---
On a Sunday?
---
You have the full logs and not just the overall dps readout? 
---
Because I see nothing that indicates he wouldn't be using the one weapon that makes his build actually worth anything. That being said I don't really know anything about him so I could be wrong. Is there something I'm missing that indicates a player other than Esfand is using Nightfall or is he known to not use it?
---
I would be mildly disappointed and thought you were cheap but that's just me
---
The graphics are more like an aged whiskey. But not whiskey aged in a barrel, but whiskey that was just bottled a long time ago. So people will act like it's gotten better when nothing has changed.
---
To be honest the last time i truely played AAA titles was the 360 ps3 era. So granted top notch graphics may have plataeud and therefore are longer lasting. But my point was more regarding the life expectancy of aesthetics.
---
Hi, for warlock advice in PvP feel free to Check Out my Guide https://classicwow.live/guides/620/warlock-pvp-guide
---
just want to say you are beautiful
---
I wish I could get that book. They don't ship it to Canada yet. 3rd world countries can't have nice things.
---
5. abuse the neutral ah on your server
---
but making a second account just for saving enchanting tips is definitly not worth it
---
No, this is just your opinion and isn‚Äôt backed up by the numbers or history or anything Blizzard has said.
---
Play on retail?
---
I haven't played since mop. So I'm completely confused about everything.
---
SH? Is that a new private?
---
Regardless of what profession you level during leveling, you will be ‚Äòlosing money‚Äô as you could have sold the ore, leather, herbs, etc‚ÄîI wouldn‚Äôt expect enchanting to be much better than blacksmithing or engineering (which are on the expensive side) 
---
Also, consider you can sell wands to the other needy casters. And maybe sell low enchants for a few silver while leveling.
---
*new
---
Esfand never uses Nightfall, he always goes for the weapon that provides the highest personal DPS because he likes the memes. The [armory link](https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643) from which the parses were taken shows that he has Might of Menethil.
---
Nothing is toxic about comparing the two games. As more negatives and positives are pointed out then possible improvements may happen. Though I think it is 3 expansions too late to fix retail, maybe classic being successful will either cause changes in retail, or they go to classic+ revamp the game and maybe not make the same mistakes.
---
Thought that blurry building in the background might have been sears tower.
---
I‚Äòm in Europe and I got it after backing a couple months ago.
---
I now see the monitor bezel.  Hard to see when you click on the photo on mobile.  Thanks.  I‚Äôll return to my retirement home.
---
The character models yes, but the environment was beautiful. My favourite wow zones to level
---
Thanks man really appreciate all the details
---
It measures 1m20 on 90cm
---
Will Classic actually support native 4k?
---
Slay the spire!
---
Look at this 4k picture I took with my phone so it looks 720p.
---
Yea you are right. Thanks a lot. What do you plan on playing?
---
I‚Äôll be in a 5 man group for most of my  leveling  time. A bunch of my friends are taking 2+ weeks off work at launch
---
me too! How is it going for you? I was thrilled and then someone asked me to kill boars (duh) ... and I don't know what happened, but I got annoyed instantly ... help.
---
Asking the real questions. I've already taught my wife how to fish for me via pserver.
---
&gt; WPVP seems really fun but I'm just worried of wasting so much time running from spawn/getting camped etc, especially since I know nothing
---
You're going to get killed a lot on your journey up to 60. You can minimize it by always going out questing with someone (either play with a friend or go with some random folks, many like to quest together) and keeping situational awareness of someone wanting to kill you. At some point you'll be a 30 in a contested zone, a 60 will run by and decide to kill you and your party, all you can do is /wave  /salute and hopefully they'll leave you alone. 
---
By the time you hit 60 you'll be comfortable with the game and if you're an "efficient" person I assume you'll be the type who reads/watches a lot of guides on your class and by that point they'll make a lot more sense and you'll get up to speed quick.
---
I only said it's "a bit lame to *let* people believe that you created it". I didn't say that you explicitly claimed to have done so. There's a bunch of relpies that clearly have the impression that you were the creator. 
---
Not to say I don't understand *why* you didn't link to the original source given this sub's stance on Private Server promotion. But I'd personally have at least acknowledged that it had come from somewhere else.
---
An armory link does not prove he didn‚Äôt switch to Nightfall during the raid. Of course he wouldn‚Äôt wear it outside of raids. If you don‚Äôt have links to the exact parses or videos of these exact raids, then my argument that he was using Nightfall is just as valid as your argument that he wasn‚Äôt.
---
Why is no one stating the obvious:
---
Dire Maul will not be out on classic launch, so no.
---
However, BRD could be farmable it depends how they handled the elite wardens in there and whether they can net or not
---
I just started it on Friday, really digging it so far!
---
So I‚Äôll be rolling a troll hunter with a shaman. Should I go lw or alchemy? They both have perks and right now I don‚Äôt have interest in engineering.
---
I agree a lot of ps360 games haven't aged well, so many games going for grey and brown "gritty realism" dates them pretty badly and were limited by the hardware of the time
---
It is good , considering the short life span of classic servers and how much fun the leveling process is on s fresh server.
---
Wine develops new characteristics over time.
---
No, it's an enticement to subscribe for 6 months. And it will help numbers in 2 fiscal quarters. The money taken in during Q2 and the sub numbers during Q3. Players save a few bucks and get a new mount, Blizzard gets a lil boost to numbers and no one really loses on this deal.  
---
The only mtx is if you just buy the mount in the store. Which is silly, but free will and all that jazz.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa  aaaa sit right back let your trouble melt away
---

Where did you fish to get mooncloth?
---
How are you using a Hotmail domain in 2019?
---
u think preventing friends from playing together is a better idea than queues?
---
FPS games suck.
---
Look carefully my dear Watson.
---
Hey guys. That's the joke.
---
I know eh lol, 
---
I love when people who obviously don‚Äôt smoke try to make jokes about it. 
---
It‚Äôs so cringy haha
---
I know. I'm just messing around since im bored
---
Titles for rewards that arent attached to achivements would be the only thig id be okay with like being exalted with certain factions or having max professions etc. like the exalted title and professor
---
We both know TPS reports are just busy work
---
No, l don't even have access
---
No, your argument rests only on the assumption that both versions of the story are possible. On the other hand, my argument is supported by the fact that Esfand is notorious for raiding with Ashkandi, Sulfuras, MoM or equivalent weapons instead of using Nightfall.
---
Yes, people work on Sundays.
---
Private servers, hmu if you need a name of a few good ones.
---
I want instant que times. I played a ton of BGs in TBC and Wrath. Even with Cross realm BGs I saw a the same people all the time. I developed some great rivalries. The best thing is when you puss someone off enough for them to make a level 1 in your server and faction just to bitch and moan because you just trashed them in AB
---
Thanks. I think you make a really good point about the efficiency of gold here (it's worth more as a lower level because you need to buy stuff, and less as a higher level as you can farm/acquire it more easily).
---
I think I will actually start off skinning + mining and vendor all the leather goods. But I will switch to Engi much sooner than 60 as I know I'll get bored of leveling (but maybe wait till after lvl 40 mount).
---
I imported it from the US amazon store. Well worth it
---
Wow isn't the first game to make these type of classic / retro servers, and all of them needed more beta testing.
---
Those Hyena packs are heavily nerfed on private servers, they're literally impossible to take damage from. I haven't seen anyone try them on the Beta. However, for a level 60 it's very underwhelming gold per hour since they're 30-ish mobs.
---
The ebook is on amazon.
---
It‚Äôs Blizzard, it gets released when it‚Äôs done. That‚Äôs the only logic that applies.
---
If anyone in Eastern USA is interested in doing this Im down to war/sham/rogue it up
---
I‚Äôm building a computer over the summer to play classic, since blizzard refuses to bring classic to Xbox or switch
---
To ensure WoW maximizes the destruction it causes on another generation of students' lives.
---
Your definition of content isn't on point here.
---
I don‚Äôt care what stories get passed around the campfire, those aren‚Äôt facts. Find the parses or shut the fuck up.
---
Because they intentionally wanted to ruin your summer in particular
---
I was so hyped and now I play other games like Dota Underlords and they are fun.
---
Don't know if the hype can come back but I am already considering not playing at all :D
---
Still this picture is worse than my old screenshots taken in 2006 on my 32" LCD LAVA TV HD READY (720P)
---
So glad I‚Äôm done with school and have no kids, can‚Äôt wait to spend those breezy fall days inside playin wow with the boys
---
Why would anyone do that?
---
So for multi-boxing you like to have same classes. It will become increasingly more difficult to manage 5 different classes from one keyboard. You will most likely spend more time setting up your shortcuts and skills than leveling. 
---
5 Ele Shamies was a always popular multiboxing combo because they have high AOE damage with chain lightning, Can chain heal and have good armor so no need to kite. 
---
If the main reason for your multiboxing is to level certain classes then just stick to those classes even if they do or do not work with each other.
---
I am not in the Beta, but there is no coding involved in this Addon, it‚Äôs essentially a UI graphics swap. I would love it if someone with Beta access would give it a try, otherwise I will test it in the next Stress Test. It works in BFA (although some graphics drop out in retail) and on private servers so I have no doubt it will work in Classic.
---
Pantheon? People keep talking about it. 
---
Hmm... there is not much on their website. Where should i look for info about it?
---
https://legacyplayers.com/Armory/?charid=329643
---
However, there's nothing to indicate he's not using it for these parses except the fact that his recent gear history doesn't show it (we don't know when these parses were or what he was doing on his char last. In fact, I'm pretty sure that's his character from back in the day, which means it is almost definitely NOT the link for the gear he was wearing during those parses.
---
believe it or not, the main playerbase of classic is not in school
---
I know it, those buggers!
---
Regardless, nothing said so far is something that doesn‚Äôt exist on a pve server.  If one wants to experience the supposed thrill of being vulnerable while questing in Tanaris, they can flag themselves and be open to attack.
---
I've been doing some leveling on a Private Server as practice, and I've hit a little bit of a roadbump in my leveling path. I've been primarily just leveling naturally, not using a guide or leveling with maximum efficiency. I'm lvl 39, almost 40 now, and the questing has slowed down a decent amount.
---
As a Gnome Warlock my questing zone so far has been Dun Morog &gt; Loch Modan &gt; Redridge (a bit) &gt; Wetlands/Duskwood &gt; Hillsbrad/Arathi/STV
---
I'm mostly done with STV, mostly left with elites and orange/red quests now. I dipped a bit into Badlands but it's been a slow and sparse zone so far (though I might be doing it wrong). I visited Swamp of Sorrows and Dustwallow Marsh but they both seem a bit barren of quests that I can do, or at least I'm not finding any quest givers very easily.
---
I guess my question is which zone should I be in right now? I feel like the answer is probably somewhere in STV/Badlands, but the former is drying up and the latter feels sparse, and I think the level req. for the next zones of Hinterlands/Ferlas/etc is probably at least 42 if I'm guessing correctly?
---
I've never played Classic before but it's been extremely fun so far, been trying to practice what the leveling will be so if anybody has a better recommendation of what order I should do the zones in (1-40 or 1-60 in general) then that would be appreciated as well!
---
Is that a sound bar in front the pc?
---
His idea is benefitting that too, if players have a harder time beginning on a full server, they will play on less crowded ones and thus keep them alive
---
Ah suh dud!
---
Because most people go outside and do things during the summer?
---
Ive seen lowbies camped too man, maybe your experience wasnt the norm?
---
Your mileage may vary
---
University and gf((
---
But I still gonna spend those breezy fall days inside playin wow with the bois :D
---
roll on a x15 xp classic private server
---
Ironically you would have been laughed at in actual Vanilla for turning up wearing a dress. By the time we got to Naxx, I would slip on my dress when the raid started, guaranteed within 10 minutes somebody would be taking the piss out of my pink dress.
---
I just used the 3 day retail trial.
---
Holy fuck, it‚Äôs like dropping someone from the 1700s into a modern Starbucks.
---
Shit is popping up all over the screen, quests are randomly appearing.  The entire city looks different.  I recognize the surrounds and players, but no clue what anything does.
---
I tanked a 5 man and shit was glowing like a Christmas tree.  My talent tree is gone and replaced with other random shit.  My guy sits at 100 rage with nothing to spend it on.  Very confusing time in my WoW life.
---
I am not an ebooker.
---
If you dont play on a pvp server you're missing the point of the game entirely.
---
Looks rad dude.  I used to use 3 monitors but now only use 2.
---
Classic player are really prone ti be retarded by glorying a screenshot taken with a cellphone ;/
---
If youre ahead of the curve, here's what will happen.
---
The world will feel dead, there will be barely people to run instances with and you will burn out as soon or likely even before you hit 60.
---
Chill out, find some cool people to play with, and just enjoy the experience. There's nothing at the top that warrants skipping the middle
---
Haha perfect name.
---
I see, thanks for the insight. Sounds like I'll probably stick with the 20/0/31 until people ask for a deeper holy build if ever that does happen. I would like to eventually clear up to Naxx but that's farther down the line, and I'd be using consumables and such as well for that so sounds like I should be fine overall.
---
Hmm, maybe I should. Crypto trader by night, gamer by morning.
---
You‚Äôre starting to get into that grinding area of leveling between 30-50. There‚Äôs an island off of Feralas that has some quests you can do (feather moon). When you hit 40 you can go to Tanaris and grind waste wanderers until you‚Äôre high enough to do quests and turn in pouches for rep if you care about that.
---
I don't really mind about buying physical copies, they are more fun but I got them laying around somewhere, so been there done that =)
---
Soupasoka has two full 1-60 series for priest and warrior
---
test
---
Potions are always good and you can sell xmute, but any leather stuff you can just get on the AH. Unless you really love LW, go alchemy
---
Its up to 40 ¬∞C (104¬†¬∞F) in central europe atm and no one has air conditioning here.
---
Just wearing headphones is torture. Im glad there is no release at these temperatures.
---
Seriously hilarious the amount of people complaining that #nochanges should totally not apply to cross realm battlegrounds (that impact the entire community of the server) while at the same time denying people a toggle function for improved graphics (which impacts literally only the person that wants to activate it). 
---
\#nochangestohypocrisy
---
Then classic won't be fun to you.
---
Yeah like those private servers, dead first week! Oh wait
---
Nah, no sound bar. Two speakers on each side of the rog monitor. Did you mean the white the pc is standing on? It's a ledge I built to elevate the pc from the desk.
---
I was doing this recently.  Was binge watching on Netflix so I just grinded up Rexxar's strength to absurd levels to where he could one shot anything.  Good times.
---
So... not proof of anything.
---
Enhancement is not only bad, it's also boring to play in PvE.
---
Usually you level an alt
---
show us your setup
---
Right.. I should... but the lights man...
---
I've played both factions for nearly 13 years now, so I guess I'll chime in.
---
Back in the day (2007 to maybe 2010 or so), Alliance was pretty popular with the retired/older/more mature audience, they would always be pretty active in the early morning (5am-11am). On the flip side, it became very apparent when the classes (children) and day-shifters (young adults/teens) let out, because you'd start to see the trolls/spammers/toxicity right at 5pm or so. 
---
On horde side, it seemed like most of the playerbase had jobs - I'd see more late night raiding/pvp guilds on horde, presumably to fit the night-shifters work schedules. That doesn't mean the children weren't on horde - right at 5pm, you'd see the same shit.
---
Does that mean [faction] is worse/better because it has more/less mature players? Not really, it really did depend on the server population. For example, if you joined a server with top .1% raiders/pvpers, you'd see a lot of toxic younger people on both sides trying to be edgy and fit in.
---
In today's "internet", the playerbase overall has matured. Since MoP or so, both factions feel almost the exact same. I have no doubt this will be the case in Classic.
---
I play Paladins, Realm Royale, Heroes of the Storm. They are great games, but they excel at being secondary games. I play Civ5 as my single player "me day". I play an assortment of tet-level games, but nothing worth mentioning.   
---
I tried playing live WoW twice yesterday to try out my warrior. It really is near unplayable; it feels like a junkyard; in some ways it is.   
---
I logged on once for PVE, and I literally got up in the middle of a quest fight to check on the dogs, got distracted, made a cup of coffee, came back and my toon had killed 1, and was standing there derping, and I still killed and looted the mob. Finish quest, hearth, log out. 
---
I logged on the other time for a bg. I hit up 2bgs, one as arms, the other as fury. Arms game, I pretty much ate shit to a premade. Fury game was improved, but I still felt like all I was doing was belting off priest shields or waiting on paladin HoJ to be up, meanwhile I ate shit. Every. Single. Time.
---
I had lost my passion for wow at the start of BFA, i had good memories of vanilla but i wasn't super passionate about it, no private servers or anything, i was planning to play classic but wasn't super hyped, until a week ago... I watched a few pvp videos and the hype is now real, nostalgia is overflowing, and i wish i held off watching those videos until classic was closer to release.
---
 Efficiency is a double-edged sword.
---
I can't speak for the Alliance as I only play Horde, but there is a *'leveling path*, and while you have some different zone options (eg. Barrens/Silverpine) within a level range, if you just follow the dots you will miss out on quests/rare mobs/vendors that are squirreled away off the beaten path.
---
The rush to 60 is an important thing for a lot of players, but there is so much more to the game that can be missed/greyed out if you are only focused on the end of the journey rather than the journey itself.
---
Class design doesn't even matter when enemies in 90% of content die before you finish even one rotation of abilities.
---
I'd go one step further and say really bad guilds that take whoever they can get would allow them, but also really good guilds that don't need everyone min/maxing will take them. And probably pugs that just need bodies.
---
So almost everyone except the elitest people who are taking off a week of work to play wow when it launches to get "world first" on something that was achieved 15 years ago.
---
If you are content with BG's and 5 mans, for sure. It is brilliant having pre-raid BiS + Unstoppable force, one shotting clothies, 5/10 man dps is competitive, maybe even ZG/AQ20.
---
Great game, I think Terraria is one of the best games in recent memory but I think people find the art direction offputting.  It's seriously super fun.
---
Thanks, it's overkill. But it's something to spend time on between work and classic launch. And since no beta, whacca gon do right.
---
in the mid atlantic we should have pretty nice weather well into september, im looking forward to sitting on my laptop out on the porch with a cold beer and a fat joint strolling through azeroth
---
&gt; oneshot by a double crit 
---
I am confused.
---
Counter to seeing Enhancement Sham in pvp: any slow.
---
How can everyone tell he used his phone to take the picture?
---
you havent decided on the raid schedule and still asking for people to be raid ready in 3 weeks, O K
---
Desolace should have some quests, and some take you to Scarlet Monastery which help bump you up. I will say though, it does get really slow and a lot of people end up getting discouraged, but the mount is motivation! I would say 1K needles too. Try running RFD? 
---
Come launch, try to shoot for doing some Westfall, Duskwood and Ashenvale stuff to get you up some. I remember through all my years and pserver experience, you really do end up going to almost every zone to level and milk out as much xp as possible.
---
 That sounds like a ton of work tbh.
---
There‚Äôs usually quests for wands and there are likely really hard core people that will hit enchanting up and have mats to create and DE. Probably warlocks. Priest you need to save your money. I would suffer the grind until your first wand quest at 10 and keep checking the AH and do bother but skin and 1 other gathering to save your money. 100g for most sucks plus the costs of spells sucks too. The only thing I think you should pay for as a profession other than gathering is cooking. Cooking gives you spirit and spirit is the only stat you care about until you‚Äôre done leveling with spirit tap. Better to do wand quests and buy them than burn money with tailor and enchanting!
---
Awesome :D
---
&gt;god forbid people find fun and new things to do. 
---
It might surprise you but cheaters enjoy what they do.
---
&gt;Layering will ruin the economy way more than one person being able to solo dungeons for gold/materials and a new challenge.
---
Comparing a serverwide system to a sibgle person? Layering as a whole will not have the impact that all multiboxers have because 1. its temporary and 2. has a cooldown. But even if i agreed what kind of argument is this? Just because there are worse things, it doesnt make bad thibgs right
---
Because its washed out and theres glare.
---
I was also going to suggest doing a little grinding, but also Desolace is available for you. The Centaur quest lines and others should at least offer you a level at this point. They will likely be green mobs but it is a great little spot for 32+.
---
Hey fren hope you are having a wonderful day, i like your comment made my smile : )
---
IMO, put enchanting on an alt, they only need to be level 5 to do the wand and you can send them stuff later to disenchant.  Pick up skinning/tailoring on your priest instead.  Vendor most of the skins and you'll probably want to keep tailoring for the truefaith vestments.  You can also just do tailoring at 60 and pick up two gathering profs but not sure how competitive nodes will be at launch to make it worthwhile.
---
What a cluster fuck
---
Basically: The Burning Legion is pretty much destroyed. Garrosh is dead. Vol'jin is sort-of dead, Sylvanas is Warchief, Horde annihilates Teldrassil, Zandalari join Horde, Kul'Tiras finally exists again and joins Alliance, Sylvanas is Garrosh 2.0 and begins alienating everyone, Alliance wants to kill Sylvanas to stop the Faction War for the 13th time, Horde is trying to find their identity for the 13th time, everyone goes into Queen Azshara's land to kill her, and that's where we ended off.
---
There's some shenanigans with time travel in Warlords but that basically amounted close to nothing except making the Legion invade again, which was taken care of at this point.
---
Roll Mage or Warrior?
---
What I read about both classes in Classic and some of my preferences (some points might be wrong or inaccurate):
---
Mage:
---
Pros: Easier leveling, utility Kit (food, water, portals), AOE spells, better gold farming, top ranged DPS, flashy skills, good defense skills (ice barrier, blink, poly, nova), less mechanics to avoid in raid, better duel class, strong at BGs, cheaper pre-raid BIS, only DPS role (personal take)
---
Cons: Easy but boring PvE Rotation, squishy, cloth armors are kinda lame, overpopulated class, lots of downtime due to mana recover.
---
Warrior:
---
Pros: Best raid DPS, PvP beast when you have a pocket healer, more races avaiable, awesome looking armors and weapons, less squishy than mages.
---
Cons: poor solo PvP, at some point be asked to tank (personal take), harder rotation, no escape skills, very gear dependent, hard solo leveling, needs a pocket healer no PvP, hard to farm gold, stance dance looks kinda clunky, overpopulated class, more macros than mages, higher repair costs.
---
Personally I'll get it up to 70 or 75 where you can craft your blue wand then forget about it until 60.
---
Yes!  I think playing WC3 was partially why I was able to get invested in the lore of vanilla-&gt;WotLK but none of the later content.
---
I deeply thing that something isnt objectively boring. We are all different and we define boredom in different ways. Thanks for the comment anyways
---
Read the Reddit post. I found mine a few months ago and we‚Äôve been hanging out since
---
Played on the private servers and they were all pvp. Gonna level alone w a friend on a pve server this time. Got a lot of shit from the other friends tho :p
---
in the lore: gul'dan and the shadow council covertly operate to pull the strings of the horde and are found out by Orgrim who behead's Blackhand and assumes direct control of the horde
---
in the movie: gul'dan walks around in broad day light casting fel spells and sucks Durotan's (a retcon character) soul out of his body in a mok'gora and then Blackhand is killed by plot armor ssj Lothar
---
All the healing classes level as their dps specs. You can heal all of the dungeons up to ST no problem. You might run into mana issues in ST, but maybe not as a pally with enough spell crit. If you're rolling with a group of coordinated friends and using voice chat, you can probably heal all the dungeons without respeccing. 
---
As a paladin, you can have an awesome hybrid build with prot. You should have no problem fighting enemies in the world, but your dps will suck.
---
I meant "too". Sorry English is not my mother tongue.
---
A raiding guild usually has at least 50-60 raiders. 
---
But first get to 60 and get some gear before you are worrying about raid spots. 
---
If you are on again off again you will probably have a low spot priority, so it's possible you will be left out even when you are online and ready.
---
Dispell for sure. Mana burn. MC off of LM. MC NPCs in AV. Silence. Fear bomb. And moar dots.
---
Ah i did not saw the last part. I will go for stormstrike then, we will surely see

This will help separate the tourists from the folks who will stay a lot faster than if it released in the middle of summer.
---
Scenario; you are lvl 10 and 50xp from ding. You have 3 quests ready to turn in at lvl 8, 10 and 12. Which do you turn in first?
---
Risk of Rain 2 update just dropped this past week. Fugg yeah boi.
---
Generally need any BOE you can get some good gold for. Make exceptions sometimes, like if a warden staff drops and the druid intends to tank end game, just pass it over. They'll remember
---
I do.
---
Is there a way to play right now
---
My guild back in the day made fire resist potions mandatory for rag kills only in the beginning. When your raid has some bwl gear it's not needed anymore.
---
People aren't trying to get a 100% exact repeat of what happened, people are trying to avoid servers with a large population of toxic players.
---
Obviously people do care or it wouldnt be a frequent comment.
---
Priest can mostly wand. You‚Äôll have to slow down by keeping cheetah off. Forget bubble just renew and DoT and wand. Throw out heals if anything goes sideways. Save the mana on priest.
---
Worked in vanilla, works on pservers, not sure about classic.
---
World of MageRogueLockcraft
---
I did that too, and it's "good" to pex and get your lvl 40 mount, but that's it. It's something like 8 gold per hour with skinning. Grinding random mobs in a high level zones at 60 would be more profitable than that tbh.
---
Cba to read your whole comment but they said to remove leveling, not the level cap. Aka, once 60, new content following will also be 60 content.
---
I understand what a bundle is, still qualifies as a mtx I'm not sure what the differentiating factor is
---
Your answer is in your post. People commit crimes everyday, not all of them are caught.
---
nope, claw is bis for resto. lok is bis for holy priest
---
It depends, how close are you and your friend. Good friends, maybe best friends?
---
Seriously, my school starts on the 28th. Thank you Blizzard.
---
It's a bannable offense. The only way they'll catch you in your case would be your ~5 days /played without sleep.
---
It's a risky thing to do.
---
They have a subreddit as well. /r/PantheonMMO/
---
That being said it probably doesn't have as much info as the website. It's still early in development, so I'm not sure how much info is out there other than that it is heavily inspired by ever quest lol.
---
I just put crazy amount of hours into my part-time job schedule so July will be hopefully gone faster. My brain just goes crazy over Classic if I have nothing to do.
---
I guess my question is more so "is this a banable offense?"
---
Just like you can heal dungeons in the wrong spec in healing gear you can dps in healing spec whit dps gear atleast good enough to do some questing or killing some mobs. What you gain from a dps spec is mostly efficiency not the ability to kill something (only talking about pve and not raiding as damage)
---
&gt;if this is against the ToS
---
Obviously.
---
&gt;I know account sharing is not allowed but when I was little I used to share an account with my brother from the same computer and we never got into any kind of trouble
---
Because it was impossible to track, and no magical tool was invented since then.
---
So you're breaking the rules, but there's no way for Blizzard to know it, dw.
---
Roommate
---
Blizzard is certainly testing everything, even stuff past level 40. Sure there is significantly less people testing everything, but they do internal testing and possibly some people have an NDA
---
Yes it is. Pretty hard to get caught though if you‚Äôre on the same Pc. People could report you I guess? Not sure if it‚Äôs a report option even tbh
---
You should be fine finding an off tank role as in a raiding guild. Prob not mtank though
---
This game will crash the stock market
---
For tailoring you will out level zones if you want to keep up the cloth farming, but go for it if that's your fun.
---
For enchanting you just need your blue wand craft at 70 or 75, after that you really don't need enchanting until endgame. Make sure you have enough gold for your mount then do whatever you feel like.
---
I personally won't take skinning because every 2nd person is picking it, it's just basically a 3 second cast for looting again for 2 silver, since you won't be able to sell in AH, you can only vendor. If you find this interesting, go for it, otherwise just skip.
---
Not anymore. Hardware have caught up to games, and hardware is also stagnating.
---
I would say anything past $1500 (not counting accessories) has a massive amount of diminishing returns.
---
But if you run 1080p 60fps you can run classic on a potato $500 build
---
I think the picture looks good...
---
Doubt you‚Äôll get banned since it‚Äôs on the same computer. Only issue is if he lived across the world and IP was way different.
---
I played a hunter from 2004 to 2005. I used a specific addon that worked with the Track Humanoids ability. It both pinged my radar whenever a new player-character humanoid appeared on it, modified the tooltip when I mouse-overed a PC blip to tell me their name, race, and class, AND allowed me to select players by clicking on their radar blips.
---
It was soooo nice for wPvP.
---
Do y'all know if that kind of addon will be available? I failed to find something similar for BfA last year. Makes me think Blizzard squashed those parts of the API.
---
Except nobody knows what those reasons are lol
---
Wish this was the kinda shit I had to worry about in life
---
It's in invite-only beta as servers are currently frequently being restarted for changes and fixes, mostly likely adding back all the decade and a half worth of streamlining and character model management so that loads of people can be in one place without turning into a server-side slideshow.

---
beta has so many bugs i wouldnt mind if they delayed it a bit
---
This is what I suspected but I'm getting mixed answers
---
&gt;people don't trust blizzard to do it well
---
So I've got a couple points against this argument, because I totally understand where it's coming from...I just think it's irrational.
---
1) 1.12 was simply where the devs stopped patching Vanilla and focused their efforts entirely onto Burning Crusade's pre-patch. Every single talent change and new ability added in 2.0 was already under development even as early as patch 1.10...which means that all the class changes and overhauls in 2.0 were made by the legitimate original Vanilla devs, and so was most of TBC in fact.
---
The 2.0 versions of all the classes and talent trees had WAY better class flavor and identity, WAY more interesting mechanics and rotations, and saw an era where almost every single class spec was viable and sought out for raiding. You had Prot Paladins tanking with +spell power and +intellect, with mana as an interesting resource to manage (vs now where mana isn't even a resource unless you want to start healing as Prot). You had Enhancement Shamans wearing +strength +intellect mail armor who functioned almost entirely as a support DPS class...designed around hugely buffing the melee group and being a key player in raids. You had Shadow Priests also acting as a support DPS class; mana batteries for healers and spell DPS. Then you had all sorts of specs like Moonkin, Elemental, Feral, and they were all bringing unique raid buffs and competitive DPS. Even all of the pure classes had extremely strong identities with different specs...Assass Rogue all about poison applications, Combat all about weapons, Subtlety all about striking from stealth and controlling fights. Frost Mage devoted to pure control and burst damage via shatters and novas, Fire for wild damage streaks, Arcane for rotation and managing resources.
---
2.0 was definitely the beginning of a golden age for class design in WoW, and I legitimately struggle to think of any class or spec that wasn't hugely improved in the patch.
---
2) Starting August 24th, WoW will begin to exist as two separate games with two separate playerbase and two separate design visions. That means a WoW Classic dev team is no longer burdened by having to make a game that appeals to the masses. They'd be free to make changes to the game that retail players might dislike, but would be on point for Classic players. For example they could start working towards 2.0 talents and abilities since that was almost universally good, but keep 40 player raids, don't add flying, don't splinter Azeroth by having every player 58+ leave it, etc. They're free to avoid all of the pitfalls from TBC and WotLK that were added to make the game more accessible and casual friendly...but keep all of the great ideas from those expansions.
---
Let people enjoy things
---
NANIATTEBAYO!?
---
They‚Äôre on par. Play what you feel like playing I‚Äôd say, in this case. It‚Äôll depend on the amount of consumable you‚Äôre gonna invest in ;)
---
I believe you're only able to have that you are the legal guardian of and is under the age of 18 play on the same account as you... at least it used to be something like that. Otherwise you get the ban hammer
---
You‚Äôre good. Make sure you keep your played around Joana‚Äôs (4 days, 20~ hrs) to stay under the radar if you cap 60 first
---
I'm look at an orc lock and can't decide on the gender, it's really difficult choice since you can't change it later.
---
Not many games do, nvidia graphics cards do a hell of a job of stretching and fixing things so that they can offer larger resolutions.
---
Honestly you should solo your main and play the alts together. Playing together will work like for a month top. Except of course if both of your lives is about WoW, then disregard my advice.
---
4k doesn't change a thing, prove me wrong
---
You can also fish and gather herbs.
---
Caps locks makes a really good keybind modifier if you remap it to control. Just sayin'
---
I'm very excited to play on a PvP server.  That being said, I'm terrified it will become a Horde-favored server.
---
I forgot about making use of the neutral AH.
---
Also, I suppose if you had two screens and wanted to work on the old insane title, you could use your second account to roll a rogue and pickpocket for the rep (and just mail the turnins to your main character).
---
Don't warriors hit Threat cap if they get too good? On Horde especially?
---
I'm gonna be much slower than joanna cause I'm going warrior but I want my buddy to level me through at least 2 nights of sleep
---
Soulshards are soulbound and used as a reagent for your spells. You can create healthstones to trade and use your soulstone on other players
---
&gt; Otherwise you get the ban hammer
---
But how do they learn?
---
Same
---
This is a good point. They may indeed have some filter like this, to try to ensure a fairer race.
---
A druid will stealth in, pop shadow reflector, grab flag, sprint out and there is nothing you can do about it.
---
There is a reason why rogue and hunters are the best WSG defense. Control galore.
---
10-20 hr a week is not enough to farm and raid. 10-20 hr is basically 3 raid nights.
---
That‚Äôs a tough call. I played a human male and female dwarf rogue, for perspective,  After playing a human it‚Äôs pretty clear gear is designed around the human model. Everything looks right, and this goes for weapons and armor.  Males do have a silly run but with a long enough cape you don‚Äôt notice it often. 
---
Dwarf chest and leg armor is harder to see, but on the female model it seems less truncated and is more naturally scaled. In other words, things are sized to scale just shorter...the male model has that barrel chest aspect and things look compressed and stretched outward imo. That said, if you want big shoulders....
---
I think going human would give you a fresh perspective, but ime people that really love dwarves do treaty wa to play anything else. If this is you and you want something a little different, try female dwarf. They are similar but different and generally rare too.
---
I am in absolutely no rush whatsoever this time around.
---
I am going to take my time just chilling, exploring, crafting and mat farming.  I am done with the gear treadmill and don't need it to enjoy my time in game.
---
If being hopelessly corpse camped for long periods of time bothers you, don‚Äôt roll PvP. I never got annoyed by it, and actually enjoyed the challenge of trying to figure out how to escape. But I‚Äôm also an alt-oholic so if I knew there was no escaping this camp I would just hop on a different character with no sweat off my back.
---
You‚Äôll be good regardless. Even if you no life it with no sleep, Blizzard can‚Äôt prove anything unless you admit it.
---
They could also catch them if one of them is an idiot and talks about it in game, and gets reported by someone else... so don't drink and play in the first 5 days lol.
---
My advice would be to make sure it‚Äôs not 24 hrs a day played, both of you should be offline at least 3 hrs a day for ‚Äúsleep‚Äù
---
Bc if blizzard were to look into it, you‚Äôd want to have the ability to say well no, I did take breaks.
---
Additionally, since reputations between players is a thing in classic/vanilla, be careful to not piss your roommate off and make sure he knows to act as you would in groups.
---
All it does is discourage world pvp by actual pvpers.
---
It really doesn't improve the game the way it's implemented
---
You're completely missing the point. The content IS having an incredibly dangerous world where there is a sense of risk/reward for your actions. You still come off as a pussy because you answer smugly as if there's no difference.
---
One thing I'm most excited about playing as a Rogue on a PvP server is saving fellow Alliance members who are under attack from the Horde.
---
It‚Äôs just interesting Bc I‚Äôve been playing a Druid around this level recently, and I take hella damage in cat form.
---
&gt;because this is what /r/classicwow told them.
---
Don't do what other people tell you to do.  
---
This comment brought to you by /r/classicwow
---
There are people that have done legit 5 day marathons. Someone played Just Dance for almost 6 days straight.
---
Actually, I‚Äôm leveling a mage in retail right now, and I actually find it quite satisfying with the speed to level, and the flow of the questing which is clearly streamlined in a sense. It is not challenging at all, but that makes it kind of a breeze to just go through the areas and progress.
---
No 15inch square monitor -50 dkp!
---
I made a pandaren mage called Pandalf when Mists released
---
Help i cant  read
---
We're also getting all the class changes from day one, changes that almost took 2 years to put in.
---
The game can better by selectively choosing the best parts and avoid leaving mistakes in
---
Because software development is a process that takes time and it clearly wasn't ready for the start of this summer?
---
SW cathedral basement has  leadin for an SM quest in Desolace you can do, gives good xp good rewards (good vendor for warlock). Some neutral quests dotted around desolace and the reclaimers quests from IF.
---
 At lvl 39, theres still loads. Faldirs cove in Arathi, elite alterac quests from hillsbrad, 2 quests in SoS, neutral quests in badlands +1 in Loch Modan (badlands has 4 different small camps with quest givers), Shimmering Flats, some Tanaris quests.
---
Xxsephirothxx
---
It is unavailable because you won't be fast enough to get it.
---
Yeah I could see that being the case in casual guilds.
---
Hit me up when servers are announced, I'm looking to play on an Alliance-favored pvp server.
---
I'm in Canada as well, and I noticed he has a PDF version for sale here: [https://thewowdiary.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders#store](https://thewowdiary.backerkit.com/hosted_preorders#store)
---
But it says Preorder PDF? I'm not sure if that means it's not immediately available?
---
&gt; I wouldn't bother trying BfA on this though, it's got just enough to handle 1.12 as is.
---
Well that pretty much rules out playing Classic on it.
---
How are the PVE servers in Beta in terms of population? Do you guys think PVE servers will be popular? How does world PVP works in PVE servers?
---
Yes like I said there's various vendors but on a fresh server these will be completely bought out and people will have to get them from AH.
---
Useless greens and blues that doesn't sell good on ah can be turned to dust or shards that might sell for more, but it is a gamble. Enchanting is a more lucurative trade you csn invest in for future profit. Extra spirit on your gear makes you level faster though.
---
It getts me 1000% more excited than saving turtles on the beach, thats for sure
---
I think the reality of the situation is that Runecloth and/or Un'Goro Soil/Morrowgrain turn-ins are probably going to be needed whether you complete all quests or not. Spillover rep will help get you closer, but you won‚Äôt necessarily need to go out of your way to complete all quests. Getting exalted by level 40 may not be possible, but perhaps level 47 will be within reach.
---
The idea that we're starting a "new" MMO with 1-2yrs worth of content that will all exist in a single patch, frozen in time, never balanced, never altered...it's really bothersome to me. It's not AT ALL what Vanilla was about.
---
In Nov 2004 when you first installed this game and logged into the character creation screen, were you making your choice based on knowing exactly what race/class/spec combo was going to be the most overpowered and valuable in the final raiding patch of the game? Of course not, no one in the world had even fucking SEEN a WoW raid yet!
---
You chose based purely on fantasy and personal preferences. You loved Warcraft 3's Far Seer and Taurens? Maybe you'll make a Tauren Shaman who can shoot lighting just like that Hero. You loved the Demon Hunter and Blademaster? Maybe a Night Elf or Orc Rogue would feel similar to that style.
---
This is 2004 Blizzard we're talking about here. Masters of game development and balancing.
---
Every single one of us just assumed that whatever we chose that day would eventually be 100% just as useful and viable at the end of the game as everyone else. The Blizzard devs would make sure of it...that's what they do.
---
Classic should be no different and strive for that vision.
---
PSA: as the edgy ateist teenager i was. I made a priest named Boytoucher and it took only 20 mins Before i got permanent banned. Do not use that alias for your hero. Lol
---
And that's why a big chunk of the vanilla experience didn't really have solid wpvp. 
---
Not only is there little incentive to begin with, it punishes you harshly for things you can't control
---
Opening line holds up:
---
"What will Blizzard do next? It's a question we love to ask. Those who have become enslaved by their addictive games. And one we always get wrong."
---
Is there a classic Rogue discord?
---
It's a matter of polygon count, not the engine.
---
It can be annoying but people who do these grinds are also the ones playing extreme hours. 
---
Everquest was grouping all the way to max on server first stuff and you had groups of 6. You just set aside time to play then everyone sleeps. Need to really trust your group tho so no one oversleeps.
---
Orc is better in pvp and pve, yet they were rare compared to u/d rogues in vanilla.
---
I agree with that. Also a bunch of streamers who never played wow at all, coming from shooters and MOBAs.
---
I guess it's impossible to do both?
---
those hyena packs are really weak compared to normal mobs
---
Idiots and twinks
---
BFA is actually quite fun now
---
I feel your pain. I start on the 27th.
---
The se Are great tips - i hadnt even thought about! Thank you so much, now im not as afraid, knowing i can farm as holy, and dont have to respec once a week.
---
And I had No idea fishing was such a gold mine! Will definatly look into that!
---
HAHAHAHAHA

---
Go 72 hours straight on the first round. Log off the account for 6 hours and then do another 48 hours. Repeat the 48/6/48/6 pattern until you hit 60.  
---
Do I think you'll get banned if you're online on your account for 5 days straight with the same IP and computer? No, but avoiding drawing attention to yourself is always a good approach.
---
Nothing much
---
Sure, I watch my dvds on my disc drive instead of buying them again. I burn music for my in-laws to listen to in their car. I make DVDs for my family of video/photo memories from the last year. I‚Äôm sure I could think of a couple more reasons, but I get that you‚Äôre joking too.
---
Anyone have ideas about approaches to picking a server?  I have the feeling that I will be the first person among my friends to play, so I will be picking the server.  I already know the faction we will be, and it will be a PVP server.  
---
On launch day, population levels (low, high, etc.) will probably be meaningless, since populations will grow exponentially over the first few days.
---
I know I will try to avoid the servers that big streamers are on, but other than that I have no real strategy.
---
Is everyone plan just to pick a random one, or is there a smarter approach?
---
Theres no real way to prove it, if its on the same IP id say youre safe, since thats usually the way they catch people, other than people openly admitting it, which i hear happens most often.
---
I would "take the risk" but i really doubt youd be found out unless you wemt around telling people about in Gen chat.
---
Turn on pvp flag and you in the exact same danger as you would be on a pvp server.
---
This is the least true thing I've ever read in my entire life. Ele gets a bit less bad at 40, but virtually everyone I've known stays enhancement until solely farming for pre-bis as a healer.
---
Mmmm yeah give me some more of this
---
You have to be trolling. Excessive camping was absolutely a normal part of the game from day 1. There were always arguments if it was griefing and reportable, but it definitely wasn‚Äôt punishable enough to dissuade people from doing it if they indeed DID punish for camping.
---
What the fuck do you mean, PvE servers were available at vanilla launch.
---
I remember years and years ago, Blizzard accidentally released a bunch of normally restricted names, so people gobbled them up before Blizzard corrected it. I was going to start playing on a new server soon so I reserved a bunch of names on classes I would play,  never ended up playing any of them, but I have Orc, Ogre, Warchief, Undead.
---
I'll probably start in a levling guild with irl frends and friends of friends of friends. Not sure what we'll do later on. Either merge with another guild or break off into other guilds one by one. I'm not shy of joining some other bigger raiding guild while having my alts in the friend guild.
---
I can't remember how potion cooldowns work. Do all potions share a cooldown (e.g. healing pots share cooldowns with swiftness pots, invis pots, etc)? How long is that cooldown?
---
I seem to remember the pvp-vendor healing pots being on a separate cooldown from crafted healing pots, but that may be a false memory.
---
This way students can't just no life it while people with jobs get left behind. Now we both have commitments to keep. Workers could no life if they have the time off and no kids though.
---
Suppression does nothing for shadowbolt, and you probably won‚Äôt be casting any affliction spells on bosses except 1 curse with a long duration. Points are better spent elsewhere.
---
Imagine comparing organsizing a 40 man raid to a click an que raid...
---
Fair enough
---
So get the tap and die set out and fix it, what are you, a scrub?
---
That‚Äôs part of the difference between Retail and Classic, yes; but that isn‚Äôt the concern here.
---
The difference between the 1.12 client and the Classic client is massive compared to the difference between the Classic client and the Retail client.
---
But why bring them? Why not just bring a holy pala or a better holder? Ret palas are just deadweight.
---
Flipping through that reminded me how good gang magazines used to be.  Mystery of the Druids is a real mystery because I'll never play it.
---
I hope some streamers will get brain aneurysm getting ganked every 2 minutes.
---
Camping was normal but people definitely did argue that it was griefing that went against TOS. I never cared enough to look into the subject to see if there was any legitimacy to the claim, but I heard it plenty.
---
It is known.
---
They have powerful sorcerers at work on this very issue. 
---
I'd guess they flag anyone who plays for more than 48 hours straight for suspicious behavior and try to check, but with the same IP it'd take magic or something stupid like playing for 5 days straight to get you caught. Hence the sorcerers toiling away.
---
Remember the good ole days where advertisements weren't everywhere? Me neither.

Over the course of my time playing WoW, Ive probably played about 50/50 on PVE and PVP servers. I hear the argument about casuals who don't have much time to play not wanting to waste their time being ganked, but imo, as someone who wont have massive windows of time to play, I'm choosing PVP because at a certain point after 60, there just isn't much to do that isn't at least a 2 hour commitment (finding group, traveling, actual run, wipes, etc), and being on a PVP servers gives you something to do in shorter periods of time (aside from BGs when they launch).
---
That's largely due to remastered and high resolution texture options though.
---
Does it affect your latency?
---
Ele works fine at 40+ you just have to drink more. No gear? There's plenty of intellect gear while levelling.
---
You are a fucking idiot. You still don't understand. You are logging into a server where everyone is not on the same risk/reward as you. People can opt out of the danger whenever they want.
---
Dude 2 hours is not enough time for a vanilla endgame dungeon lol. Best case scenario it takes 30 minutes to get a group and everyone to arrive at the instance. But it can take more.
---
You wipe once on the 2nd boss and the trash already respawned. Etc etc etc.
---
Overwhelming AF
---
There's something about doing them Now while it's "trivial" and "I'll have to do it again at Launch"... And Yet, I'm an alt-oholic.  But I agree with you to an extent.
---
I found it much more pleasurable to level pserv with Joana's guide, just ticking off the boxes, easy time of it.  Judging my progress on his list rather than how many X I've found yet.
---
The calendar should be already on September with a big red circle
---
Agreed, looks uncomfortable, weird monitor setup.
---
Can't see his PMs

Generally Wotf is an asset mostly against priest because they can‚Äôt recast fear. Against a warlock it is slightly less of an asset because they will probably just double cast fear in anticipation that you‚Äôll wotf asap, which is what happens nearly all the time. Hardiness offers no advantage unless you can be stunned...if you face stuns often it never losses value because its passive...so make spec warriors, all rogues, Grenades...etc...

Man fuck those people who see somebody on their faction in a fight and try to /r/notmyproblem the situation.  Always assist, if you don't it just breeds negativity throughout your faction.

Assist and lose: get to /lol about it in whispers during the run back
---
Assist and win: instant friend
---
Good thing you caught that, buddy. What would we do without you?
---
Sounds like heaven
---
On the beta you can do it if you are grouped with an alt or have a friend or guildie that let you join their group while you log out, other character resets dungeon, you log back in at entrance of a fresh instance.
---
&gt;Man you‚Äôre just an uptight angry man-child aren‚Äôt ya. Go to sleep you slimy little cockroach

The ring she drops is preraid bis for several classes.
---
I hope you posted it 2nd class!
---
You surely missed warcraft 1.
---
:-)
---
thats exactly why i dont want beta access i dont wanna spend so much time leveling a character just to have to do it all over again when classic launches
---
ST is in the level range where paladins get access to BoL. Spellcrit and Illumination won't be relevant until endgame. You can heal pretty much all of Maurodon, Sunken Temple and BRD with Holy Light Rank 1 and Blessing of Light. 
---
Generally  speaking have a intgear and later +healing/int gear and you can heal anything up to UBRS without issue. Paladin heal talents are simply not required for group content. 
---
just make sure that the tank is worst case 3 levels below the endboss of the dungeon. Otherwise you'll struggle like any other healer. 
---
For Sunken Temple specifically I recommend a tank with level 48+ if you want to finish it.
---
 Not sure it will be reflected into classic wow but I played vanilla as Horde. We used to joke alliance was full of kids. I'd just pic which aesthetic or lore you prefer more !
---
Still 2000 is not some massive sum
---
Just get the AV Ram
---
Yo that's OP AF
---
The PvE server is for sure lower population than the PvP server. It's ranked as 'medium' and the PvP server is 'full' but both servers are pretty much dead at the moment
---
You were probably on an unbalanced server or one with a pansy social mindset of live and let live that most followed. I was camped for over an hour on more than one occasion and 10-20 minute camps were quite common. Camps were almost never while they were questing, they were looking for ganks and there was no waiting out their questing in the area as they sat on their mount waiting for your spawn.
---
Having to log off/go to an alt was a very real reality if you didn‚Äôt wanna sit there for a silly amount of time.
---
There was plenty of well populated PVE terms throughout vanilla. I‚Äôm curious how it will shake out this time as a PVE player.
---
I think PVE servers will have good populations but I‚Äôm worried that it will heavily unbalanced towards alliance.
---
Go on wowhead and using the 3d model viewer see how the dungeon and raid sets would look like on both genders. That could help you decide.
---
Really torn on if I should roll a shadow priest or not. I want to raid and pvp endgame and always adored the class, but I don‚Äôt know if it will be hard to get into raids or get geared with a middling dps class. Probably will roll ally. Open to suggestions on race too.
---
Yeah this is what i thought. I look at the video for how to do it on youtube. It seemed to me all you needed raiding vise was to clear BWL in 5 hours. If you could do that it seems very possible to get, even for casuals
---
ret is better then enh
---
why? apart from the farming which can be done solo, the only "hard" thing needed seems to be able to clear BWL.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapcsales/search?q=Keyboard&amp;sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;feature=legacy_search

you could check out /r/mechanicalkeyboards too but theyll all tell you to get a ducky, das, or build your own keyboard.
---
Mutli boxing?
---
About the same chance you have of playing those same hours and being the first HWL/GM.
---
fucking casuals i swear gtfo outta muh classic
---
Mind sharing your report?
---
Would be nice :-)
---
I did, seems like you need to be able to clear BWL and farm.
---
Why not? Seems like you just need to clear BWL and not mind farming.
---
This is perfect, instead of wasting one guy's time I can waste 20 guys' time. Thanks for the advice on who to camp!
---
Warcraft 1 is pre Metzen, our lore and savior.
---
Funny reading that so many years after, thanks for the link :)
---
Exactly what I did in Vanilla. Maining ret in raids, while building all my 3 sets so I can do any roles for dungeons when needed to help friends, and replacing healer when they were sick or missing. I also MTed ZG runs. Went up to several bosses into AQ40 as a ret, and there were arms warriors, at least one balance druid, ferals, and another ret in the raid.
---
Was the best periods of my gaming life. And I'll find a guild where I can experience the same again, this time up to naxx, since we won't be time limited.
---
You either level a mage/hunter to farm for you or you find friends to grind with.
---
Any Tauren.
---
People like wpvp because you can be completely garbage and still get the HKs. It's essentially for stupid people.
---
I‚Äôm not joking - one of the main reason I never want kids is because I‚Äôll never have time to really just shut down and relax for so many years. 
---
I honestly have so much respect for people that can balance life, work, and kids - but that shit isn‚Äôt for me.
---
If I ever have kids - I‚Äôm skipping the first 7 years and adopting a small adult - eager to work and learn.
---
It is
---
As someone who has beta access I understand this completely. I've leveled 4 different characters to 20-30 and that's enough for me. They're throwaway characters as far as I'm concerned and I've tested the things I want to test and set up my UI the way I want it for release. I get no sense of accomplishment playing in the beta because it's not **my** character. People who treat the beta like it's a full release I find weird.
---
At this speecific example It doesnt Matter i think. But usually turno in the lowest level quest first just in case
---
I will again play an undead warrior - as tank. Not usual, but it is fun and looking best IMO. On top, it has useful racial abilities that are forgotten by many people.
---

the big gnome warrior
---
not sure what profession yet - thinking engineering as it seems fun and fits the whole gnome thing
---
MMORPGs are designed to be the complete opposite of "FRESH" that's true. Throwing everything into the bin and starting over is something you would expect from ARPGs who are seasonal by design, or BfA which is basically a ARPG at this point.
---
Because a difference in the damage between a war or hunter using nightfall properly and a retadin using it is smaller than the variance in damage from player skill. (They're doing slightly worse damage, but have slightly better uptime. Whereas if they play to have fun and out dps the pally, their uptime is worse and they end up having a lesser cumulative effect on the raid.) Do you also not bring human mages because they are just a tiny bit worse than gnomes?
---
More importantly, it's boring AF to spam wing clip or slam over and over again to maximize debuff uptime. Whoever is doing this, will probably burn out.
---
Make friends, have them do the killing. It's what being a healer is all about
---
Mages spellpower coefficients literally are 2-3x stronger.
---
You also won‚Äôt grt r12/13 gear h less you play 9 hours/day.
---
The problem is spriest have 2 direct damaging spells, mondflsu and Mb.
---
They‚Äôre both easily interrupted.
---
They get destroyed by CS.
---
10/10 name tho
---
PvP server is for stupid people who lack character IRL and killing low level players is the closest fulfillment they can get in their low-tier existence ^ ^
---
The sideways PC on the right is getting to me as well.
---
Cluttered
---
DotA 2
---
No, it's largely due to the engine being written and optimized for 2018 and not 2004. The minimum specs for Classic are basically the minimum specs for the last 2-3 expansions.
---
Okay. Most of the games he listed aren‚Äôt FPS tho
---
No confirmation yet.
---
As someone who doesn't get much time to play, this can be a huge pain and is most of the reason I'm rolling PvE. Flying all the way from Ashenvale to Hillsbrad to start questing and finding out that Tarren Mill is under Alliance control is just such a huge waste of time for someone that only gets a few hours to play a week.
---
Tauren shaman or druid. Their culture being based upon native americans goes very well with either class.
---
I got to take 3 weeks off from work, starting at launch date, ready to hermit my days away! So glad I got my damn schooldays waaay behind me!
---
lol i stilll remember that guys face on the ad. 
---
man...thats a blast from the past
---
I have beta but haven‚Äôt played for 2 weeks. I‚Äôve leveled a rogue and hunter to 30, practiced 1-20 on 2 other hunters, and just don‚Äôt feel like playing anymore until the live game comes up. It‚Äôs nice to jump on and spend a few hours grinding, but I don‚Äôt have any friends to experience it with.. nobody else got the beta. 
---
When classic launches on August 26th (for me) it will be a different story. I already have a 6 real life friends and 10 online friends coming back to the game and my old mythic guild of 40+ is preparing for classic.
---
What a very strange and ignorant thing for you to white knight someone over.
---
Using Print Screen is not only faster and easier than adding a whole second device into the mix, but it actually saves the picture in the monitor's resolution. Which, when your whole post is about resolution, *is kinda relevant.*
---
Fucking awesome.
---
Thanks for the well thought out and tested response man! I appreciate it.
---
How do the debuff limits work? Does the guild decide what 16 are going on the boss, or is there a priority system built into the game that ranks debuffs?
---
What happens if there are 16 on a boss and someone attempts a 17th debuff? Does this overwrite another, or simply not apply?
---
I bought a shitload if gold in vanilla and tbc. People like to talk shit, but I make good money and it would take me 40+ hours to farm the amount of gold i could afford with one hour's pay. I value time more than money, so it's an easy decision.
---
Why people have never understood this, I don't get.
---
Well that kinda makes sense. Unless you're a high profile content creator why would they invite people who don't play and support their game? 
---
WoW has had over 100 million players over the years, imagine the black market on beta accounts if they started inviting people randomly from that pool.

Played a gnome mage for years during Classic. For some reason being really small made the world feel larger to me. I was just one tiny little gnome in this vast giant world. I personally don't like to be zoomed out all the way because it just makes the game seem more "game-like". If you've never played a gnome or dwarf, I highly recommend it to get this experience.
---
Haha that would require a trip back home and sifting through moms attic
---
for anyone who doesn't want to sift through the whole thing, the part about wow starts on page 70
---
I'm pretty sure Duke is a restricted name, I've tried just about every variation of my username I could think of and none of them work, even on pservers. I've tried:
---
Dukeofpizza
---
Dukeofpiza
---
Dukeofpizzaz
---
Dukeovpizza

ect, with no luck

How much griefing can we expect on a non streamer pvp server?

Same could be said about you
---
Sounds good to me! Godspeed and enjoy!
---
Judging from numbers on private servers most people will play either mage og war. Just pick what appeals to you the most as both classes will face the same amount of competition to get into groups/guilds/raids
---
I‚Äôm out of town, but I‚Äôll log in tomorrow and let you know. I guess I might have used an alt code? I can‚Äôt really remember now.

Thank you but I never played it, just a friend.

I don't know if he was bragging or what, but he told me that when he was multi-boxing he made everybody lag !

When you dont want to group and just relax by yourself is when you hop on your mage alt.

I agree.  I would even go as far as skinning/mining until 60, and just sell everything on the AH. Enchanting is a huge gold sink

Because Retail 8.2 just launched and they aren‚Äôt going to release Classic around the same time to compete with it. 
---
Classic Phases and Retail expansions and content patches will be staggered around eachother and around other competing game releases.
---
If you don't say Undead Rogue you are wrong.
---
My guild killed most of naxx while sporting many "meme" specs in the raid. Sure we never killed 4HM but seeing as the vast majority of the playerbase never even stepped foot into that raid, I think we did pretty good for ourselves.
---
As a paladin I would go a hybrid holy / ret spec. It helps. Instead of going Holy/prot. Noone is gonna babysit your talents anyways.
---
Not a chance. Maybe for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to pay people to funnel you shit but otherwise it‚Äôs not happening.
---
I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôre blowing multiboxings impact way out of proportion. It isn‚Äôt that big of a deal, it‚Äôs not cheating. You aren‚Äôt botting, blizzard has come out and said multiple times it isn‚Äôt cheating. Yes it‚Äôs shitty when a mutliboxer camps you. But get over yourself by thinking it will ruin the game like you claim.
---
Did you take the picture with a kinetoscope?
---
More serious premades usually don't bring a single spriest but 1 ele. Spriest shines in 1v1, in group settings not so much.
---
You're right, I should have said almost all of them were.
---
Sick setup man! Although I gotta say I used to do multiple monitor setup but now I just straight up prefer one super nice big ass monitor over 2-3 monitors. Either way looking forward to tearing up some Classic along side people like you.
---
Which is why rogues guard the flag.
---
Your guess is as good as your mom's.
---
Are there addons for enhanced graphics we can use for when classic comes out? Not that its a must but could be nice.
---
For PVE priest
---
I like this aspect of the game. 
---
It teaches you sympathy - so when you‚Äôre capped - and you hear about this - you can stop it. 
---
I love the notoriety vs fame aspect of PvP servers.
---
You can be well known for being an arse - or you can be the hero.
---
I‚Äôd take getting ganked by a level 60 rogue 20 times over - just to see a friendly hunter cut him down right in front of me.
---
I‚Äôll be doing my fair share of arse-ry and heroism. 
---
I‚Äôd like to be known as the one to be feared by the enemy a and the one to call on by the ally.
---
It makes you feel like a huge asset - as if you are an important role for your faction - almost like the heroes (arthas, tyrande) in WC3.
---
I remember in WotLK there was a rogue that would gank all over the world - but most usually in STV - as this was the most convenient place to level.
---
Every week or so, you‚Äôd hear about him stirring shit up - they lowbies in the guild would call for help - so 3 of us level 80s would make haste - and tear apart grom‚Äôgol to force him to come out of hiding.
---
He was elusive as ever - we‚Äôd split up in hopes of getting him - but he‚Äôd take one of us out regularly. 
---
It gave this real sense of being vulnerable in a jungle - but it gave this sense of power and pride, too.
---
The exceptions seem to only be people that were added to the Friends and Family list. If you're not on that list, like most of the people in this sub, then it seems like you have to have active game time to be eligible for a beta invite.
---
Yeah druids are godly in PvP. Not quite as overpowered as in BC, but they‚Äôre so damn slippery.
---
They wanted a min max PvE spec for a resto Shaman that goes deep enough for improved  weapon totems. A resto Shaman will never melee swing in a raid, but they might get lucky and Dodge an attack from a loose mob or have enough armor to survive a to k of a sartura whirlwind.
---
First of all, they aren‚Äôt the original graphics so they didn‚Äôt ‚Äúage like fine wine.‚Äù They were updated continually over the years. Second, that‚Äôs not 4K for a couple reasons stated in the other comments. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying the game still tho. Happy for you.
---
Finally, a voice of reason. It's like all the elitists migrated to here over from retail.
---
I plan on trying to get most of my work and projects wrapped up the week before release. I can start "research" into my next project. Not my proudest moment
---
I mean every race who has warlocks turn a blind eye to them, including Alliance
---
Holy priest and did actually open world really well in their raid heal spec. Shaman and paladin are pretty damn slow though.
---
It is a Thorium Brotherhood reward so like probably 90% of the TB stuff it won't be in the game until BWL.
---
Being a healer is all about being social because you aren't particularly effective by yourself, but you make any combination of dps/tanks 10x more effective by being able to keep them alive.  This is by design.
---
That said, you can put on dps gear and farm in the world okay.  A lot of people run hybrid specs at end game like 30/0/21 shamans or 24/0/27 druids because they heal pretty well (raids will still take you in many cases) and can farm on their own as long as they have water.
---
Paladins need 21 points in holy to be effective enough healers.  That means you could in theory go 21/0/30 in order to be able to farm.  However, there are a few "nice to have" things in holy after that first 21 points, and you'd be missing out on kings.  With enough strength plate and a wicked 2h, you can still be full holy and do decent dmg.  2H weirdly don't have much of a place in raids, so paladins can pretty easily pick one up that is about to be DE'd for little to no DKP.
---
You will have no issues soloing in the world as a holy paladin, but it will take longer to kill each mob.  That is true for hybrids in general, but exacerbated by speccing to heal.  If you want to make money, I strongly recommend gathering professions (herb specifically, but also mining is good).
---
Upscaled 4k with AA looks better than 1080p.
---
Yea, I have no one to play with so my motivational drive is small. Have like 20 people coming for live that I know IRL and online so it'll be a blast.
---
I have no idea what I was talking about with the spell crit. Especially when I was assuming he wasn't even in holy build. Serious brain fart there.
---
I was just saying that ST was the line I had back in the day where if you were healing offspec with a random pug, it didn't always work out. You needed a decent tank and to actually cc. I guess you can wipe in the deadmines if your group sucks, but usually it took something going pretty wrong. I'm also definitely remembering it as way more difficult to coordinate with PuGs because there were no markers back then.
---
Hey there fellow Mac User. 
---
I play on a MacBook Air from 2017 and I was able to push my graphics to ultra high and had zero lag even when we got to the end and all the layers were merged together. It's really why I'm so excited to play classic, my little potato of a computer will get to really show off all the graphics and not overheat or lag out. Next Stress Test I plan on running my computer harder to see how long I can push it and write down my findings, but good luck to you!
---
Man, those weather effects. I don't remember the last time I saw an actual *rainstorm* in WoW.

You can see Westfall lol. I mean aside from the fact SW looks different than the one in wow. It's still kinda close.

This is exactly the case. However it is a race and just because you are capable of clearing the content doesn't mean you will do it in time.
---
Not everyone has a 2-3 hour limiter
---
Exactly. I loved playing and made my fair share of hunter bug reports, but now it‚Äôs just my sandbox environment to test/explore stuff while I wait for the live game.
---
What other profession are you planning to do? The general consensus is that herb / alch is more profitable than skinning / lw. That being said there are a few pieces of gear that are nice to have from LW if you don't plan on raiding that frequently. Don't forget, you can always switch your professions or make alts to fill out other professions you do not want to rely on others for.

---
Because a lot of people on here are ~~unique, beautiful snowflakes~~ 30 year old boomers who want Classic to be something other than what it is. Either they have forgotten how unforgiving the community can be when it comes to these specs or they're simply just out of touch and think that every guild will do a hop and a skip at the opportunity to carry someone through content and shower them in undesired epics that were 'clearly made for their spec'.

How do zones/quests work in Classic? If I look at the map and decide to head to a zone level range that would work for me, will I find quests there when I enter the zone? Or do I need quests to bring me to the zone to unlock the zone for me?

Pyroclasm is hot garbage. It‚Äôs 26%/#of ticks. You‚Äôll rarely see a stun from it, it‚Äôs just a waste of 2 talent points, or 4 if you‚Äôre just getting the 2 above for it.
---
So I‚Äôm actually not that worried about the rotation complexity, my planned classes are: 
---
Paladin tank, this will be the most complex and who I will mainly focus on during dungeons, he‚Äôll mainly auto attack during quests until I do big aoe pulls later on. 
---
Priest: will mainly wand other than mind blast, will be the healer
---
Mage/warlock/hunter: corruption/agony if I ever bother with agony until later on, will he bound to a key that mirrors serpent sting, and then frostbolt and shadow bolt will be on the same bind with aimedshot on the hunter. Multishot will cause the casters to use their primary spell too.
---
Classic rotationally is extremely simple, this is how I‚Äôll start out and make it more complex as situations occur.
---
Well that made the decision much easier for me.
---
I don't think there's any actual difference between Horde and Alliance communities as a whole. Everything you'll hear is just someone's biased perception. 
---
IMO in reality, the age/job/friendliness/whatever are evenly distributed across both factions.
---
There might however be larger differences on a specific server, but it's random.
---
Leave your main two monitors close - and extend those other ones further back - so you don‚Äôt have to crane your neck to look up.
---
Looks good though, very clean.
---
The only reason people didn't do it is because they didn't want to. Totem twisting sucks as resto. I've done it on PS and it's why I'm not rolling a Shaman.
---
I should have done the same. I was in undergrad during vanilla and now classic releases when I decide to go to grad school. At least my wife is understanding.. I hope..
---
Despite its canon flaws, I still love the movie and sincerely hope we get more.
---
Yeah, I will be ganked so much. It's going to be breathtaking!
---
Triple monitors is probably the most you can justify from a utility perspective, and only if you have them extending your display.
---
You not only have them positioned in utterly random spots (wtf is the one way up high for??), but they are showing screen 1 so there's no purpose to them.
---
The reason people are making fun of you is because I'm sure you took this and showed everyone because you were proud of it and thought it was a sight to behold, but I hate to be the reality check: it's horrendous.
---
No, it means all elves are troll-like.
---
You can describe a dog as wolf-like.
---
You can't really describe a wolf as dog-like.
---
Hell yeh brother
---
Simpson‚Äôs and futurama have done crossovers and it was hilarious. Bart was causing the end of the word accidentally.
---
This is such a strange post.
---
If you don't like it, go roll on a PvE server, no one cares.
---
A professional reposter, yeah. This guide is like 4 years old at this point.
---
Let's say Im a fresh Level 60 warrior in classic, what dungeons from the previous Levels do you think I could Farm Solo?
---
There‚Äôs a list available in the data they put up on the cdn, check wow tools and search for the profanity/restricted names in the most recent 1.13 files.
---
There won't be too much raiding opportunity for you as a shadow priest. This is because of the debuff limit. I'm sure you will still find a raid on occasion or even better if your guild is casual raiding and doesn't min max. 
---
But, for almost guaranteed raid access, you can always respec for 50gold everytime you need to heal. It is expensive, but the option is there.
---
And here's [Ironforge](https://imgur.com/a/HoaR3l3):)
---
Not a single panda is sexualized in the least. They all wear full clothing except for a few male pandaren who are shirtless. And they aren‚Äôt big tittied unless your experience with them is porn.
---
Also if you look the bottom is angled.  A print screen would have a level bottom unless he purposefully tilted it.
---
Yeah that's different. We're not talking about people who are always in
---
Yeah, Tauren have some kind of spiritual symbolism and the artwork was very generic Native American inspired. I think in many ways they kind of overdid the "Indigenousness" of it.

Except you can... Wolves have dog like features and Dogs have wolf like features.
---
Same with Elves and Trolls.
---
Any race will do for non-hardcore players. 
---
I believe at least one spriest is typically taken - but considering priest are quite popular - id imagines there are a lot that are sick of healing - so competition is high.
---
Race in PvE is min-maxing.
---
In PvP it can be quite important - as it is life or death.
---
Lol lots of people talking shit out of jealousy. Why do you people care how many monitors he/she has? If it's what they want, who cares. Sweet setup dude.
---
Been putting in the hours with my SO constantly warning that August 27 - October is WoW time.
---
I am more concerned when things don't go as planned or there are extra mechanics like AOE silence in Mara or stun in SM, or other things like agro drops and CCs. Just something to keep in mind when choosing the dungeon to grind.
---
It wasn't in 2005 either. [Average age of Vanilla players was 28](http://www.nickyee.com/daedalus/archives/001365.php).

Aye screenshot might have been more known because our phone cameras sucked dick.  Now people are confused because it seems ok to use their phone camera for everything.
---
I'm sure some dude was doing polaroid screenshots back in the day though lol.

It runs pretty well actually, the amount of power needed to run Classic is much less than BFA.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uA1Hi9AKZo
---
Some benchmarks including mid-ranged 10 year old computers.
---
Next time name it Daycare :)
---
Gnomes?
---
Its still so much less resource intensive.  I get ~150 FPS in BfA, I was getting over 400 FPS consistently during the stress test.
---
It may be on a modern client, but its using old assets as far as I'm aware, and its not hard for any modern hardware to absolutely smash.

This is the optimal PvE resto/enhancement totem twister spec. You can put points into restorative totems if for some reason you need 3 MP5.
---
Don't ever put points into Healing Way, it's a total noob trap.
---
Are you 5? Because you sound like a 5 year old going Nuh-uh!
---
It's blizzlike to have them, they were in real vanilla.
---
I don't know how your chrome book compares but this guy did a bunch of benchmarks and got it to run decently on some decade old equipment, looks like classic runs better than 1.12 did. 
---
Make it Paladin specific then
---
Find a single piece of literature that has ever described a wolf as "dog-like". You can't.
---
Oh yeah, we had weather didn't we?
---
I remember when they took it out
---
Peoble stick more to the character and no lol noobs pwn gtg etc in chat.
---
It is way more fun running around barrens, telling udeads to get back where they come from and that they took our mobs mon.
---
Old vanilla player here.
---
You will be able to get into most zones whenever you want. There are some quest chains that will take you to other zones and continue the chain there. However, there will be zone specific little quests that will be available there too.
---
Find a rule that says we can‚Äôt. Your the one making the outlandish ridiculous rule, so you have the burden of proof.
---
Blizzard says its not cheating because it makes them money. Simple as that. And again, this isnt because of some sort of impact it has on me. You have an advantage because you pay more. You are stronger in wpvp than you should be, you are clearing content solo that you shouldnt be able too, you are farming more gold than people who just pay a sub, you are skipping game mechanics completely like the social aspect of the game that is a core philosophie of vanilla, you are skipping the whole rolling for loot mechanic because everything that drops is for you, you ruin other peoples immersion when they see you out in the world with your little bots following you (not literally bots just in case you're gonna nitpick this). All of this might have very little impact on others like you say, but it has a big impact on you. This is like the story of that banker who made millipns by taking a few cents from a bunch of bank accounts till he got caught. His actions had probably zero impact on anyone involved, but it had a big fucking impact on himself.
---
Spouse means gnome? 
---
Who knew
---
I'm not saying you can't, just that you're an idiot if you do.
---
Yeah, going to 5box a 5 man team from classic launch.
---
Zug Zug.
---
I should probably watch this movie at some point.
---
You sound like a very metrosexual orc.
---
If you wanna go back to say... WoD. It's min spec was 2 gigs of ram and at least an intel HD3000 and an AMD Phenom 8750.
---
The broadwell GT1 is on average 20% faster than an HD3000, and the humble Celeron 3205U goes toe to toe with the Phenom 8750 in single thread perf.
---
As with the intel min spec, the Core 2 Duo E6600, overall performance is about on par.
---
In that case your a dumbass and an asshole. The double whammy where no one likes you.
---
D-vitamin pills and your good to go, also working out/being in movement a few hours every day helps ;)
---
You can use a shader.
---
Loaded down with tools, and handy enough to use them?
---
Nice. Granted I have a laptop and a wireless Logitech mouse. So anything will look nice...
---
AOE leveling is possible starting at the farm in Arathi (all melee with fast swing timers). The number you can pull at once is determined by gear.
---
Shoutout to that day in Legion that someone disabled the forbidden names list.
---
What level do locks get summon?
---
Found Garrosh's reddit account.
---
Nice, I might do a larger monitor for main screen and then drop a few others when I move houses. Thanks boss, looking foward to doing the same ! ;)
---
You still have 60 days :)
---
You could make a connection like that to literally any name.
---
You learn LB rank 7 at level 38 and at level 39 you have enough talent points to go 5/5 Lightning Mastery. So at the earliest you can make the switch to ele at level 39.
---
I'm 26, and the PC is a newly built, about 4k cost PC. I just like being around money.. you know?
---
I'd rather be an asshole than an idiot.
---
More importantly no stupid blood elves
---
Ele is a lot stronger than you think. I invite you to level a Shaman and see for yourself.
---
Wow you don‚Äôt even know the word dumbass.
---
I pity you.
---
Well I guess I'm rolling Night Elf then.
---
Sure, good point. I will be doing further adjustments, I'm not really gaming much yet. So I will micro manage the monitors more as classic launches. Thank you though :)
---
You only use the mace for threat heavy fights like Vael.  Our Feral Druid would bring two to an MC+BWL night each week and he was fine.  Usually took him less than an hour to farm them across a week.  Definitely not the most grueling thing, everyone farms something anway.
---
Through an addon? Not sure what you mean by a shader.
---
Multibox 5 destro warlocks or 5 demonology warlocks. You could solo any dungeon. Destro aoe isn‚Äôt really viable tell level 31 when you can get the 26% stunt chance from rain of fire but then x5 perma stun lock and daze on targets? I‚Äôd be curious. Maybe if you want throw in a mage and use the mage as your main box to control the mobs and to keep them isolated. But I imagine 5 voidwalkers with good pet control can do that.. I am theory crafting here FYI this may not work.
---
why do you check every day? this is pathetic. And this is coming from a basement dwelling WoW nerd.
---
You left out Twitch! You can level your class while watching someone else level their more interesting class. üòÜ
---
Lots.  Seriously.  The non-streamer aspect is not a factor when it comes to griefing.
---
Lower level dungeons - like SM or Stockades are always decent.
---
You aren‚Äôt great at soloing unless you are very well geared. 
---
One of your best farms is with healers in dungeons.
---
Righteous orb farming, and I think some diremaul dungeons are great for warrior/healer.
---
But you have to be social and learn to split your earnings evenly.
---
And you should return the favour to that healer - any time you get into a dungeon or a raid and there is a missing healer spot - he should be your first contact.
---
Shew...$50 
---
Worth?
---
Those who give warnings like this that "PvP will waste time" shouldn't roll on a PvP server.
---
The fun part is spending 5 hours killing and being killed.  The wasted part is endless grinding fucking NPC boars because you need to level...
---
I think I‚Äôm going dwarf warrior over human just because of that reason. I‚Äôve never leveled a dwarf aside from the dwarf hunter I made during my temporary trial in tbc and I‚Äôm super excited.
---
awesome!  thanks much!
---
Yeah, I get that you have a difference of oppinion on the way monitors should stand. But ehh, for example. The place in which I built my little computer den has a finite amount of room to set up monitors. Therefore its up there and no where else(because there is no other room at the moment). That top Monitor will be used for browsing the internet, while I multibox/stream/misc on the rest of the monitors.   
---
Have a good day!
---
Honestly, save yourself 2 hours and don't. It was awful
---
Their*
---
Shades are "tweaks" to your game's contrast, brightness and other settings through being injected into the files. You download a shader pack, place it in your directory and then get it to work.

I hope vsync works in the release of classic.
---
or he just /rolled a 74 because thats so hard to believe.
---
People act like leveling a Warrior is worse than child birth but it's not so bad.
---
In my personal opinion, on a fresh launch where you don't have any money for gear upgrades while leveling rogue actually feels like the runt of the litter, not warrior.
---
Doesnt classic go live in August?
---
Btw, Dog and Wolf is a bad comparison since it‚Äôs more closer to Humans and Monkeys/apes. If you say someone looks like an ape or monkey it‚Äôs an insult just like it is in WoW for Trolls and Elves to be told they look like the other.
---
Denying people the option of starting on "full" servers should only be accompanied by free unlimited character transfers from the server, allowing friends to stick together.
---
Sure but there's no point in buying something you don't need, you'd be better off investing in better peripherals
---
Major minor?
---
The multi dotting depends on your tank. Just ease into it little by little and make sure he's keeping threat. If he loses it, be ready to jockey the mob with fear/CoR.

I‚Äôd never really considered orc female but I saw a recent Savix video and they looked pretty cool. Like Klingon females.

Even if you have consumes left, they'll just be on cooldown.  Congratulations on spending 3g to extend the fight though.
---
Yeah, well. The world will be like that, I've cut contact with so many "friends", only for the fact that people are actually very jealous of nature, and will do a lot to destroy your creations in envy.   
---
More ghetto term would be haters gon hate.

Thank you though, bless you ! ;)

Well thats the entire point of the post, hes a god.

Thanks g!

You can rock up to any zone your level and start questing. 
---
There is no pre-requisite outside of level requirement to get a zones quests.
---
Some zones may have quest chains from other zones that lead to unlock a main storyline - but these are typically forced quest, regardless. 
---
(I believe Westfall quests unlock red ridge main questline with mayor soloman)
---
Why wouldn't it be worth it for warlocks? 
---
The faster cast time on the mount alone makes it the best mount regardless of class.
---
Potions share a 2 minute cooldown. Pop a swiftenss pot and you won't be able to use health or mana pots for 2 minutes, etc.
---
There are other consumables, dark runes, etc that don't share a cooldown, but potions trigger the 2 minute potion CD.
---
Why is this relevant today except for the obvious karma grab?
---
Much better, I suppose the 1440p is supported right out of the box?
---
Back in the 80s and 90sn Nintendo Power Magazine had a monthly high score content and they asked readers to send in photos of their TVs with the score visable.  They even had tutorials in the magazine to help take as good of pictures as possible.

Yeah idk for some reason I thought he wanted to raid as dps so you‚Äôre perfectly right.

4 monitors to use auto attack. Gotta love capitalism :D

Personally my plan as a priest is to do tailoring/enchanting to get the wand at 5. Then drop ench for herbalism. Once I get tailoring high enough to craft truefaith vestments, I'll drop it for alchemy.
---
Both are A tier choices for endgame. Priest for heals and Warrior Tank/dps. If you‚Äôre rolling ally then pick up dwarf priest for fear ward.
---
And wow doesnt even have 4k textures to begin with.
---
Not much. 
---
Ganked = fairly common - typically you get killed once or twice and they leave. 
---
Griefing = very rare - occurs when you are repeatedly camped and, essentially, prevented from doing a task. 
---
Ganking common. 
---
Griefing rare.
---
That‚Äôs what you accept when you become a healer. Either level one and do world content with your wheelchair buddy, or you level an alt for it.
---
Jesus christ these posts are pure cringe.
---
I was going to say the same to you. You never played and are now making shit up
---
I'd argue it has more tondonwithbscreen color quality but it doesnt look bad for sure.  Thing is, WoWs textures and models are from the 480p era .
---
Clear BWL, farm thousands of drops off bugs, complete a series of quests requiring your entire guild to help in fighting multiple raid bosses, go back and clear half the raids in the game, etc. 
---
It's the most involved questline in vanilla, needs an entire guild to be involved, takes dozens of hours, and is a race against time. If you aren't the first to complete the chain, you have 10 hours to ring the gong before the mount is no longer available. 
---
It's difficult for hardcore guilds to get and likely impossible for a casual one.
---
I was
---
Yeah that's what I figured.. 
---
Considering i might get 15-20hrs/week playtime, would I enjoy DPS warrior or healing more? Or rather, which would you choose and why?
---
There's no such thing as wPvP in WoW, there's just ganking. It's always some idiot who attacks you while you are at half hp and fighting a monster or a high level or a group of players who can easily kill you without facing any risks.
---
It can be fun when people get fed up and create their own group of players to fight the gankers, but that rarely happens so it does not save the overall wPvP experience. I would still keep playing in PvP server though, because I like to suffer.
---
The movie predates the Old Horde invasion of Stormwind and also predates when Orgrim killed Blackhand after most of Stormwind had been taken and didn't even make the first siege on the keep. Also, the first war was not the the Alliance, it was Stormwind alone.
---
Literally makes 0 difference in this situation. You don't outlevel a quest until you're &gt; 5 levels from the quest level.
---
So that level 8 quest (Remember, level you get it is not the level of the quest --- A Favor for Evershine, avaialble at level 2, is a level 8 quest, for example --- ) will give the full 525xp from level 2 until you ding 14. Do it at level 2 or 13, still 525xp.
---
No, a scattered few self-flaggers does not create the same emergent content as an entire flagged server.
---
As some ppl mentioned most of the pre 60 dungeons are healable in a "wrong" spec as long as you have proper gear and know what you are doing. 
---
It is difficult for Paladin healer even in DPS gear. Other healers actually can be OK, not too bad.
---
Join a discord for horde players and organise with them.
---
And example for oceanic servers is a moderator or owner of a channel deciding which server they‚Äôll go to.
---
They did this with the stress test and I ran into a lot of oceanic players - all whom agree that it was because of the discord.
---
Why is there snow in Stranglethorn
---
Always turn in the lowest level quests first to avoid losing XP.
---
Right. I'm hoping to do more then auto attack though :P Since multi boxing would require you to use maybe more then 10x keybinds for a 5 man group.  We all love capitalism, also love the basic human individual power to achieve anything with the right amount of mindset or determinism. =D
---
&gt;What will Blizzard do next? It's a question we love to ask.
---
Oh how times have changed...
---
It all comes down to gear. Get a DPS set and solo questing shouldn't be a problem as holy.

you have to deliver soils from ungoro, that can bring you lots of rep with darnasuss.
---
It does seem like the way to go. Let the "masses" find bugs in the main systems (combat, crafting, etc...), and do concentrated internal testing on raids to make they work as intended.
---
They could let beta players test raids. What would they get, like 2-3 raids going? It's not enough benefit to remove 100s players from testing general issues, and put them in 2-3 groups testing a few raid bosses.
---
ye, its just my recommendation.
---
Chronicles are the best to learn the mythos quickly no doubt.
---
I cant even count how many times i read Chronicles vol 3 because of the Scourge lore... at some point i literally just skipped to when lordaeron scourge-lore begins and read only that section several times until i wanted to read something else. :D
---
(From the point when Lich King arrived to Northrend and began his conquest - until lordaeron was destroyed and arthas became the lich king.)
---
I should probably buy the Arthas-book itself... but i havent ordered new books in years.
---
Bro, why the hell do you have so many monitors?
---
**"Buy Food"**
---
I agree with this answer. SM Ruin keeps you more versatile. You don't have to sacrifice your pet to stay optimal, and you get additional abilities that can help solo farming at 60.
---
He said the best part of WoW, I know sometimes it feels like WoW = life, but it's not.

What for do you need this many monitors? I see that everyone is digging that wallpaper too, that‚Äôs great

Use them on people? No.... that's not what they are for. You use them to make health stones, and those can be traded to people.

What? No.

King Llane dies at the Dark Portal in the movie. He should have died in Stormwind during the siege.
---
Lothar kills Blackhand in the movie, it should have been Orgrim.
---
The movie was just plain wrong on so many levels.
---
I get what you're saying, but I've never heard of a Priest being first 60 on any server, live or private.  I've never even heard of a Priest beating all Mages to 60 on any server.
---
Furthermore, any Mage who is going to single target mobs will not have to stop and drink every 2-3 kills.  Frostbite/Shatter leads to a lot of crits and you'll go through about 5-7 kills before you need to drink.  Frostbolt and Frost Nova are very cheap, and since you're going to be killing single targets you can use Fire Blast instead of Cone of Cold to do your shatter combos.

Yeah as a lot of ppl and guides pointed out Enh is very boring in Raid PVE. Your highest priority is totem twisting that takes most of your mana. The rest of the time you are literally auto attacking while keeping the rest of the totems up. I mean it is better than Mage frost bolt spam but at least mages have a better future rotation after MC.
---
Also Enh like any hybrid requires a TON of consumables to accomplish anything outside of their "healing" role. 
---
All in All I strongly believe Vanilla content will be trivial for the most part and most of raids will be full of weird and PVP specs.
---
it was not that bad
---
Yeah, people don't realize how similar discipline priests and holy priests are.

This is your discipline build

Vs
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMusV0oZfhtcc0Vx
---
There's even an argument to be made that mental strength is better than spiritual healing. Meaning the best healing spec is actually 26/25.
---
Discipline smites don't even hit that much harder, because holy gets basically 100 extra spell damage from spirit when fully geared and raid buffed. Discipline smites just crit more often.
---
Wow, that is a wonderfully broken, unintended consequence of paying for game time with tokens purchased from in-game currency.
---
I believe Blizz has stated tokens for game time will not be available in Classic. Likely, this will limit multi-boxers. Also, without phasing - and assuming layering isn't broken - the gold making aspect should also be limited.
---
It would still be great to have something physically preventing people from multi-boxing. I'm sure there's unintended consequences there to.

I plan to be eternally poor.

So I really want to play classic w/ a raiding guild, but feel bad about live because I'm the healing lead and best healer in the guild.  How are folks balancing maintaining their relationships with their live guilds but also moving over to classic?  If half of our guild goes to classic, we really aren't going to be able to raid in live.

I've seen people in 2019 using right click to copy/paste still too.
---
If you don't care about looks, Dwarf priest is by far the strongest option for any priest including Horde. The fear ward is great in PVE.
---
As to Raids Shadow priest goes OOM very fast so be ready to farm for a lot of consumables if you don't want to wand half the time. 
---
It is difficult to predict the Raid compositions as I believe Vanilla content will be trivial enough for just random specs to still do the job.
---
Also yes.

Thanks man helped a lot

I have a few questions all related to the same thing.
---
How **difficult** is stance dancing as a prot warrior and how **important** is stance dancing as a prot warrior?
---
I'm aware you need to stance dance for fears but outside of that how important is it? Do I need to use mocking blow and thunderclap in 5 man dungeons? 
---
I love tanking but I'm intimidated by these concepts.
---
we are going to have a twister shaman in melee group 2 as well for them. He will be the guy wanting to soak ele gear. So he will be healing and twisting.
---
I'm not saying the movie is accurate, I'm simply saying the first war ended with Stormwind being taken and Orgrim as Warchief and neither of these things happened.
---
I think they didn't want it to compete too much with the 8.2 patch
---
Once the new raid is out and cleared they will probably make the beta relevent again
---
Orc is best, undead is viable.
---
It‚Äôs not strange at all, seduction soulfire has been a meme for ages.
---
And I'm simply saying that they should have happened in the movie, not some pro-Human rewrite that doesn't follow the history at all.
---
Forgot about mind soothe, so useful, very sad when they removed it.
---
Yep.  I was getting over 500 fps on classic settings with a 560 gtx during the stress.  You could run this game on a potato
---
First 60 was a Human Warlock and it was just the best thing ever. The new World to explore + the Warlock and Human lore, the quests/dungeons/raids/professions and meeting other players made it immersive af. Aug 27th can‚Äôt come soon enough.
---
We will know what servers (and how many) we are getting in just over a month, so until then any answers you get about them until then I would take with a grain of salt.  Blizzard's layering plan suggests that we may be seeing far smaller numbers of servers/types than we saw at launch.
---
That said, only you can decide what levels of latency/timezone differences you are prepared to accept.  It doesn't hurt to start checking out the NA/EU Classic RP guilds that are recruiting and keep tabs on the ones you like just in case a worst case scenario rears its ugly head.
---
Once August rolls around we will all have a better idea of what to expect.
---
Solid point
---
I‚Äôm the same way, but with enchanting.
---
OP's question was whether it would the rep would be on release- you said yes, and then mentioned an item would be.
---
Not trying to be rude, just trying to make it clear that corehound belt probably won't be out on release if Blizzard's follows their stated intentions.
---
Magazines did have a lot less ads in the past, though. I remember specifically getting fed up that there was an ad on almost every other page. Or literally just pages of ads. This issue had to be made when magazines started pulling this bullshit.
---
Not bad what‚Äôs the name of it?
---
You can see Hogger if you look closely enough.
---
Doesnt the garrote damage him and break the sap?
---
Personal observation most of female models seemed to have less variety when it comes to casting animations. Example Undead Priest smite and heal will have same casting animation for female model but very different for male. 
---
I call that tactical advantage on the PVP server and that is why I will be rolling female no matter the class and race I pick.
---
Because I can. Same reason you ask why man go to the moon? Because he can? xD
---
Really hope u got AC if not u gone have a bad case of swamp nuts
---
Don't you dare threaten me with a good time.
---
This was actually quite interesting to read. Thank you for posting this!
---
So? A lot of people haven‚Äôt seen it yet (me for example)
---
Disable the lights and it's aight.
---
Then why are you disagreeing with me? The only key point from my original statement was that you mislabeled SW as the Alliance and glorified Orgrim.
---
Even with pre-bis gear you can have 20 meme specs, especially on 1.12 with 16 debuff slots etc. world first rag will probably be like 15 people at level 58 and 1 60
---
Aww shizz this shit got nerdy quick. Ok while I have you big brains here. On a 15.6‚Äù monitor 140hz on my laptop what resolution should I be gaming classic on? Thanks.
---
Yea it‚Äôs pretty common, especially as conflag spec. Its definitely one of the most fun abilities though, in bwl gear you can crit people for like 4K with it.
---
Tell me more about this "whirlwind axe"
---
Dwarf gun hunter,  gnome mage, human pal, human priest, human rogue, orc war, orc hunter w/wolf,  nelf hunter w/cat,  troll sham, Tauren sham/Druid, ud lock
---
Yeah I‚Äôm picking my dungeons carefully now. I also need to make sure the drops in there are decent to help myself gear up as I level. I‚Äôll do stockades for a bit of levels in the 20s. SMs will be my bread and butter 30-42, then I‚Äôll quest a few levels, then head into ZF for 2 levels, quest for a bit. At 50 I‚Äôll do all of my quests needed for pre raid bis items, then proceed to farm the bosses I need for pre raid bis until I‚Äôm 60. 
---
I‚Äôll also spend a few levels down in ungora crater doing all the quests + grinding the elite mobs. I‚Äôm going to be skinning/LW so I‚Äôm going to try and farm as many beast dungeons/mobs as possible.
---
I can hit 60 the day before week 3 for all I care as long as I have as much of my pre bis as possible the Tuesday my guild decides to start raiding.
---
is that westbrook garrison near the border with westfall?
---
Hah. Got it. That's clever.
---
Hahaha thats exactly what i did and if you do it on a seperate account you save so much time and money on food/portals its unreal
---
Love the Esfand shills downvoting this :D
---
Why would more people play proven bad specs now compared to 15 years ago when people made their first toon with no knowledge or dps meter? You think people back in Vanilla all knew they would need to play warrior rogue or mage to do damage?
---
Yep this so much. I mained a spriest on pserv and i happened to run into a tank while leveling. We played a fuckton together and ended up becoming good friends in game. He started his own guild, and even when there was only 8 debuff slots he still brought me along. Of courae i had my pre raid bis healing set as well to slap on when fights required it.
---
Always show up with consumes, full enchants, full pre raid bis, know the fights. Be someone that contributes to the raid and guild bank. Its just a matter of getting people to recognize you and take a liking to you. There will be 20+ people who just strait up show up on raid day and do nothing more than ask for an invite. Faceless names essentially. Dont be one of them and youll be fine. Classic is all about networking
---
Read the first page of his comment history then make your edits lol.
---
Acer Aspire Switch 10E there is newer models out there now that can do much better i'd imagine. But i've done 1-60 on private servers on this bad boy with no problems.
---
5 Man groups are 30 Fps and fine.
---
Raiding however i would not advice.
---
That would entirely depend on where I live, but I assure you I have a seperate nut cooler installed from Corsair.
---
&gt;Shaman quests seem really dumb, just lots of running
---
That's what ghost wolf is for!
---
Agreed, I thought it was pretty okay, not offensively bad at any rate.
---
Betalstation in full alert, this is not a drill,  I repeat, not a drill.
---
Good man
---
But that‚Äôs the point of execute... the joke is that it‚Äôs a ludicrously overkill combo not just using an ability for what it‚Äôs designed for.
---
But he top dps in his vids (while being in full naxx gear in MC with level 56s)
---
Mfw clasic will  have real money trading just like retail
---
Point taken.
---
The screenshot feature took shots in a format Paint couldn't read. Later they changed the format to JPEG
---
Also, that Core 2 Duo E6600? that's 2006 hardware. Something people often upgraded to between 2006 and 2007, and it supports 64-bit instruction sets.
---
Mages have a very high skill cap in PVP. You can do some crazy shit but it is VERY difficult to pull off. Raid PVE and leveling (if not AOE farming) is insanely boring .... . 
---
Druids are very fun but you always feel inadequate in PVE no matter what role you are doing ..... 
---
Shamans are RNG heavy, if you like gambling and feeling lucky you can have some fun moments.
---
Not getting it I guess
---
I‚Äôd rather auto-attack for all my life and do less dps than the tank, right? Very fun!
---
What shaman spec can kill mages the most easily?
---
Roger that captain, sounding the alarm!
---
Looks like it. I never realised the attention to detail until now. Not worthy of the hate it gets
---
And isn‚Äôt that Duskwood across the river?  It‚Äôs missing the one tree if it is
---
Thanks for this. Definitely some good insights. We'll be running Loot Council.
---
Do you feel Warriors will be a clear outlier? Sounds kinda even and then the one-off case for whoever happened to score some loot recently?
---
If I could have been guaranteed beta access, I'd have bought a month of retail. I don't even own the games after cataclysm.
---
I'm passionate about classic, and wanted to be there for it and help. Not spending money on a chance though. I don't play the lottery.
---
&gt; they specifically shit all over spellcasters 
---
What spec is best to accomplish that?
---
It is worth watching to see the world come to life.  
---
It is not worth watching without that attachment built in.
---
I'm not that kind of orc!
---
In our case we'll be Alliance.
---
Yeah my PC is over 3 years old, and its not like it was some crazy top of the line shit at the time.  i-7 5930k, SLI'd 980 TI's, 32gb of RAM, generic SSD.
---
Now we want Blizzard to not do anything to not ruin their old licenses lmao
---
Just do remasters of your good old games.
---
Herb Alch. Any other answer is a lie.
---
You can filter the logs for 'Spell Vulnerability' which is the Nightfall debuff.  
---
That will answer your question (I'm afk for next few hours but I'll get back to you with particulars if not figured out)  
---
But we're talking about the guy here that casts rank1 pala buffs on dps in 5mans and max rank on himself so he's second to last and not rock bottom so yeah he's not swinging nightfall ..
---
Seriously let me know what you guys think, it gets way better as the video goes on. Its supposed to be funny. Enjoy!
---
And the entire point of his comment is that he could‚Äôve faked a 16 roll so it looks like he called it
---
I'll break it down for you.
---
&gt; The movie predates the Old Horde invasion of Stormwind
---
No it doesn't, it rewrites the plot so that the invasion of Stormwind never happens.
---
&gt;  and predates when Orgrim killed Blackhand after most of Stormwind had been taken
---
In the movie, they rewrite it again so that Orgrim isn't even part of Blackhand's clan and Lothar kills Blackhand after King Llane is dead. Blackhand was dead BEFORE Stormwind was taken and Llane assassinated, so I disagree with you there because you're just wrong.
---
&gt;  Also, the first war was not the the Alliance, it was Stormwind alone.
---
And yet the movie gets this wrong too. Showing the Alliance forming in Stormwind.
---
Did blizzard cut the stupid highlight thing out for classic?
---
User-generated content.  It is a thing, deal with it.
---
Plus female orc doesn't have the broken back.
---
Beta is in a lul as Blizz wants people to be looking at 8.2. Off seasons for subs can get a little lax with the "on topic" discussion. see: /r/freefolk
---
noted
---
I legit am bored out of my mind videogame-wise. I want classic so bad. I'd get mario maker 2 but Idkhow long it will really keep me entertained as I don't make stages.
---
This is just amazing...
---
Because they want to keep subs grow into a quarter in which they typically decline, is what I would do.
---
Maybe they just couldn‚Äôt get it finished in time? It seems like the beta is still filled with bugs.
---
I would recommend asking questions to those you play with. Most people really enjoy sharing their knowledge of the game. I would avoid relying on barrens chat for quest info, just google the quest name. But as far as in dungeons, just play cautiously, let your group set the speed of the run.
---
All the volumes of CGW are available [here at the CGW Museum](http://www.cgwmuseum.org/) as PDFs. I owned many of these mags at one stage before having to give em all away when I moved.
---
It‚Äôs such a nice feeling browsing through the PDFs cos they bring back lotsa memories. Sometimes, I can recall exactly where I was when reading a specific volume.
---
i fully agree they just ignored all lore and broke lore to such a state that it should be the only one. or remake it.
---
&gt; I've never heard of a Priest being first 60 on any server
---
That's not what I was saying. Stop moving the goalposts.

---
The youtuber's 'unofficial' are benchmarked for low @ 1080P. and recommends 720P at max in raids.
---
768P is the native display res for this chromebook, and access to the internal scaler will greatly reduce load in exchange for chunkier pixels.
---
Warlocks have to farm soul shards in classic and it's worth noting you will need a threat meter because shadow damage pulls high threat and locks can't mitigate their threat. This is why Alliance warlocks will almost always pull more damage on fights because Pally can buff them to reduce their threat.
---
Cat durid is for fite.
---
Damn, I have watched a bit of Swifty playing the beta and he seems like an OK player after all... But this? He says it is "so hard" to equip his 2h wep, pop deathwish and press (click) excecute while enrage is up, lmao

Bro dont worry i plan on doing the exact same thing with my shammy. Yes ill get cloth and wear a dress in pve whatever. But outside of that im wearing mail and a big ass dam sheild. Even if its not bis id rather look and feel like a tank bitch than a dress shammy
---
Pick something that looks great to you and gets you excited to play. You‚Äôll find great people whichever side you play. People have tried to generalize who plays what for years now, and from what I‚Äôve seen it‚Äôs never accurate.
---
Yea, you usually go sap, cheap shot, restealth, garrote, kidney, gather CP, CB, evisc
---
This is easy, go hard on your main.
---
Level an alt with your filthy casual friends.

I was expecting a countdown :)

OK..... I guess

---
It's all about shareholder's, bottom line is money, stock price increase for end of the year.
---
Ya all of my buddies, and friends I've made on PS are just completely disinterested in BfA. It's a different game now. I don't want them to change retail to suit what I want. I don't care about it. They would have to ruin it for the people who like it now, to make it something I would play.
---
On a fresh server, if you can't get through STV before ppl are 60 and bored enough to gank all day, you probably should go to Desolace or hang out in Scarlet Monastery.
---
For everyone who can keep up the levels: STV is the shit!  It's a giant BG with tons of quests to do.  Bring some Swift Boots, Spider Belt, engineering bombs, and maybe a stack of Lesser Invisibility for those times you need to lose some assholes camping you.
---
I wish I had friends that would play
---
This is why i hope they release tbc. Resto druid coupled with SL/SL lock was so fucking broken. I was the slsl lock. Could literally run throuhh battlegrounds dotting everyone in sight and drain tank and never die. Plus if i had heals in me bahaha
---
But they did respawn in the South Park episode. Cartman even says ‚Äúno no I don‚Äôt wanna restart at the grave yard‚Äù. That‚Äôs what made it funny, the lifeless was literally corpse camping entire servers haha.
---
How do you have the grass popping up everywhere?. Mine won't go that far, basically just right in front of me

Only very specific NPC's with the tag "civillian" are dishonorable kills.

Literally will be going in alone with no planning ahead. Probably the best experience imo.

Shaman 2hander with windfury can accomplish the same thing.

Was down until I saw the horde filth symbol. Why don't you get a white box pc with a crt screen on top like a proper horde.

Ok, on this version the top of Kalimdor definitely looks like an angry chicken's head. Cannot unsee.

 **(this game‚Äôs graphics aged like fine wine)** 
---
Hard disagree here it looks like 2004 graphics.  I think you're just nostalgic of the art style which is fine, being a fan of artistic styles is purely subjective however the graphics are now a couple generations behind.
---
To be fair, few people buy BFA more than once.
---
Yeah because casuals will farm 42000 carapaces. The quest is a massive guild effort and if you don't do it fast enough you can't get it at all.
---
But if the Old Horde hasn't even come to Azeroth is it not before?
---
They could patch him back like his hand.
---
They show them talking, not an actual alliance. On top of this, even in the lore, Stormwind was not a founding member of the Alliance of Lordaeron. The closet to an Alliance they would form is the Council of Seven Nations.
---
human mage = gandalf
---
If you put the effort inside the game you can absolutley meet people and become friends in game. Happened on every pserver i played on
---
a 40 priest raid killed ony. People can meme pretty hard outside AQ40 and Naxx.
---
What goalpost exactly are you defending?  You won't kill a single target faster than a Mage.  You won't go through ten targets faster than a Mage, who has to drink, whether it's single target or AoE.  Your kill speed is about 70% of a Mage's, the only difference is you shouldn't have down time.
---
The only goalpost I see being moved is your own because you keep trying to dictate exactly how a Mage should go about killing shit while arguing that you're faster somehow.  You're not.
---
I know he's washed up but I didn't link the vid to advertise him , just needed something relevant to show execute damage numbers outside private servers.
---
Is that true? Staysafe was saying a few days ago quests give full rep on the beta regardless of when you turn it in.
---
It's not wrong, it's a different timeway. Iow it's not *our* azeroth.
---
Oh I already have a guild and stuff I meant real life friends
---
Then watch his channel and catch up. This is all old news.
---
Always played a Gnome, whether as a Rogue, or as a Mage. It made me feel immersed for the same reasons you said.
---
We‚Äôre in a tough content drought, let it slide
---
Thanks, wasn‚Äôt sure if they upgraded the graphics or anything.
---
Well at least they got the characters right.  That is, there aren't any in Warcraft and there aren't any in Warcraft.
---
I think it's pretty hard for the average beta player to keep their enthusiasm up for long term play. I am crazy excited for classic, but I hit 40 in beta and I've pretty much stopped logging in. I reported all the bugs I saw, but at this point I've invested enough time that I'm worried about getting burnt out for actual launch. I'm actually surprised that the beta had so many people dedicated enough to level to 40, that's a pretty big investment for something that's going to be wiped in a couple months.
---
Join your class discord
---
Don't misguide people. This is only true for private servers. From what I've seen in Beta streams, mobs in all dungeons, including ST, deal literally half as much damage as mobs in private servers. 
---
Don't think there's a need for respeccing till 60.
---
What about carry a friend and know everyone is having fun but also your friend specced holy because he likes to do that for raids?
---
Are you chasing hardcorism because you can - or are you doing because you find it fun.
---
Thats the question you must first ask yourself. 
---
If WoW is your only connection to these people in IRL - are you willing to strain that connection, or point of interest to achieve in-game goals? 
---
I‚Äôve had a similar experience in overwatch with a group of online friends. 
---
I was much better mechanically - than they were. 
---
My positioning was superior - but I enjoyed playing with them - so much so that I stopped dreaming of being a grandmaster and chose to play with them at gold/platinum. 
---
I realised I couldn‚Äôt balance both knowing my nature.
---
I‚Äôd never change those relationships for any ingame reward. 
---
I hope you find a balance - my parting advice would be to reflect on your past experiences. 
---
What are you more memorable and greatest achievements in games? 
---
What memory brings a smiles to your face without failure? 
---
This is where you‚Äôll find your answer.
---
That magazine really brought me back in time!
---
Shrug.  My WoW screenshots from early 05 have always worked.  .bmp files?
---
Beautiful
---
It‚Äôs not even the same universe. Drama pregnant before the Dark Portal? No. Orgrimmar Doomhammer a Frostwolf? No.
---
Yah... thats not gonna happen. I wouldn't object to another movie either but it wasn't a success financially and the people that make the decisions about what gets made and what doesn't are all about "show me the money!"
---
I'm honestly tempted to go engineering for those two perks. But I'm also tempted to go Blacksmithing.
---
you're like the neil peart of gaming and useless addons to your drumset
---
Timeways are weird man. What can I tell you.
---
I mean you‚Äôre correct but in my opinion wow looks as good as fortnite and that‚Äôs a game made 12 years later
---
probably elemental, enhancement is pretty RNG based and i dont like that you end up having a small mana pool because you build like a rogue/warrior
---
tremor/grounding totem are excellent defensively against casters.  earth shock and purge totally fuck them over.  priests and mages without fortitude, shield, ice/mana barrier die very quickly to an elemental shaman
---
warlocks are harder but warlocks are always really strong haha.  the totems do help but i would guess shamans probably lose the dps race against lock
---
their BIS attack was literally shadowbolt spam
---
I mean it‚Äôs a phone that shoots in 4K but okaaay..
---
You'll be 100% fine at 1080p.  There is no need to game at 4k on a laptop.  Bad for battery life and the screen is so small the 4k detail doesnt really come through.
---
They literally yell ‚ÄúFor the Alliance!‚Äù in Stormwind at the ‚Äúend‚Äù of the movie...

Resto dps sucks
---
I'm in a similar situation because shaman is my favorite class and alliance is my favorite faction so I have to make the choice between best faction and best class. It's gonna be a tough one.
---
Watching his channel won‚Äôt find these exact data parses, which is the only thing that can prove what weapon he was using.
---
I mean my phone shoots in 4K AND this is the original client not classics but.. okay?
---
Yes, it's a horribly inaccurate movie; however, you were talking about Orgrim destroying the Alliance, not Doomhammer sticking his magic metal/fel hand into the King now weren't you?
---
That‚Äôs fine if your friend likes Holy and healing, but if he doesn‚Äôt, then he shouldn‚Äôt change specs.
---
This is absolutely spot on. Im really going to try my best to play with them, but my ultimate goal is to see all content and if they get stuck progressing MC-BWL i might just have to roll an alt to play with them instead.
---
Pshh nah man. Still rocking the same 15 year old $15 black logitech. USB? Hell no, PS/2 man. 
---
I see no reason to change it.
---
I stopped reading after "4chan"
---
And without the cover sheet, did you see the memo about this? Yeah.. I‚Äôll go ahead and get you another copy.
---
Use Joanas guide and mix in a dungeon when you need to catch up.
---
You are right about one thing. You can easily make a name for yourself as a spriest. They were made for disrupting groups trying to raid or run instances in BRD. Your faction may not know you but the other one will.  Hard to get in groups though.
---
What are you even talking about? Orgrim Doomhammer did not have a metal/fel hand and Blackhand never stuck his anywhere near the king.
---
I seriously put 1.12 client in the description and you still failed. But okay buddy
---
Cheap,  bs auto attack, ks bs auto attack, gauge, restelth, repeat
---
I never did like that button
---
Don't respec till You're done with solo content.
---
Yes, it actually is
---
By realizing I play the game for enjoyment and BFA is hot garbage. I‚Äôm an officer in my guild and already told people I‚Äôm gone once classic comes out
---
It made feel pity towards the OP, actually.
---
When you zoomed in on the taurens face after the sodapoppin name i laughed. Good vid mate
---
Now thats a cool pic. All it needs is a "Wish you were here" and the rest of the Horde could use it as a holiday post card! :D
---
I didnt get a lot of sleep.
---
But yah, chased wowprogress, went to uni, played competitive sports and managed a relationship and worked a part time job.

Did a lot of adderal.

Now all ive got is my career and working out...and somehow it seems way harder to get everything done these days.
---
Thank you, a video like is appreciated!
---
Well, unless you have proof that he did, you can get fucked lol
---
Well, a lot of the settings that I tweaked with macro for this screenshot, will be easily adjustable in WoW: Classic, since it has many of the advanced graphics settings from Retail WoW, like Soft dynamic shadows, Cata water, grass density, etc.
---
I'm baffled at the criticism it's getting in this thread.  They changed the pointless yarn from the first game, in which a climactic defeat must occur on a periodic basis, and changed it to a pointless yarn on the scale of a movie.
---
Kept all the shallow characters and vapid plot elements.  Man, every time I hear that word 'corruption'.
---
It is amusing to see superfans being confused and alarmed to find out that their favorite thing cannot be movied.
---
Liked and subbed bro
---
&lt;3
---
Enjoy. Getting. Downvoted.
---
In my experience in most dungeons it isnt that important. Though when you get in a tight spot it can save your group a wipe. So importancy level for a casual player not that high, as a hardcore player I would expect you would want to learn this.
---
Difficulty wise you have to find some good working macros and set key bindings that work for you and just try and get used to it. Its a fun experience in my opinion!
---
Hope this helps!
---
Do you know of a way to remove the "fog" effects when it rains?  I don't mind the rain drops, but the fog just ruins my eyes.

Gonna depend on a few different variables of course, such as your party and makeup (how geared vs trigger happy they are), if threat meters being used, even your faction. 
---
Best thing to do imo is plenty of dungeons as you're levelling. Some times there's gonna be another person tanking and you can just dps. But a most of the time tanks are very sought after. You can learn how important/valuable different abilities actually are and if stance dancing is required. 
---
for the horde ! not if you are gnome !
---
When I played alliance priest in vanilla I specced holy around 55. I swear I would just /wave and keep grinding. After a few ganks the rogues would see my terrible clear speed and take pity and help me by damaging my tagged mobs. Thanks to this one troll rogue in particular who helped me for almost half a level wish I could remember their name.

Man that‚Äôs so interesting.

I remember when I first played WoW thinking it was like I had zoomed all the way into WC3 and I loved it.
---
Really should sift through the entire thing though. So much nostalgia in those adds. Do people still play the Sims?
---
I've been raiding since vanilla with my irl friends. It's just a "Hell, it's about time" moment for us.
---
But maybe yes.
---
Does totem twisting actually make a difference in classic? I don't see how you would not be oom super quick
---
Cool. I have no intentions of raiding prot. I just will be doing 5 mans. Furthermore, my father will be a dwarf priest so fear ward will help a lot.
---

Game world size vs actual size is way off, that's probably duskwood at most
---
Amazing!

We should morph into VULTRON
---
I‚Äôd put the PC to the side and have a monitor there since it‚Äôs in a more natural position for your head plus you could align the monitors better... but that‚Äôs just me and I can totally relate to wanting to see the parts, so I can‚Äôt disagree too much.
---
&gt; But what may I inquire , Where you where thinking on the day, that you conjured up for a man like me **and oooooo I look so gayyyyy** gnome chorus
---
The bolded part is actually "a robe that looks so gay" :)
---
This might be the dumbest thing I‚Äôve ever read
---
I‚Äôm on it tonight
---
*laughs while mind controlling you off a cliff.
---
The loch during that storm was aesthetic as truck
---
I believe their point is that vanilla was never about rushing to the end, that a lot of the game is between 1-60 and they are concerned that new players will miss some great experiences if they decide to rush to 60. But people should do whatever makes them happiest.

Undead priest is the unkillable you looking for
---
Yes, you should be able to tweak it with  "SET weatherDensity 0-4" in your [config.wtf](https://config.wtf) file, or by using the console, guide to that here:  [https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=1100](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=1100)  (for 1.12)
---
I think 0 removes the rain competely and 1 removes the fog, although I am not sure.
---
I mean it looks better Bc it‚Äôs my monitors native res.. everything else is downscaled
---
I see almost everyone talking about 40 man raids. Is this something you are interested in? 5 and 10 man dungeons are perfectly doable as enhancement.
---
In pvp enhancement is that clown running around withva huge hammer while distracting everyone with logs the have to avoid and once in a while he turns into a god for a millisecond when windfury procs with 3 crits in a row. If you can learn to play as support, dip in and out with your totems, slows and interrupts, know when to run away in wolf form and not try to rely on your weapon hits then you'll have a great time.
---
Undead Shadow Priest or Undead Warlock.  The narrative is great, and the quests are really flavorful in Tirisfal and Silverpine.
---
This is the stuff you would miss out on tho :P

The male human running animation is the worst, looks like they have a have a big turd in their pants.
---
Adding "SET farclip 777" in your [config.wtf](https://config.wtf) should do the trick
---
That's according to survey and older individuals are more likely to be taking surveys.
---
You will almost never stance dance to use Mocking Blow, and for the most part Thunderclap is a waste of Rage to use in every situation.
---
Stance dancing becomes more important once you have berzerker stance and you can start to use Intercept and Berserker Rage and realistically both those abilities can be easily macro'd to swap stance use ability and swap back to defensive.
---
Damn man no hate but you did put 4K in your title and then post a very poopie image so I think everybody is just a little confused

---
FOR THE HORDE
---
Giving your guild's leadership as much notice about your intentions as possible is probably the best thing you can do. It's worked out for me
---
When the Beta first came out, quests gave full rep no matter what level you turned them in. After the WSG patch, that changed and now you receive reduced rep and experience for quests once you outlevel them by 6+ levels.
---
Holy crap the $3,900 LCD monitor. 
---
I remember almost all of those games. Man. I was 17 then and Diablo 2 was basically my life then.
---
Probably because hes using private server footage, and this sort of thing wouldn't actually work at all, its not feasable by normal standards, you would have to have 5 man group, as soon as someone plays by themselves, its not worth it for them anymore to run the dungeons, early levels 1-2 levels extra halves the experience gain from said monsters. (Unlike 40+ where monster scaling with XP is quite narrow.)
---
Also the fact if you have 5 friends, making them play a melee cleave class is probably not fun for them and highly not recommended, I saw 3 warriors in that clip, what happens at 60? are they all gonna have to share loot? It seems kinda meh.
---
Not having access to beta and showing of private server numbers and guess work is just straightup atrocious, nobody leveled like this in real vanilla wow, and leveling like this has been debunked on beta, from groupers. (As far as I've seen on deadmines/wailing caverns streams where I kept an eye on the XP gain.)
---
You are way better off solo grinding somewhere else according to your level, and even then grinding isn't good until 42-50 (Which is one of the best times to grind) when XP starts normalizing on the level difference and quests start to be somewhat scarce.
---
I've played this game since 2004 beta, I know my stuff, this sort of thing wont work, sure if you wanna have fun and play with friends like this, go ahead, but using it as a leveling "guides" baseline, is not recommended.
---
You're better off duo leveling with a mage or AoE style setup and just pulling normal mobs instead. (AoE Mage, AoE Shaman, AoE Warlock, AoE Druid, etc.)
---
thx for posting nice read

Oh I see thank you.

It‚Äôs for the streaming real estate too. They probably don‚Äôt want classic streams getting more views than 8.2 hype.
---
So if there‚Äôs no content in classic, then the streamers will focus on retail, and you don‚Äôt have big non wow streamers streaming classic diverting views away from 8.2
---
Yes, after pandaren had already been introduced

1. As an april fools joke

2. As neutral hostile creeps (naked bears)

No, that means people can actually queue without waiting 2hours.

That is, however, overwhelmingly China being the audience, and no US actor wants to be in the movie franchise equivalent of a foreign advertisement.
---
Thanks for all the info everyone! I think... I'm gonna stick with priest.
---
I'd like to level prot if possible. One of the reasons I want to tank is because I don't have hours to wait for groups to form. My dad's gonna level a priest with me and he'll heal for me sometimes so that will speed up the formation of groups by a lot.

It was the highest grossing video game movie of all time.

IIRC it did really well in Asia.

I dunno how Hollywood accounting really works, but it seems insane something that grossed $433 million and had a budget of $160 million couldnt find a way to make money....But thats why you negotiate points on the gross not profits
---
You need more screens and RGB lightning.

What we see in WoW isn‚Äôt correct as weird as it sounds.  Canonically, Goldshire‚Äôs population is around 10,000 but in game we only see an inn and a blacksmith.  The world is much larger than it is depicted as in the game.
---
Nice alt account üëç

I never said it was a flop, but it wasn't successful. It would have been a flop but for China tho.

You should ALWAYS be gaming at the highest resolution of your monitor (or higher because of downsampling but that's a bit more advanced!).

Im been trying to convince my roommate to play, but he‚Äôs still playing runescape. Im still trying since i know he would love it.
---
It seems that your goal is fairly simple, and certainly achievable whilst also playing with your friends. 
---
If it is just to see all the content.
---
An important idea to note is that your friends may not enjoy the game without your full attention.
---
This may impact their enjoyment of the game and may lead to unsubscribing. 
---
You may need to go hardcore towards naxx and AQ - but early onyxia and BWL are far more accessible to players than the formers.
---
You may also feel excluded from their ‚Äúinner circle‚Äù - as you clearly hold them in high regard. 
---
You are currently feeling this fear - due to your wavering mind. 
---
Success and happiness vs stability and happiness is a fickle beast.

Play Star Wars Galaxies, imagine every planet in that game is a single wow zone....thats about the scale. And itd still make for Azeroth being the SMALLEST planetoid.

Eh. Only Warcraft fans would really notice it in still shots

It was exactly what it said it would be - an adaptation.  They didn‚Äôt promise to be 100% true to the lord, there‚Äôd be no way to do that and have an actual story that was accessible to the masses.

[That Dark Age of Camelot ad man... bringing back some nostalgia.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgBZ_X2_h9A)
---
The way people here talk about Classic WoW with their nostalgia goggles suctioned firmly onto their face is how I feel about DAOC. Logically I know DAOC has some serious issues but god damn if I don't feel insane nostalgia about the game.
---
I made an orc, killed him off, and ran his ghost all the way up to the east coast of Winterspring (which took about 20-30 minutes). I then searched along the entire coastline (as a ghost) to see if the zone would ever switch to Winterspring and could not find a spot.
---
I know from the previous test that I can fatigue kill my ghost and then return with a 2nd ghost to rez at the fatigued corpse location, but it‚Äôs unclear to me where my new spirit healer will be if I rez then die again outside of the Winterspring zone. Before I spend another 30 minutes making that 2nd ghost trip, I wanted to find out if you were aware of any way to get into Winterspring from that east coast.
---
Is this a joke? From the description of the Hunter class:
---
&gt;Wherever Hunters go, they fight back the ravages of sickness, exploitation **and industrialization.**
---
Yeah, what a class to give to Dwarves, who literally live in an *Iron Forge*.
---
But wait, there's more! From the description of the Alliance:
---
&gt;Bound by a loathing for all things demonic, they fight to restore order in this war-torn world.
---
Yeah, that's why two Alliance races can be Warlocks and there are Warlock trainers, complete with demons in tow, in every village.
---
So Dwarven Hunters are out, Human/Gnome Warlocks are out, who else is out?
---
Orc Shamans are out because the totems are clearly of Tauren design.
---
Undead Priests are out for obvious reasons. Actually the Undead as a whole don't make a lick of sense but whatever. Should have pushed harder for a Naga playable race, Metzen.
---
Gnomes are a joke too. Dwarves are pushing it but they at least make up in width in what they lack in height, but Gnomes? They're like fat five year old kids. They should be literally incapable of any martial activity.
---
Ditch the levelling system!? U wot m8.
---
Selling extra herbs while leveling, selling transmutes at 60 :)
---
Shouldn't this have the humor tag?
---
Personal opinion: even though graphics in modern games have come a long way, gameplay still determines if I end up playing the game after 2 weeks. WoW is quite possibly the best example that I can currently think of.
---
They won't be solo. Guarantee the warriors who are pushing for a sub 5 day will duo with a healer.
---
What is this video, I vaguely remember it?
---
Just to make sure we see both sides I'll say no :p
---
Then you're kinda stupid, buddy.
---
Somehow this is spooky and cozy at the same time. I love it!
---
There‚Äôs actually very little evidence to support that claim.
---
Will we need to dl a new client for classic wow or is the bfa wow client enough?
---
I've done this but no change =/
---
Yeah but this isn't very interesting it's mostly empty and generic terrain
---
Same for Daggerfall which is probably even bigger than Galaxies but the world is pointless and empty and mostly randomly generated, Galaxies was probably randomly generated too and they added random point of interests
---
Imagine if WoW had bigger but still handcrafted beautiful and interesting zones
---
Berry niceeee!
---
Like the post on the OP says, twisting means almost 5% crit for all in addition to the WF.
---
I explained why Resto isn't a better option. A Resto Shaman twisting will *either* be missing a shitload of  "twists" or will be completely unreliable as a healer.   
---
Meaning if a Resto Shaman is twisting for the melee that shaman effectively doesn't occupy a healer spot. 
---
Like the OP also says, you can avoid going OOM but it does mean you're pretty much only autoattacking and twisting.
---
The twisting also loses its worth with every upgrade the raid gets since the agi bonus becomes less and less necessary, at which point the raid is better served by a Resto Shaman keeping WF up. 
---
That said. I think the point here ultimately is very simple. There is a case to be made for having an enhancement shaman in the raid. That's all being said.
---
1.Roll druid healer 
---
2.Download decursive
---
3. Click one button in raid.
---
4. Watch  porn on other two monitors
---
5.?????
---
6. Get all the gear
---
Ashenvale was the most dangerous place in Azeroth in vanilla... which also made it the biggest thrill for me when I was leveling with some of my best and worst memories. Escaping a horde raid on astranaar as I was minding my own business curing that sick kid was exhilarating. Won my first ever 1v2 against 2 horde at my level after they initiated contact.
---
Any of this goes down in classic and I‚Äôm /logout to switch characters. I‚Äôll ping pong until I hit 60 somewhere.
---

---
&gt; Before I spend another 30 minutes making that 2nd ghost trip, I wanted to find out if you were aware of any way to get into Winterspring from that east coast.
---
A) thanks for the first 30 minutes.
---
B) sorry, no idea if there's a coastal spot that qualifies as in-zone for Winterspring, hence the wondering above.
---
Give it a few days and someone will stick a shitty filter on it and reap the karma.
---
Undead cloth user, Orc warrior / shaman, Troll druid / hunter, Tauren anything. 
---
Human anything, Night Elf druid / hunter, Dwarf paladin \ hunter, Gnome cloth user \ rogue. 
---
I know Undead rogue is a pretty iconic combo but if we're talking purely immersion and not cool factor, I don't think it works too well. Don't get me wrong, I love me an Undead warrior \ rogue, but being a melee fighter while being a frail rotting corpse is a little weird. I guess you can wave it off with "it's magic, I ain't gotta explain shit" but it just looks a little odd.

Dota Underlords

Be sure to give him a passive aggressive name.

I propose "slowlevlin".

I never have been hardcore into wow but had some friends who were, they liked the progression/server first raiding stuff but it's not for me. Your friends will be okay with it to, just don't be a dick and try to force them to play how you do. They hop on and want to run some dungeons/quests/bg's and you've got free time, cool, just let em know you've gotta leave for a raid in an hour but in the meantime go enjoy squashing filthy horde beasts/punt some hideous gnomes.

---
There can't be any more than roughly 3k people online at the same time, the game was designed that way to foster small communities. Everyone else will be sitting in a queue and hopefully people aren't as stupid as to roll on those servers.
---
Blizzard has said that if servers are overpopulated after layering is removed then free transfers will be offered off of those servers.
---
Parody guild names.  My favorite ever was &lt;Elitist Jerkoffs&gt;
---
How they never made us change that is beyond me...
---
I couldn‚Äôt
---
Yeah, but to them they think the game is about killing NPC boars and then killing a dragon at 60.  They actually think that is the whole entirely of the game.
---
They fail to realize getting to 60 and getting that gear from said dragon is just a means to an end.  The end being getting better gear to kill the other faction with.
---
I'm screenshotting the irony here.
---
Its VERY difficult for me to choose. I enjoy all types of playstyles and I'm interested in trying everything.
---
It depended on the magazine. Magazines like nintendo power, official dreamcast magazine, and game informer were always okay with their ads. CGW was one of the worst offenders and stuck an ad on almost every other page.
---
I guess they became even more desperate in the early 2000s, which is why you see this ridiculous shit with them having like 6 pages of back to back ads.
---
You will need to download a new client, if you have it from stress tests it will auto update. If not, the file will be available for download a few days before release on th launcher.
---
This is incredible!

This is embarrassing

Sure, I'm just saying that "taking your time" shouldn't mean "making bad choices so that everything takes longer"
---
Gank lowbies in Redridge repeatedly.
---
Long time lurker, first time post. This is what being a Warrior in classic WoW is like from my perspective. Hope you enjoy.
---
Same man. Probably going female cause I think male shoulders are too much and think they look silly on warlock mounts. 
---
It was hard not to go undead cause they seem to fit the theme so well. But being another cloth undead in a sea of them seems like it could get old
---
I too have a dumb little hearthstone stress ball on my desk for when I get tired of being ganked by honorless Alliance scum (this goes for horde as well - I strongly believe in only engaging in wpvp where the target yields honor, otherwise you're just being a dick for the sake of being a dick :P).
---
how big is it?
---
He gets free trial and you level to 10 together, if he likes it and wants to keep playing, neat. If he doesn't like it you do all the chores for a week.

lol care bears downvoting you for the truth.
---
I did it bc im an angsty edgy teenager who has never heard of the print screen key. I also only play games on the iPad or my phone so srry I no know not copy paste work.
---
That's putting it mildly. The standard melee range is 5 yards, leeway adds 2 yards on top of that - meaning you have 40% more running to do. With perfect movement you could of course dip into that 7 yards range yourself, but with auto attack being on a batch timer you can't just face the enemy for only a split second to begin with.
---
It shouldn't be anything more than 5-10 gigs
---
Noggenfogger Paladin
---
I played on Frostwolf, Frostmane, Gurubashi and Frostmourne oceanic which is not known for being pansy
---
What‚Äôs more likely?
---
A random guess with a 1/100th of a chance of being correct happens without prompting on a live stream?
---
Or a streamer uses a simple macro and his keyboard to have someone clip an ‚Äúinsane wtf‚Äù video and post it everywhere?
---
and there wont be any patches in the future since it would kill the point of wow classic so lets say 10 gb for life? and maybe 20 most if its like pastches to fix the game.
---
Because shadow is a meme spec. A healer priest will literally always be 10 times more valuable.

Yeah i understand, on the otherhand i've had some of the best adventures fucking up when i started playing wow :p
---
Can't wait!
---
I played a paladin at the tail end of vanilla and didn‚Äôt get a chance to raid until TBC and really enjoyed ret. 15 years later I have a lot less time to play and will be playing casually. I‚Äôm thinking this time I‚Äôd like to roll Warrior, tank dungeons and dps or offtank some raids when I have enough time to actually get run one. My question is, can I stay arms/fury spec and still be able to tank level 60 dungeons effectively? I‚Äôm a bit worried I won‚Äôt have the time to farm gold to afford all the respec and repair costs? Thanks!
---
Alright, thank you. But is it possible to have a build that's good for both Raiding and PVP?
---
This looks so good
---
Edgy male teens will go horde.
---
IRL women will go Alliance.
---
The choice is obvious.
---
So SM/Ruin is more of a raiding spec. What about if I wanted to do mostly PVP but with some raiding, what build would I want to have?
---
Alright, I heard you out, I'll reply here when the realms are announced, cheers
---
I would say 20 is on the high end but yes, just bug fixes for the most part. You can buy a cheapo 16gb to offload some files if you really need the space
---
Blast from the past, man. Do gaming magazines even exist anymore?
---
You can do this in low level dungeons. 
---
And with good gear you could pull 8+ toons that are level 40 ish. 
---
But you certainly can‚Äôt hold your own when ganked whilst doing this. 
---
Once you have competition - it‚Äôs pretty much over. 
---
A mage could easily just nova &gt; CoC their mobs whilst warding off a rogue, warrior, other mage. 
---
A warlock would just be overwhelmed. 
---
This is if you want to farm open world, of course. 
---
Dungeons are better environments but offer more challenging pulls. 
---
(More damage = less time to free cast with sac shield) 
---
You‚Äôd have to pull small - and your gold per hour would be significantly less than a mages.
---
yes it is sad and queues are never that long if the cap is higher then 5k
---
If I do roll Shadow, how much time per week should I expect to spend farming Runes and gold for pots do you think?
---
Dwarf Paladin
---
1/100 is easily likely
---
Wow you feel cool calling people end user brah?

It  actually seemed to me your better off back strafing back a bit, then back peddling if you really want to hamstring kite.
---
You literally just need good voice actors, and guys willing to run around in green body suits so you can CGI all the fantasy races in along with oddly proportioned humans.
---
You don't actually need to show a single real human, so its not like you need some high dollar big name actor/actress, and the voice actors are probably already into the fantasy stuff anyhow, so they're game for it.
---

If you like pvp conan sucks. Rust is a much better game.
---
Retail is shit, they‚Äôll understand. (Jk, but really)
---
Except it isn't. First and foremost Blizzard has used it as free advertising. Beta testing comes secondary or they would have invited more people.
---
Paladins have stun but you can blink out of them and the defensive dispells are annoying as well as freedom as a mage. But you can burn a pally bubble easily by sheeping them. Where against shaman they have earth shock interrupt you as well as they have grounding totem and other utility totems. So it is basically do you want to have to deal with another class busting you up or the shaman busting you up with another class. Personally i would so go with the horde mage, and kill all of the paladins that you see.
---

I've heard many people mention shadow oil for rogues in lieu of instant poison vi. The reasoning was scalability with spell damage and debuffs. For those who have experience using it, what sort of damage do you see against a raid boss with debuffs? What consumables do you use in order to achieve that sort of damage output? Is it only worth it for speed running when those bosses are on farm? For reference, with 0 stat adjustment, shadow oil seems to be 56 shadow damage at 15% chance, IP is 130 nature at 20%.

Aaaand JUMP!
---
10/10 dadication.
---
Very nice, I just bought a copy and will be reading it after finishing up the Warcraft 3 campaigns.
---
Why do you guys not have AC what's the deal with that ?
---
I‚Äôm speaking purely based on professional streamers. Look at them yourself. They use less than 20 buttons.
---
Look at streamers from Vanilla. 70+ buttons.
---
Sure wish I could have a last name too.
---
You should think about this from group PvP perspective and not duel. Pal are easy to deal with in duel compared to shaman, but the warrior they give freedom to in BGs isn't. You don't have spell steal in vanilla so freedom/free action potion is pretty rough on mage.
---
Gnome warrior
---
Those $160 million is most likely only the production cost. Then after that you have marketing and advertisements.
---
Amazing piece!
---
Why?
---
For me thats a plus, something that can be done by everyone loses it magic. Just knowing stuff like this "is there" makes me feel good eventough I dont do it myself
---
Rogue vs rogue depends on who is a dwarf. One can break blind while the other can‚Äôt. Dwarf is very strong in pvp and basically nullifies most * vs rogue scenarios.
---
Play an orc. 
---
Reason: lok‚Äôtar fucking ogar! For the horde!
---
Id love to play some 40s surely since i ve never tried it before. But i will surely not be spending all the time in raids, since i like dungeons and in retail i keep on leveling a lot of alts just for dungeons. Id also love to pvp casually
---
Really? That small? BFA is like 60gig. I‚Äôm always tight on storage space. Will be great once I can delete that for classic.
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre enjoying your computer, Mom.
---
They aren‚Äôt selling it since reforged is soon. I had to torrent it.
---
How much did all of that cost??
---
While it is missing the tree, Duskwood wouldn't exist yet. Since Warcraft takes place during the first war, it is known as brightwood at the moment. Once medivh dies however, is about when the downfall of the area begins.
---
Legendary used to have an app where you could plug it into VR and fly on a gryphon 360. It was awesome
---
OK.... I doubt that but whatever
---
Seems like slight overkill for a game that can run on a smartfridge lol, but to each their own
---
I would recommend avoiding injection or modification of core game files. Warden is a cruel mistress.
---
Their sword spec is amazing. It's actually the exact same as a talent at the very bottom of the Combat tree but ofc they get it from day one.
---
Damn so many good games in there... loves that DAOC ad
---
Which books are you reading that have the Warcraft 3 characters in them?
---
Male or female human mages - they are the Kirin Tor.
---
Female night elf priests - they are the Sisterhood of Elune.
---
Male human paladins - they are the Knights of the Silver Hand.
---
Male tauren or night elf druids - they are the Circle of Cenarius.
---
OP is the guy doing gearchecks for a WC run
---
I've ran a Crouton install with Chrome OS and Ubuntu running at the same time on my Acer C720 from 2012.
---
Classic client works better than 1.12 pServers, kinda. Haven't bothered trying retail but I figure if I can run classic I can probably run BfA.
---
bless you
---
Perfect for paladins! &gt;.&gt;
---
They were previewing Zoo Tycoon
---
I can picture myself waiting for a zepelin there. Was that something on Vanilla or it was added later?
---
undead mage
---
DURIDS IS 4 haf FUN TIME WIT FRENS every1 is like a fun time durid!!
---
Lol no. It‚Äôs literally the lowest whole number percentage odds you can have.
---
Yup, absolutely.
---
Things inject into everything all the time, though. It's not the injection that is the problem, it's Warden specifically targeting something that has done so. I want to believe in my heart of hearts Blizzard isn't stupid enough to target something as widespread as reshade.
---
But then again, I have been wrong about Blizz its common sense before.
---
What server are you on?
---
"Hollywood accounting" has more to do with manipulating things on paper to reduce the profit attributed to a specific movie, to reduce the amount they pay out to anyone with a percent cut of profits (plus the usual reducing tax burden, etc). Now, the thing about the declared budget and declared gross ticket sales is that they still don't tell the whole story of whether the movie actually made money. The declared budget doesn't include certain things outside of the actual production, most notably the marketing campaign (which is substantial, for these big action blockbusters). The gross ticket sales number is also before taking away the theater's cut, probably among other things. For a big movie like this, I usually hear that a good estimate for the break-even point is ticket sales of double the stated budget. The final piece of the puzzle is that the studios get a much smaller cut from Asian theaters, so for a movie that does a disproportionate amount of its business in Asia the bar is even higher.
---
Taking a crit from sitting does not proc enrage on official servers! Jesus listen to what they are saying.
---
Hin Denburg zeppelin shuttle at yer service
---
As a healer, you can have upto 4 pets that does the killing for you.
---
Also Blessing of Sacrifice makes it hard / impossible to sheep a paladin if he got it off first.
---
shouldn't be too bad, couple hours maybe. Heal Scholomance runs is another option. its common on pservers to reserve the dark runes for the healer.  of courae you also have to farm dps consumes like all caster dps
---
Jesus don‚Äôt want me for a sunbeam
---
Yep. I‚Äôm doing skinning tailoring on my priest and enchanting on an alt. You can farm some early linen cloth, level tailoring, and mail the tailored green junk to your enchanter to DE. You can also craft linen bags and sell on the AH for early money.
---
You bet your ass 99% of druids willing to run flags will be engineers - *the* PvP profression.
---
It's 5min cooldown. It will be ready pretty much every attempt to snatch the flag from a clueless spriest thinking he can defend a flag by himself.
---
Anyways the spriest will not be defending, he will be asked to be on dispell duty and throwing around R1 shadow word pains to proc blackouts on healers and others.
---
Yeah, and the guy that pours my coffee will sit in Congress one day...
---
I think it's still there, but not enabled by default.
---
I would love to see a new bigger WoW with more little villages, trade wagons moving between the villages, just a lot of little details to make it come alive.
---
Lmao no homie, all the r14 boys are also hardcore raiders. This isn't vanilla anymore.
---
Meh dwarfs are so predictable, blind them first chance you get, go for reset. Continue fight as usual.
---
Spirit Tap doesn't increase your spirit.
---
I've been at some very low points in my life, but jerking off to sexy wow characters is a low I've gladly never reached
---
So confused
---
damn thats good art!
---
And suffer the tears of any warrior who got the weapon from Vanilla.  
---
Maybe give a paladin specific weapon to the paladin, and some other special non-worn item to non-paladins.
---
&gt; Wherever Hunters go, they fight back the ravages of sickness, exploitation and industrialization.
---
&gt; Yeah, what a class to give to Dwarves, who literally live in an Iron Forge.
---
By that logic guns shouldn't be available to hunters
---
Undead warlock, nice quest zone and best class quests
---
Just happens to have a macro set up to fake yellow roll text a specific number?  You literally watch him type /roll in the chat window.
---
If he had a macro, you'd see 2 numbers showing up in chat, not just the correct one.
---
such abstract art i offer ten thousand copper pieces
---
Don't worry about the thousand better ways you could be doing everything. Go with the flow and experience the world that WoW is.
---
The only thing you need to do in my opinion is to figure out what zones to go to for certain levels (study this map for zone levels:  [https://i.redd.it/yiw429e454631.jpg](https://i.redd.it/yiw429e454631.jpg) ). Being a new player in WoW is really about discovering the world. I'm not into lore or anything, and I too consider myself an 'efficient player', but I very clearly remember the first time I ran into Ironforge (15 years ago) and was completely in awe of the game. Same with some of the other major cities, and some of the very pretty zones such as Un'Goro Crater or Stranglethorn Vale. Discovering WoW for the first time is just an absolutely awesome feeling.
---
You need to learn the game and the world, and you won't do that if you rush through everything.
---
Also, since you're new to WoW I'll give you this advice: When in dungeons (5 man groups) or raids (40 man groups in Classic) people who don't know how to play their class can be very annoying and completely disrupt the group dynamics. Learn your class and how to play it. Example: If you're a hunter, don't go around and mindlessly spam multi-shot on every target including crowd-controlled (CC) mobs. Doing so will get people to dislike you and you'll less likely get invited to groups in the future. Instead, if the tank asks for it, help him pull mobs, use CC such as freezing trap when needed, damage the right mob (marked with a skull or your own hunters mark if that's how the group decide to do it) and in general just be a good support/dps class. Players love people who are in control of their class and play well in dungeons/raids.
---
Moar like this plz
---
Yeah, new skyboxes in BfA butiful and all that, but vanila clouds are somewhat more dynamic and actualy behave like clouds, not like drawn picture. And still look great.
---
Lore wise, why would a warrior have the ability to use the light necessary to cleanse it. Enjoy your strong sword, and let other classes enjoy things.
---
The best rpg design is when every class gives you a reason to go want to play it.
---
Yes and thats why i do 5mans with them but always was in different guilds except for once. The problem is not that i play more than all of them. One plays even more than me, he judt cant be bothered to get better, still mostly a clicker. I was for the very first time with him in a guild in bfa, joined at the same time pretty much (i joined a little earlier), he got benched after 2 raids and then left the guild while i was doing legendary parses most of the time.
---
I don't recommend prep for newbie rogues. Better getting more points into combat and assass.
---
I don‚Äôt believe you actually need the current expansion, just an active sub.
---
&gt;I dunno how Hollywood accounting really works, but it seems insane something that grossed $433 million and had a budget of $160 million couldnt find a way to make money
---
Here's the thing, every studio production is going to use (((accountant sorcery))) to make it seem like they made a loss on the production when in reality they made a killing. This is done to cheese the taxes owed as much as possible, and it's all done legally too. Even Avengers: Endgame is being reported by disney as "not that huge of a success" in order to get tax breaks on it.
---
If you take a look, almost every single movie produced does this, because you pay less taxes.
---
I mean a large portion of survival is melee based abilties/defenses.  The only people i ever saw back then going survival were baited into thinking they could get away with a hybrid meele/ranged spec, which didn't work at all
---
I mean, sure?
---
The screaming at the end is pretty shitty for headphones.
---
Remember the Alamo.
---
Thanks a ton! Really appreciate it
---
Genuinely didn't mean for it to actually be loud enough to be considered ear rape. It was just supposed to be normal screaming not ear rape.
---

---
Wow. Thank you. I love this place so much.
---
This would be a dope phone wallpaper

What happened to the leg?
---

---
#**‡≤†_‡≤†**
---
Wow, thank you for sharing and crediting the OC. This is definitely going to be my phones wallpaper
---
lol that is exactly the comp our hardcore horde guild ran for progression, and you can cut a couple healers for dps once stuff is on farm
---
We just really hate ourselves.
---
This is the build I'll use for Destro, rather for concentration then imp via, and rather have intensity than searing pain. http://armory.twinstar.cz/talent-calc.php?cid=9&amp;d=vanilla&amp;tal=35002004122000000000000000000000005050005122005151
---
CB/prep build is pretty basic imo and if you're going daggers which makes you even worst at going for a hemo build which is what I would suggest to a new player. Plus prep is "forgiving" to play at an "ok" level since you can missplay and use your prep to get everything back and try all over again.
---
They didn't need it previously.
---
Ahh
---
That was certainly quite a turn of events of his artwork style ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
All the polls say it will be the most popular.
---
What do you mean "low"?
---
Supporting this.  You'll have a lot of "red is dead" types, but you'll also have plenty that won't bother if you're not around their level. Getting camped to the point it becomes griefing is very rare.  I've experienced it only once and I only knew of one person on my faction/server with a reputation for doing it. 
---
That said, gaming culture changed a lot in 15 years.  I used to get GG and GD, now I get KYS and GDIAF.
---
There‚Äôs no reason to stoneform an early blind though. You stoneform the blind after the KS into blind-&gt; sap reset when energy is too low to do anything but try to reset. Dwarf gets blinded -&gt; SF -&gt; blind rogue-&gt; sap. Open with cs/rupture/ vanish. Best possible outcome for enemy rogue is they sprint directly away from the rogue or break los so they can‚Äôt reopen with the bleed ticking.  
---
CD vs CD dwarf removes 1 blind, not to mention snares/bleeds meaning a clean vanish 100% of the time. UD has no counters and orc relies on RNG to resist the CS counter play opener.

Asked and answered numerous times. Check one of the other hundred identical posts for your answer.

Well it certainly wouldn't be a high point in my life
---
Credit where it's due! Glad you liked it.
---
I just wish we had plainsstriding :(
---
Even on private servers it is faster to die and run in if you include the pack on top. As an alliance you just get the quest trinket that kills you (no durability loss, and you do not need to unequip items). You will still reach the lockout.
---
You definitely need the current xpansion to play the current xpansions.
---
It's literally the same as modern wow except for the character models.
---
It's not going to be worth it assuming you're at the front of the pack.
---
For the Alliance!
---
On a brand new server you‚Äôre right you won‚Äôt get it around level 30, but mid 30s with help is doable. 
---
If you‚Äôre Alliance you can skip it and get the Bonebiter Axe, if you‚Äôre Horde oh well.
---
Decursive won't work in Classic.
---
That's not strictly a warrior quest, since paladins can do it too. Starts with a drop from Dire Mail (can be bought on the AH as well), ends with you doing a few steps during the Onyxia fight before killing her.
---
yeah and when speedrunning healing is not the issue most of the time, since most dps are stacked on LIPS and healing potions anyways. so when you already have 5 shamans for healing you dont want another raidspot thats not doing dps.
---
Real game, we've been playing for a month now.
---
The amount of days we have above 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F) was like 7 days per year so its not really worth it.
---
Im speaking about private homes of course, not offices.
---
I agree, just look into some other weps, corpdegrinder or what have you at that lvl
---
A warrior wants Sul'thraze, says it's not a hunter weapon.  Hunter tries to combine two bows and they explode and kill him, his pet is sad.
---
I lol'd
---
that is actually a really good idea :)
---
Thanks. I remember whipper tubers being one such consumable. Cheers!
---
BTW, do you use Arch?
---
Holy shit
---
I‚Äôve leveled enough warriors to learn the hard way lol
---
Nightfall? I dont see any reason to take it on a hunter vs a fury warrior spamming hamstring(30% more attack speed proc on fury alone makes them better)
---
also its terrible on ehnancement, they are the worst at consistently proccing it
---
Well yeah but even 80 or so you want AC, they don't even build houses without it any more over here and it tends to be colder here than most of Europe
---
Welp, we'll be waitin for ya down here at the bottom!
---
The 5-gig Classic client shares assets with BfA. I don't know how big the stand-alone Classic client will be, but it may be larger than 10 gigs.
---
"reeeeee but my leveling guide says I have to quest heeeeerrreeeee!"
---
Human warrior, miner and smith. Nothing magical, nothing out of the norm. Just your plain old Joe.

---
For some added nostalgia
---
Agreed, they should have just made the first movie about Jaina and arthas' descent
---
Imagine WoW 2 having these graphics, that would be amazing lol
---
We have it here and it's colder that most of Europe..... "need" is highly subjective I guess
---
Anyone else feel like the Undead and Night Elf leveling areas are seriously underrated? Tirisfal -&gt; Silverpine -&gt; etc... provides such a thematically consistent story for your Forsaken character (if you care about that stuff).
---
I was about to make a long reply about the whirlwind axe, but then I found this video that really explains everything:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igHxERi6idE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=igHxERi6idE) 
---
But, I wanna add this: Warriors are hugely dependent on gear while leveling (and also at max level), and getting the whirlwind axe (or the sword or mace which are also rewards from the quest chain) is such a huge boost to your damage and survivability, and thus a huge increase in your leveling speed. If you can get the whirlwind axe at level 30 it is definately worth it to do the chain. If you can't get it until level 40 you might aswell just get a weapon from some instance. However, the quest chain itself is pretty cool as far as I remember, and in general I just love class-specific quest chains.
---
You have no graphics card? You‚Äôll still be able to play but I don‚Äôt think it will look very good. Mine looked pretty shitty on my older i3, no graphics card. Way better once I got a card. Get a cheap card imo (~$100).
---
Horde has nice axes as quest rewards from 40-60. Pairs well with the axe spec in the arms tree. The only dungeon that is worth doing a couple times for a weapon is RFK (Corspemaker, it lasts you 10+ levels)
---
seeing stuff like this makes me thing of how cool world of Warcraft could be in UE4
---
I did a stint on a PvE server with some RL friends, I'd only ever roll around with PvP toggled on, and it was still so boring, very few other people would be flagged, much less trying to gank me.  I ended up telling my friends to either reroll on my PvP server, or I wasn't going to play much with them, as I was bored out of my mind on the PvE server.
---
They rerolled and they all managed to live with playing on a PvP server.
---
It‚Äôs not insane at all. Here‚Äôs the thing: these $160M are production costs. Add distribution fees, marketing fees etc. The estimated loss is around $15 to $60M.
---
There will be many warriors who will want to help since they want the axe as well. Certainly won't get it done at 30, but in the mid 30s should be doable and at that point it is still a good weapon.
---
If you are going super hard on release though then I can see your point since no one except other warriors will want to help probably (unless you have a group of good friends.) So then you might already reach the 40s before the other warriors catch up.
---
0.01 is not a whole number
---
I miss blowing up everything instantly.
---
They released it early it's sweet! Check it out man
---
isn‚Äôt the closed beta 5000 people?  that means absolutely nothing in the wider scheme of WoW subs
---
Me am that kind of orc
---
Sexy
---
People never stopped saying that, everyone just stopped paying attention to party chat after LFD became a thing and other players might as well be bots.
---
What spec will you be at endgame?
---
Stardew Valley, Sea of Thieves, classicbeta...
---
vanilla animations shenanigans
---
Game informer had this ad for a game on dreamcast called seaman. It showed a kid fucking a fish very passionately at home in his bed. I still remember seeing that fin and feed coming out of the blanket. Very disturbing advertisement that haunted me for a very long time
---
Yep, it will be first or second most popular
---
Hey thanks for the input, I‚Äôll probably do like you said here. Just need to see if all the cables can be stretched around. Bless!
---
Not bad thanks for the info!
---
So I need some opinions. I've never ran a warrior before but I want to in classic. Would I be able to level up as arms or fury and be a dps for dungeons while leveling up or is that frowned upon for warriors since they're the best tank in classic?
---
Hmm, I thought that command covered grass, try following this guide:  [https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=1100](https://forum.nostalrius.org/viewtopic.php?f=32&amp;t=1100) 
---
one of these commands should do the trick
---
&gt; It turned out to be 80 % Horde.
---
Hey, I found your problem.
---
Turns out, it wasn't a PvP server problem, it was a faction imbalance problem.
---
The rank-and-file human warrior is the most immersive for leveling.
---
You start off in the abbey as a peasant looking for work, get handed a sword, and get told to go kill kobolds. This is basically what happens when peasant units in WC3 get told to turn into militia units. But as you prove yourself to be a cut above the typical war grinder fodder, you start wearing whatever you can find. Anything to help close the gap between the power of you and your enemy, doesn't matter if it's leather or chainmail.
---
You use whatever weapons you can find; if it had a sharp pointy end and it's better than what you have, you're using it.
---
You expand your training, mastering the hodgepodge of junk you've plucked. You start to learn why you're more than just a schmuck out of Elwynn with anger issues, and what it means be a warrior. From drunken bar fights to Fray Isle, you've learned from the very best. And some of those people along the way have made you claw mouth-frothing tooth and nail to get gear worth half a damn.
---
You become a mercenary, going where the fight and money is. Mages, warlocks, paladins, who cares why they're traveling around? When the quest names it, you maim it. Nothing complex; kill, get paid, and move on.
---
A fully consumed warr will beat anyone if he's geared, they scale much harder off stats than other classes (Diamond flask, str/agi pieces, things like lionheart helm giving rediculous stats, etc etc.
---
While some of my fondest classic memories were on a freshly launched pvp server, I wont be rolling pvp on classic because I fit in the only have 1 to 3 hours to play at a time and I want to get stuff done category.
---
Awesome
---
You won't level as prot even if you want to tank in dungeons. You can/will tank as fury or arms while leveling anyways (assuming you wanted to tank). If you want the ease of grouping I would recommend at least learning how to tank.
---
I do gear checks for hogger, where the real men are made.
---
I figured less buttons for a beginner. Easy to just pop imp sprint and adren rush.
---
I hate retail. The PvP is easy as fuck as well, I think you are misunderstanding me. There are a SHIT ton of skills, but they have little impact. Classic has less skills, but every skill means a LOT. Timing needs to be perfect, counters, etc. The ultimate PvP imo. Retail is a shitty 20 button rotation mash. Fuck up 3 CDs? Don't worry, you have 4 more to save you. That was my point.
---
FOR THE HORDE!
---
Lmao.  This reminds me of wow drawings I would do in middle school.  10/10 school paper and everything
---
i put in all these commands, even downloaded a different client, still doesnt work.
---
Installed it a few times, end up using Manjaro and MX Linux the most.
---
I played vanilla, engineering wasn‚Äôt that common and characters min-maxing specifically for PVP was also not that common.  
---
It will be nice when there is a population of players similar to vanilla and not pserver redditors everywhere
---
If you don't have a fetish of having your head crushed between a muscular female orcs thighs can you really call yourself a man?
---
&gt;Orc Shamans are out because the totems are clearly of Tauren design.
---
They're Tauren because Orcish shamanism didn't include totems. WC3 shamans were leather-robed and claw-equipped spellcasters.   
---
The Tauren race introduced the outer of turns to the horde, and it was incorporated into Horde shamanism.
---
&gt;Undead Priests are out for obvious reasons. Actually the Undead as a whole don't make a lick of sense but whatever.
---
The Forsaken are human(oid)s in an undead body. There is nothing "undead" about their mind and soul.   
---
As for sense, you're talking about a game where undead are one of the most populous creature types. An entire expansion dedicated to them...
---
&gt;Yeah, that's why two Alliance races can be Warlocks and there are Warlock trainers, complete with demons in tow, in every village.
---
And Night Elves draw on demonic energies in order to hunt demons (WC3 campaign.)
---
&gt;Yeah, what a class to give to Dwarves, who literally live in an *Iron Forge*.
---
Iron Forge uses lava straight from the core of the earth, they do not burn trees to run the Iron Forge. 
---
&gt;Gnomes are a joke too. Dwarves are pushing it but they at least make up in width in what they lack in height, but Gnomes? They're like fat five year old kids. They should be literally incapable of any martial activity.
---
Dwarves are magical creatures whereas humans are straight flesh and blood. They're literally carved from rock by titans.
---
Gnomes are also magical in origin, also created by the titans. Where dwarves are "stone" gnomes were originally mechanoids, and it stands to reason they aren't entirely humanoid despite outward appearances.
---
Your post should have been in the tone of a question, not accusatory.
---
Time is money friend!
---
It was still ranged bud, not melee
---
Can¬¥t really say due to subreddit rules, but it¬¥s a larger one starting with L.
---
Not 4K through a phone....
---
Why u jelly of my closet? Didn‚Äôt m teach u to clean out yours too.
---
People are more knowledgeable, therefore most people will know what they are in for picking certain classes. I can imagine people going out of their way to level druid, gear them for flag carrying and spec into the flag carry spec will also dish out 80g for gnomish engineering to be topdog flag carrier.
---
It's basically giving you another class' worth of abilities ontop of your own.
---
Hi, that is some detailed run down. From what I have read it's still not 100% clear if the mage (in this case the main character) can send food via mail to an alt (I want to try out/build a support profession/whatever), like I remember doing in wrath.
---
Give me Stormwind from Warcraft (2004)
---
Human
---
shamans are infinitely more annoying. the main thing is the ranged slow that shamans have, when paladins have no slows. mages can blink out of stuns, but slows really own them.
---
thats why every video of a baddass 1vx mage in vanilla was a horde mage. making clowns out of warriors, paladins, and rogues in packs.
---
and only alliance videos i remeber are crit montages and 3minute mages.
---
Troll druid isn't until cata tho, same as worgen. Druids were tauren and night elf only in vanilla to wrath.
---
Do you live in the US ? Well I have seen what materials you use for houses ;)
---
When its 80 outside (which it is under 30 days a year maybe) it is like 72 inside.
---
Thats pretty much the perfect temperature anyway.
---
This is amazing. So excited for the old world again
---
What the hell is a poopsock?
---
I'm in northern Wisconsin, I don't think I'd want to deal with 80s without AC
---
I've never played on a private server. I'm remembering how it was back it the day. I did look up some private server meta to improve though. 
---
Like I said in my other comment to /u/staged_interpreter . Much of the difficulty I remembering with PuGs in ST while healing as shadow most likely stems from the lack of marking back in the day. While being able to actually mark crap and without lagging all the time, it's probably way easier to do ST than I'm remembering. Either way there is definitely an increase in difficulty from mara to ST, that new healers may want to be aware of to make sure to have a high enough leveled tank.

That ironforge looks amazing

Isn't the same music that Wailing Caverns ?
---
No i mean the stress test where anyone with a sub got in. Also a lot of people subbed with hopes of getting into the beta
---
I know some of the people that worked on it (guy I'm thinking of specifically is an animator) and based on everything he told me about it, I highly doubt that will happen.
---
It was a mess behind the scenes of that movie apparently, and he was convinced the movie was going to do terribly at the box office long before it was finished.
---
If you got the ram, maybe. Though the BFA really struggles to even load in boralus last i tried on that c740. It only has 2GB of ram that's soldered to the board
---
Wow, Etherlords was in there.
---
My friend used to represent druids as trees in his drawings at school always made me laugh
---
Compared to cringing from the cow people, gnomes/goblins, werewolves, space goats, etc running past you. I'm glad pandas is where we drew the line.
---
No. Even with BWL and farming you're going to miss the boat, there's so many things that need to happen. You won't even get close and you'll most likely miss the entire gong ringing altogether.
---
Just facts, this is like 100+ hours a week type event, let alone less than 100 hours in a month.
---
I'd only like to see a second one if they'd stop trying to hard to make it PG-13. There was very little realism and blood/gore when it came to the fighting, it felt like all of the deaths were due to blunt force trauma as opposed to getting hacked down by a 2h axe or impaled with a sword/spear.
---
It also felt like they were trying way to hard to keep some of the darker scenes from being, well.... dark? For example that scene where the young prince gets separated from his farther and alliance solders by that magic wall and was left to face the orcs on his own while all his father could do was watch. That should have been a brutal and horrific scene where the father watches his screaming son get torn to shreds right in front of his eyes but instead they turned it into this faux heroic act where he screams for azeroth and valiantly charges into 10+ orcs that he stands no chance of beating.
---
As MisterShillington says, priests get the quest for Benediction/Anathema which is one of the most awesome class quests I've seen in the game.
---
I'll assume you don't know it (because then I get to relive it while explaining lol), but basically you loot an epic item that has a 50% droprate from Majordomo Executus in Molten Core (meaning you need to fight the other priests in the raid to get the item like any other loot/item that drops in the raid), and then you need to either kill Lord Kazzak in Blasted Lands OR farm high level elites in Winterspring (you need a group to do this) to get the 2nd half which you need to combine with the one you picked up from Majordomo. Then, once you've got both items, you're ready to start the quest which takes place in Eastern Plaguelands where you need to cleanse and heal injured soldiers as they try to escape undeads attempting to kill them. 
---
If you manage to kill x amout of soldiers you'll be rewarded with benediction. If you fail, you have to wait I think 24 hours before you can give the quest an attempt again. It's absolutely amazing! I might have forgotten a few details about the quest since it's been \~14 years since I did it, but all in all that's how the quest works.
---
Bonus info: Having benediction in a battleground is like having a permanent hunters mark on you and will make everyone on the opposing team focus fire you xD
---
Paladins will blessing of sacrifice on the warrior to become unsheepable though.
---
.TGA files, you needed to go seek out software to open them, but it was a quick google search in any case. It changed to JPEG in 2.1.0. I remember being annoyed about it back when I started the game, didn't make any sense to save screenshots in a format that default windows software couldn't read but I'm sure it had it's reason. 
---
[Source.](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Changing_the_screenshot_format)
---
Does this happen because of the console commands?
---
Holy is God tier for both pvp and pve, honestly have no clue all the people who swear by Ret are so against the idea of literally taking control of any battle with heals and blessings and when you get enough spell gear you can even burst absolutely anyone down.
---
He seriously broke his computer over that? Bro, email blizzard and restore it. Yeah the gf fucked up bad but that guy's got anger issues
---
I hope the artist is cool with it, but here is an upscaled version:

---
Once I got spell power gear, 31/0/20 was insanely fun and I zero problems with melee and 50/50 casters while still keeping up all my teammates.
---
SM/ruin is the go-to for raids and it's fine for PVP. Your shadowbolts will still be big dick burst, take shadowburn and go wild
---
Yeah there are mods, though you need to pick a class the uses a smallish number of abilities
---
The logs were talking about are literally just an image of overall dps for the total run. My point was we don't actually have the logs to check, so we cant filter for 'Spell Vulnerability'. 
---
There's a link floating around of Esfand using Might of Menethil on his character back in vanilla, but that doesn't say anything about how effective a paladin with Nightfall is or whether or not Esfand is using it when he does this run on a private server (which is what I assume this is. If it's a run from 14 years ago, it's even less relevant. Clearly we know more about the game now and are able to play better outside of the cookie cutter builds).
---
Oh, okay. Thank you. After researching some more, I'm probably going to go SM/Ruin and have it almost equally good when raiding and PVPing.
---
No, it's because you let the ret in and everyone else seen that they can play bullshit specs too.  Have fun bringing your fire mages to Molten Core.
---
Sweet Jesus this is perfect. It looks gorgeous.
---
I hope we get most of them eventualy. If someone will do Cataclysm that would be great, it has the best voice acting and is second only to this one in terms of fucking awesome.
---
Ignore the generic "works for any game" 3rd party applications like Xpadder.
---
There's a WoW addon called [ConsolePort](http://consoleport.net/) that makes playing with a controller really easy. There's a Windows program called WoWmapper they also develop that you'll need. The developers are making a Classic version right now.
---
It's not hacky at all, it completely changes the UI to be controller friendly. Even typing in chat.
---
I think you're underrating the ability to wield a shield. A shield is a ton of armor on it's own, you'll be more resilient than most casters with just a shield even if you were decked out in cloth. And you likely won't be as a Shaman, it will be a mix.
---
I mean no one mage should be able to take on a warrior and Paladin, just cause you said ‚Äúin packs‚Äù cause freedom / cleanse and the warrior has hamstring so no kiting. 
---
1v1 tho mages own me lol as a holy Paladin I run out of options quick and the mage can just keep resetting
---
Mana burn is MUCH more effective than viper sting, especially considering sting is a disease/poison iirc?
---
There's a reason mana burn was flat out removed from the game down the road.
---
Okay gotcha, appreciate your insight!
---
It's stuff like this that just makes me wish blizzard would make a WoW2 that is just classic but with heavily updated graphics and more realistic game mechanics. Same everything else. Dunno why that's not a thing they are going for.
---
Could play spriest. If you just never leave shadowform the number of abilities you have available is pretty small, could maybe even fit some trinkets in.
---
They did this with EverQuest. It didn't help that they releases EQ2 right around the same time that WoW came out, after a couple of weak expansions to the original game including the original FoH plane of time drama where Furor wrote his letter to Sony and turned the site into a WoW site. 
---
Those 2 things are what ended EQs short, albeit memorable, reign as top dog for MMOs. That said I think the game is still around but last I knew people just bitter full groups and has mercenaries (npc healers/tanks/dps) in order to complete content. It's an absolute shadow of what it once was.
---
Yeah in 1986 not in online surveys on websites more sequestered.
---
Again, put up or shut up.

Yeah, I bet it isn't what most people would consider playable for areas like that.
---
Put up what exactly because from what I see you're citing bullshit then claiming it's a valid source. I'm not claiming I have a cited source behind a $44 paywall and providing no understanding of the literature.

That's 22 easy binds. Plenty for any class.
---
Foror's Compendium of Dragon Slaying. 
---
Sadly, paladins can get this too. Myself being a main warrior, I think it's wrong, but whatever - that's how the game is :)
---
Basically you either get the compendium from Dire Maul (random drop from bosses or trash) or you buy it from the auction house for some obscure price once someone decides to put it on. Then, you venture into Onyxia's Lair, place the sword in the ground and asks Onyxia kindly to do her flame breath on the sword. After this, you kill Onyxia and then I can't remember exactly what happens. I think you loot the sword from the ground, pushes it into the dragon or something, and maybe venture back to Dire Maul to collect your reward - Quel'Serrar. Not 100% sure.
---
The blade Quel'Serrar is still to this day, 15 years since WoW was released, in my top two of coolest swords in the game. The only one that beats it is Thunderfury. All other swords - cool as they may be - just can't compete with Quel'Serrar or TF, and I cried a bit the day Blizzard allowed players to get the fake Quel'Serrar. What is it called - Burnished Quel'Serrar?
---
My point is: QUEL'SERRAR IS SUCH A COOL SWORD! :D
---
If you look close you can see everyone jumping off the zep and dying if they don‚Äôt hit the roof.
---
did they use Dubrovnik to shoot this?  because it looks just like Kings Landing
---
&gt; older individuals are more likely to be taking surveys.
---
This is what you said. It is false.
---
I can almost hear the guard going "heelloooooooo"
---
Ok
---
It's really not that hard to get. There will be lots of warriosr that wants to do it with you, and killing the fire elementals as 2-3 man isn't bad at all, plus you do some decent exp. Later you just 5man the quest with all the other warriors that need to do it. Lots of fast warrior levers do it, some do skip it but honestly it's a really fun quest and since it's not definitively bad, I would recommend doing it.
---
Rogue in general, so much cool flavour added to the class
---
It's vanilla bruh, it's not about having 22 binds, it's about being able to swap between them because most of the time you'll need maybe 3.
---
Simple question : Why are most questions are concerning Warlocks when they represent a minority of players?
---
PS: I just want to feel like a special snowflake as a future Alliance warlock
---
Yeah less best dependant is really nice, but I've been learning that Spriest also scales poorly which kinda sucks. If a Spriest can still get out 1v1'd by a geared up mage it kind of hurts our niche a little lol.
---
when i looked it up the break even point was about $450 million.  You have to take into account opportunity cost of having all that much money tied up in a movie when it could be making more in other investments
---
Really interested in the answers on this one. I have the same exact question.
---
You've provided nothing in citation to claim it's false, you merely will me to take your word for it. You don't have to believe me, I don't care.
---
We shall wait and go on his adventure together üòÇüòÇ
---
Yeah I wasn‚Äôt planning on that...
---
What? Are you talking about when you respec? Because otherwise you absolutely do bind all your abilities and hardly ever "swap" between them.
---
I play on a private server where - when you kill someone within 5 levels of you (or are killed by someone within 5 levels of you) you drop a couple equipped items and items in your bag too.
---
After getting acclimated to this, pvp in retail/classic is ENTIRELY stress free.

Wohoo! :D
---
GameStop release for Vanilla was epic as fuck.
---
The line was massive.
---
I highly recommend you don't put points into Prot while leveling. You can tank just fine without the talents and you severely gimp your mob-killing abilities when not in a dungeon. 
---
Use a dps spec to level, put on a shield when tanking and you'll be fine.
---
Whoa wait a minute there. Dwarf is the best in terms of looks.
---
Me: Wow, what a great piece of thematic artwork! I'll just click here to see the rest of his stuff! At work!
---
Me 5 seconds later: *furiously closing the page and looking behind my back*
---
Down ranking, it's very easy to have 3 of a spell type on several abilities. Most of the time you use them so rarely you click them.
---
Do you. Don‚Äôt let bad friends hold you back. I‚Äôm in the same boat. A few of my friends go hard, the others don‚Äôt. I completely leave them in the dust and do my own thing.

there is no way in hell theyd ever make an R rated warcraft movie.  They are banking on the kid market wanting to see the movie to make their money

Kargoz makes alot of good guides that are easy to follow on how to lvl all classes etc. really recommend his stuff if ur wondering about other classes aswell
---
Except I have provided evidence. You might not think it very useful, but it is. And considering you have nothing but your opinion, that leaves you with nothing.
---
If there was anything available to support your claim, you'd have found it by now. But you won't, because you can't, because you're a liar.
---
I believe they said they are having cross realm BGs right from the get go- so that will help all faction imbalanced servers get in BG‚Äôs at least.
---
I haven't played warcraft 3. But I will someday. So I cannot tell which characters of warcraft 3 are in the books I read. I read chronicle volume 1, the last guardian, rise of the horde, lord of the clans, part 1 and 2 of war of the ancients and before the storm. 
---
On my book shelf are still: beyond the far portal, day of the dragon and the Sundering.
---
Richard Knaak's books are especially very good imo. They have long build ups around the characters. Though they can be a tough read. 
---
I have just finished the second part of war of the ancients: The Demon Soul. The whole trilogy covers the first war against the demons with a little twist in the timeline. It contains Cenarius, Malfurion and Illidan Stormrage, Archimonde, Sargeras, Mannoroth, Xavius, Krasus and Rhonin, Broxigar, Tyrande Whisperwind, Korialstrasz, Neltharion and the other aspects.
---
After reading it I understand the expansion Legion way better. Also I now get the whole lore around the well of eternity dungeons added in Cataclysm. 
---
Christie Golden her books are a easy read, good if you don't read books often. She covers the whole back story well, but imo goes too fast through all events. 
---
To get back to your question, I looked up the main characters of  Warcraft 3: Archimonde, Cenarius, Tyrande, Malfurion and Illidan are in War of the Ancients.
---
Rise of the Horde covers: Ner'zul, Thrall, Drek'Thar and Gul'dan.
---
Time travel was WoD though. I don't recall much of that happening in mop if any..  like what examples are you talking about for cata and mop.
---
I mean besides an entire faction storyline where we overthrew the hordes war chief in the siege of orgrimmar, yeah sure you can say nothing happened. Also plenty of old God stuff with the sha. It was just as impactful as any other expansion to the overall story..
---
Idk why you'd say art as it's very clearly wow. The lore was typical ally vs horde with a new neutral faction thrown in that gets pretty sick quickly of both sides messing everything up. Turns out a lot of it is due to old God influences which we largely take care of and we tag up to deal with a conqueror in throne of thunder who's been amassing an army and then to overthrow garrosh who has gone off the deep end. Seems pretty typical wow to me.
---
And aesthetics you can argue it's something new to the game but its not like wow is strictly this Tolkien like fantasy with humans and dwarfs and orcs. A lot of wow races borrow aesthetics from irl races that you wouldn't normally find in such genres. Taurens clearly draw some native American Indian influences, night elves seem to draw some Japanese influence with the style of their buildings. Gnomes and goblins are a whole lot of steam punk. Troll stuff reminds me of either aztecs/mayans etc or voodoo stuff in the Caribbean. We have draenei who are literally aliens (and the expansion they came with we literally went to another world) so maybe you just don't like Chinese aesthetics but I'd hardly call it out of place when wow already has some insanely diverse aesthetics throughout the game.
---
Very phallic!
---
The whole point of pvp is to have good and bad experiences. Most often a good experience for one player is bad experience for another.
---
Takes you back to your first Undead levelling experience. What a gem! Awesome work
---
Downranking is a super niche thing for a few classes that I doubt a 6 year old would ever even care about.
---
How stupid are you?
---
&gt; no US actor wants to be in the movie franchise equivalent of a foreign advertisement
---
Uh, why not? High profile US actors play in worse things than that all the time.
---
That implies you have anything but your opinion because I doubt an article for 1986 contains information on online surveys. 
---
What are you flipflopping between and why?
---
im hoping for some anime WOW movies, or a series.
---
No, but I can if need be. Didn‚Äôt know if my basic computer could handle one...
---
"That's 22 easy binds. Plenty for any class." Except it's not. You normally get aggressive when you're caught telling lies.

What are the unmarked areas in Kalimdor?
---
A few times but I think I settled. I originally wanted to roll the opposite faction as an Enhance Shaman so I can relive my BC days but quickly realized I can‚Äôt...because it‚Äôs not BC. Then I was gonna go NE Druid for all the flexibility it offers, mainly Feral, but recently looks like it‚Äôs even more memespec compared to PServers and I don‚Äôt want to gimp myself that much in end game. I almost certain Iv settled on a Gnome Mage at this point. Yea it‚Äôll be an over populated class but Iv never played caster but it looks like a good mix of high viability and QoL class mechanics.
---
Us landlubbers were thougher than you thought. You had to improvise!!
---
Can gnomes choose between mech and ram mount?
---
Paladins are more annoying in basically every way.
---
Sure you can win 1v1 versus a ret paladin, it will be annoying as hell to kill him though wiht zero cd dispell and freedom etc and his infinite use of OP CD's.
---
But a paladin in a fight is the most annoying thing for a mage. He can cleanse, freedom melees, and you literally cannot CC a paladin. 
---
Shamans on the other hand aren't that annoying in big pvp, as long as you watch out for grounding totem and his ranged silence then you can easily CC him.
---
In 1v1 ele shaman is technically a skill fight, but all you have to do to win as a mage is to not fuck up counterspell. That's it. Don't get fakecasted, don't have grounding down, and you win. Enhancement shaman is free win.
---
Don‚Äôt agree entirely with all of this, but I‚Äôd like to add that world PvP at 60 is FAR more content than a PVE server can provide.
---

Oh. So it's not about age
---
There isn't a single class that a 6 year-old can't play 100% of the game available to him with 22 binds.
---
You normally get stupid when you're caught not having read anything.

---
Sorry about that! Added NSFW edit.

Hope you're still employed
---
Technology != industrialisation.
---
Ironforge is not surrounded by a sprawling metropolis.  It's inside a mountain with rolling hills and mountains full of animals and trees surrounding it.  
---
Same with Aerie Peak, and Loch Modan.  A base built into a mountain and a technological marvel that is a Giant Dam.  But the fields are still green and the lake is still blue.
---
Basically, there is a big difference between a people who utilize technology like guns, forges, etc. and a people hell bent on industrializing everything they see.
---
I used to do a 1070 SLI setup, it was handy when it worked though.
---
Warlocks totally fit. 
---
They actively hide their practices of the dark arts because it is frowned upon.
---
In SW, the main warlock hub is hidden beneath a tavern so that noone can discover their occult activities.
---
I'm going to try it on my surface pro during the next stress test. Probably min graphics but,meh. Playing in bed sounds wonderful.
---
Spriest can 1v1 anyone. Ele shaman is more group friendly though. If you like to BG a shaman is way more useful. Spriests can have all their damage cleansed by paladins. Shamans will burst key targets. What‚Äôs a healer guna do when he gets insta blasted by a shaman after a warrior just charge stunned him? Spriests can‚Äôt burst like that. So dots or burst?
---
Druid Feral dps not being competitive is only with regards to endgame raiding. You have nothing to worry about there.
---
You need to learn how to read.
---
I'm still waiting for any link of yours that suggests the opposite. Moron.
---
Only if you have 9,000+ mana
---
You definitely need a lot of patience with those slow 3+ seconds swings that get parried, dodged or miss all the time...  
---
It gets better around 30-40 when you get whirlwind axe, whirlwind ability and later mortal strike (they give you an actual extra attack instead of just amplifying it like heroic strike)...

---
What is Polymorph??
---
Bloodscalp
---
Instant poison is better. Guess you can use shadow pots on Garr because he's immune to nature.
---
Sure, but there isn't a single glass that can't play the game with only auto attacks. You're being vague to word a win but there is reason to have over 22 key binds and you claimed that there was no reason to have over that.
---
IIRC its good on a warrior offtank bc of one of their abilities during downtime. But yeah, shaman is the worst of the three but enh will still use it, and if they dont give it to a warrior its going to a hunter, but odds are there will be one warrior on bitch duty
---
hahahha yes, i was trying so desperately and unsuccessfully to attract patrons supporters that i sold my soul to the devil. Fortunately that was just a dark phase that lasted a couple of months. 
---
Now i dont care about patrons but mi art! &lt;3

People are people horde and alliance doesnt really define shit. It comes down to what they like esthetically not what kind of character they have. Both sides are generally the same.
---
Correct - Several songs in Vanilla were used multiple times, this being one of them. Some are unique, most aren't
---
The farming cannot easily be done solo. If you‚Äôre able to do it solo it‚Äôll be far too slow to keep up with any other guilds that are doing it as a group.
---
For the horde!
---
Waiting for the link to what? You keep implying you cited a source but you might as well linked let me google that for you because you didn't  read into it at all. You just hoped you dropped a link and I'd just agree with you instead of acting checking to see if you're making things up again.
---
Go ahead and list the 23 or more keybinds that any class would need and I'll prove to you that you're wrong.
---
nazi punks FUCK OFF
---
Press esc instead of enter after typing, and push macro right away is possible?
---
This is my biggest concern. Back in 04 I had little responsibilities, so I was able to power to 60 relatively fast. It kept me ahead of the people who stop leveling to gank/camp people 5+ levels lower than them.
---
This time around, I am worried I will be stuck getting griefed from level 25-40.
---
Some less serious premades do bring a shadowpriest for extra defence, but you would still need a rogue to stay with you. A solo shadowpriest can't take down a druid with decent gear.
---
I'm 100% locked in to playing Priest. 100% locked in to healing because from what I've seen no one on the Horde has any real plans to play healers and all the priests are going shadow.
---
It's something I've never done before (heal, I tanked in Legion but mostly dps'd before then) on a content patch I've never played before (started playing the game a couple weeks before BC launch) so I'm ridiculously excited. Big thing that worries me is I've been using *a server that apparently is not to be named* to test leveling up to 12 and killing things is stupid slow, even when I grab a wand (which probably won't be a thing first day of Classic) shield&gt;smite&gt;pain&gt;wand takes forever. Might have to grab the first warrior I find and never let him out of my sight.
---
But I've also been watching too much Venruki/Ziqo/Xaryu and I --love-- pvp so I'll also probably sneak in a Mage after I've put an undetermined amount of time in on my Priest.
---
Most of the comments you leave are very wierd.
---
Yes. Though mostly on faction and race. my friends and I all played alliance in vanilla and we‚Äôre constantly going back and forth between basically the nostalgia of doing it again or the excitement of playing a new faction and discovering a whole other side of the game for the first time like 2004.
---
If you logged out for 2 hours, played an alt, then came back and he was *still* waiting for you, then I'd call that a win for you.  You made some retard waste 2 hours of time waiting for you to spawn up, meanwhile you were leveling an alt, doing a dungeon or BG, or playing the AH or something productive, while he just sat there like a fool.
---
There was no twitch back then
---
‚ÄúSome farming‚Äù is likely 10,000 kills of elite mobs. This will take a group longer to do than most took to farm their epic mount.

I'm playing retail for the summer (yeah...yeah....) and I was really disappointed to find that the zeppelins were removed here and replaced with portals.

How so? You going to set up the rules that it's for a 6 year old and that aspirations are only to play the game? By your contrived perspective if I gave a 6 year old the controller not plugged in, they're experiencing the game because they don't know any better.
---
You see, I can't click the bag so every single inventory slots needs a keybind? How fun is it to try and talk about something when the points are as silly as yours?

Let's stay above the name calling thing, we can disagree and still be civil
---
I love how you can see west fall off in the distant right
---
Yup
---
And no one will miss you.
---
Both classes compete for a lot of gear pieces so don‚Äôt worry too much about the overpopulation :p
---
Dwarf for sure.
---
Everything is better even racials.
---
Druid, Warlock and Hunter.... everyday :)
---
Who cares if it‚Äôs the lowest whole number %. That‚Äôs very strange you bring that up because it has nothing to do with anything except to further your strange agenda of calling this fake.
---
Things can have lower than 1% chance of happening, so what‚Äôs your point here exactly?
---
Teenagers probably love this pc.
---
But adults, come on...
---
You can run it on almost anything, though I wouldn't recommend going under 400 or so
---
No, there's disagreeing and then there's following me around in threads I post in just to pick a baseless argument that has nothing to do with the thread in any case.
---
I don't remember his name, I blocked him. But he's 100% pure bred idiot.
---
Warlock is not low dps in later raids.
---
Well, in Diablo you could just leave and make a new game, with a password, and you knew when people went hostile and could book it back to town before they found you.
---
Yeah there's a lot of salty, jealous people in here coming up with reasons to bash this dude.
---
Gotta get that crescent staff/wingblade
---
I don't think teaching him to play WoW with a controller is going to be good for his WoW future.  
---
I mean what if he can never unlearn it and people call him a noob for being less reactive than mouse/keyboard? You don't want that for your son.  
---
Do the right thing. Teach him the way of manhood. Teach him on a keyboard and mouse.
---
So They are viable in endgame dungeons as well? :)
---
What is blessing of sacrifice ?
---
Druid/priest. At least once a week I am certain that I will be playing one of these. And then next week I have definently decided to play the other. Wont now what actually happens till release and I get ti make the chars
---
Right I know and I was okay with that but the idea of their being some random cave somewhere that‚Äôs tucked away in a corner that I don‚Äôt know about cause t may be apart of a class quest that I don‚Äôt know of that is going to irk me
---
I plan on using a steam controller for some of the leveling process. It's highly customizable and has the added benefit of a trackpad for mouse control. Just need to add wow.exe as a game in steam.
---
No official bluepost afaik, but John Hight and Omar Gonzales talked about it in an interview: https://youtu.be/O3b423uqrdo?t=553
---
I played a druid healer during BC and WotLK and really loved that style. What's it like in classic?
---
I had a very different pvp experience on my pve server of suramar.
---
 Do you remember which server you played on?
---
Yes, this is the correct answer.  RIP me earning my second degree this year.

Any computer can handle a graphics card as long as your power supply can handle it and your motherboard has a pci-e slot. Check the wattage on your power supply. If it‚Äôs low, you can either upgrade that too or get a low power graphics card.
---
Ok, im one of those: I have no idea how to make screenshots without the need to use paint.
---
My point is that 1% is not "easily likely" as /u/mokacoffay says.
---
It's not likely at all.
---
And it's natural to be skeptical of something very unlikely happening when there's a perfectly reasonable explanation for what actually happened, especially when internet fame and attention are involved.
---
The people arguing that he correctly guessed a random number out of 100 are the ones that think the magic they see in Vegas shows is real.

Is this just fantasy?
---
I played on a PvE serer for a while at the behest of some RL friends, and I was flagged 100% of the time, and it was lame.  Not a lot of like minded people that were flagged as well.
---
People will try to say that flagging yourself on a PvE server is identical to playing on a PvP server, but thats hilariously wrong.  On a PvE server, someone could just be running around you acting all chill while you're flagged, then all of a sudden decide to attack you (which is fine), but on a PvP server, you could choose to make the first move, rather than being the flagged target waiting for a challenger.
---
Basically, in my experience, the only people I fought on a PvE server were opportunistic bitches who would only fight if they got the jump.  PvP server, whoever decides to initiate gets the jump, which for me, a bloodthirsty killer, is good.
---
I dont think Hardiness is generally better. Its really fucking good but it's RNG and you can always just not resist while wotf is 100% guaranteed to take effect.
---
I'll roll undead for sure beacuse i prefer to have control over what happens. And playing mirror matches and me resisting a full kidney would just feel so slimy and unengaging. Its like playing basketball against a cripple.
---
It's totally inefficient, just skip it if you care about speed. I've got ir once and I don't need to do that long ass chain again.
---
Well best to block him as you dad and move on, sorry I didn't know the full context
---
For casual groups, no one will care anyways. It‚Äôs hard enough gathering 40 people to raid cooperatively. Min/maxing guilds are a different story.
---
Yeah because that works in 1v1s lmao

I only don't like the 2h stance of ud male warrior. Looks weak af.

You did not seriously take a photo of your screen with your phone right?

I love you too

But why was Ashitaka banned? Something happened in Mononoke hime? I don't remember.

Yeah, I know that I am a pain in the ass to have an argument with but I try not ad hominem. I will admit though, in the three discussions I've had I found the speed of the replies to be easy to reply to before I got bored of trying to convey my thoughts instead of just not participate.
---
No, they didn't make the "rule" that it's for a 6 year old. OP was literally asking about setting up a controller for his 6 year-old son to play WoW.
---
Way to not read anything.
---
But why is duke banned?
---
For the Horde!!
---
Combat is really bad at PvP compared to other specs, I'll be the dagger rogue of my guild and I've accepted my fate to wpvp in pve dagger spec. But nobody should have to go through that pain if they can avoid it.
---
What improved sprint offers to a rogue, prep offers it through second vanish.
---
Plus your adrenaline rush means that you will actually be facing your enemies instead of of just stun locking your enemies with 2 CBs to back up your damage. Which means that you should know how to survive and know your limits.
---
If you plan on going Alliance and have a friend or two you can do  [Murdaloc](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=739/murdaloc) at lvl 30 for a great 2h in no time at all compared to WW axe.  
---
Then run SM in your high 30's for [Bonebiter](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=6830/bonebiter)
---
Don‚Äôt the steam wheel cartel guard the zeppelins? Otherwise a incredible picture and the maker should feel proud!
---
I'm aiming to play fairly casually (a couple of hours a night) but I think this will still end up being too hardcore for my irl friends I'm planning to play with.
---
We've all got 3 days booked off of work a week after launch. If they're not burnt out by then, then there's hope. :)
---
lmao he didnt do shit
---
Only if it‚Äôs after they go to reset, I never saw a single rogue try to tea a gouge after a SF blind. Besides you can blind facing away so there‚Äôs no reason to be gouged. The blind reset relies on the 5s window dropping combat to enter stealth and sap for pooling more energy. You won‚Äôt have the energy ticks to support additional CC if you open as if you are going to blind/sap reset. I highly doubt many if any players will zg/tea preemptively against SF.
---
I'm no expert but it seems you have filler points in Intensity, Fel Concentration, and Imp COA. I would probably prioritize either imp curse of weakness (ask RL if they want it up), or the other 5pt in tier 1 destruction to conserve Mana - if you can skip a couple lifetaps where you'd otherwise be casting shadowbolt that's great. At least the intensity points, unless you're planning on duo AOE grinding with a healer I don't see where it would be useful.
---
I roll Tauren Hunter with skin/herb and it feels really immersive as well.
---
But they ar e so sexy tho
---
Same two race class combos for me! My plan is to go Troll Spriest first while leveling (and try to collect the blue PvP set), then respec for healing in raids. I'll have a Tauren Ele Shaman alt and want to try to get the T0.5 set for fun as I never did it in vanilla, will probably just run dungeons and PvP, only raiding as an alt when the opportunity arises.
---
I've heard a lot of good rogue and mage players saying they like rogue vs. mage because it can go either way and its generally about mindgames and outplaying your opponent.
---
I am almost positive I will be rolling an orc hunter. But every once and a while a small voice creeps into my head ... "warlock."
---
Acer aspire older models are in this range and totally capable machines.
---
I'd consider it a must-watch if you're a fan of Warcraft/WoW. It's not true to lore or anything, but simply seeing all these locations brought to life in a big-budget movie is really breathtaking.
---
Everyone is unique and special in this version of the game but I mean there is the weirdness of warlock or Druid for you if you gonna insist on being extra weird with room to choose a different role config than the one your talents can optimally back
---
Haha, this is wonderful
---
I could say the same to you considering I quoted what I replied to above. You can't play any class with 22 binds in classic, it's a disingenuous statement and like I said before, you can assume the 6 year old is so unaware they are "playing" the game by just watching someone else. 
---
Hell, one could even argue that the 6 year old will not need more than 4 buttons because that's really all you need to play a hunter when you have no idea what is going on. Instead it boiled into a contest of validating the 22 binds as if that had anything to do with the problem. All the 6 year olds I know would do better with a keyboard than that 22 bind controller combo setup. In what world would a 6 year old be able to actually function with that combo system to the point where it would actually be needed?
---
As a kid I always called it "Trust Fall Glades"
---
Yeah that was what I was thinking too
---
Only if it‚Äôs after they go to reset, I never saw a single rogue try to tea a gouge after a SF blind. Besides you can blind facing away so there‚Äôs no reason to be gouged. The blind reset relies on the 5s window dropping combat to enter stealth and sap for pooling more energy. You won‚Äôt have the energy ticks to support additional CC if you open as if you are going to blind/sap reset. I highly doubt many if any players will zg/tea preemptively against SF.  
---
SF can be even stronger vs daggers because of the energy costs limiting how much can be pooled for CC if you are trying to burst a player down.  
---
Source: I ganked many dagger rogues in BRM
---
No, I asked why there weren't any US actors locked into franchises that aren't well thought of in the US, but are profitable in China.
---
For the Horde!!!
---
lol yeah, this guy describing the accounting methods of movie studies seems like quite the nazi
---
Correct, I'm hoping to just get him to kill some boars, although he's really competitive and extremely good at games lol. Idk If you've played dauntless, but he rarely gets downed and does more damage than I do
---
Preach
---
It's still 210~ million usd in the rest of the world making it worth a sequel just with that. And with China obviously gonna jump on the next one it's an obvious success.
---
BoP was op in phase 3 Nefarian, I guess horde just had a bunch of mages for that?
---
Sweet. So all I would need is Consoleport and then Wowmapper?
---
[Every time](https://i.imgur.com/y6pxQ1k.gif)
---
Yeah I also started young but he's very "Go go go go go", and I can see him getting frustrated trying to navigate on a big keyboard
---
You can buy 1000 gold for $15, then buy the enchants with it 
---
So no do not double sub
---
Only been answer a million times already...
---
Troll.
---
It‚Äôs warrior, shaman, rogue, warlock, or priest for me. Once in a while Druid or mage sneaks in there too. I need beta access. What am I doing with my life?
---
I remember people saying that if you're a healer you just make another character to do the farming and solo stuff.
---
Out of all the streamers and  all the times they‚Äôve done stupid stuff like this, It‚Äôs completely reasonable to assume one of them at one point called a 1% chance gamble. That‚Äôs completely reasonable. And it‚Äôs also safe to assume that it would be posted to reddit. 
---
Being skeptical is one thing, calling something fake without proof is another.
---
Of course I will, 100%. He's already played a bit. but I can't deny the fact that he has a hard time WASD'ing and pressing attacks because his hands are small. This may push him away, vs me letting him play control for now, and teaching him keyboard when he gets bigger
---
Overwrites a debuff of similar prio
---
ASUS TUF FX505DY. 
---
It‚Äôs $699. One of the laptops I initially considered before settling on a more expensive one.
---
Well we would need a totally new mmo to get this and the genre is kinda dead :/
---
Wait, that works? That's actually amazing. I will look into that thank you. Is it difficult to add Wow.exe to steam?
---
Never played vanilla, but aren‚Äôt there way less greens while leveling?
---
Yes, both of them can be found on the site I linked above. The Classic version is still in testing, but he's looking for feedback on the Discord if you want to help out.
---
Rust is a fps, if you like PvP that isn‚Äôt a fps for a change, Conan is a much better game. Even if PvP is lacking which I don‚Äôt think it is, it beats it in all other aspects of a ‚Äúsurvive and conquer‚Äù game imo
---
Awesome thank you. I‚Äôll look it up!
---
what answer? And what question are we answering?
---
Ah yes, the player who will quit before level 30.
---
Welcome aboard
---
Bro that shit was hilarious. I fucking loved it. I can only hope the same stuff like that happens in classic but I feel like a lot of them were kids and they grew out of that. Maybe not though
---
new background for my phone. love this &lt;3
---
That's not how statistics work.
---
Sounds great !
---
I see - so this wouldn't work for classic Pservers right now then right since it's in testing?
---
Do allies really prioritize using only dwarf priests?
---
what does (((this))) mean, except for being anti-semitic?
---
To me it seems like you're thinking about enjoying it. So then you really want to play a hunter or pally I see. lol
---
Easy, at lv 1 run all the way to NE starting zone, and start doing quests.
---
All you're doing as a Warlock in a raid is applying your Curse, and spamming Shadow Bolts. Which means you'll only utilize a fraction of all your talent points regardless how you spend them.
---
Some talents are essential for raiding: Improved Life Tap, Shadow Mastery, Ruin, Bane, Destructive Reach. That build has them all, so you're going to be fine.
---
Going 5/5 in Suppression is a bit redundant however: in PVP the hit cap is 3%, and for PVE you'll need to hitcap your Shadow Bolt anyway - meaning anything beyond two points is essentially a waste at level 60.
---
And for PVP, COEX is absolutely incredible - I'd definitely go 3/4 in it above just about anything.
---
Don‚Äôt you need a certain rank though cause 25 doesn‚Äôt seem like too much
---
Everything now a days is ran thro discord. There is currently a discord group for every class every guild every region even this subreddit. My guild is advertising on all of them and currently have 50+ members and launch is like 58 days away
---
Amazon Prime Days are coming up on the 15th and 16th, not sure if it‚Äôll be on sale, but it might be worth holding off and waiting to see if it gets discounted.
---
Check out the MSI ones too. You can also check local yard sale websites like Facebook Marketplace. I've gotten a few gems off there, including a week used Rog Strix 1070 for $200
---
No, Private Servers have a very ancient addon system that most developers don't remember or care about. There isn't a single addon written for Classic or Retail that will ever work on Private Servers without a complete overhaul that just isn't worth it.
---
If you want to test it out, your best option is the Retail free trial.
---
Tbh we never really understood why multiboxing is allowed. Tokens will not be available in Classic but there's already some people thinking about an exchange rate between BFA gold and Classic and setting up a market.
---
Downright soulcrushing.
---
you can run it on every laptop with a MX150 gpu or better.
---
I think a lot of old timers are coming back. However I think classic will draw in a pretty big new crowd. So we will be able to make plenty of kids rage.
---
Ahh ok I see. Thank you
---
You could make a friend with a dps class and do things not alone.
---
Nononono, that's not how it works. You have to pick a side and bash the other./s
---
 But yeah, I'm not going to have an ulcer if people don't pick the same type of server has me.
---
for tthose in the dark ;d https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w
---
They can, but if your warriors are geared to the teeth so is the tank. Running Ironfoe in MC is just asking for death, for instance.
---
Oh okay. I understand it now. Thank you.
---
Paladin since day 1. Paladin every xpac.
---
Paladin again from day 1 v2.0
---
Are you thinking PvP? Because they both have quiet the different roles there, as for PVE you'll be healing with both though, except for the tanking you can do in dungeons with your druid. I have experience with both from private servers if u have questions feel free to send me a message
---
I‚Äôve heard of issues with the MSI laptops. For the money the ASUS TUF and the Acer Nitro 5s are the best for your money. 
---
It all depends on how much you want to spend. IMO, the Asus TUF FX505DT with a Ryzen 7-3750H and a GTX1650 with a 512gb SSD and a *120hz IPS panel* for $899 is a beast for a sub-$1000 laptop.
---
You can keep a dmg set for healers and tanks to help with dmg without respec. Your ability to grind gold/reputation for most factions will still be limited this way. Herbalism/ mining will still work. 
---
But compared with a mage/hunter gold/hour you have to look for clever alternatives.
---
This is me.  You are definitely not the only one.
---
I don't care much about lore, I'll probably give a watch soon!
---
You use your dragon points silky wabbit
---
Rogue is the only thing Im sure of...its the rest that bothers me   
---
horde or ally?  
---
dwarf or gnome?  
---
orc, undead or troll?
---
Hex is a shadow spell and procs all shadow debuffs as well. You can spam rank one to get a blackout proc on melee it ranged without worrying about being shadow locked.
---
Beserking at low health could be the difference between a clutch heal and death. It‚Äôs not so cut and dry between the two. WotF, zerk rage, and pvp trinkets are the only things that can remove psychic scream and intimidating shout. It also removes seduce and gives 5 seconds of immunity to making fighting warlocks easier.
---
Of course there aren‚Äôt as many alliance warlocks and spriests already do pretty well. Shadow guard reflects on spell attacks as well as melee and HoW reduces healthstone, pot, bandage, siphon life, and drain life healing. You can also out range their fear by running away and spamming rank 1 HoW for blackout procs.
---
Anyone can remove diseases with the right consumables and if you know your up against an IF DP you can use that but as troll your biggest worry is fear ward (dispellable) and desperate prayer which your HoW cuts by 20%. The dwarf can also remove IF DP every 3 minutes and I think between hunters, rogues, priests, and even pallies we‚Äôll see s significant dwarf population.
---
Um? Yes it is?
---
If you have 10,000 people it‚Äôs statistically probable at least one of them can call a 1-100 roll.
---
R /whooooooosh
---
Never open with cheap shot on a mage
---
Apparently some people had a diff opinion than you
---
The nice thing about retail is that you can raid log essentially. Get your weekly +15 and just do your weekly mythic and heroic raid at most. Then in your remaining free time play classic. If you have the time and different schedule guilds you can raid on both 
---
A few members in my guild will be doing that
---
I tend to agree. This would be classic application of the Peter Principle
---
Mate I‚Äôm the worst person to ask. I‚Äôve ‚Äònarrowed‚Äô my choice down to either warrior, rogue, mage, lock or priest. 
---
I guess if you want to get up close and personal and top the dps charts then go warrior. If you want to stand back and play whack a mole with raid panels than go priest.
---
I will use old socks in my room and poop in them so i dont have to getup to go to the bathroom during playtime
---
Yes, you can tank leveling 5-mans with any warrior spec. Just make sure you always have a shield/1h in your bag.
---
Are you drunk? Were you drunk when you decided to take this photo, share it, and write that the graphics aged well?
---
I'm not a leveling guide fan but if the only thing holding you back is the alt-tabbing, you can find addon versions which integrates the guides in your ingame UI
---
Mine has been there since the Stress Test but it says no servers available.
---
In a good guild you can clear bwl mc onyxia and zg in 4 to 5 hours. This leaves you 15 hours  to farm. You can do it on either class but warlock is prolly cheaper and easier
---
one of my favorite zones, can't wait to return
---
Yes. But if you're planning to heal in dungeons you'll probably want to respec around 50; I'm switching to 30/0/21 then.
---
You're delusional
---
You can, but I‚Äôd argue getting something no older than a year, because even a laptop with a GTX1050/1050Ti can be had for under $700. Some even cheaper than that.
---
Pservers have been using TBC values apparently. They had to guess on some of that stuff. Vanilla wow should be like 60% of pservers numbers.
---
Classic wow launches when kids go back, because the target audience are us parents, that played the game 14 years ago.
---
Huh, check out ‚Äúwhorecraft‚Äù for legit wow porn parody, in full makeup. It‚Äôs gotta be 10 years old or so, about a dozen parts. Maybe even including a real bear as a hunter pet if I remember correctly
---
As a priest you can do lasher farming in DM:E. Will require you to be in a party, but should not be an issue.
---
You should also go herbalism and farm gold that way.
---
Its not 1/100 its 50/50 either he gets it or doesn't.
---
OK
---
Ah aight
---
bfa bad give orange arrow
---
Brand wise, it doesn't really matter. They pretty much all use the same internals and are all constructed with average quality. Just go for best bang-for-buck. 
---
You are going to hear horror stories from every brand.
---
Great expansion. The last good one actually. Still probably would have preferred not having pandaren as a playable race.
---
Keep in mind that end game is what you make of it. If you are a healer, nothing prevents you from raiding, doing dungeons, world pvp, BG's, collect herbs or mining nodes, the list goes on and on.
---
You're right that re-speccing constantly is not viable, but if you really want to play healer and have some damage dealing capability, maybe shaman or paladin is a bit better. Or roll an Alt (having a mage alt to farm is quite useful).
---
All that being said, you can still be a healer spec and be a solo player. Druid, Shaman and Paladin all collect damage dealing sets, and nothing prevents a healer from doing the same. Perhaps the biggest difference is the lack of shadowform as priest if you're a healer spec, but being a healer in pvp is often better than a face melter.
---
My big message, don't worry about it. No class has any real problem farming at end game.
---
PvE servers are for the players not good enough to pvp...
---
Will running my human character to teldrassil save time in the long run for darnassus rep? I'm not expecting to hit exalted at 40 or even 60.  But will the extra rep from leveling there save time/energy farming runecloth at 60? especially since ill be playing a rogue, which isn't the most efficient class for farming.
---
S P R O I N G
---
Warlocks: Fear, DoT, DoT, DoT, Fear, DoT. 
---
GG.
---
im thinking about rolling a ranged warrior or a melee hunter.
---
If you included dwarf paladin / hunter, why not dwarf warrior? Just curious.
---
I would take Imp. Lightning Shield over dodge.
---
Something like this: https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=shaman&amp;talents=BoBpBqBrBsycyCyDyEyFyhytykygyuydypyqyrysyiJkJlyjyvJmJnJoJpJqBnw6w4xcw~xdw-xexaxfxbxrw7xgxhxiJJJrJsxj
---
The biggest differences are pet vs no pet and DoTs vs AoE, I'd focus on those
---
If you are a priest as long as you have spirit tap and improved wands you can level and quest just fine as a healer. You will only be marginally slower than spriest.
---
When I was a kid, my friends and I always thought it was Trisfal glades lol. I hear it every time I read Tirisfal glades
---
Our education system is fucking doomed.
---
Not me. Dead set on human female warlock.
---
Max level is 60.
---
Step 1: cast Fear
---
Step 2: all the DoTs
---
Step 3: Fear again 
---
And then you win
---
i don't get why every post has the disclaimer that end game progression in classic is a joke.
---
damn just looking at that xbox ad with that huge ass controller took me back hard, its crazy how fast gaming has evolved in just 15 years.
---
Actually playing WoW. I stopped playing a few months after the BC expansion and I just want to learn the ropes again before classic comes out.
---
I can hear darude sandstorm playing...
---
Pop cap won't be 5k.
---
At best it will be around 3.5k per layer in phase 1
---
Get a friend who can heal you
---
Ye ik
---
Aight
---
You won‚Äôt be playing shadow in a good premade group but something like tri spec. If you can squeeze in blackout in the build the utility of shadow guard and HoW will vastly outstrip ToS and DP. DP can‚Äôt be cast on dwarves and pallies will just dispel it, consumables also dispel it. 
---
He fails to mention spamming rank 1 how which in combination with SWP and shadowguard will all but guarantee a blackout proc for clutch heals. Beskerkjng can be used to mana burn more effectively as well as heal.
---
WotF is probably better(marginally so) if your playing in WSG premade vs premade but don‚Äôt worry a good premade doesn‚Äôt actually want to fight. Basically WotF will help you vs warriors, locks, and other priests while shadow guard and HoW will be useful against every class in some situation.
---
You can enter any zone at any level
---
I guess because it's a title? Like pretty sure Admiral and King and Knight are banned too. I dunno, dumb rule if you ask me
---
Depends.
---
That's a level 60 spec. You don't level once you're level 60.
---
What do you want to get when?
---
I only know my experience through pservers. Getting through BWL was as far as i got beforr i quit and we had a small few bumps but it was honestly easy

Honestly sick of how many fucking nazis I encountered on pservers, really hoping classic community will be a lot different.
---
When WoW gets ray tracing and you have a beast machine
---
I agree. I‚Äôm a programmer and have loved computers since I was a little kid. I‚Äôm all about the digital world but there‚Äôs just something about a real book.
---
First, there's no difference between 10,000 people guessing once and 1 person guessing 10,000 times.
---
To have a 99% probability of guessing the correct answer once, you would have to attempt to guess 458 times. There isn't a streamer that has done this.
---
The warlock succubus quest was a pretty big time waster because it had you running across Kalimdor as a human or gnome. Most people say skip it until later but I plan to do it as soon as I hit 20.
---
Just making 433$ with a $160 is not that much. You need at least 160x2.5 to make decent money. They have to split the money with the cinemas and especially china is complicated. Hollywood doesn‚Äòt get that much money out of china because the laws there are different.
---
You're making it seem like I'm spending the entire day farming which is utter nonsense though. It's very little time investment. I farm it once (till the cooldown comes into effect) at which point I'm done for the day. I've been doing that for past couple months and I've already collected enough gold to play classic for free for an entire year.

Probs enh till 42 then focus on ele as well. Then Respec at 60
---
Never played vanilla, but it was pretty common in wotlk. Typically if a high level is camping you, they‚Äôre doing it in the hopes that you‚Äôll call guildies to save your ass. Which will give them the world PvP they‚Äôre looking for
---
No. Maybe on private servers, or "world first" guilds. There was no distinction based on race and very little on spec. There were night elf priests (which are considered "sub-optimal") which were commonly present in many raids. In fact, look up some of the world first videos and you'll clearly see this.
---
There were three primary factors which determined if you were raiding in a heavy progress build:
---
1. You were available whenever they raided, usually on a set schedule, often multiple days per week.
---
2. You farmed for consumables and materials, or contributed in some way for the push.
---
3. You weren't a loot drama whore - it was about the guild's progress. Loot was considered secondary.
---
Holy nova lasher farming in DM:E
---
That's literally what those are supposed to signify though.
---
Night elf druid for sure. Tauren Shaman close 2nd.
---
Undead rogues really dont feel immersive they just got hugely popular pick because of WotF.
---
Play female troll the animations are pretty good.
---
FIGH  FOR THE HO `E
---
There is no such thing as a lack of resto shamans.  There is just a lack of shamans, because they should all be resto and any decent shaman knows that.  Your raid either has enough shamans or it doesn't, but why would one even bother playing enh?
---
The empire earth advertisement &lt;3 freaking loved this game
---
Or respec at 50 to 30/0/20 as it's good at later levels
---
Is it though? It‚Äôs not really a woosh cuz you actually didn‚Äôt printscreen it kiddo
---
But everyone is playing at a different level now. If he does the same thing he did before, his performance will exponentially suffer versus everyone else incorporating how the meta has changed...
---
What he did back then might be seen as trash in a modern 40m raid.
---
Amazing how much story is behind everything. Thanks for the info.
---
&gt; just a schmuck out of Elwynn with anger issues
---
Best description for human warriors ever.
---
Man do I disagree. I didn't buy BFA until it went on sale recently, which was after I've already been on the Classic hype train for months.
---
BFA is a good game. It's not the same game I fell in love with over a decade ago, but it's actually really good.
---
SM/Ruin is the closest to a jack-of-all-trades build here, and is still decent in PvP. PvP builds just lack the required talents for raid DPS, and so you have to rely on your guild giving you a pass for a sub-optimal build.
---
If you say ‚Äúcan‚Äôt wait for classic to kill bfa‚Äù in general chat people will enter into an hour long argument 100% of the time
---
Sorry that movie was an absolute disaster. War3 cinematics had better character dev, dialogue, and plot. Warcraft movie was a complete waste of resources

post this on r/wow
---
Makes it look shit because Westfall isn't supposed to have lush green grass all over the place lmao.
---
Not sure if you're aware, but what /u/Impeesa_ is nodding at is the fact that "Hollywood accounting" is a thing.  
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting  
---
&gt;refers to the opaque or creative accounting methods used by the film, video, and television industry to budget and record profits for film projects. Expenditures can be inflated to reduce or eliminate the reported profit of the project, thereby reducing the amount which the corporation must pay in taxes and royalties or other profit-sharing agreements, as these are based on the net profit.
---
but both situations are specs --AT-- 60
---
30/0/21 is still a level 60 spec. You can't use 30/0/21 at level 27.
---
Again. What talents are planned at 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55?
---
THAT is a leveling spec, not a full 51 point tree.
---
I'll second the dwarf hunter. I found cat pets as extremely comforting though. Broken tooth fits into every environment like a glove. Never got a mount with my dwarf, just aspect of the cheetah and made many good hikes across Azeroth, hunting for food when needed. 
---
Conversely Gnome Mage felt terrible. Gnome Culture was way too complex and dependent on convoluted technology. Being a mage on a mechnostrider was a little bit soul crushing.
---
&gt;SM/Ruin is the closest to a jack-of-all-trades build here, and is still decent in PvP. PvP builds just lack the required talents for raid DPS, and so you have to rely on your guild giving you a pass for a sub-optimal build.
---
Oh, okay. Is there a way I can make the SM/Ruin build somewhat better for raid DPS?
---
Player skill and gear are way above race choice.  The only times you will 100% need dwarves will be if your overall group is really bad and you need the extra heals during the fear phase or for speedrunning.
---
If the raid is geared you twist windfury and tranquil air totems.
---
I do mostly focus on pvp and have played a druid most of my game time. I will still be playing a healer on my druid. I just dont know if I want to be crowded with all the other priests. And I dont know if I will be satisfied with shadow priest when I'm bored healing
---
Speak for yourself bruh
---
Legit question. Why do you feel the need to talk about BFA on the Classic WoW forum?
---
I dont have friends so i dont worry about it
---
I normally don't ever go for WW axe because i dw the whole time i level on a warrior from 20 on. There are plenty of dungeon weapons and quest weapons from dungeons that keep you competitive. I use [this](https://bobo-talents.aerobaticapp.com/?class=warrior&amp;talents=qfrqrrqcrsqlryrzrArBqmqisYqCsyszsAsBqGsKsLsMsNqFyPyQyRqEqzs-tatbtcqHH_H.s8s9qBsZs0s1s2Ins_s.slsxsHySyT)  spec while leveling. Demo shout is super useful while leveling and this spec is good for world pvp while leveling as well as great spec to tank dungeons with. if you have any questions let me know.
---
Yeah the title wasn't that phrased well by me. I meant it as talents to work to until lvl 60 the Respec to 30/0/21
---
A sex dungeon would be less creepy
---
What private server were you on that allowed you to do this combo as a Mage? I thought private servers were AcCuRAte?
---
Hi there thanks for this!  Is there anyway we can download this to use offline??
---
Yeah how is demo shout good for leveling? All guides I've seen say to consider skipping it and it's not in any rotation I've seen
---
I just wish they‚Äôd invite more people for testing. I‚Äôm afraid they wont have enough bug testing with the dying beta-population. I don‚Äôt care about the population, just about bug-testing.

One annoying thing about skinning with no bag space is you also have to completely loot the animals to skin them. That means lots of looting and destroying just to skin.

Enslave Demons will not spawn in instances or pvp. There maybe a way around this; by making your enslave demon permanent. To do this you need to have an enslaved demon and duel a priest; priest MindControls you have the priest melee your demon only melee. Priest the. Drops MC and then run out of the duel. When enslave demon buff drops the demon should still be yours to command. Still not sure if this technique survives zoning or not.
---
Sure, but until Naxxramas it's quite low
---
Unfortunately AOC proved that can happen.
---
TBF, people in general chat will enter into an hour long argument about nearly anything. Better than the old thunderfury spam and various anal links.
---
Yes, the best thing you can do for rep is start go to their starter zones immedialty when you can to level. Will save you a lot of runecloth farming.
---
Hell no it doesn't. Warrior groups should always have a shaman in them.
---
As a big fool who plans to run his human warlock to Teldrassil the second I spawn in, yes. Doing Night Elf zone quests while they are still yellow is going to net you the most rep possible for your Darnassus rep grind, especially as a human with the racial bonus. Missing out on the teldrassil quests will set you back a lot on that. I wish I could find the specific video that broke down the grind really well, having trouble finding it though among the sea of similar vids.
---
Thats a bit of a reach, not really sure how this is funny or connected. Cortez killed hundreds of thousands. Whats that got to do with ion and classic dev
---
Plan to make gold by not wasting it. Have my spec set in stone with no need to ever change it saves ton in respec costs. Never buy anything on AH. All gold goes towards mounts.
---
that would suck
---
This does not change anything, but yes.
---
This is an opinion that 99% of people hold.
---
What's the opposite of gilding a comment, and how do I do it to this one?
---
More than that! My shadowbolt would regularly crit over 5k with consumes in BWL bis gear.

ice block, nade, sheep, bye
---
As much as I liked the story this isn‚Äôt really true at all. You could make this exact same story with an undead warrior wanting to tank dungeons
---
I said guy. She was on the Democratic ticket. Being female was an advantage.
---
Thanks for the sanity check. Hopefully they leave our community alone. Hate has no place here
---
If you are grinding like most warriors like to do. I charge rand demo and i barely will take any damage from yellow/green mobs. You can just steam roll your way through stuff. This spec my buddy and i ran on a ND and we crushed stuff. And it works even better on classic. Imp demo is actually pretty good for leveling. A lot of people suggest hamstring kiting, with this you just beat face and get extra rage from the mob hitting you.
---
And thank you for the gold, kind sir!
---
So what‚Äôs your point here? There‚Äôs less than 458 streamers who have ever guessed a 1% chance?
---
My fucking point is, at some point in time, some one some where is gonna guess it correct, with all the people that stream someone is GUARANTEED to do it eventually. And when they do it, it would be posted to Reddit. Your looking way to fucking much into this and can‚Äôt seem to grasp a simple point of ‚Äúmore attempts total, higher odds‚Äù
---
Oh no shit? Jeeze dude, I guess it's been longer than I thought. Dwarf shaman and Undead hunter were the only two combos I knew for sure came in Cata.
---
Classic is very easy to run, I remember having it on max graphics on an integrated graphics chip on a laptop from 2010 and run great
---
What?
---
I'll probably jump ship on Classic for the next WoW expansion. Blizzard is clearly making design decisions for 9.0 to attract Classic players. And it will work.
---
Then what at all of these world PvP gank videos that are so popular on YouTube? Swifty/Drakedog/Perplexity = not content??
---
It completely depends. If you plan on leveling with some buddies it could be worth it. Just level through SM dungeon runs and pick up the weapon in uldaman or RFD.
---
No, I just plan alts.  I'll flip flop while I play them all.
---
You can login and not stop playing until level 20

it means that he's describing a group of people as jewish. the vast majority of the people who run hollywood are jewish - this is just a fact https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2008-dec-19-oe-stein19-story.html

this is like getting upset and calling someone "anti-semitic" because they point out that the majority of the population of israel is jewish. spare us the disingenuous hand-wringing, buddy

I posted a few speedleveling runs on this subreddit before, and the main question that always occured in those threads was, 'but how do you plan on leveling during launch?' I've made a video and a spreadsheet ([https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j\_E3yhwD7pqAM1nccEVoKom649uMu7P0laxlFmktprY/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j_E3yhwD7pqAM1nccEVoKom649uMu7P0laxlFmktprY/edit?usp=sharing)) in which I explain what can be skipped in Mulgore during the initial few hours of launch. This is your best tool in staying ahead of the zerg! :)
---
Seduce + Soul Fire
---
Well there's this thing called Dragonbreath Chili, and if you have a semi-hardcore guild that knows how to stagger Arcanite Dragonlings it's quite a big dps boost. Also, just because your class doesn't have an AP/agi flask doesn't mean you shouldn't use one. Mages and locks have to, so join the club and do more dps.
---
I'm torn between a gnome mage and an undead priest. It's been like that for a month now &gt;.&gt;
---
honk honk
---
So demo shout is an alternative to hamstring kiting? And have you actually done a timed test with it vs battle shout?
---
Both run 24/7.
---
Demo shout isn't good for levelling, and neither is Unbridled Wrath I can't even wrap my noodle around that spec.  
---
Demo shout is OK for tanking, there's a point where it's better threat for multiple targets than Battleshout depending on how many targets you hit, but that's about it. Also if you're on a PvP server, and have booming voice it's good for bringing something out of stealth. So it's not a hard skip, just *perhaps* skip later ranks.
---
The harbor is a joke though.  Not even saying that as a gaming fan.  Just... do they even coast?
---
That makes sense. A good friend of mine said he‚Äôs running priest this time around because as a dwarf paladin in vanilla he remembered that he‚Äôd always get passed up in raids for a priest. I tried to tell him to play what he likes and if that‚Äôs paladin then screw the naysayers, but if dwarf priests are THAT highly sought after I don‚Äôt want to argue him out of it.
---
You dont play Warlock because you want to be top dps you pay Warlock to be a useful support. You have a ton of group utility that is worth the loss in dps.
---
You can run classic on a potato plugged into an alarm clock.
---
Leatherworking will be one of the lesser-used professions. But because of this, crafts will likely sell higher. Especially if you require raiding to get specific recipes.
---
Alchemy will be one of the more common ones, but you can also get more gold from it. Selling potions to raiders and pvpers.
---
If you have a friend with either profession, all you need is to bring the mats to them. Although there are a couple of nice BoP items in leatherworking.

I'm probably gonna out level most of the pack and I'll have a hard time finding a group for dungeons at that point

Human warrior is for min/max, dwarf warrior is if you want to be a mighty man

Making money in goldshire.
---
Any Ele resto variation ( 31/0/20), (31/7/13),(30/0/21) are all excellent to DPs in 5 man content, heal, or PvP with.
---
Ele resto shamans are the only "true" hybrids that can heal and burst DPs in both PvP and pve. Shamans are never optimal to DPs in raid pve.
---
Elemental shamans in general are best suited to tank casters (I.e. Belinda in av or the princess in maradon) with their anti caster toolkit and ranged threat generation.  More mana and significantly higher spell damage/healing compared to enhance.
---
Until the second half of Aq40, you can heal perfectly fine as Ele resto.  Arguably one of the strongest world PvP classes, and you can solo grind exceptionally well with just spamming lighning bolt and even aoe farm.
---
No, you‚Äôre putting way too much faith in random chance when there‚Äôs a much more probable answer.
---
[ReShade](https://reshade.me/)
---
Make friends with a dps. My buddy played resto Druid. We would roam azshara, he would herb any nodes we found and keep me full health and as a warlock I would farm the satyers for felcloth by dotting up every mob I came across. Because of lifetap we never had to stop and drink meaning we could just walk from mob pack to mob pack killing everything as soon as it spawned. It made my matt farming go quicker and less painful and made my buddy money too. Win/win. Vanilla is a harsh world and we must work together to accomplish our goals.
---
Is it Terroristenx
---
And why exactly is that relevant?
---
Another question. At what point will I no longer be able to tank dungeons with all my talents in arms or fury?
---
At least get to 5 for DEing rando greens.
---
Thanks! Definitely interested in that 31/7/13 as I hear most suggesting 31/0/20. Any suggestions for mid lvl shamans (lvl 30-40)?
---
I would assume if you have two good priests and one has fear ward...
---
The guild decides.
---
First answer is unfortunately no. 
---
Second is yes and yes. 
---
Still looks good to me
---
Home Sweet Home.. Can't wait for a pint in The Gallows' End Tavern.
---
Nope. It is already an excellent raid build, second only to DS/Ruin by 5%.
---
This build you linked looks good.

Instead of just deleting posts, the mods should just start banning people, honestly. Oh, and if anyone thinks I'm being petty, its literally the first rule of the subreddit.
---
U have 5 Seconds immunity so recasting is Not that easy
---
Alright, then that I'll go with the build I sent. Thank you for explaining it to me!
---
&gt; Oh, okay. Is there a way I can make the SM/Ruin build somewhat better for raid DPS?
---
Not really, the one you have is pretty much the standard SM/Ruin build. SM/Ruin and DS/Ruin are really the only viable raid specs, anything else and you're pretty severely gimping your DPS. If you're looking to be useful in both PvP and PvE, SM/Ruin is the best choice.
---
Who cares though
---
If you're really far ahead then arathi might be empty. If the zone isn't packed, it shouldn't be that hard to get the materials. Just the issue is once people get the appropriate level to farm the ele's there will literally be someone farming them just for gold at all times of the day bc they drop a good amount of elemental fire.

Nelf Druid &gt; Cow Druid for RP

But cow shaman is tight

No. Stop trying to guess my secret name. It starts with the letter S

Rank 11. Also, the person you're responding to is incorrect about the marks. That was a later patch.  
---
It's 10g if you hit rank 11, and has a riding requirement of 75 so you don't need to purchase epic riding, even though it's an epic mount.
---
Old Tirisfal was magical. I remember seeing Brill for the first time and just falling in love with that place. I hate the new forsaken architecture.
---
Do you like solo or group play? In pvp druids are better for solo play and priests shine in groups. Druids are not good at raw healing like priests are, they are hybrids who kite the enemy and slowly wear them down.
---
LOL ok that's a first. I'm sad that I only have but one downvote to give.

Sorry I mean 2 ü§£

Exactly this, you aren‚Äôt some giant green muscly thing or a comically tiny person, or a giant cow. You are just a plain average joe setting foot into a crazy world.

Srsly dude, whatever. You can either accept the truth or not.
---
I need a series of posters like this on my wall. It's decided.

Because Blizzard has proven to be infallible when it comes to testing content?
---
I played holy priest during vanilla. Let me tell you that, if you fight, your win rate in 1on1s is about 20%, if you were already fighting a mob and someone ganks you, it goes down to 5% maybe. Well either way you won't win a lot of wpvp if you're alone.
---
On the other hand, if you try to run away, you're survival rate could be about 85%. But you have to be prepare and have some light feathers in your inventory. Fear, run away, shield yourself+renew and start looking for a cliff or a body of water. Levitate will save your ass more than any other spell. Jump off a cliff that would kill anyone and just glide away. If you find a lake, just levitate, dot the enemy and walk away.

We used to have a feature in WoWMapper ([for playing WoW with a controller](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/console-port)) that used memory reading to make the cursor to the middle of the screen, switch between run/walk based on joystick position and rumble the controller when taking damage or low health.

Those features had to be removed when Blizzard upped the ante on "hacks" because account security could have been jeopardised.

The sacrifice was for group pvp not 1v1 as you can see I clearly seperated the two, and blessing of sacrifice has no cooldown so you can constantly re apply it aswell as paladins having bubble AND trinket as safety nets

Hi westfall!

You require a lot of mats to level both blacksmithing and engineering 
---
You‚Äôll have to do a lot of mining for both of those, and I mean a lot. Something to consider.

Does the warlock mount trigger GCD? I bought regular epic mounts on my paladins since they allowed me to activate an aura/buff and mount up at the same time. It seems small, but in PvP it matters.

Why is it good?  I watched my friend log in for 5 minutes because he subbed for beta.  He walked into org and all I saw was a ton of bullshit mounts like flying carpets and rainbow unicorns or some shit.  I remember earning some cool mounts for raid achievements or gladiator in TBC/wotlk/cata, but this just seemed like a joke.  It looked so fucking stupid I nearly threw up.  What is good about the game though?  Genuinely curious.

Worth picking up skinning if your class is good at farming, and you intend to farm a lot of mobs.
---
If the idea of killing the same dragons for 3 hours hurts your entire soul, then skinning probably won‚Äôt benefit you as much anyway.

I also think of Undead Mage in that category but I still laugh my ass off at the old video from I think WotLK of the undead mage wanding a target dummy screaming ["I'm going to wand you do death"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34mS5GK--cQ)

You‚Äôre right, maybe had a 30 dollar bottle once. Damn
---
There isnt. I main a DK and im struggling with choosing a class too. Like you said DK borrowed things from other classes but those things individually dont make it feel like a DK. For instance warlocks and hunters have a pet but they are ranged so they couldnt be more different than DK already. Paladin uses spells in melee in addition to regular abilities but its like the polar oposite of DK... Idk man, really cant help you just as i couldnt help myself
---
But it's dead now you've all missed the train frens
---
This need to go to the front page lmao
---
I like the group play more and I'm leaning towards the priest for that reason but I'm more comfortable on the druid
---
You can play together as long as you play the same faction (Horde/Alliance). BUT - you'll start in different zones in the world. You'll have to work/level your way towards each other, or travel to the zone of your friend as a level one and start together.
---
You won't regret it :)
---
The two games will be in direct competition with each other even though they will be on the same subscription, so it is kind of relevant.
---
No, they're rebooting an old project and bundling it with a game they want more people to play so that when they make changes to that game, such as the level squish back down to 60, people will give it a shot and many of them will stay.
---
Anyone that thinks Blizzard isn't holding meetings on how to convert future Classic players into future Retail players is delusional. Half their money comes from microtransactions. Classic has none, Retail has new ones every week.
---
Amazing.
---
I wouldn't be upset if we didn't get such a good view of how this shot should look whenever taking a flight path out of stormwind
---
You can thank the Koreans for horde blood elves.
---
You won‚Äôt have to be a tauren to play with him, you can be any other horde race. Problem will be that you have to meet eachother somehow, since different races start in different areas. Also, if you choose other races with and perhaps a class that taurens don‚Äôt have, there are no class trainers in Mulgore before Thunder Bluff, which does i.e have a mage trainer IIRC.
---
You could, perhaps, plan your leveling with your friend? Make a strategy and discuss plans?
---
When it comes to classes friendly to new players, hunters spring to mind. Very simple class and easy to learn. Good luck!
---
lol just watched a video. You gotta use invisible geometry that you'd never know unless someone told you. Thanks for the info though
---
How bizarre. This and the Orgrimmar wall look so much better than the terrible slutty drawings
---
Too bad the story telling sucked and the art style felt off
---
It means that twisting doesn't lose value but rather gains it. The more geared the raid gets, the better 20% threat reduction becomes and agility totem is never worth as much as that.
---
22 binds isnt nearly enough for probably any class in vanilla if you want to take it really serious, especially considering pvp
---
I plan on getting engineering, but I‚Äôm going to level with skinning/mining, and have enchanting on an alt to DE things with low vendor value.
---
I‚Äôll probably keep skinning for a while as it‚Äôs great if you intend to do long farming grinds
---
My friend have jobs, so.. Yeah, Kinda.
---
It‚Äôs more efficient to skip it, especially if you are racing. That is not even my opinion but that of the most experienced warriors out there.
---
You can get it, though. It will cost like 30-40g (this part is speculation). It will carry you for like 15 levels. It‚Äôs tons of fun. Strong in PvP.
---
You need to be a bit behind of the top of the curve, though. You need some 40s farming the elementals.
---
Efficiency is not everything. I‚Äôd rather take 10 hours longer to level but experience most dungeons, take care of profs, do a lot of pvp, make friends and perhaps get the WW axe.
---
Ravager is a good alternative, though.
---
I ran a very similar spec on a private server and in the beta and it was very good.  Imp Demo shout is great for leveling and tanking.  The only difference is I go straight for piercing howl and then switch to arms to grab tactical mastery.  
---
The are other ways to do it, sure, but this spec worked great in the beta.
---
Same reason Diablo 3 is good. You can log in for an hour and click mindlessly without the possibility of failure and you get your purple item. It's a theme park game, if you enjoy that kind of stuff, it's a good game for you.
---
You can play 100% of the game with 0 keybinds. Is it efficient? No
---
I have a question, and it‚Äôs sincere and not meant as an attack.
---
If you haven‚Äôt played since Cata, why are you surprised that they‚Äôve added more mounts? Did you expect that they would go 4 expansions without adding any more mounts?
---
Also, flying carpets have been in the game since WotLK
---
Too furry
---
This
---
First thing I'm doing is 8 points in arms for cheaper heroic strike and 5% parry. Then I'll do 11 points in prot for shield specialization the plus defense skill and then one point into improved shield block for the extra block. Then I'm dumping the rest in arms until 60.
---
Welcome to classic! First be sure to join the same server as he does. In classic wow you cannot play with people on different servers. Once you are on the same server you need to pick the same "side" as him. So if he is planning on planning a tauren druid you can pick any horde character to play with him. The starting zones only matter for the first 10 levels. So in my opinion just choose the class that you want to play the most and meet up with your friend after level 10! Best of luck and have fun!
---
Like I said, I am done with your trolling. Since you keep going I'll just ignore the account.
---
Awesome.
---
Yes, ban all whom you disagree with
---
I was trying to imply that either of those two options could potentially be better than what we have now, and should both be looked into when developing a WoW sequel.
---
I don't want to sound like a dick, but do you have proof that windfury has an ICD in classic WoW? Because I've heard, that the ICD on Windfury was added during TBC. I'm just trying to gather some information, in order to be able to accurately theorycraft.
---
&gt; The idea that we're starting a "new" MMO with 1-2yrs worth of content that will all exist in a single patch, frozen in time, never balanced, never altered...it's really bothersome to me. It's not AT ALL what Vanilla was about.
---
It will be fun. But yeah, it bothers me when people circlejerk each other that this is "pure authentic vanilla with no changes!" when it's nothing of the sort.
---
&gt; Every single one of us just assumed that whatever we chose that day would eventually be 100% just as useful and viable at the end of the game as everyone else. The Blizzard devs would make sure of it...that's what they do.
---
But then the pirate server grognards wouldn't be able to choose their race, class and spec with 100% certainty that they would be the very bestest of all forever!
---
I‚Äôm currently stuck between hpally and hpriest. I know I definitely want to be a healer and will never be tempted to dps. 
---
I know I‚Äôll be focused more on pve because tbf/tbh I suck at pvp
---
If I roll pally I know I‚Äôll go human, but despite the chanting to roll a dwarf priest I feel like I‚Äôd either do NE/human there too
---
I‚Äôm not too concerned with min/maxing racials and everything but if you‚Äôd like to shout at me for being stupid and putting aesthetics first, go ahead
---
I play both classes in retail and have mained them for a while. My current retail preference is priest but I love the class fantasy of paladins.
---
Opinions? Even though I‚Äôm sure my decision will be made on the character screen in August
---
I'm not surprised, it just looks terrible and has gotten to the point of being ridiculous, and half of them cost like 30 dollars in a store or something?  It's like they are beating a dead horse.
---
There is a question in your title...
---
now we just have to get Metzen to narrate the audio book.
---
Never
---
Debuffs have assigned priority values, a lower prio debuff wont push off a bigger one, but will push off an equal or lower one.
---
One day im a sm ruin warlock the next 30/0/21 ele resto sham, the next im a fury warrior...
---
A lot of people stopped playing because of the microtransactions
---
What rogue in their right mind is fighting a thunderfury warrior?
---
Nah not at all. I used to exclusively play the best raw healing class. And I am going to transition that experience into the best dps class that also happens to be the best class for tanking.
---
Priest and warrior life ftw!
---
Honestly, lacking of healers is usually not true. Because you only need one healer. As a healer you always need to create the group pretty much.
---
The blockade tends to be the tank. I am tired of begging them. So I will tank myself. And if there is a tank? Even better. I get to DPS.
---
Looks great
---
Ah, fair point
---
I remember some mod that had a weird name like Tahoe or something like that. I just can't recall. There's nothing in this screenshot that looks like xperl.
---
bro, it isn't trolling, every decent shaman plays resto to raid in vanilla, this is common sense...
---
Or just the people violating the established rules.
---
Classic may affect BFA but I don't think BFA's success would affect classic.  If classic is insanely popular and BFA dies, then they would probably try to incorporate more old school style WoW game design.  But They aren't going to turn classic into BFA.
---
It's not xperl, much different look.
---
Hope it helps!
---
Interesting. Something new to discover.
---
Xperl is still around and it looks much different.
---
It's really not great for levelling. You're talking about a **FIVE** point investment for an extra 22ap (Not even 2DPS) reduction in enemy damage at level 24.
---
Youd be absolutely mental to think five points is "very good" for less than 2DPS damage reduction. Demo shout in general is OK for tanking, for the threat not for the reduction.
---
As for levelling, not tanking. Spending 10 rage to reduce damage by 2DPS is worse than just killing those enemies faster than the equivalent of 2DPS. Which isn't hard.
---
All the Texas Martyrs were bear droods
---
I never said yes. I said a believe they will be. There is a difference even if its a small one. Clearly, the point of my comment was to express that I‚Äôm looking forward to selling them and rping as scrooge mcduck swimming in my piles of gold.
---
Go for the AV frostwolf imo, looks great on undead.
---
101 101
---
whipper is on the same cooldown as healthstones and crystal restore. crystal restore is a hot but benefits from spell damage (on pservers at least). casters should use crystal restore on fights like Loatheb when out of healthstones.
---
Probably not, since classic is based mostly on legion+ api rather than vanilla.
---
The three big things for me are:
---
1. It looks a whole lot better. Every texture, model, animation is just better. I get that some people love old school stuff, but that's not for me. I'm very disappointed that Classic isn't a remaster with updated graphics. I'd rather play Super Mario Galaxy or Odyssey every time over Super Mario 64 for this reason alone.
---
2. The questing experience is just better. I'm engaged by quests, they flow, they're unique. I actually care about the story and feel like I'm part of the world rather than some invisible creature in a world that resets every time I logoff.
---
3. The dungeon and raid encounters are night and day compared to Classic. They're creative and difficult and actually have themes and mechanics. Wow Classic dungeon and raid encounters are incredibly boring in comparison. I still love them, but they just don't hold a candle to Retail.
---
I get that, and I agree to an extent, but that‚Äôs the nature of a game that keeps adding content. It‚Äôs inevitable. 
---
The alternative is adding content that is only slightly different from old content, and the community hates that (‚Äúffs this is just a recolor of X sword/Y mount‚Äù).
---
okay im rolling horde lol
---
I'm dead set on warrior as main and hunter as alt. I wasnt sure which faction I was going to pick for the longest time however. I played horde pservers for while and loved it. Though I was alliance during original vanilla/bc/wrath. No doubt that im going horde this time. Their story is just so much more interesting in vanilla.
---
You're damn right.
---
They will probably open it up for like the last month as they did with bfa if I remember right but at this point I'm not interested until it's released.
---
Ya they shouldn't have the beta on there for those of us who can't access it. It's like they just want to troll us. So Im just playing Xbox games until late August.
---
* Log on an alt for a bit
---
* If you don‚Äôt have an alt level one to 5 for professions
---
* go somewhere else
---
* spirit rez if you have to
---
* do some chores for 20 minutes
---
* find that one addon/macro that you are missing
---
* call for help
---
* go on discord and bribe the ganker
---
Yeah, things will take longer. That‚Äôs a cool thing IMO.
---
The real issue is if there is a huge faction imbalance like 65:35. I have seen the Horde win *the world of warcraft*. Every place was camped. Every DM took like 40 minutes to corpse run inside. They would mind control you back so you would get further behind and behind. Most groups fell apart.
---
Getting griefed while leveling? You can absolutely play around it.
---
Plus that racial isn‚Äôt the worst
---
Yeah, because a 6 year-old really needs to grind that honor out for Rank 14...
---
&gt; And yes, i believe that (now) "casting magical spells" with reddit, twitter, twitch, and forums make a difference. 
---
I don't think forum whining on its own does anything. Unless you vote with your dollars, you are shouting into the void.
---
Oh I absolutely agree with that. Classic exists *entirely* to keep people in their commercial ecosystem. And as long as they maintain consumer trust through a laissez-faire approach to the old game, most people will give them the benefit of the doubt and try the new stuff as it releases. It's a win all around.
---
That said, I don't think their primary goal in the boardroom meetings is to convert Classic players back into Retail players. Classic is a stopgap to maintain numbers on the back end. Retail is about attracting new players on the front. Like you said yourself, it's not the same game you fell in love with anymore, but you still think its a good game. They aren't gonna spin it all the way back to make it appealing to Classic players again. They're gonna keep it modern and appealing to modern sensibilities.
---
Imagine believing politics is solely the purview of career politicians and the uber wealthy who have repeatedly sold out their constituents for personal gain lmao
---
Pouring coffee doesn't and shouldn't intrinsically disqualify you from holding an office. Are most baristas viable candidates? No, same way coming from a rich family with connects doesn't make you qualified. Anybody should be able to run and whether or not they deserve to win should come down to how much the people they would be representing support them, not how much money and clout special interest groups splash into their coffers.
---
Shoud add a option to ad BoL (Blessing of Light) to paladin calculation. BoL can make low rank holy light be a decent option early game when mana can be problematic or if you don¬¥t wish to spam mana pots in dungs.
---
Demand Tauren Druids are underrated
---
Hard to tell as people will hate from the bottom of their hearts what others love but one of the few things most should agee on would be great raid design (some mobs in BFA dungeons have more mecanics than some vanilla raid bosses)
---
And despite some glaring issues, it managed to bring back world PvP as a feature. For example if you kill too many players without dying, at some point you'll get a quest to keep killing players without dying and recieve an assassin title but everyone  can see your position of the map and recieve some nice rewards for killing you. (PvP currency, ~400g and slightly more in crafting ressources)
---
Except all of the viper stings the priest is going to eat that a pally can just yawn and dispell. Also pallies wear plate in PvP, cloth in PvE.  Not that I would ever play the boring ass class.
---
I mean...no matter how slow you level if you start when everyone else does there's not gonna be THAT many gankers. Just stay the fuck out of STV if you hate it so much.
---
After that, just log on your main and camp the camper. 
---
I leveled a rogue on cata and kill a mage 2-3 times. Then he invites a guildie that kills me 2-3 times...then I came on my 85 ret and camped them for 3 hours while watching youtube (1 monitor pleb here, so I had windows half and half and spamming tab so they can't fly up).
---
It only sucks the first time, and you can always just run away, you probably won't be the only one in the zone.
---
Yes, vanilla WOW PVE is terrible, I agree.  I'd rather play TBC or WOLTK, but we are getting vanilla...so whatever.
---
for some reason i have 2 beta acces on my account, i wish i could give the useless one to someone :(
---
The shaman slow is actually so far from the list of things that make shamans a pain for mages, mages could honestly take an undispellable debuff for 50% slow and remove earth shock or grounding totem or purge and it would actually be a trade up.
---
Elemental shamans are the only shamans who should truly pose a threat to mages once both have gear, without gear resto are tougher and enhancement is a free honor kill unless you start counting items like trinket and grenades which can always help a good player.
---
I used to duel A LOT of shamans in classic, no engineers either my frost mage or their shaman. But the fake outs and interupts combine with last minute ice barrier/grounding totem were big variables.
---
Herbing, mining, fishing and cooking.
---
&gt; The lag alone before the entirety of Daggerspine EU transfered to Kazzak made add fights a fucking nightmare.
---
&gt; On private servers and classic every guild that raids will have Nef down within the first/second reset. 
---
The pirate server consensus is that vanilla raids are super easy. And, of course, that pirate server players are super l33t.
---
Try telling them that a lot of it is because of modern frame rates and modern ping and they get upset. They are 100% convinced that if they could travel back in time to 2004 they would clear MC in the second week in 2004 greens with 2004 mechanics, 2004 lag and 2004 frame rates.
---
They aren‚Äôt competing, they are the same subscription.
---
There is an understood meaning and implication from those symbols.  This is not new. If you want to say something don't skirt and act coy about it.
---
35 years old nerds who live with momma can't RP female elves in Azeroth anymore
---
Who cares?
---
The alternative is they should make WOW 2 or something and stop milking the dead cow.  Honestly WOW has just run its course and the bloated weird game it is now is just sad.
---
I'm not going to go hunting through the 38+ list of patch notes, but if you do, you're looking for the one that talks about how extra swing procs can no longer proc themselves. They "fixed" that by adding an internal cooldown to Windfury and other items.
---
Running 5 man's will help tons, but learning from guides never hurts. If you can, try and be an off tank that holds adds, or extra mobs while the main tank takes boss. More experience from raid mobs, boss adds, ect will help you get better at how to tank
---
the movie was pretty cheesy but honestly i love the detail they put into the backgrounds.  i was in the cinema getting hyped every time i spotted like a westfall harvester or whatever in the background
---
elemental in group pvp is the best range dmg dealer of any caster. they are just walking turrets.
---
Lady dog, man dog, I love sheep
---
Cloth Shamans are delicious as a rogue, make sure to never wear full mail so I can 2 shot you.
---
Get out.
---
There is likely an organized AV group running pretty frequently that you could hop in on non raid times. Run as Resto until you get enough rank for some pieces
---
They will be competing for each other's playerbase.
---
I feel 'more dps' is misleading, since the increased DPS:: cost ratio is pathetic. But I wanted to add, another thing your raid can spam is oil of immolation. Again, the damage increase is somewhat small, but the cost isn't huge.
---
It's low in my. That's it. Starts catching up on believe and breaks even about AQ. The bigger problem is their threat on horde. If alliance just take pally buff and go ham
---
Does everyone forget about Warcraft 3
---
LUL
---
&gt; Are most baristas viable candidates? No
---
Ding ding ding. This was my entire point.
---
&gt; Are most middling developers viable candidates for director of an entire studio and the face of the game? No
---
Omar is not a good public speaker, he's not a good communicater, he's not a good leader, he's not a good artist, he's not a good designer, and he has absolutely no experience that would qualify him for Ion's job. Omar is a good engineer that tinkered with something and showed it to other people that ran with it, that's it.
---
How does everyone think pandas were a joke. They were literally in the campaign for WC3
---
Thanks that really helps!
---
Mods are busy deleting things that dont violate rules or directing people to threads that have been dead for 18 months. They cba to uphold these "rules" you speak of.
---
If you got no friends, yeah fuck it. Should feel like a brand new game if you change factions
---
I never said anything about Omar, OP's post is nonsense.
---
i'm not sure what "point" you are trying to make here. would you be happier if instead of using parentheses, the above poster simply said "hollywood accountants, who are jewish...." ?
---
your incoherent complaining essentially amounts to getting angry at others for describing a jewish group of people as jewish. again, there is nothing wrong with pointing out the demographics or characteristics of a group of people
---
can you explain why it is "wrong" to point out that there are a lot of jews in hollywood? how is this different from saying that the majority of residents in Teldrassil are night elves?
---
And this one is a regular on The Donald.
---
Don't worry about it you're being brigaded by trumptards and nazis.
---
Mythic content is by far more difficult and more engaging than anything Classic has to offer.
---
Microtransactions drive classic players away, it doesn't attract them lol.
---
The tool looks excellent and all that - but do you really need 30 minutes and a PowerPoint presentation to explain what downranking is? I'm a big fan of theorycrafting, but these convoluted guides on the most trivial matters blow my mind. The game isn't *that* advanced, especially PVE.
---
Yeah, this very mirrors how it went for me, lol
---
cool
---
They own both games, and both games are included in the same fee. There is literally no competition. Stop trying to turn this into a retail vs. classic thing. Either way you‚Äôre giving the same money to the same corporation that just fired 800 people after posting record profits.
---
Yeah, I am on my own and returning to WoW after 10 years away.
---
I have no ties.
---
Paladin is very unique in that they are extremely reactive and relatively easy/forgiving of mistakes.  The only thing that screws a paladin is kick/counterspells.
---
Every other healer has to be very careful and think ahead because once they get out of position or become the train target they will have a bad time.  Druids can be super tanky but you have to know when you‚Äôre getting focused and shift before you get stunned.
---
Priests are in cloth, so you‚Äôre dead if you don‚Äôt get peels.  Fear bomb can help but it won‚Äôt save you from warriors.
---
Shamans have good armor, but not having bubble makes them vulnerable when trained, and they have no CC of their own.  Nature‚Äôs Swiftness is strong, but healing wave is the weakest big heal of the 4 classes.
---
There‚Äôs really nothing like a paladin (which is generally a good thing).  You‚Äôd be best off as a Druid or shaman, but just know that you need good peels on horde or you will get lit up.
---
Begone heathen! Head back to your city of dirt!
---
Boredom.

---
Aww man sweet I just hit level 15 last night!
---
You sweating profusely: yep me too as you log out of your level 50 toon.
---
TIL after playing this games for 15 years lol
---
Yeah but
---
did you get the memo?
---
You think sequels of moderate movies pull in more than the original?  If this one barely made enough to be a success a sequel would be a flop.
---
Why would they do that?
---
Youareerareare welcome
---
UD for pvp, troll pve, orc if you love the way male orcs look.
---
Because the windfury buff the town applies to the players weapon lasts 9 seconds
---
Thank you. Much better.
---
The only 2 actions that can proc nightfall are stormstrike and your normal weapon attacks, windfury procs cant trigger weapon procs.
---
So you‚Äòre looking for your weapon swings every 2.45-3.5 Seconds, depending on flurry, and your stirmstrike every 20secs. 
---
From here on do the math on yourself, you‚Äòll ser why enh Shaman is the worst nightfall wielder.
---
Forum rules update: Post beta content and reminisce about the past. Just those two things. Please make sure you ONLY reminisce about vanilla and not about how anything else compares to vanilla.
---
If you like playing melee DPS but you don't want to go Rogue, then I'd go Orc Fury Warrior. You can build them for either 2handers or DW. Some of the available weapons, like Arcanite Reaper, will help give you the DK flavor.
---
I get your point but I don't like having alts, I like to focus on just one class. Especially Classic, that requires so much time invested.
---
Honkity honk honk.
---
Nope, I know the rogue is my class but I also think that maybe I should play hunter just because it has mobility and easy time without proper gear. Idk.
---
My life for the horde
---
the butthurt crusader
---
But like... paladins though.
---
Because we are oh so mysterious
---
The game is based on playing with other people.  If you want to play BFA, and half your friends or guild quit it to play classic, that impacts your enjoyment and time playing BFA.  The opposite is true if people are playing classic and decide to jump to BFA.  There is a WOW playerbase, the two games will be directly competing for the players.  The company doesn't care, as long as the players are playing one of the games, but the playerbases of each game sure as hell will care.
---
I grew up playing WC3, I was excited when the pandas came out for MoP.
---
I think they got a lot of hate because many (obviously not _every_ one) players who had never even heard of Warcraft 3 simply didn‚Äôt know about them, and thought blizzard was just picking races out of a hat.
---
Pandas were in the campaign for Warcraft 3, and Chen could be hired as a neutral-hero at taverns. 
---
https://liquipedia.net/warcraft/Pandaren_Brewmaster
---
His ult was even ‚ÄúStorm Earth and Fire‚Äù, which is as classic as it gets.
---
Yeah.. that's the whole point. They both appeal, so I'm trying to rationalize it as much as I can
---
Sry fot the late response. Thats a nice plan, i hope you ll find a nice community to top it off
---
Mage doesnt use much tier sets, bar a few t3 pieces. Same with lock.
---
Hahaha, I was hoping somebody would relate
---
DUDUDUDUDU
---
Meh, I fully intend to buy gold in Classic and there will be plenty of others doing the same.
---
Warlock or Warrior here. But the lean on Warlock is quite strong.
---
Imp Ghost Wolf is for leveling and maybe PvP but not PvE. 
---
I'm going for [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#hZxZEcxpAeqo). You can move a point from Ancestral Healing to Healing Focus if you like but otherwise it's pretty cookie cutter.
---
It's like fucking Whoville at Christmas 24/7.
---
Same! It‚Äôs not the most pretty or even interesting, but it‚Äôs nice having a giant open desert without any mountains or valleys in the way. Also the quests and ZF are a nice bonus.
---
It has "shit" in the name.
---
Ya, not as flushed out as the Lock one though. Join the lock discord, theres links to all the class discords in one of the info tabs at the bottom.
---
Thank you for actually answering the question! This was helpful.
---
I paid ¬£90 each for 2 refurb fujitsu t752s. I5 3210m 8gb ram. Spent ¬£30 on 2 new 120gb ssd (optional). Runs classic like a dream.
---
i actually feel so bad that i subbed to bfa just for a chance to get into classic
---
im def going to make a new blizz account when classic comes out
---
1 i will be much less likley to ever log onto retail if i dont have my characters
---
2 it will be much easier to sell off the account if i have the clean email to go with it
---
You mean from China?  Blizz isn't selling classic gold lol
---
Warlocks seem trivial untill you don't have wotf, it also solves seduce.
---
* Can a level 60 Holy Priest hold his own in a non-group setting?   No, you become group-dependent.
---
* Do they fare well in 1v1 W-PvP?   No, you are squishy and lack meaningful offense.
---
* Can they farm gold well?   Not really, but you can gather herbs and fish.
---
* Can they efficiently kill mobs?  Absolutely not, but it can be done if you have mage water and time.
---
It's a great class and if there's a shortage of healers (many times there are not!), then you'll get asked to groups.  If you're on a PvP server, you're gonna get shit on solo. Night and day difference between solo holy priest and hunter, for example. Night and day different between group setting for holy priest and hunter at the same time.
---
LF page 17
---
This was weird.
---
It's not even a big closet.
---
When you need 40 people to raid, you take what you can get with healers.  reliable players that show up ready to go are far more valuable.
---
Yes! It's warrior and mage for me.
---
Don't think wiping raids will be the best way to grind honor.
---
It's also Disc not holy and it takes good gear to do it, and even with decent gear you probably have to pop a mana pot on every pull.
---
And I mean no offense when I say that I'm trying to tell you and OP is that the recipe won't be in the game from the start if Blizzard's follows its expressed intention for item addition patch by patch- it will be in phase 3 when BWL is released.
---
I'm not intending to accuse or admonish, just share the info I have- I hope you pull off your plans to make a ton of money off of the item :)
---
Omg I just remembered how much of a grind that is haha - I can't wait! Thanks for the memories!
---
I don't tell coworkers or friends about my main account. They will actually think I'm the most casual.
---
we get that. But we need more details.
---
Is -this- a good leveling spec (if I get A first, then B, then work towards C, then back down to A2, etc)
---
It's like saying "[Is this how I rebuild a classic mustang?](https://robbreportedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/01-shelby-gt500cr-classic.jpg?w=1024)"
---
Schrodinger‚Äôs education system.
---
Did someone say Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Wind Seeker?
---
It's all about stepping out of your comfort zone as they say, if you like group pvp more priest is the best :) you'll get just as comfortable eventually with the priest don't worry. 
---
Ps. Just a tip if you go priest. Spec into PI 32/19/0 rather than the typical holy spec since it's way more durable and better for pvp and you can heal raids just fine with it.
---
You're probably talking about Patch 1.4.0 (2005-05-05). But I'm pretty sure, that didn't add an ICD. In Patch 1.4.0 Blizzard stated, that it was a bug, that Windfury would give an aditional hit + reset of the Weapon swing timer, so they fixed it. I mean, an ICD doesn't even address these problems and would've not changed anything about it, so why would they have added that in that patch? I do not have super solid evidence to proof it was added during TBC myself, though I read that it was added to balance dual wielding for enhancement, which was introduced to shamans in TBC
---
Blind, AND drop bleed and poison, dwarves can also skip the mirror, and warriors.
---
I mean, I guess I did.
---
I don‚Äôt care who sells it. It would be better for the community if Blizzard did, but people don‚Äôt seem to remember how much worse it was before WoW Tokens.
---
At least with WoW tokens only providing Blizzard Balance that can‚Äôt be used in Classic for anything but realm transfers and game time, people would only buy so much.
---
Oh gotcha. Well I'll focus on Enh first then move on to Elemental (30ish) then respec at 55-60
---
This is beautiful and so very true!
---
Ty bro, i Will look into this
---
first estimate suggests 320 as the breakeven point, and once you take the disproportionate distribution of sales into account its fairly easy to see how it could be a bad or meh investment from whoever made it.
---
I will be focusing on pvp but will want to pug and run dungeons every now and then
---
YAH.
---
^(I got the memo right here)
---
That's what i like about the orcs
---
Not a Race / Class combo but a race / profession combo-
---
And that would be gnome engineers. When I made my rogue back in 2005 when I was only 8 I only wanted to level my engineering- I'd stealth around and kill mobs that were defending copper nodes until I was gated in my engineering progression by my character's level.
---
There is something so satisfying about being a goggle-wearing, dynamite-throwing, gadget-wielding midget :)

Old school runescape
---
Tanking 5 mans is the best way to learn. I don‚Äôt really want to tank raids in Vanilla, but dungeons are fun. I‚Äôll just run one or two dungeons a week to keep up with my rested xp.
---
But you‚Äôll get the hang of it. Start off easy, like doing Deadmines at 20-22. Every level makes a huge difference as a tank and can be a crutch or training wheels as you get your bearings as a tank.
---
Legion's Return to Karazhan was a fantastic dungeon, some of the most fun I've ever had in WoW and that's the truth.  The first part of the dungeon was more or less similar (Opera quite different though!) and after Shade of Medivh (not Aran anymore!) everything turned super wacky but super awesome.    
---
It was a blast and a fitting tribute to old Kara.  You would have loved it.
---
8.2 is okay. It doesn‚Äôt fix the core issues of BfA like terrible class design and a bad story but it‚Äôs going in the right direction now. Nazjatar is pretty good.
---
doesnt it refresh itself as long as you are in range of the totem?  the totem lasts for 2 minutes
---
Mage, definitely mage.
---
(killed by a warlock)
---
Maybe warlock.. Mage or warlock...
---
Nope, still definitely mage.
---
(fails to save someone who pulled too much)
---
Maybe a healer? Priest.. or paladin..
---
Or if I play horde, maybe shaman?
---
Fuck yeah shamans are cool, definitely gonna be a shaman.
---
(Have to ask a mage for water once)
---
Maybe I should go back to being a mage..
---
(Plays with a terrible tank)
---
Heck, maybe I should play warrior instead.
---
(killed by a mage)
---
Still haven't decided
---
210 million on a 160 budget means that whoever paid for it to be made will be hemorrhaging money. That compared to showings in china making less royalties means that not only did this one lose money, a hypothetical next one will definitely lose money too.
---
You don't need wotf if you open on the warlock though, unless you're terrible he won't even get a deathcoil off yet alone a fear. As far as seduce goes you still have alot of options to counter it (altough being undead makes it somewhat easier) 
---
Only SL warlocks with void out stand a chance, and those are very niche
---
They can't sell classic gold...that would completely annihilate classic from even being close to a vanilla experience.  Gold sellers will be big again, but that is just the way it is.  Take your chances with them and hopefully Blizz polices it as best they can.
---
I mean from my understanding the blue posts are pretty clear.  
---
I doubt you'll get anything close to Rank 14 between Phase 2 and 3 though, but since we don't know how long that's going to be there's no way of knowing for sure.
---
I haven‚Äôt watched it, was it any good?
---
You know its good when it makes a guy who swore off wow for life feel like playing again.
---
Same. I even race changed my main to Pandaren, mostly because the food buff racial was nice.
---
If you're not planning on raiding then you don't really need to spec deep resto. You can get away with just the 21 points up to Nature's Swiftness.
---
Oh yeah it's not like a mage/lock where you start doing 15% more damage just because you have a flask up. It's probably more along the lines of 3-5% damage depending on the fight. There's also weird stuff like Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom scaling with spellpower/+nature damage to consider.
---
Level 38, you get a new rank lightning bolt. Spec elemental from enhance. Go for elemental mastery as it helps your burst and grinding significanty at 40.
---
At the same time,  pick up engineering for a green lens of nature's wrath. That will carry you in your 60's. 36 nature sp is nuts around your late 30 and 40's.
---
At the same time get all the good nature / sp gear and a shield. The fastest way to level is by only spamming lightning bolt at enemies. Highest DPs and most mana efficient spell you have. Use a lower ranked lb to finish off mobs to avoid overkill or hit them a few times. Spending more than 8 seconds or ~ 3 auto attacks is too much as that will slow down your kill speed and xp/h.
---
When leveling, most important stat is spell power. Not spirit. Second would be stem/int, as you will be chugging after your 4th or 5th chain pull spamming lightning bolts.  Int will help when you are leveling because of minor amounts of spell crit, bigger mana pool for potentially killing another mob between drinks.
---
Classic case of too much money to throw away
---
Hah thats exactly me. Every damn day
---
So good! Keep making wow landscapes!
---
well I could use a healbot for leveling but: A) horde or alliance, B) eu or us, C) I want to go 24h+ on the first day : D
---
What kind of potato did you record this on?
---
If 90% of the players are playing classic, that really fucks up the retail game because there's no reason to make content that no one is playing
---
Oh, I remember that. I'm pretty sure Mia Rose got banned from her WOW account for being in one of those movies
---
LFR is harder than MC with world buffs.
---
Exactly, and they start off with a higher base strength anyway. Dwarves are jacked to the gills, I'm sure he'll be a formidable warrior.
---
UD mage,cuz every1 is affraid when u enter Tyr's Hand
---
Someone is triggered
---
Is that a military term?  There is a small streamer I like named Kargoz who uses that term a lot and he is former army.
---
I used autohotkey [its legal so long as 1 button press = 1 button press, no spamming] to bind my controller to WASD/etc, and could get creative with leaving the mouse in the middle of the screen for autoloot, or just use mouse as well.  Good for grinding, not good for dungeons.
---
The pirated realm shitters are the real toxic players.
---
When it came out my friends were making fun of it because of the comic graphics. Now 14 years later it still looks good. Best decision by blizzard to change the looks with wc3
---
A) probably alliance because memories b) us c)I‚Äôll probably only log 12-16 on the first day Bc I‚Äôm a filthy casual xD
---
What movie is that from? I see Chris Pratt and Aubrey Plaza, I want to watch
---
The realm being listed as full doesn't prevent you from making characters on that server as far as I know.
---
Dafuq?
---
But you‚Äôre wrong so please fuck off with your lies :)
---
You'd have a lot more interesting debates and discussions going on at least, but the amount of posts and comments would probably dwindle.
---
I love getting achievements, and typically try to get them all, but I had a lot more fun with games before achievements became mainstream. Could just be an age thing, though.
---
A microwaved broccoli as a matter of fact!
---
dungeons and raids have no sense of exploration though, they're all designed to by speedruned on mythic and have nothing unique about them like secret rooms/bosses or events. It's just move to boss A then B then C then D and now you are at the final boss good job. 
---
And that gets old really really fast.
---
So for you, mounts dictate a good game?
---
There specs for healers that allow them to heal and do enough damage for a bit of farming. 
---
For example, Shamans can go 30/0/21. 
---
Druids can also go 30/0/21 and heal just fine (moonglow spec is nice to help with mana issues). 
---
Priests apparently can farm some areas with Holy Nova. 
---
Obviously as a healer, it won't be as efficient as other spec/classes, but it's helpful.
---
This does not help my anxiety about playing a human priest.

Everything you said I feel about bfa. 
---
40 splinters at 30% drop rate is over 10 weeks of full clearing Naxx.
---
Skipping out on WW Axe stinks, but isn't that bad.
---
Corpsemaker (RFK) or Loksey's Training Stick (SM Lib), potentially Illusionary Rod (SM Lib). The Pacifier is a good option if you're fast enough to kill the rare spawn first.
---
Then Ravager (SM Arm), Bonebiter if you're Alliance.
---
Will of the Mountain Giant (Weapons of Spirit in Feralas), or Executioner's Cleaver (BoE World Drop if you can get it). Potentially Morgaine's Might if your luck sucks.
---
The Chief's Enforcer (ZF)
---
Resurgence Rod (Corruption of Earth and Seed in Mara) or Gatorbite Axe (Mara)
---
Soulkeeper is surprisingly high damage if you grab Thrash Blade instead of Resurgence Rod.
---
Angerforge's Axe (BRD)
---
After that you're basically aiming for your pre-raid BiS for 2h:
---
* Dreadforge Retaliator (BRD), Arcanite Reaper (not worth the investment imo) for Orcs. 
---
* Malown's Slam (Strath Live), Warblade of Caer Darrow (Scholo), Demonshear (Strath Live) for Humans.
---
* Slavedriver's Cane (Strath UD) - due to 1.12 itemization this is pretty nuts.
---
I'd recommend Slavedriver's to most races without any weapon specialization, but you're not limited to that. Same thing for Orcs and Humans, though you'd be throwing away your Weapon Skill advantage which is nothing to sneeze at.
---
I felt my own personal resolve get stronger after reading this.  Thank you for sharing.

---
Wow there‚Äôs actually morons who think this is fake. It‚Äôs not. He just got insanely lucky.
---
The world in Vanilla feels so much bigger than in modern WoW.
---
I've tried it. The game is faster but that's it. And no, original Naxx is harder than anything in the current game :)
---
Some people find reality shows and child beauty pageants engaging, it's okay to find BfA more engaging than the greatest piece of art ever made for PC. You should be playing instead of commenting on the classic sub.
---
Thunderfury before replacing UBRS shield? Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs good or bad luck.
---
You can stop seeing this by just deleting the beta files. Since you arent in the beta, it will disappear. Problem solved
---
Hell, even heroic and mythic+ dungeons are probay harder than most of what vanilla ha
---
The ebook version is only ~10$ but yeah, it's easily worth the price if you prefer hardback.
---
At some point during Vanilla, Windfury and all other extra-hit-on-hit procs were changed so that they could not trigger themselves. That‚Äôs the change you‚Äôre looking for. An ICD wasn‚Äôt the ideal fix, but it was the best they could come up with. We‚Äôre not talking about a cooldown longer than a couple seconds, just enough to make proc chaining impossible
---
Thinking out loud for myself and the good fellows who will be curious enough to follow me in that maze:
---
1 - I do enjoy leveling just to learn some new spells while the difficulty arise and unlock some new regions in the game - Do anyone remember the first time he met one of those scary as shit mob with a skull instead of a level, then being one shot a few times trying to escape ? That was epic !
---
2 - At some point I love raiding to get some BiS stuff and be more badass and good at my role.
---
3 - Part of my frustration though come from the fact that a new expansion make all of my epic stuff completely out-performed by some greens, but what the point of raiding if I already have the BiS stuff ? At some point it must worth my investment, so I guess this part is inevitable.
---
4 - Nevertheless, in Vanilla there is some BiS stuff  for every class that is not necessarily purple, nor even the higher lvl needed. So maybe we should ditch the color thing, and let people think about the stuff they have rather than freaking out because not every thing is the same color in their inventory. I would like to add that I truly think that a good bunch of colors has been randomly attributed in Vanilla (any lvl 40 tankadin in the room ? Dodge in mail or Stamina in plate ? agility or spirit ? Ok so stuff with nothing but armor can be green too ?
---
5 - Literally needing the key of the gate of Stratholme to enter the town was frustrating for the casual me, but kind of amazing too. So maybe Blizzard should let WoW be the game it was back in the days: A freaking pain in the ass for the newcomer !
---
"You didn't finish that quest in Karazhan ? No way you pass the Dark Portal dude ! You are not prepared !"
---
Human Mage.
---
Gnomes are for punting off a cliff
---
Glad I could inspire you with my story of ridiculousness.
---
Same here!  For the longest time I was going to play Druid, feral tank, prove people wrong.  Low gear competition, strong with little gear, shape shifting fun, throwing a heal, hopping into cat, stealth and slippery in pvp.  Being able to stealth wherever I am is nice for wife aggro.
---
But then...I played a mage in vanilla and I was awful.  Mage feels so good to me.  I‚Äôve always preferred the mage-wizard type in all RPGs.  I don‚Äôt need to tell you guys why mages are so strong in vanilla.  I want to do my mage justice and I‚Äôve heard everyone say ‚Äúno one regrets rolling a mage in vanilla‚Äù.  
---
Good luck to you!
---
My favorite Alex bit is when he says he‚Äôs alpha and red pilled.

Ya, easily could use the left monitor for shit like spotify, discord, etc. Something you dont have to see all the time.
---
I know what the item does. I just didn't see any worthwhile use for it.
---
cmon man i thought i was finally settled on alliance quit doin this shit :'(
---
just quit job and stream, free money 4head : ))))
---
You know monitors can be bought for like 25$ used. LOL
---
No, they won't. They share a subscription. And simply because one likes Classic doesn't mean they hate BFA by default. Just because one likes BFA doesn't mean they hate Classic by default.
---
a thunderfury rogue?
---
Better then those starting pants at least. Best is to not question it I think, or it all falls apart.
---
If you're just doing dungeons you won't run into any mana issues. As long as you had some healing gear, you could heal any dungeon with 0 talent points spent.
---
How can people be so blind, just watch as some guilds will tear themselves appart because half their players go play a different game and tell me again how they do not impact each other.
---
People will focus on playing one or the other, who cares if they hate the other game or not?  They are directly competing for each others playerbase lol
---
*All around me are familiar faces*
---
Anytime, remember you are an armored ranged caster with an offensive anti caster tool kit. You don't have the same pure sustained DPs as other classes because you have healing/buff toolkits to act as a damage multiplier. You do however have the best ranged burst setup in the game. Use that to delete targets of opportunity (in both pve and especially PvP) and a very strong anti caster toolkit you need to take full advantage of.
---
Your primary role is always dropping  totem for warriors and acting as a counter to paladin's shenanigans. If you keep on top of enemy paladins, then you shut down what makes the alliance think they are hot shit. Purge those BoF and BoP and interrupt paladins when they do try to heal. Your spells punch right through their armor and they tend not to have high HP pools. Be ready to do a lightning wombo combo to mop them up when they get down to 60% or less HP. Need to burst them down before they even have the option of bubbling.
---
No one's going to care what race your character is, unless you're in some super hardcore world first raiding guild. Play what you want.
---
I mean during pvp
---
If you think you're hitting r14 without playing BG's for 10 hours everyday for months, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.

Sure, I was shaman class lead.  I can help you out.   There's basically 39 healing pts in the resto tree worth taking.  The remaining 12 pts basically don't even matter.  You can do w/e you want with them.

There is absolutely a competition: one for the player's time. Yes, you CAN play both. But MMOs require a large time investment, and as for myself I definitely won't have the time to play both at once, as with a lot of people. Add on top of that work and all the other games one might want to play, and it's clear one will win out depending on which players feel is more worthy their time.

I should note that it's not worth speccing elemental prior  to 38. You need the extra sp from gear, and the talents (spell crit, reduced cast speed, clear casting) that just aren't available at lower levels. Melee damage with rock biter and kiting with earth binding totem will be fine and convienvtly only slows down in your late 30s just in time to respect elemental anyway.

It will be mathematically impossible to get rank 14 before phase 3, you could be top of bracket 1 every week, won't matter, you might get to like rank 11 by then.  I forget, someone did the math.
---
I¬¥d play beta if:
---
1. I actually had beta.
---
2. If beta wouldn't require you to sub. Why should I sub to test the game and lose all progress made in two months time? Rather wait for August.
---
It isn't about the amount of honor. As long as other people are getting very little honor too -- you simply have to be the top contributer for the last 3 weeks.
---
I am fully aware of, and regularly calculated the brackets for ranker groups both in original Classic, and on private servers.
---
It's physically possible, even if Phase 2 only lasts 3 months, especially if the bracket leaders cooperate and don't break established caps.

Yes pretty much. I‚Äôm torn between Warrior Rogue and priest at the moment.  I love to PVP but I also really love vanilla raiding and dungeons. I love warrior PVP, to me it is the most fun class to PVP, rogue is a very close second, and being able to stealth around is super fun. I want to play priest for the ability to Raid and dungeon anytime I log on.  Not sure if I will enjoy priest pvp. 
---
It‚Äôs just a very hard decision to make. I played shaman rogue and warrior in vanilla. 
---
Always thought about if I got the chance to do it all over again what I would play, mostly been set on warrior, or rogue. 
---
It‚Äôs just such a fucking tough decision mainly because I do have limited time to play, having 3 toons is gonna be impossible.

In a similar vein, the guild I'll be joining for Classic mentioned they're low on locks for their roster so far. Which sounds great to me! I'm hoping to make the hop over.
---
No, it's small 3 man gank squads constantly rotating through the world -- but you still DO the bombing for boosts, at set schedules, to get the boost.
---
Just like if BG ques are long, you go gank in the world between que-pops. If you're horde, in phase 2, I highly recommend camping the hallway enroute to Diremaul.
---
Then you realize it was just one of those panthers.

If anything I‚Äôm disappointed there‚Äôs not enough min-maxing.

Because quests reward 100% rep until they are gray, it can be worth it to do a few starting quests in the human zone first (if they arent incredibly overcamped). May as well overlevel a bit any chance you get.
---
If I was doing this, Id probably hit level 3 or 4 and then make the journey.
---
Yeah this would be great. Thanks for the info
---
I didn't even so much as suggest it was related to the amount of honour. So I don't know why you even mentioned that.
---
I said, and I repeat. I **doubt** you'll get rank 14 within the time between phase 2 and 3, but ultimately neither of us know how long that phase will last.

Jumping from the zep before docking is a trust fall.
---
You could also play a Tauren druid and level together as feral for questing, and be able to run dungeons as a tank and healer. Druids can fill either role, or play as dps.
---
Make a second hunter and make him a tank. There are hunter tanking guides and it‚Äôs viable (+super fun) for 5man content .
---
The truth is that dwarf priests are there to cover up for warriors who aren't doing their best. The bosses that do fear do it in a predictable 30 second window (with accompanying ground shake) and warriors can always stance dance it if they are aware.
---
That said, if the warrior fucks up even once, there is no tremor totem to pick up the slack so they'll be eating a full duration fear and this will usually cause a wipe. 
---
I wouldn't go so far as to say that DPs are 100% required, but if you go on to raid nef without one, your MT better have a solid computer and connection.
---
BIGGER! I need this for my desktop!
---
Pally or Warlock for me. Do I heal like I always used to or switch to DPS? Mostly interested in PVP. But there are just so many factors ripping me in both directions.
---
I remember spending so much time doing open world PvP in Southshore as my Night Elf Rogue, and then wrapping it up by running up this tower to catch a Zeppelin to leave in style.
---
lots of fun emoting with Horde players while taking gentle flights across continents.
---
Judging by the lack of paladin and shaman i'm guessing you haven't even settled on a faction
---
A rogue can 100 to 0 most classes if you can sit undisturbed and use all your cooldowns. But you only see that shit in pvp videos. You don't always get to open on the lock. Also what are you doing about seduce, trinket? In BGs you will get feared all the time, even if you're 'just so good'.
---
I've had 4700 Soulfire crits in T2/R14/ZG gear.
---
Troll hunter with a pet raptor, bow and skinning/leatherworking really does it for me.
---
This sounds great, I m just wonder if this could get you banned. Any info on this not being a problem for Blizzard?

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c7k6z3/-/) has been removed for Rule 7 because it was considered to be a repost.

This is not true. That is the game being preloaded onto your system. When you finish downloading, you will not be able to enter the game. This is not a beta invite.

---
Another repost without credits. Boo
---
See above -- but that's unrelated to the question. I mean, if literally nobody else on the server PvP's? Such as on a PvE server before battlegrounds exist... in a perfect vacuum...
---
If you just sit inside Gurubashi arena, and all the horde and alliance who want to PvP rank just stayed there and FFA'd 4 hours per day ... and agreed to meet tomorrow ... and the next day ... and the next day? You would all actually successfully climb up the ranks at a ridiculous speed.
---
Likewise, squads of players hanging out at the gates of Ogrimmar on a PvE server (9 rogues, and a paladin) ... who can successfully provoke people to attack the paladin ... and then kill the players who flag on him ... will successfully rank if nobody else is doing the same thing.
---
That's how the math of the pyramid system actually -works-...
---
Really? I don‚Äôt remember that. Hmm.
---
This has nothing to do with my QUESTION however.
---
For PVP shadow, you need to go undead. Every race has different spells for priest and undead get a killer DoT on top of already having Will of the Forsaken.
---
On the other hand, dwarves have the best healing racial spell.
---
I still got that armor in my void storage lol
---
Are Warriors really that bad at solo content? 
---
I have a friend leveling a Holy Paladin and so I‚Äôm leaning towards a Warrior instead of Rogue, however, when he‚Äôs not online am I going to have a hard time doing stuff at 60 without him?
---
This question mainly is about world PvP. I almost feel like I won‚Äôt be able to take anyone 1v1.
---
I switched to prot in original at aq40.  Tanked everything up to then as 31/5/15 or a fury dps build
---
Was it Campbell‚Äôs meatballs?
---
It missed its break-even point by about 20 million.
---
They really should have just started with Artha's story. It's really the only coherently told epic in the game at least.
---
I feel bad for the Pet :c
---
Also useful for damaging caster mobs since you often have to waste rage on an interrupt right after charging; Might as well leave them bleeding since they usually have pretty low health pools.
---
then the problem of people continuing to join already overpopulated realms... is not solved?
---
Why should I roll a hunter instead of a mage? Or why should I roll a mage instead of a hunter?
---
Yeah, Steam Controller + ConsolePort will get a ton of use from me.
---
MCP gives more dps than Atiesh does sadly.
---
I have a Computer gaming magazine from back then that had an article about wow. The writer literally said that the only thing that could ruin the game was blizzard changing it to cater to the more casual crowd.  This was written well before launch, like a few years.
---
You said you wanted to get it before phase 3, I answered your question:  you can't.  The fastest way to rank 14 is obvious, be top of bracket 1 every week from the launch of the honor system until you have it, that will be at some point in phase 3.  Yes the items will be on the pvp vendors as soon as the honor system is implemented.
---
Frontstabbing only works on private servers. You can‚Äôt do that in the Beta. So I highly recommend Combat Swords/Maces for leveling.
---
Because they don‚Äôt have their A/C licenses
---
It's a super common speed levelling thing, dunno where it originated though
---
Yeah dude, mix it up. It‚Äôs a new start might as well do something totally different.
---
I just did that quest and it is a pain.  There aren't that many of those sneaky cats and, as a warrior, it's a pain if I don't get to charge them.
---
Maybe Enh shaman. maybe. Anything else seems like a stretch.
---
Unless you wanna come full circle and roll a Paladin
---
I don't recall ever doing a spec specifically for pvp as resto.  I always just pvp'd with my resto spec, but if I suppose if I wanted to be more serious about pvp, then I'd use something like this.

You're going to want to take a look at the *[Looking for Group Monday](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=flair%3ALFG%2BMonday&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=all)* threads.
---
in my city you got the copy at mcdonalds back as tbc launched haha
---
You‚Äôve hit Grand Marshal multiple times?
---
Where did you get that information from? Because what I'm asking about is hard evidence, not hearsay.
---
Some people are saying that the WSG Spell-pen runes won't be available day 1, nor will some "Naxx Patch Blue" releases in BRD and other dungeons...
---
Some people are saying Hand of Justice will be on General Angerforge.
---
I'm asking for posts on this, as I've been unable to find more than average joe on reddit messaging me. I am wondering if other people have found other info available or not.
---
In this particular instance Universal was entitled to 10% off the top for them bringing it to the US. Ironic considering it was a massive flop and Universal did their job terribly.
---
Warrior is basically the weakest 1v1 class but if you go prepared you can still win a lot of fights. Many people just expect the basics, for example a mage expects you to trinket a slow/nova once. If you use say spider belt or even fap most have no idea what to do. If you step it up further with things like rocket helm/tidal etc you win even more. That said once you get to the point of players who are skilled with those items the classes flaws in 1v1 will become very apparent. Basically you can still enjoy a warrior solo.
---
Haha I will tomorrow thank you!
---
I bet it's like a sauna in therd
---
Some poeple stick with their faction for nostalgia, other swap for a new experience. 
---
I guess that since you started in WotLK you haven't really grown attached to either faction's quests and  zones.
---
Back in vanilla I always Lvled in the human zones and then up into wetlands and arathi. I never really touched ashenvale or stonetalon. I think that's what most alliance did and is why STV is such a murder zone.
---
How could you not mention Cthun axe? Stuuuuuupid pvp wep.
---
If any of them are as hardcore as you, you can level together. Not all your casual mates will level at the same speed either, so having an alt to level with them may not be as effective as you'd like
---
The afromentioned 1.4.0 is that change - that patch is getting cited, whenever poeple are talking about the nerf regarding windfury proccing off itself. Unfortunately it doesn't mention anything about adding an ICD. And  I've looked at all the other patchnotes in vanilla ( yes, I do have a lot of freetime :D) and it was not mentioned in any of them. Of course it could be plausible, that that particular change was never documented
---
I know it's a hard choice. DK is simply unique and has mix of many abilities from the other classes. But I want something that would remind me my DK a little bit at least.
---
17 is not one of the objectives of the quest, you pleb!
---
You have assburgers, look in a mirror? twat
---
Nah, some dodgy looking ones from the store's grab-and-go section.
---
But it was $5 for a tray of 20 meatballs.  How could i pass that up.
---
Remember that Northrend pre-WotLK (meaning concept art for it and WC3 maps) looked thiner, almost banana-like, and Outland was less varied, the whole thing looked like hellfire peninsula with floating trees and giant dry shroom flora
---
Lock or ret have,  I think, have the most in common but it‚Äôs a stretch no matter which way you go.
---
YT got that covered also:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBIvO-cZ8xM&amp;t=6s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBIvO-cZ8xM&amp;t=6s)
---
Yeah. I known a guy too, who did it on a druid an Alliance, and then gone to horde on the same server by deleting his toon and going to horde... because even with full PvP gear, they wouldn't let him Feral tank BWL.
---
Horde let him do it, and he got to tank 3 bosses every week. xD
---
Honestly release is probably the best possible time to do it. There are going to be many warrior parties pushing to do this, and at least one of them is going to have a healer friend happy to tag along. You'll be fine.
---
Personally I plan on speed leveling to 60 and then doing everything possible to help my guild's warriors get their axes. The sooner they hit 60, the sooner they can tank for me.
---
Are the raid times set in stone? Your the first guild I've come across that does weekend raiding which is exactly what I want
---
Thanks! :)
---
This is overblown. They are great tanks for 5mans and can tank a lot of raid bosses. There are a few raid bosses where druids are preferable and some where they just can't cut it.
---
It's also plausible that adding an ICD is exactly how they
---
&gt;  Fixed a bug that caused an additional attack beyond what was intended.
---
in patch 1.4.
---
Blizzard is not really in the habit of explaining exactly what happens with every change and the mechanics behind a fix and they were especially vague back then.
---
I started at launch, but only played for 6 months before moving on to other games.  I came back for Wrath and played through the TBC/Wrath content before moving on to other games again.
---
I have been away from the game for 10 years and only coming back for Classic.
---
That's a bad strat unless you plan to level in dungeons. You really don't need any prot talents, your spec will gimp you in the world.
---
So it's basically only good for the chance to stun off Seduce-SoulFire setups?
---
Gnomish death ray is awesome
---
Lolwhut, this thread is literally about Druid macros, just use those.
---
&gt;All part of the charm
---
Indeed! Im not a pvp'er at all, but I loved so many pvp encounters in vanilla wow. Especially the large scale fights before raids.
---
Im not good at pvp and i still love pvp servers...
---
They are item gating certain drops according to what patch it released in, but nothing will be in the game in a non 1.12 state.  Once something is in the game it will be 1.12 status.  I don't know what dungeon drops will or won't be around at first and I don't care, but the pvp stuff is easy, once the honor system is in, it will all be there, fully 1.12, just waiting for you to achieve the rank.  This was all outlined in stickied blue posts on the official Blizzard WOW forums, I suggest you go there and look at it.
---
25c a ball. Delicious!
---
Yeah, the more I think about it the more on the fence I am.
---
What do Alliance players even yell in chat?  Horde are always good for a *'For the Horde!'* or *'Zug Zug'*, but I have no idea what Alliance players would even yell.  We have Gnomes?
---
This is a fantastic capture.
---
You can't even get to that point in the chain until you kill over 10000 60-62 elite mobs to farm the 42000 carpaces you need to bring your rep to neutral. That will take dozens of people farming all day for at least a week. And that's with hardcore players farming. 
---
Sure, your casual guild could help you with the raid parts, just do it during your raid nights. They aren't really that hard. But no way you're farming the rep on 3 hours a day to get to that part.
---
That looks about like what I was thinking. Thanks for the replys
---
Then do the undead dance with the guitar shred, the head banging and the moshing. Metal afafaf
---
He's a Warrior.
---
It's solved by the warning, and the queue.
---
Bfa :( . Sadly that‚Äôs the state of the gaming industry, when retail wow is still the best game on the market , and we are all looking forward to a 15 year old game rather than something new coming out. Sad times we live in
---
Skip ww to grind sm for the dps mail and ravager. 0 pvp and the blue sm pieces will last until you farm plate replacements.
---
name them based off famous players like Unbreakable
---
That brings back memories
---
If you don't like tanking you should consider mage tbh. You will compete with 5-7 other fury wars and 4-6 combat rogues for weps. That's 18-30 swords divided among raiders. Gl getting geared without no-lifing for world buffs, pots, flasks, jujus and engineering to be highest on dps and get prio. Or spend all your saved up dkp on the first drop then never have a chance until the 28th drop
---
You really think he went and bought some cheap shitty $25 monitors on craigslist?
---
Like the ears from pvp kills in diablo. I would save all those lol
---
Is this wow2
---
I really want to say warrior but every time you get rolled by a hunter you‚Äôll wish you went that way.
---
32, IIRC
---
Human males are stacked

---
The tauren animal forms are too small. Nothing sillier than a massive minotaur beastman turning into a small bear to become tougher.
---
Delicious is not an adjective that I would attribute to these meatballs.  Firm, dry, flavorless would be appropriate.  Given the way my stomach has been rumbling since I ate some of them I am expecting a high speed dash through the house some time later today.
---
this and the Org pic are not originals by the artist
---
Things that keep my choices narrowed are.
---
1. 50g per respec is not a viable strategy. That's 100g a week to PvP as a healer.
---
2. If not 'Duo leveling' then Warriors and Pallies REALLY ARE that slow to lvl. I've read posts about people giving up on leveling a warrior even as an alt. Being able to funnel money into a warrior is preferable.
---
3. "The lvl 30 wall is real" - Wolrd record to 60 is like 116hrs, Speed levelers get to 20 in under 10. Those later levels are long. Better pick something to enjoy it.
---
4. If you don't like fierce competition then the less played classes will still be rewarding to play (Druid, Hunter, Warlock)
---
Small price to pay
---
Most good premades don't want shadow priests. They want holy priests or a dps like mage that can peel.
---
Zeppelin was there.  They just added more of them as the expansions came out
---
The movie was hot garbage.  I don't know what they were thinking.
---
It sounds like you would be into playing shadow priest.  The other comment presented a lot of info highlighting how they are inadequate at the very top 1% of players in terms of raiding and pvp.  I'm certain you could find groups and a raid spot as a shadow priest.  
---
And they absolutely dominate most casual players.  When I played a level 40 shadow priest I legitimately beat a level 60 rogue in my guild in duels (he happened to be playing from china and lagging horribly, but still).
---
Yes, from blue posts it seems like r14 weapons will be available for tier 2 raiding. Which multiple people have answered in here.
---
&gt;If you just sit inside Gurubashi arena, and all the horde and alliance who want to PvP rank just stayed there and FFA'd 4 hours per day ... and agreed to meet tomorrow ... and the next day ... and the next day? You would all actually successfully climb up the ranks at a ridiculous speed.
---
No, it's not going to happen. You can hit rank 10, possibly rank 11, but you're not hitting r14 unless you dedicate 8-12 hours a day for BG honor farming and are in a group that *allows* you to be next in line. 
---
You're understanding of the classic pvp system is off. There are only a designated few every week that are capable of hitting the hardcap and ranking, those people are picked in a queue system by the top pre-made BG's. Premade BG's can farm wins in 3-7 minutes, hanging out at Gurubashi will not compete in honor farm.
---
They can't 100 to 0 most classes without there being a window for them to fight back, warlock is pretty much the only one they can do that to without them even being able to cast a single spell.
---
You use skull of impending doom vs seduce, makes it useless for 15 seconds, after those 15 seconds you got pvp trinket. You can also trinket seduce, blind lock and just kill the pet (only has 1.4k hp) 
---
In BGs rogues are in the base and locks are in mid fighting for position, not many situations where they meet and if they do it's not 1vs1.
---
&gt; It was a mess behind the scenes of that movie apparently,
---
It shows.  I didn't expect much going in, and I was still disappointed.  It was just a mess.
---
I'm not denying that they are strong, but they aren't really annoying to deal with.
---
Questing in STV but has thunder fury? I don‚Äôt think so.
---
Resolutions have gotten better, which for a game like WoW with its large open world, really helps. It's really the closest thing we'll get to a graphical remaster of Vanilla. 
---
Sure there were high end CRT's back in the day, but they maxed out around the 4:3 equivalent of 1440p, 4K was out of the question.
---
Undead rogue was mine. Orokusaki let me feel like the ninja clan master was brought back from the dead in Azeroth with limited memory of his past life trying to resurrect his clan and restore its former glory.
---
We really have no idea about the itemization of phases besides that every item will be in its 1.12 state.
---
I seriously doubt that Phase 1 Onyxia and Molten Core are going to have their 1.2 loot tables. That means half the items from Ragnaros don't exist, none of the items from Majordomo exist (he literally didn't give loot until patch 1.4, which is one patch after Phase 2 content), and the tier sets will be all fucked up (some pieces not dropping at all, some T2 dropping where it shouldn't, some T2 not dropping where it should).
---
I also think it's safe to assume that all the available PVP gear will be available as soon as the Honor system drops.
---
However, the absolute minimum number of weeks between rank 0 and rank 14 is 12, if you are the top player every single week. And we know that Phase 2 is only going to last "a couple months". So there's literally no way to reach rank 14 before BWL launches.
---
The movie is absolutely worthy of the hate it gets.  It was a terrible movie in so many ways.  Some faithful and impressive CG world building in a couple scenes doesn't redeem that.
---
Between fear ward and blessings of salvation the Alliance is all about making up for bad tanks. If there was any single reason why horde raked in so many world firsts it‚Äôs because horde can‚Äôt rely on such crutches.
---
Paladins are free HK's to mages unless they are a top tier paladin who kites the mage or uses MEME cooldowns that don't reset until raid unlocks, also in those cases a mage can sheep bandage evocate and basically be in a better spot.
---
This would be great add-on for the game. 
---
  checks current sp and talents  then gives a adverage hps and hpms value when hovering over spells in the spell book
---
If you do, I‚Äôd advise going human. Elwynn, westfall, redridge and duskwood are really fun. I‚Äôve played horde for years but I always miss those zones.
---
Now touch penises
---
Fucking awesome!
---
Southern Hemisphere doesn't have mid year holidays so we are unaffected
---
That will be my alt.
---
&gt; I'm asking for blue posts regarding specific phases and items in the PvP system.
---
several comments here already answered this. this doesn't seem to satisfy the OP, so my suggestion is google literally any combo of all or some of these words, and the blue post about this tends to be the first result
---
classic wow, pvp, phases, battlegrounds, rank
---
* Hello. Maybe you can help explain the results I'm getting with the tool.
---
* For Druid healing touch, will all relevant talents Pre-AQ, It says to use Rank 10 until 393 +healing. And from that point on Rank 4. 
---
* However, from my understand Rank 4 is already as efficient as Rank 10 at 230 +healing. Why does this tool wait until another 163 + healing? It seems like the tool isn't really telling you which is most efficient.... but seems to be balancing efficiency with HPS.
---
a warning and a queue do nothing when it's better to play on the realm that everybody else is playing on instead of a realm that nobody else is playing on
---
go to a theme park and there's a like 10 miles long for the new roller coaster.  they recommend you go ride the ferris wheel instead.  nah we wait.
---
Imported it to the UK, incredible read. Absolutely essential for folks on this sub I would say and a great way to steadily build hype for the next few months (if you read just a little per night..)
---
Who the fuck cares what he did, chill out
---
Actually I was thinking about warrior too. They're definitely similiar to Frost DK playstyle in some ways. Hell 2H Frost was basically a different version of Arms warrior. I played warrior a lot during WoD for example because gladiator stance was so fun. I've always had warrior as my alt.
---
Also my DK has been actually almost always Orc (except for one time I changed to BE for racial, but now I'm back to Orc). It would be pretty cool to think about my Classic warrior as it would basically my DK pre-Wrath, until he was killed and resurrected by Arthas.
---
The only thing I'm concerned about it that I plan on doing PvP a lot and I'm not sure if I'll have my pocket healer as well as during levelling. 
---
Also altough I don't mind playing popular classes, it's pretty obvious there will be shitton of DPS warriors, but only few tanks. I mean I changed sometimes to Blood when another tank was really needed, or when our tank left. But I prefer playing DPS which I guess will be possible because Fury is S Tier for PvE and Arms is great for PvP, however I guess I'll need to get into the groups to get some gear for my DPS specs first. And of course it will be way, way easier to do as prot because so many warriors will refuse to switch.
---
Still, thank you for advice. I'll also consider rogue.

I miss blood dps as well, but I‚Äôm saving the DK nostalgia for wotlk servers. Try playing something you wouldn‚Äôt normally so you get to experience it all.

If you really don‚Äôt like other classes, Warrior is the closest viable choice.

If only you could get that insta-corr plus master summoner
---
And shamans have nothing to get out of sheep once it's landed on them. They also can't take it off of anybody else.
---
It's a lot easier to deal with a shaman and a friend, than a pally and a friend.
---
resto shaman is really not that good in pvp since you lack a defensive dispel. just go elemental and you are still a passable off healer but now also the burst machine.
---
resto is sadly just a raidspec.

All races on a faction are connected via teleports in the form of ship or flying blimps. They are located just outside each capital city and everyone new character start in their own starting zone, which is also right next to their capital city. So worst case scenario I get to lvl 5 before meeting your friend in game.
---
Alright, thank you for your time and patience, I'll try and dig a little deeper and see what I can find. Thanks again
---
You are the one that is getting worked up, lol.

If Ion sticks to his plan of 2 months for the first two phases, the maximum rank you can earn before BWL drops is rank 12. And we'll have cleared BWL 4 times before anyone reaches rank 14.
---
I think there is a distinction to be made, though. Blizzard is pretty adamant about one-action-one-reaction which was why they generally allow things like scripts that directly translate controllers into other forms of input, but things like Wowmapper probably started getting a little too smart how it handled things and what it did to facilitate user control and that's where the issues lie. Things like

If you‚Äôre focusing on PvP then I wouldn‚Äôt go deep Resto.  You will not have fun at all.  You can‚Äôt do any damage and you are the worst PvP healer of all the classes.

This spec will have you focusing on chain heal. It‚Äôs the bare bones healing spec that skips all the healing wave talents.
---
You could also go 0/30/21 for a melee/heal hybrid that goes for improved totems.

Oh wow, they took about the /sit exploit in the beta?
---
Yeah lock definitely fits the theme of DKs the most in vanilla, that's for sure. Also they're little bit similiar to unholy playstyle with dot management and they also have a pet. As I said I don't mind playing ranged class and lock was my first ever class, so who knows maybe I might go with it in the end.
---
No ret for me sadly tho, I forgot to mention I'm playing Horde. Ret in Wrath was one of my favourite specs to play and it was actually really close to DK playstyle, but sadly in Classic I won't be able to play one.

Paladins are annoying for everyone, immune shield resets and shit, trash

So, does it proc?

Screaming like that is never funny.
---
Even worse than druid?
---
I think most people are planning to have a warrior alt, that might become a tanking alt. Warriors are so gear dependent that having a 60 main to funnel gold and gear into the warrior smooths over the lvling process greatly.
---
interested, checked the site and submitted an app.
---
There is no way you can do murdaloc with lvl 30s. It would be impossible to pull him without getting 5+ lvl 38 trogg adds.
---
Dwarf rogue. You seem to like them more, and stoneform is great for PvP.
---
Humans are a dime a dozen for melee, since specialization is OP.
---
I'm coming back from a very long break myself. I'm not guilded but am always looking for cool people to play with.
---
Glad to hear it! We will look for it and get back to you :)
---
with that gear no worries stay and wait for him to come
---
I guess I'll just go arms but be sure to put 5 points into parry. Does defense rating not matter at low levels?
---
Youtuber Defcamp lvled a troll priest with Kaargoz as soon as the beta came out. Can confirm it works.
---
No actually, I shouldn't because you fundamentally do not understand the rules. Blizzard has said previously that it's only against the rules if it's targeted long term harassment. It's only against the rules if I target one specific person and continually try to fuck with them at every chance over the course of multiple days. Camping someone you run into in the world even for a few hours does not meet their definition of harassment. I get it though, you can't handle it, so do everyone a favour and roll on a PvE server instead of crying like a giant baby.

Why is rep so important in classic? I started with Bl and was a noob till Wotlk

Do you think a premade will take shamans?

Okay I looked up the Enhancement Shaman Therory articles on elitisjerks, way back from 2008. Apparently the 3 second ICD change was made in 2.0

(https://web.archive.org/web/20080811084026/http://elitistjerks.com/f47/t15809-shaman_windfury/) "hough no one is really sure how long it has existed, the 3.0 second cooldown that is associated with Windfury Weapon was brought to light around the 2.0 release" So it wasn't actaully in Vanilla.

How do premades work? Is there an MMR system like in rbgs? Do you have a higher chance to match another premade? or do you just steamroll pugs all day?
---
He's talking about MMOs before wow.
---
you'd best google a comparison but afaik gnomish has trinkets and goblin has bombs.
---
I believe lots of people will go gnomish to make the trinkets then switch to goblin
---
Bruh just get a small keyboard. Don't do this controller route with wow
---
Now that there's no more GoT HBO should make warcraft series. I don't trust Netflix because of all the crap they've been pumping out.
---
only elemental. resto might get a spot in an av group.
---
Does serpent sting scale with Atk power or spell damage?
---
I'm really excited for Classic, but if they made Wrath servers I wouldn't touch retail ever again. The only reason I still play it is my DK, altough as I said in my post BfA DK barely reminds DK I used to love. But being able to play Wrath DK again, there wouldn't be anything holding me there.
---
Actually I'm thinking about warrior too. As I said in the other comment, my DK has almost always been an Orc, so I would make Orc warrior in Classic thinking about it as it's my DK pre-Wrath. The bad thing is I'm not a big fan of tanking and DPS warrior will be extremely populated.
---
That shield is BiS for fire resistance so it sorta makes sense.
---
I am flip flopping between NE Bear tank or Human prot warri. I tend to play Bear but what makes me think is the grind for Consumables especially Pummelers. I have responsibilities IRL (Wifey and Kid need attention as well) therefore I decided to play tank (almost no waiting time to find a dungeon group). Warrior is not that grindy as a Druid, thats an advantage though I like the idea to play a Bear but I don‚Äòt want to gimp myself in endgame.
---
Bear pros:
---
- fast leveling
---
- Tanks are always in demand
---
- I personally prefer the specc more than prot warri
---
- Not as popular as prot warris in endgame
---
- very grindy in endgame (time consuming)
---
Prot warri pros:
---
- Very popular spec
---
- Not as grindy as bear
---
- Always in demand
---
- very slow leveling
---
- not the preferred specc
---
One thing that will help while leveling is getting your professions up. I'm confident that as a hunter I can hit 20 with several hours less play time than the guys at work. Which is why I'll be trying to level up my engineering while they catch up. Maybe we will all hit 60 around the same time while I have engineering, cooking, fishing, and mining maxed
---
I would rather just camp you.
---
Hmm that changes things. I know I want to heal but not sure what. I played a druid from launch till wotlk but only healed in wrath. I like priest but I dont want to be over crowded
---
By now I don't think there's any difference between horde and alliance players. Back in 04-07 there were a lot of stereo types. Look up the 'Hi I'm a horde and I'm an Alliance" parody videos.
---
I think the biggest stereo types we're going to have nowadays would be the idea of streamer followers.
---
Define world pvp

That was wonderful.  I missed that piece of historical content.  Thank you for sharing.

Hey, as i see that you were a sham class lead. Whats your opinion on enha pve? If you know anything
---
Basically any PvP that isn't a Battleground or a Duel.
---
Hahaha but *you should be banned*
---
Good luck with that baby, unlike you I'm not so garbage as to let myself get camped. It's really not that hard to avoid it.
---
Meaning, you will just log off like a lil bitch after I kill you, lol.
---
Dude's been rolling for 12 years... The fuck yall expect?!
---
Ok, so I look forward to you getting a chance to try classic rogues out bud. Locks have better peel and surviavility than most, skull is cute try it and see what the problem is. Also all BGs are apparently warsong?
---
I remember when my video card during Vanilla never rendered grass, I never actually saw that WoW had them in-game until seeing it on some rigs at a LAN Center that long went the way of the dodo.
---
Flipping between warrior/mage/priest every day
---
Fun fact : in the lore the forsaken after capturing the capital tried to join the alliance, they where rejected because all undead where considered monsters that needed to be destroyed.
---
No not at all. Stamina is what you want, of the bear gear is solid. It's all about using cc and pulling correctly in dungeons.
---
I mean, that's a pretty big stretch. The quote even says they don't know how long it existed.
---
We didn't know for sure that Hunter ranged attacks were on a two-roll system until we got that mob with the 60% miss debuff in TBC either, but it was pretty much understood.
---
There are quite a few references to an ICD cooldown long before the TBC pre-patch.
---
I like how r/classicwow just reinvented legion here lul
---
No you moron, it's called using the environment to res in a way where it's not immediately apparent where you are at which point you run away and don't get killed. But I guess if you're crying like a baby about being ganked you wouldn't understand that.
---
IF you really want that Troll raptor mount then I suggest taking a page from the discussions of alliance humans trying to get those nightsaber mounts.
---
So in short, Rep rewards for quests get continually smaller as your level increases against the quest level. So As an Undead you'll want to IMMEDIATELY head over to the valley of trials and do every quest that rewards troll rep in the game at its required level, and even then you'll only get to like 1/2 way through revered and need to farm rune cloth turn-ins the rest of the way.
---
You can spec into disc and do AoE farming.
---
I played some Alliance content 1-30 recently. Better cities, better zones and quests for sure.
---
I think their races are super bland compared to the Horde. I'm a bit torn on what faction to play.
---
I am not sure how this tool recommends ranks, but efficiency isn't the only factor.  If it was, then we would all just spam rank 1 all day.  If your HPS isn't adequate, then the tank will die or the other healers will have to cover for you.
---
Quite decently.
---
Powerful burst, survivability. But they get locked down and go oom quite often and then it's over. Also gearing is a little bit wonky, since PvP pieces are mostly enh gear, plus casters in raids won't hand you over their loot.
---
Probably because we see posts like this all the time that way overexagerate the negatives of playing on PvP servers, making them out to be some wasteland where you spend 90% of you time corpse running due to death skulled players of the other faction constantly camping you.
---
If only the hobbits had Ennor Auto Pilot.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs a bit more difficult to use unlike fear ward.
---
Shaders are commonly banned by anti cheat systems, that's all there's to it.
---
Of the group 3 will make it to 60, 1 will realize what all the need for atunement and raid mats and not log on again.  2 will raid with you for awhile in MC/Bwl/Ony then stop after a few pieces of gear.  You will raid alone with strangers you mostly tolerate and a few you loathe.  If you are lucky you make friends with a few in your guild/class and those will be who you farm dungeons with between raids.  Alts will be what you play with your other friends who's characters are scattered from level 6 to 43.  You might also use your main to run them thru stockades or scarlet monastery for a little xp and much needed gear.  Best of luck man.
---
Guys guys.. chill with your priests etc hes clearly describing an orc warlock.
---
Cant get killed, check.
---
Perfect for wpvp, bgs and 5mans, check.
---
Heals the grp (healthstones) and resses (soulstone), check.
---
As long as you admit that you would die.  Must be sad to be so shit at the game that you have to fight lowbies.
---
To Thottbot of course
---
yeah its not worth using if you haven't practiced the jump but worth learning beforehand for advanced gamers.
---
This is what barrens chat is for isn't it? 
---
\*cough\* Mankirk's wife \*cough\*
---
Yeah i have one close friend who was in a top 100 guild in wrath and i know hes down for the classic grind. Weve been talking plans consumes leveling routes etc. All the others have been sorta silent. So yeah this is probably gonna be what it is.
---
&gt; Just happens to have a macro set up to fake yellow roll text a specific number?
---
Healing grace is garbage.
---
And layer doesnt equal server so if each layer had 3.5k and a server had atleast 3 layers bg queues would be Max 5 min without crossrealm bgs. Dont you enjoy recognizing names from your server in bgs or fighting that other factions top premade etc?
---
You're thinking original AV. In 1.12 and towards the end of vanillia in general AV was a race to the end boss that took 10-15 minutes.
---
Having two copies of the same spell available is the best course of action from my experience. Max rank, and your downranked copy. Expect large damage? Wind up your max rank and cancel if necessary. Expecting average damage? Downrank. Knowing how and when to use which rank is a huge part of the skill ceiling for healers in classic. There is no one size fits all unless you're a holy paladin spamming flash honestly.
---
Contact another guilds enchanter, scratch each others backs.
---
Drop the points out of intensity it's shit. At no point will you want to be using those 3 spells while someone is beating on you.
---
Well depends on the rep, the water lords for example summon ragnoros the last boss in MC, thorium brotherhood give access to fire resist gear etc etc
---
i mean you can still heal in elemental spec, its almost on par with deep resto in a pvp setting and even for pve its not that bad. some guilds even let some shaman raid in elemental spec.
---
but yeah, if you only want to be healing in pvp then you should probably go priest. its not over crowded btw, there will be more shaman than priest.
---
It‚Äôs winter for me :)
---
Heal dungeons for groups or go heal in battlegrounds to get your pvp rank up for some of the pvp rewards that will come along in later phases, hell you might even find some people that will pay you heal dungeons runs or be their pocket healer in battlegrounds.
---
Orc Warlock too indeed both choice are really good even if i prefer UD
---
With how shadow priests get their powers it doesnt make sense for them to be undead. Void and undeath mix like Light and undeath, or Druidism and undeath.
---
Spell damage (Nature)
---
„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã„Öã
---
Lack of death knights will increase the available edgelord names but rogues will still be fighting over them
---
No I'm not, it still took a while even at the tail end of vanilla.  It wasn't the multi-day affair that it was when it came out but it was not as fast as it is now back then.
---
Any tips on PvPing with Priest?  I'm level 39 right now, just looking to improve my survivability and usefulness in pvp skirmishes and learn what my rotation should be and what I should be doing in general.  Thanks!
---
Ahh yes the old argument "YOU GANK LOWBIES SO YOU MUST SUCK AT THE GAME" you're really showing off that 50 iq mate.
---
"This has nothing to do with my QUESTION however...."
---
lmao
---
Ia 21 30 0 enh spec better than a 0 31 20 one in pve?
---
1st to queue. The only exception to this is if say, Horde queues a premade of 10 for WSG and theres only 3 random Alliance in queue, followed by a full 10 man premade, then the premades would square off and the 3 would have to wait. So premades are likely to queue into eachother if there arent a lot of people queueing and less likely if theres a lot.
---
Still ends poorly for the rogue
---
Honestly it comes down to gear, and the class you're against. And your spec. If you can literally two shot them why wouldn't you. If you're hemo you're going to be cheap shotting and getting control of the duel.
---
Do you like pumping into clothies, or melee? 
---
If you love the idea of making a cloth wearers day the worst - then hunter. 
---
If you love playing with melee like ants - then mage. 
---
Although, hunters are a much harder counter to rogues than mages are.
---
Control is probably the most important factor. 
---
Hunters have some powerful control - is debate vipers sting to be one of the best control spells in the game. 
---
Since it either forces to caster to deal with you - or run away from you. 
---
But nothing will beat a deranked frostbolt and polymorph. 
---
If you expect to world PvP - hunter is very good when initiating the fight - but is poor at being opened on. 
---
A good hunter can create some distance to enable him to use his ranged abilities - but for most average players - you are nearly dead by that time. 
---
Mages are the masters of dealing with unfavourable situations. 
---
You have a plethora of abilities that enable you to create distance - and your cold snap is probably the most Broken ability in the game in a 1v1 or 1vX situation. 
---
A mage using shatter &gt; frost nova &gt; CoC &gt; arcane explosion spam &gt; cold snap &gt; frost nova &gt; CoC &gt; arcane explosion spam; will literally end 20 players at once. (Excluding warlocks)
---
Multi shot is powerful - but control isn‚Äôt built into the ability - such as in many of the mages spells. 
---
Both have insane skill ceilings - I‚Äôd debate hunter is much higher due to the nature of their abilities being very obvious to read (trapping) so learning to disguise your work is a work of art.
---
I agree, I always though that it was super awesome. If I had time to play a warriors I would, I got two kids an a job so hunter it is for me.
---
The "new" quel'serrar is actually pretty neat imo, you get the book from the Icecrown citadel dungeons and it takes you on a really long and epic quest. I know alot of people dislike readded stuff but I dont mind it, its Nice to relive old memories from back in the day, even though I never got that sword back in the day.
---
Random. Normally the point of premades is to steamroll pugs all day as efficiently as possible for max honor. Often premades either queue dodge or stop queuing for the day if they keep matching other premades.

I have actually never heard that.  It's interesting that you have heard it so much.   Maybe it's because you suck?   lol

I played on Skywall (PvE) for a little bit, and Turalyon (PvE) for a longer bit.  Skywall was just empty, so I'm not surprised by the lack of PvP, and Turalyon was (maybe still is?) full of little bitches who rarely wanted to PvP, even finding people for arena was a pain in the dick, the only PvP you could find a group for relatively easily was premade BGs with a bunch of other raiding nerds who just wanted to pubstomp and weren't interested in a challenge (I'm talking people would /afk if they came against another premade).
---
Before/during that time, I was playing on Azgalor (PvP) and Smolderthorn (PvP), then in BC I had an some Alliance alts on Detheroc (PvP) with the RL friends, and since Wrath all my Horde characters have been on Scilla (PvP).

Doesn't matter if it scales.  The point was that you could spam it forever, because your regen is higher than the cost of the spell.

Yeah, but I'm not seeing blue posts on how long Phase 2 lasts, or if those are available. A lot of people are asserting it, but SEARCHING for that information hasn't provided me any hits, which is why I'm asking on reddit.
---
I wanna know where people are getting this info!
---
It‚Äôs part of the rite of passage of getting a war to level cap.
---
Ele shamans are above average, but not great, in world pvp. You are fairly tanky, but you don‚Äôt have many ways to avoid damage. Your biggest weakness is your dependency on casting. If your opponents let you get off a cast, you can really erase someone, but good players won‚Äôt give you that opportunity. You can use LIPS and FAPS to make this easier.
---
You didn't ask how long the phases last, you asked if the items were fully available from phase 2. I didn't claim I knew either, you'll find I said the exact opposite I said we both don't know.
---
I was trying to decide between Paladin and hunter for about a month. Now I'm stuck between mage and warlock.
---
I've been playing dk and warlock since forever so I'm in the same boat as you. I'd love to play the good old Death Knight again, so I feel like a tanky Warlock is the closest to it. Soul link and dot away, maybe add in some melee hits to really get the DK feel...
---
i'm mean i'm playing bfa waiting for classic, and i would be playing ESO instead, but those guys just fucked their entire game by releasing a buggy expac that broke performance and heavily nerfed the base game classes while redirecting all the good stuff that was taken to the new DLC class to incentivize more people to buy the DLC
---
as a lock that doesn't look for trouble but will fight and end you if you dare, I can't wait....

I played on a private server as a male nelf druid in a group that consisted of a female nelf priest, male nelf hunter, and female nelf warrior. That combination gives me a lore boner
---
Gratitude! I didn't even know that interview existed. I was looking through blue posts, and google.
---
10 hours a day don't even get you to r13.
---
Good, they should suck at one thing at least in vanilla.  They are literally the top PVE dps and tanks, and wrecking machines in pvp with proper support.  I have no sympathy that they are bad levelers.
---
I played vanilla in 2006. I have also ranked to 13 with 2 classes on private servers between 2016-2018. I don't need to try something I have used a million times, it's simple game mechanics you don't seem to have any answers for.
---
I don't see why you are bringing up BGs to begin with if we are arguing about 1v1 rogue vs warlock. BGs are group play 10vs10 or 15vs15 has nothing to do with 1v1. Even in AB, lock goes with team and rogue stays stealthed at flag.

True Alliance is literally even worse than Horde i would never trade horde for few city musics and start zones even if i prefere durotar than Elwynn forest
---
Cool, thanks
---
Meme spec used on farm boss apparently translates to viable build for anyone.
---
Hard same. It's all iron fencing and "plague"
---
I'm guessing your playing on a private server? Because if that's your reference I'd agree with you. On the Classic beta warrior actually feels pretty good. Not 'strong' like hunter/warlock/mage/druid, but definitely 'ok' and similar to the other classes.
---
As a warrior, should I take herbalism or mining along with skinning while leveling? Thanks!
---
I installed Ubuntu on my very old Chromebook. It uses the LXDE interface (I think that's the name of it). Took a lot of steps to get running, but it works great now. I can have several things open at once on it without any big problems. I might have to try and install classic just to see.
---
I must be missing something, I see nothing on the artist's page that would offend anyone. Worst thing I see is a WoW character in a bathing suit? Maybe something was removed from his page before I got there.

Imagine trying a class briefly at a non max level and thinking that it‚Äôs the classes fault for being bad lol

Most rep isnt important in classic, but some of them are used for opening up raids and some seen as a way for more casual players to get epics or good items. You can get some decent epics from CC and AD at exalted (with some additional materials) without raiding (or for CC, without a 20+ raid at least). AV 1.12 is a notable (I would say notorious) example of a very easy way to get good epics from rep.
---
As for instances, Hydraxian rep is very important for summoning Domo/Rag in MC and if you want to clear MC super fast, youre going to need to farm the rep to do it. Brood of Nozdormu rep is probably the most famous because its required for the AQ opening quest. Naxx requires AD rep, but only honored (which is very easy to get), but gets cheaper at Revered and Exalted.
---
Wouldn't be have a bigger room if he had too much money?
---
Rogue suffers just as much in PvP as warrior. 
---
The difference is that you choose your fight as a rogue - warriors have to deal with every fight. 
---
Warriors are going to get into premades far easier. 
---
A warrior who is geared can likely beat a rogue when it comes to average players. 
---
But once you scale higher - it becomes increasingly apparent that rogues can counter you much harder. 
---
However, the way they counter you is very slow and won‚Äôt work well in high traffic Areas. 
---
You‚Äôre a warrior - branch out of your duo - you can make friends pretty easy - you are a social class.
---
Any healer would love to PvP with a warrior.
---
Still remember seeing Horde with &lt;KIA&gt; and preparing to make a hasty escape
---
Warrior leveling is on par with paladin or a rogue if done correctly.
---
If not, then it's the path of suffering and anguish.
---
Warlock vs Shadow priest. Played lock in Vanilla so I know it. Want to pvp with shadow since I played in Vanilla but got really good at lock pvp towards the end of vanilla so not sure. New vs something familiar. Plus shadow sucking in raids respecing to heal vs respecing because I like to pvp destro affliction and demo... also Rogue...
---
At level 60, can you still tank dungeons as Arms, or do you need to go Prot?
---
Does "ultimate" mean ultimate, given 0 competition, so absolutely not an ultimate guide for when Classic launches?
---
Because there's nothing ultimate about a route that involves "Do quest A that 800 other people are doing"
---
This math made zero sense, as we don't know how long phase 2 is going to last.
---
Actually I don't think the air transport was added until cata or wotlk
---
I honestly do not understand where this stigma comes from? That warriors are super hard to level.
---
I made on (pserver) mind you and got it to like 25 and it really wasn‚Äôt that much worse than anything else. From what I understand it gets better the higher you get as well.
---
Well the Forsaken were/are trying to create a plague to destroy the living races.
---
Adults play games less in summer.
---
Lol this is ridiculous.  Have someone else do it for you, just provide mats. It's an MMO vs, you won't be the only enchanter on your server lol.
---
That's why I'm saving warrior for an alt and level after a few months of release
---
You need to remember though that 1-6 zones aren‚Äôt filled with many choices, they generally are just complete A then B then C. I believe 6-12 has a lot more flexibility and will be interested to see what he has to offer there. Other than that good video!
---
Not changed. Won't will. Azeroth needs tanks.
---
Horde! Troll hunter!
---
Nah, Guild Banks.
---
The alliance didn't discover that until WotLK
---
Yes! I'm going insane trying to decide between warrior and shaman.
---
Neat. How many more people are going to post screenshots of their boxes
---
Your landscape and architecture stuff is amazing, are you planning on doing anymore like this in the future? 
---
I feel like you could do some amazing work on some of the Witcher 3 locations.
---
I stand corrected. I thought that legacyplayers website was to hold onto players stats and gear from back in the day. The post it was linked in mentions it's on a private server though, so no excuse there.
---
Then I'm even more confused by this post. Wouldn't you want to disprove rets effectiveness by showing it is bad at the one thing it's supposed to be viable for instead of something everyone agrees it's terrible at (pure dps)? I guess I shouldn't read into it too much, when the only info we got was something like "it's for a full clear." 
---
It's irksome to see dismissive comments about not checking the logs for us when we don't have access to logs (like I said it's just a pic) and "min/maxers" to COMPLETELY dismiss the effectiveness of Nightfall on a ret pally. (Which seems completely contrary to actually being a min/maxer).
---
Warlock or Rogue? Will roll alliance, which race and why?
---
Also, it'll take less time to grind a faction epic mount than rank 11. I had to no-life for a full summer to get it.
---
Its obvious even in Vanilla.
---
There are quests in Hillsbrad where you research and poison Alliance farmers. And if Alliance has any spies, they will notice the giant plague research center in Undercity.
---
I see it more in the way that it isn't time lost, it's time spent engaging in an equally important activity to whatever you set out to do. Of course it would be frustrating to only have 2 hours to raid as opposed to 3, but instead of thinking of that hour wasted you can accept it and have fun with it
---
yep this
---
i dont want changes though but there is fuck all storage in vanilla
---
You are assuming you won't recognize names with battlegroups in and also, layers will go away after phase 1 prior to BG's being available anyway.
---
With twinks, new actual communities sprung up because you were able to actually play the game and you saw the same players every time anyway.
---
In BG's if you played late at night well past your server's prime time, again, you saw the same names every time.  Arenas are what fucked everything up and ruined community aspects of pvp, not server battle groups.
---
When it comes to old content yes. It's not new content or something that needs testing. They did the testing in the original game.
---
Well "faction" epic mount is a different distinction and how much you have to no life also is. The difference between rank 1 and 10 is similar to the difference between rank 11 and 14.
---
It will definitely take more time to hit rank 11 than it will to hand in a bunch of cloth even on a low pop server, however, rank 11 technically grants you all reps at once and it may well be that you're going beyond  rank 11 for more than a mount as a reason. So ultimately it's highly variable.
---
&gt; You need to remember though that 1-6 zones aren‚Äôt filled with many choices, they generally are just complete A then B then C.
---
Cool. How about you skip A, B and C then?
---
Have you heard of classic plus?
---
No one would have even dreamed of allowing it in Vanilla.   Now, you MIGHT be able to find a guild that will take you.  
---
From the napkin math that I have done, if you are twisting improved GOA and improved WF, and have nightfall, then you are probably sitting around 90% of the damage of a rogue.   However, that's assuming that the offtank isn't using nightfall.  If there is,then he is probably likely something like 75% of the rogues dps.
---
If you are min/maxing, then this isn't ideal.   But some guilds don't require absolute min/max, so this might fly in some.  
---
My personal experience though is that this sort of thing causes Drama.   The raid wipes, and people look at the healer playing dps at the bottom of the charts.   They don't think to add in all the extra damage he is contributing.   Then you have the other healers that have to heal, while you get to have fun playing dps.  Not that enhance is even fun imo.   You literally auto-atk and drop 2 totems every 10 seconds.
---
-----------------------------------------------------------
---
I have been thinking about whether a spec like this might work though, 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/-500520210502-52030051005314
---
The idea would be to put this shaman into the Main tank's group for the improved totems.  Then he would just heal as normal.  His healing output would be less, but the the tanks threat should be slightly higher.  The question is whether this is worthwhile trade off.   
---
Another good strat on the horde is to let someone with assist move shamans around in the raid.  You can shuffle around all 6 shaman from the melee groups to the groups with the healers or mages.
---
My decision relies on whether my old guild is coming back. If they do, then I'll play a Shaman. Otherwise, I'll play an Alliance tank.
---
Warrior only starts feeling fun after you get berserker stance imo. If you can slog through the initial grind the payoff is great
---
I had 6 lv 60 rogues in vanilla wow and didnt play any other class untill wrath. Time to go warrior tank
---
yeah warlock mount is a spell too. takes an eternity to mount with curse of tongues.
---
On one hand I'm all for the convenience of it but on the other I find how janky it was kinda charming.
---
Awesome one. Really nailed it
---
Only those with the neckiest of beards.
---
Yes and no. They (all BG in general) don‚Äôt come until several months in.
---
What do DPS do by that token? What if you're a fury warrior or rogue? What do you do?
---
Thank you so much for this, and the accompanying video! I main hunter in retail and had no idea threat and pet passive etc was such a big deal for classic. You've saved many wipes, friend! 
---
Also keep it up, the production quality is fantastic and your tone is friendly. Your info is super helpful and easy to understand. May you be blessed with subs!
---
yeah if every aspect of the game is not a huge pain in the balls then what even is the point ;p
---
Glad I could help! Thank you!
---
Where is there any dialogue in the comic?
---
The way I see it: a hunter observes a warrior combining the 2 ZF swords to make Sul'Thraze.
---
The hunter wants to do the same with 2 bows, but it doesn't work out for him.
---
Hey wana see the female panda concept art for WoW

---
True, but servers tend to get more weighted towards one faction or the other over a period of time. Right off the bat it‚Äôs statistically unlikely that you‚Äôd have any noticeable imbalance
---
As an up and coming Warrior, I agree. We're optimal tanks and PVE DPS, we're really good in PVP and I think if our leveling experience was top notch as well that'd be kinda bonkers
---
You must be in school or something to think that. The majority of the population born into the genre that screamed for its resurgence have fulltime jobs now. I'm enjoying the summer with friends and the wife and am diving into wow at the end of August, couldn't be better timing for the average working adult.
---
&gt;As i've learned more about how healing in Vanilla compares to the other expansions, the chance to be #1 healer seems way less alluring.
---
I am curious, what is it?
---
Personally I find hpally more engaging than a priest. Aura management, Holy Light sniping, judgements, smart blessing use (freedom on tanks, BoP on warlocks), ability to Nightfall/Annihilator when required, efficient dispels, some holy specs even allow you to tank 5mans and reckbomb in PvP. 
---
The only part of a comparable  "gameplay extension" besides straightforward healing on a priest I see is being a holy weaver spec player.
---
It's in the engine, if it gets you banned that's fucked up. It's like getting banned for setting you graphics to the max settings. Or using an addon. If they wanted to restrict it, they would.
---
You should try Guild Wars 2
---
You being born as yourself is around 1 in 10 to the 2,640,000th power, and yet you find it hard to believe someone called out a 1 in 100 roll.  
---
My dude, please.
---
Have done both and I've gotta say sure the alliance get some nice cities and a few long overarching quest lines but the whole thing feels bland.
---
As far as alliance levelling paths you've got "let's larp in Scotland", "oh boy which generic fantasy story book should I read today?" and "these forests are pretty empty hey".
---
In just the first week of playing horde you'll climb mountains, explore lush jungles, creep through blasted alien canyons, trudge through dusty untamed plains. You can even go check out some of that cool ne forest action super early on without farting around travelling awkward for hours. And hey if you're a more boring person just outside town is a charter flight to generic fantasy edge lord forest levelling paths.
---
The alliance has this dying feeling to it. "oh yes we'd love to help but our military might is elsewhere I suppose it's simple enough that even you could handle it" the horde are like adhd kids on cocaine by comparison "holy shit dude thank God you're here we are so fucked and unless you get these motherfucking apples to this here village people are going to fucking die!"
---
Alliance races are lame, would you like to be a human, a short human, an irritating human, or a purple human?
---
Horde on the other hand we've got rotting humans, green roid ragers, spiky punk/Africa/mesoamerica mashups with tusks!, and chilled out cow campers. You can find something for everyone there and the world feels alive with diversity.
---
It's not even a choice
---
you don't have the mana for both healing and totem twisting. you're spec obviously lacks the talent for cheaper totems too which is essential for twisting.
---
I would like it to be the bigger ignore limit so I can ignore people asking for things like this
---
Was going rogue like i was in the day but now ill go hunter nelf.
---
To fuck with alllll the ud rogues.
---
YES!!!
---
I‚Äôve always been an altaholic though.  Druid was the first class I got to 60.  It was because I could change my play style after so many levels if I got tired of the monotony.
---
Druid is definitely going to be my first hoof to the floor in Classic.  But I‚Äôm also very interested in an undead warlock, troll Shaman, dwarf Paladin, orc hunter, orc warrior, undead priest, undead mage and an undead rogue.  Specifically in that order.
---
You wouldn't totem twist in that build.
---
&gt;Do I need to roll a Tauren as well?
---
No, all Horde races can play together.
---
&gt;Can I be another Horde race?
---
Yes, you'll just need to take a small trip to their starter zone, or they'll need to do the same to yours. Or you play your starter zone to 10 and meet in the Barrens, but that kinda blows as the first 10 levels do take a bit of time still.
---
&gt;What class?
---
A question as old as time. What do *you* enjoy? All classes fill different purposes and have different skillsets, so I recommend having a look at the plethora of decisionhelping videos, written guides, questionnaires and other ressources out there. Not being an elitist prick, it's just that other people have done a fantastic job of helping people out on what to pick.
---
[This is](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t-OsvFBiXE) one of my favorite Playlists regarding class help. It's *really* in-depth, if you prefer something shorter, [try this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U0OMrgWBNK4)
---
Lol and classic was designed to be the casual mmo
---
I got rejected for a Deadmines group for being a Night Elf Priest once :\ they told me I had to learn my lesson for not being a Dwarf
---
Do any mobs in Deadmines even fear?
---
I mean, you try to join the Alliance but find out literally every one else in the world thinks you're monsters and wants you dead. Would drive any race crazy, I think.
---
well then whats even the point?
---
on beta, groups of 5 30's were able to complete SM Cathedral.. this should be comparably much easier right?
---
What a ridiculous comparison.
---
And yet we have expensive technology that allows us to pick our gender, eye color, detect diseases and disorders, etc.
---
So it's not so difficult to believe that someone made a free macro to get some internet fame that directly translates to more revenue for him.
---
Or, you know, a sunset.
---
Quest item that drops from mob drops for the entire party instead of 1 at a 1 time. So much time will be wasted on this quests during launch.
---
I kinda like having the statistics from the achievement page. I love being able to see all my kills, deaths, how much gold I've gotten from different sources, what mob has killed me the most, how many auctions I've won or posted etc. It's neat and wouldn't change anything about the game.
---
&gt;  I remember using one with a red low-res icon, not the name though.
---
Irfan view?
---
Only during leveling. Once you hit endgame, it's 2 tanks per 40-man raid.
---
At least it doesn't have 20 filters on this time :P
---
I mean, ive been in guilds that have done the grind on both retail and pservers and what it boils down to most for the rep is the person with the quest, because usually that guy is no lifing super hard for it. Yes, theres other people helping them out for it, but the impetus is always on them and making me feel guilty that hes out there no lifing bugs endlessly. 
---
On old servers in retail, most of the guilds got the quest chain finished well before the war effort, but due to unknowns, most guilds just didnt reach for it, because they knew the top guild would get it first and didnt know if they could get it in time and didnt want to waste hours grinding for nothing. 
---
The world bosses are easy with the exception of the Moonglade event and any casual guild is going to be willing to spare a bit of time to help with the easy bosses and its usually very easy to broker deals with other guilds to help with the Moonglade event.
---
Another thing to be said about casual guilds, is they usually have big numbers, so you can probably convince many bad people to do a decent amount of farming, rather than few good people doing a lot of farming
---
I had decided on a NE hunter, plans changed when I reconnected with old mates who tell me they are playing horde... And 1 of them was a hunter through vanilla. So for some variety I'm switching up to a warrior.
---
&gt; And yet we have expensive technology that allows us to pick our gender, eye color, detect diseases and disorders, etc.
---
Lol what does this have anything to do at all with what I said?
---
&gt; So it's not so difficult to believe that someone made a free macro to get some internet fame that directly translates to more revenue for him.
---
Pshero has been a successful wow streamer for a LONG time now, and you actually believe he would create something to make it look like he rolled a 16?  Btw just so you know it wouldn‚Äôt be a macro that would do this bud.  You literally see him type out /roll... I don‚Äôt think you understand how macros work.  
---
Ngl my dude, you‚Äôre sounding fuckin batshit
---
I know what both of my characters will be. Don‚Äôt know who I will level up first.
---
Troll Shaman with Tailoring/Enchanting 
---
&amp;
---
Orc Rogue with Mining/Blacksmithing
---
Really gonna be a case of what I‚Äôm feeling when the day comes.
---
The cat atleast is pretty huge in the beta if that hasn‚Äôt been changed\^^
---
Unless you plan on keeping Herbalism at 60, go Mining.
---
&gt; They really should have just started with Artha's story. It's really the only coherently told epic in the game at least.
---
Not necessarily. The writing was just too cheesy to make it a 8+/10 movie. What they should have done instead is to orientate themselves on the original story (that includes Arthas obviously at some point).
---
Improved totems to increase the tanks threat.  Like I said, it's probably a minor increase, and not even worth it.
---
not sure if it's the same in live or the paths are different on pservers or what im thinking of, but pretty sure that there's a spot right outside caverns of time that overlaps the chicken and the turtle escort quests.  good ganking.
---
¬´really good in PvP¬ª, more like situationally good.
---
Not many more hopeless classes to play when caught off-guard or just 1v1 usually.
---
That was my thought
---
Yeah.
---
2 PVP, 2 PVE, &amp; 1 RP for EU
---
1 PVP &amp; 1 PVE for Russia
---
1 PVP, 1 PVE, &amp; 1 RP for US West
---
1 PVP, 1 PVE, &amp; 1 RP for US East
---
Nothing for Latin America, Brazil, or Oceania.
---
Dunno about Asia.
---
Yeah sure, but it's not WoW. Black Desert Online is very beautiful too, lots of details. But it's not WoW. It's a also an asian grinder.
---
thanks, I'll give it a try.
---
And orcs were the original warlocks
---
it was compared to the other games at the time
---
there is a good video with the developer talking about it
---
games are just super casual now so wow seems hardcore
---
You might as well tank the dungeons. The only difference from actually DPSing is that you‚Äôre in defensive stance and pressing sunder instead of literally auto attacking and maybe using rend or heroic strike.
---
Later on when you have whirlwind and mortal strike you might actually press DPS spells but ... you still might as well tank unless you like waiting for aeons for a dungeon group cause you‚Äôre probably last pick for a DPS spot given that you bring nothing unique to the group. Except for pulling aggro and requiring heals.
---
A warrior that doesn‚Äôt tank is like a mage that doesn‚Äôt  polymorph. People be like ‚Äúwut?‚Äù.
---
yeah, if you want threat increase for the tankgroup you need totem twisting.
---
I don't want to raid much as a warrior, but I want a low level toon so I can tank dungeons, no pressure on leveling fast or anything.
---
True. I love the scale of the GW2 city. It blew me away when I first played.
---
Everything would be better if more people were like you! : )
---
I mean, lets assume AI takes a few steps forward and it can create personas, so to take a shitton of work off of developers. That way it would be possible to create realistic and populated villages and towns.
---
Well well well. What do we have here? Is nkid&amp;#50;99 a human? Nope. It's just a bot.    
---
There's a difference between uplifting words and literal spam. Yours being the latter.

I want to make a Druid for similar reason. Can do all 5-man contents. Don't really expect to do much endgame content with.
---
If you mean the macros, no of course not, And Reshade won¬¥t get you banned either,as it¬¥s not against the ToS.  I¬¥ve been using it for years in retail.
---
There was an addon for pservers that took archived WoWHead comments and integrated them into the quest log. Insanely useful, I really hope someone makes that for Classic. It was called LiteHeaded I think
---
warlocks have little in the way of escaping a fight if they get ganked(or even initiate one and have second thoughts). at best they can fear and try to run away. they dont have a blink or charge or massive speed boost or stealth or anything like that like a lot of classes do. as a warlock in PVP you're more or less gonna kill the people(s) or die 90% of the time.
---
totaly worth the read, best sumup.
---
Orc smash!
---
Was referring to Diplomacy more than anything else. Diplomacy is uber powerful especially in vanilla. Cuts out so much time farming rep it's crazy once you do the math, especially for late game factions like Hydraxis Waterlords and the Thorium Brotherhood.
---
Humans get gear in vanilla 10% faster than anyone else, basically, which is incredibly powerful.
---
