1v1 rogue. BGs mage. PvE dwarf priest.
---
---
---
i’m pouting out this is shitty content irrelevant to this sub. i’m not making a post i’m leaving a comment. totally different.
---
Bgs do not have a negative impact on wpvp. It happens regardless of whether they are in or not!
---
Rank is based of what others gain aswell, so rank 1-14 with no battlegrounds, won't be that much different time wise rank 1-14 with battle grounds.
---

---
Only reason it takes so much honour is because lots of others are earning honour.
---
cool. it’s called a period. I comment from my phone without enforced autocorrect capitalization.
---
Lmao 😹😹😸
---
The title wasn't even added until TBC
---
The vast majority of players are not going to be making decisions based on optimizing honor/hour.
---
no one goes there to gank when they’re ranking because players in that zone don’t give honour.
---
cool
---
Are they going to create different servers for every single change people ask for just because they don't like the game like it was?
---
How about a server with no debuff limit? How about a server with class balancing? How about a server with group finders?
---
No. #nochanges means no changes. Give us the game just like it was and do not make any changes to it. It's not a difficult concept to grasp.
---
Vanilla means vanilla

RIP keith =(

Just as an idea of their strengths, organized wsg bring 2 priest and 1 sham as healers. As someone who is going shaman I would still recommend priest. They are stronger healers, can win 1v1 duels as a healer, can both offensive and defensive dispell (shaman cant save anyone from traps and sheeps), have insta cast heals via renew and shields, fear and mind control. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Dont get me wrong shamans bring some great things to the table, but imo priests have them beat. WF totem isnt nearly as strong in pvp as it is in pve. People totem stomp all the time, or out range it. And putting yourself in a poor position to get wf on your warriors just isn't worth it. Cleansing poisons and diseases aren't as important as cleansing magic. I guess shamans only leg up is they provide some nice extra burst priest cannot.
---
Im personally going sham because I just love the aesthetic and playstyle of it. And im really interested in the offspecs. But if those things didn't matter I would play priest.
---
Man, those max lvl gankers in lowbie zones are the main reason Im considering rolling on a non-PvP realm. Will save me a lot of headaches.
---
But will also be a lot less fun... tough choices ahead:(

WoW as a religion feels like a tough sell unless you're specifically looking at how intensely people are anticipating the release.  Where are you drawing the line when it crosses from hobby to belief system?
---
If I dont see the Ivory Raptor or Teal Kodo in game I'm going to do a fat spit take of Mountain Dew Code Red all over my monitor, then reroll on a private server.
---
Something gauging the opinion of WoW tokens would be nice to appear on the census. I think most of us are vehemently opposed to any form of token, but i havent seen that many posts for or against them that were heavily viewed/potentially viewed by blizz.
---
Ain’t nobody got time for that
---
Just regular jokes eh? What a bummer
---
Came to say this. Anal spam more popular in /1 General chat, or /4 World.
---
What class are you taking?
---
Oh hell yeah that's me
---
Hoping I’m able to find a day time raiding guild on a US server, but may have to roll on an EU server as the only time I can raid is during EU prime times.
---
I feel like vanilla is more casual friendly than retail in some aspects. 
---
There's really no stress about progression, what you do this week won't be completely invalid in 3 months when the new patch arrives.
---
There's always something to aim towards. A lot of varying things to do as well, compared to the streamlined linear progression of retail. No real daily obligations or chores (ap grind, world quests). You can check off your bis/set list (whatever your goal is) at your own pace and there will always be people to group up without because you need to start at the same starting point with there being little to no catch-up. AQ and ZG will be released but people still have incentives to run ubrs.
---
I thought it was because now we know where Mankrik's Wife is.
---
Honestly, this is THE one issue that makes or breaks classic. How they handle post naxx content will literally shape the game, if they don’t hit it right it will basically kill the servers.
---
Rogues, as evis doesn't scale with gear, so you could use a white wep and still kill people with cold blood prep build.
---
Thanks for the reply man. Some questions:  
---
Is power infusion mandatory from phase 1? 15 sec and 3 min cooldown seens a lot of downtime. At least comparing with Spiritual Guidance Spiritual Healing. Not sure how much 25% of spirit is at endgame tho.  
---
Wouldn't Spell warding be a better talent than divine fury? Looking at pvp positioning i'll prob be aimed by casters.
---
You've played 15 years ago, believe it or not, but things tend to change over such a long period of time
---
If you would have played on some of the more recent pserver, you'd understand why people are so concerned about P2 in classic.
---
I'm just glad we're bringing the World back to World of Warcraft - especially for PVP. Just more immersive and always have to keep an eye out for the "enemy"
---
Well technically this is like a rerun of classic and it's not going to be 100% exactly the same. So if you had to have one chabge/addition would it not be this??
---
I remember that lol, I had it I think. Anyways, it was an add on I believe.
---
I've always liked DPS.  Not as much pressure as a tank or healer, but I can still compete privately with our DPS to be good at what I do without killing everyone if I screw up.  Mage was one of my favorite classes for killing stuff while also providing vital food/water, caster buffs, and a portal after clearing a dungeon or raid.
---
Wrong sub?
---
why would you /1 when you could /4? it was 100% /4 in the day man. If you want to spam, you do it to the largest audience possible.
---

&gt;And then just leave you alone.
---
For a few min so it all goes off CD and he can do it again
---
Because I won't be forced to get off the computer to give someone else a turn &lt;:\^D tfw 4 siblings
---
That never completely satisfied me in retail. Anyways, someone suggested warlock...that is what I was thinking if rolling anyways.
---
I was never able to get much help either. And all the weak auras presents were for specific builds n shit.
---
Druids are one of the most skill demanding classes to pvp with but they are great in wpvp and many 1v1s.  They are favored vs rogue and warrior and have a fair chance vs mages and hunters.  Everyone else they should be able to run away from.  Warriors on the other hand are hot garbage unless you are geared with engineering, consumables, and other pvp toys.
---
Should make to get a high roll DMF buff before the raid officially starts and do the group activity buffs.
---
Doing this is just being a dick to your healer though.
---
In that case, world buffs are as simple as: Everyone get songflower on their own, meet up in SW, pop head of onyxia and you go raid.
---
To be honest, big name streamers are some of the most likely Scarab Lords. 
---
The biggest obstacles to Scarab Lord are gold and having a guild willing to let you do it. The bigger the streamer, the more likely they are to have a compliant guild who will actively try and get the streamer through the quest. The only part of the chain that involves actual skill is the 5 hour BWL run, and that should easily be within the realm of possibility for a big name streamer's guild. 
---
As for gold, major streamers are going to have tons of fans funnelling them trade goods and just straight up gold. They'll easily be able to gain the required items. 
---
Now, as you point out, other guilds are an impediment as well. But streamers can bring a lot to the table to help ensure them victory. Even large, organised guilds might very well have a hard time grinding out the Nozdormu rep, whereas streamers can rely on a virtual army of dedicated fans to help them out. Plus if PvP is an issue, streamers are going to have that same army following them around 24/7. True, they'll be more of a target, but taking on them and their followers will doubtless be difficult.
---
Hey! Turns out they have explicitly said there will be no cross realm grouping. Check out the WoW Classic talk from Blizzcon for more.
---
&gt; Casual doesn’t necessarily mean you like an easy mode. I consider myself casual because I go to school and work. Doesn’t mean I don’t appreciate a grind game.
---
I always assumed I was a casual and that meant I take my own time getting where I'm going at my own pace and Hardcore meant trying to be top of meters and first to finish the latest thing.
---
Even at its lowest levels of activity, it still had millions of players.  Try it for a month or two first and see how you like it.  Consider that the monthly sub isn't just wasted money, it goes towards regular updates, improvements, and new content.
---
Ya coming from pserver with 10k. You guys are making it seem worse than it really is
---
Don't you mean:
---
*One small punt for a tauren, one giant flight for a gnome*
---
What is the deal with people who can play3-4 hours every single day worrying abou5lt not being able to compete. 3-4 hours a day is more than enough to be hardcore in almost all aspects of the game minus rank 14 pvp grind
---
Technically, there were mounts bound to achievement over gold. The primary two being scarab lord and the rank 11 mount (it was 10g I believe?). Scarab lord is much more of a grind than 900g and rank 11 is probably more of a grind. But I remember in vanilla I hit rank 11 before saving 900g. That being said, my vanilla gold grinding methods we're questionable...
---
Just get it the day before, which you should be doing anyway. Getting it a few hours before the raid means if you get purged you wont have buffs for the week.
---
Phase 2 with BGs but no battle masters maybe?
---
Maybe it was because I knew that that thread wouldn't get many upvotes and not many people would see it, whereas since I made my own thread it got a decent amount of upvotes and more people saw it as it is kind of important info.
---
&lt;Entitled&gt; - 6:30 - 9:00 (9:30) PST - Wens/Thurs – Alliance – PVP
---
Do you want to raid with a bunch of mediocre aging adult’s whose only claim to fame is hyping up the accomplishment’s they share with millions of other mediocre WoW players? Well boy howdy do I have a guild for you! We’ve been P server heroes for the better part of a decade and our accomplishments are long and circle jerky about a bunch of shit a bunch of other people did too. But hey we did it wasted so there’s that!

&gt;I see some people saying that it was a 2 hr CD...nope, it wasn't. It was SIX hours
---
I heard 2. Is there proof of it being 6 hour?
---
Wait, so deviates change you to the standard hit size, does fire water, and other growth effects enhance it? If you get to max classic tauren size, how far can you melee people from?
---
You know it's early 2000s when the mousepad is barely bigger than the mouse.
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but in addition to the relativity of your peers, honor is also based on certain honor point thresholds that have to met. For example if no one else gets any kills and you get 50, you won’t just jump to rank 4 from rank 1.
---
I mean /1 in Barrens.
---
Du hast and ich vill
---
Slipknot fans

mine is named deathsquirrel
---
It happens on servers even with 5k pop.
---
Smaller pop just means it won't happen 24/7, but only during the prime times when everyone else is playing.
---
Can you elaborate? You saying troll is only good for shadow or overall? I know it's solid in PVE for holy but I figured UD would lead the way for disc pvp priest.
---
The more you talk about it - the more I'm glad I'll be on a PVE server this time around.
---
WE HAVE FAITH!
---
People done it in vanilla.
---
I could be wrong on this, but I think it was a gnome lock from Dragonmaw (name starts with W) that did it first.
---
I had a balance Druid during vanilla and loved every second of it also.  I didn’t raid seriously on it but was actually pretty beast in PvP...
---
Is anyone taking bets on the over-under for the amount of time MAGA is said in the Barrens chat per hour?
---
Lol
---
WE GOT STUN AND GANKS.
---
Most people look down on dudes playing video games too. Who gives a fuck?
---
That's what I'm learning again from this thread. I knew it wasnt that viable in a raid but I had so much fun playing it and doing pvp. I'm totally gonna go boomkin again
---
I'll throw this into consideration! I think it's not super important, but if the census hasn't gotten too long, I see no reason not to add it. Thanks!
---
I have long ago thrown off the notion of a "complete nostalgia" via being in a PVP realm. I don't have the time to be camped by someone much younger with much more time then me.
---
Over.....9000?
---
I hadn’t considered doing it, but I’m kind of getting excited thinking about it lol... may roll one as my first alt again just like I did during retail vanilla.
---
Vanguard did a 24minute BWL run, my own shit tier guild cleared it in 1.5 HR max it's nothing to worry about indeed.
---
Please try r/wowservers for private server questions.

Moonkin form does really well defending flag in WSG if you have the Hand of Ragnaros and spam moonfire on a shirtless paladin.

5-10k sounds groovy.
---
Like OSRS style...I'd like that
---
Orgrimmar had the zeppelin to undercity, and was a short flight path to TB. It was the center most of the cities, and had the zeppelin to grom'gul also.
---
You don't have to go to STV. If you make that decision it's on you
---
Dragon buffs, warlords blessing buff, and the auction houses used to be limited to orgrimmar. So those three reasons alone made it profitable to hangout there.
---
Not I. I had already been playing Unreal Tournament and Diablo 2 before WoW. 14 year old me was already used to strafing and hotkeys.
---
What’s BFA

Ganku here
---
I dunno about that. Even if you have an army of spergs following you around, if people wanna kill you badly enough they will. That's the thing with streamers, they can't afford not to everything, because everything is content. While they're pissing away valuable time fighting battles with streamsnipers, other guilds can get ahead.
---
Completely disagree. The original cap was just fine. You could get a good grinding spot fairly easily, and also see people in the world consistently.
---
Horde and alliance running past each other would increase heart rates, but would happen every hour or so. Just enough to think about it being a possibility but not inevitable.
---
Yes welcome to 12 months ago. That's why they're doing sharding.

The problem Blizzard faces is how to predict the WoW Classic drop off rate.
---
Twitch was nonexistant until WoW was declining. Also a bunch of popular streamers got their start doing WoW content before it was profitable. Not saying everybody will go back but I could see some of them going back for sure.
---
2.5-3.5k max and that's pushing it.
---
You had to be far more mindful of your actions in-game across both your faction and the opposite faction due to the name you would weave for yourself through your actions. Higher population servers do not encourage community, just the opposite.
---
If you want to be a d-bag go play on pservers or retail where nobody will remember you.
---
I'm down for that.
---
At launch there was only one auction house per faction. Horde was in orgrimmar and alliance was in ironforge. Later on they added auction houses to each city, but they were not linked. That means that auctions made in org would not show up in undercity. Everyone wants their auctions to reach the most people, so everyone continued to use orgrimmar. It had been at least 1 year since launch by the time they linked all of the auction houses together but by that time people were so used to using org as the main city, and so it stayed.
---
We need one for night elf hunters sitting shadowmeld with the stealth kitty lining up aimed shot
---
It's like you didn't even read the post just the title.

People want higher caps because the population decades over time, so  starting out twice as high puts you back to blizzlike pop doing AQ and naxx.
---
literally. unplayable
---

r/wow  is that way
---
10k is double 5k.
---
Bro, there are going to be SO MANY people farming herbs and nodes at launch and the following weeks.
---
I suggest tailoring and skinning and using mobs you kill to level up. Once you are 60, pick up professions you want
---
Rogue/hunter naturally attracts new players. Surveys taken before a game has a release date are not representative of what the general population will be like. That is a very narrow sub-demographic of players - those that do research and are informed. I would be very surprised if there are more priests than either rogues or hunters 3 months after release.
---
World buffs and besides you have hearthstone in kargath in case you want to do anything BRM related.
---
Also undercity looks like shit compared to org.
---
I dont know about Excel.

Quality post
---
That’s my backup in the closet
---
Decays and yes I read it. That's why merges happen.
---
You'll get more people leaving when the sense of community is gone with a high pop server. One of the best aspects of community is the server cap. Mess with it and the people you want to keep will leave.
---
Yes you get the skill from a successful "opening" but you don't have to take the herb inside so to say. Same thing with mining. But you can't get a skillup from that node again until it has been taken and respawned.
---
Glad I'm going hunter for early game destruction before I eventually adult phase out and remember only the glory moments
---
You think merges is better for community than starting higher pop? How delusional.
---
Honestly, not sure, I imagine that number of honour is lower than you might think though, hard to test as once you get 11 and above everyone is going for it, so that min amount goes out of the equation I reckon.
---
5/5 warriors won’t hit 40
---
8/10 wont hit 60

Soo there is that

 It makes the world extremly tense. I love it when i see the opossing faction out questing and we both taking it easier because we both think were gunna do something. I love the controling of towns forcing people out to defend their land. Ya it may slow down leveling, but it creates an amazing atomosphere. I love that guilds take control of resources and you need to counter that to take them for yourself. This game is about community and worldpvp and it brings the factions closer. To me i farm profs in the world and world pvp. It makes the world feel alive. You guys talk about "smelling the roses" and to not rush to lvl but the main thing that gets you to do something else is wpvp. You may have had 3 hours to lvl that night but half of it turns into a battle and you get others to help take it back. It felt fucking great. So i guess rather then telling the hardcore to smell the roses and not worrying to rushing to max. Why doesnt the casual base take some of their own medicine and help bring the community together, TO FIGHT BACK THE OPOSSING FACTION!!! You shouldnt be in a rush to hit max anyways.
---
The world has gold to be made but you cant do it alone you gotta control those resources!
---
How can someone die with that many buffs?
---
I took my time in Vanilla and didn't even know wtf raiding or dungeons were. I can't wait to power to 60 and be in the first group to clear raids.
---
Nobody cares what class you play.
---
What about sugar free redbull/redbull zero?
---
How can a quest chain be toxic? Genuinely curious
---
You casting a ballot for Alliance or Horde? The more people I hear going one way or the other, I'll run it by my wife and friend.
---
Be a man!
---
Yes, if you're flasking then you must also be elitist and toxic. Why do so many people feel the need to project and tell people how they feel all players should enjoy the game? There will be guilds that are more casual that don't require consumes and more hardcore ones that do require them. Neither guild is more "right", just different mindsets. If you don't want to use consumes, don't join a guild that requires them and don't flame them for requiring it.
---
Make a longer password next time
---
Not all chain quests this was insane to complete... but worth the reward but the amount of people who tried and failed... haha i guess its not toxic its just more so insane i never witnessed a longer quest in anyy game than this one
---
/r/wowservers
---
Why, you plan on wearing +fire damage as a rogue?
---
Yeah I started later than a lot of my friends who had the vanilla experience. I think I either started right after bc came out or right after. 
---
I think just before cause I remember being around level 30 wondering if I should buy the expac to play belf. But either way I hit 70 right after ssc came out I believe. But I leveled somewhat slow. 
---
But I missed out on 40 mans. Doing any of the high level dungeons the right way. Same faction bgs I believe were done when I hit max. Heard stories of week long AVs, tarren mill PvP, and other stuff that made me jealous of my buds who had been playing for a while.
---
Night elf hunter and dwarf warrior friend coming in at the end.
---
Merges are better than the community leaving when they don't get to experience Vanilla, yes.
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;"Oh cool, a thorium vein up ahead."  
---
&gt;*Pulls mobs next to the vein.*  
---
&gt;*DPS taps it in the middle of the fight.*
---
He goes up to the vein, grabs the mobs guarding it so he can mine it, DPS poaches it during the fight. That's the described scenario.
---
I... would respect them more if they did.
---
Not necessarily a Rogue, but why not;
---
Do PvE servers not exist in retail?
---
ESC&gt;Exit&gt;Yes
---
I care. I think there is a lot of psychological insights that I appreciate here
---
That is what made me hate vanilla PvP. I was a mage and it seemed like every spell I cast was a resist or a miss, it was fucking bullshit.
---
Then a lower level warrior or rogue would come up and slap my balls around.
---
Yea except it was really the quest experience after level 30 that was using bloated numbers. There have also been reports that those numbers were pulled back in so they were closer to Vanilla numbers but nobody knows how accurate all the exp numbers were let alone all the other factors that contribute to leveling.
---
Alls you can really say is that it's pretty certain Joanna's 4d 20h record is beatable (Even Joanna has said it's beatable) and that no private server record is 100% accurate.
---
You're way late to the party. This is why they're introducing sharding for launch and a few weeks after. The realm pop caps will be raised until the tourists leave, and then they'll be brought back down to normal numbers.

This is what I’m kinda hoping for. I see all of these people saying they are gonna rock warrior but I remember back in 2006 where I’d log on as a 60 warrior and get nonstop whispers to tank things. 
---
I feel like a lot of people will start as warrior, then watch other classes out level them and end up rerolling.
---
I played a rogue in vanilla.
---
I never had a problem getting a raid spot because I farmed all my pre-BIS (What people thought was pre-BIS back in the day, haha) and always came prepared with consumables.
---
If you want to play a rogue, fucking do it bro.  A skilled, well itemized rogue will dominate the damage meters and it is awesome!  But the key is, rogue is a very performance based class.  There is always some other rogue waiting to stab you in the back and take your raid spot.
---
Have good gear, come with consumables, don’t die, and show up to every single raid.  You’ll be topping meters in no time.
---
Oh, if you are rolling alliance, go human for that sweet, sweet sword spec.
---
Even then, bare minimum, in combat potions, flasks, and food should be consumed regularly. You dont HAVE to mega buff every raid. Yes, its good to do. But for casual groups, pots, flask, food is enough.
---
I mean...classic Alterac Valley 🤤

if i was going to reccomend a class for a more casual player id reccomend one with the ability to raid heal or raid dps like druid or priest.
---
if you can heal or dps you have a good chance to get into any raid.
---
Flexible working hours too.
---
This is the first time I've seen it done in stages, but it's also the first Blizzard official server.
---
My guess is 5 months between stages, with slightly longer before the second stage starts
---
Exactly! Time spent away from the real world is never wasted.
---
You get to experience vanilla even with 10k pops. 10k might be too high, but you 100% get the vanilla experience. Server merges should never be on the table. It completely goes against the vanilla essence.
---
More people will leave a dead server than they will leave a booming server with a lively population that promotes a sense of community. 
---
On nost, there were 10-15k on pretty frequently and you 100% had a community. You knew the good guilds, the good players, the ninjas, the bad players, the noobs, and the blacklisted players. You knew the people you queued into when doing bgs, believe it or not. There were 5x more players on nost than a vanilla server and we knew all the rankers/premades/5mans/and even the solo rankers. We knew the random non rankers that we're pve animals and had insane gear.
---
The community is there on large pop servers. People arguing it isn't either hasn't experienced or are just arguing against it for the sake of #nochanges, even though there are plenty of changes confirmed already.
---
SOMETHING, grabs a hold of me tightly, then i flow that a harpoon daily and nightly
---
Braap braap
---
I never got those 10000 damage shadowbolt crits I was promised. Even with always raiding and never leaving my house.
---
Yikes, I did not expect these comments to get so political. I was more focussed on the land line from the good old days than the poster in the corner. People are crazy. 
---
Thanks for the nostalgia trip OP.
---
It wasn’t about ganking.  It was about starting a large scale PvP battle and causing other 60s to congregate in one area to fight.
---
Laughed hard at this
---
Except they would raise and lower population cap during vanilla. You could have one server at 3.5k while another was capped at 2.5k, so it is not a change it is just raising the upper end of the population cap because we now have the ability to do so without impacting server stability.
---
IMHO warriors were the worst MTs in Tier 4, middle of the pack in Tier 5, and only clearly best in Tier 6 when scaling broke down in a way that favoured them heavily.
---
People were just slow to pick up on how good paladins and druids were because of years of "lol only warriors can tank".
---
Yeah it's total bullshit.  Was questing in Hillsbrad on a p-server with my warlock at level 28, 29 or so and a fucking level 19 *grey* rogue jumps on me and starts knocking down my health.  They were obviously in twink gear, but it shouldn't have fucking mattered, they shouldn't have even had a chance.  And if the roles had been reversed and I had attacked a level 29 rogue with a 19 lock, even wearing all bis twink gear, I would have been fucking two-shot.  It's stupid as hell and would be nice if they would fix it, screw "no changes".  Now is the chance to make it better.
---
Vanilla WoW is WoW before the release of BC, Classic WoW is a new product that seeks to emulate Vanilla WoW.
---
OP asked if someone else can get a skillup from the same node, not the original miner.
---
The answer is still no.
---
Can work. But water is still better.
---
Enjoy WoW like you’re 13. Don’t meme like you’re 13. You’re better than this.
---
Completely true, and we don't even have to go 10k, not even close. 5k is more than fine to serve the purpose, but yeah nost still had a tight community.
---
Pretty sure multiple people can get skillup from the same node yes.
---
Got to have the classic api for classic addons.

---
I think they are using "ganking" to refer to the kind of PvP where you go looking for people forty levels lower to smash.
---
If two 60s on a PvP server get into a fight over a herb node or something I don't think anyone finds that morally wrong at all.
---
If you take your 60 to a level 20 contested zone to grief people, yeah, that's morally indefensible. There's nothing there you need to farm, you aren't getting honour, you are just on a power trip bullying people who can't fight back. And no, I don't believe them for a second when they say "I am totally only doing it so that other sixties will come and we'll have awesome consensual world PvP!". If they wanted that they'd be in a higher level zone.
---
Hell, if I make a warrior, I know I won't make it to 60 with it. Not because I don't want to tank or anything, because its not my play style.
---
Probably referring to standing in the wrong spot and getting killed half the time... or was that just me?
---
If the RP was good then I would join in, but it's so hard to find good people to RP with (still looking).
---
I still prefer the OG hydras to the new ones.
---
as far as I understand it's basically just private servers having scalings wrong, and its only the old ones where it actually worked.
---
Rogue was very popular back in vanilla because the class was overpowered for most of the game, however they are pretty balanced in 1.12.
---
I think you “””only””” need to get exalted with the bloodsail buccaneers for the hat, not everyone else as well.
---
I definitely remember one or two people doing it.
---
It’s definitely doable but takes a VERY long time and a lot of commitment.
---
This is part of my worry as well. I was like 10 when BC came out and that was when I started with my dad who was playing then.
---
I want to play classic but I never got that raid/dungeon experience so little nervous with groups lol.
---
I'm planning on being scarab lord.  
---
  Hence why I'm gonna work on that day 1, I'll be as friendly, social and show up as much as possible, gonna farm insane amounts of gold and gonna set aside a couple weeks of no life grinding with friends and possible guildmates.  
---
  I'm just worried on these kind of people thinking scarab lord is gonna be easy/maybe somewhat hard and trying to take the head from me could affect that, if you want people to abandon all desires to be scarab lords simply link them a youtube video detailing the quest line.
---
Yea, I can't wait to have an expansion just so everyone can ignore vanilla again..then after that expansion, same thing...oh wait..that never happened...not.
---
What now?
---
I see a lot of people mentioning Scarab Lord like the title will be available in Classic. Technically, nobody is going to be a 'Scarab Lord' in Classic. Considering the title wasn't in the game until the 2.0 BC pre-patch.
---
Obviously the mount will still be available, so the *notion* of being a Scarab Lord will still be a thing. There just won't be a title to go along with it.
---
It was baffling how much of a community there was on nost. You wouldn't think it, but it legit had an extremely strong community. I'm not saying I *want* 10k servers, I'd be 100% fine with 5k, but when people talk about large servers not having a community, that's a complete BS statement. 
---
Like how can one actually think server mergers are better for the community and vanilla wow, than increased server pops? It's just ignorance where they fall into the #nochanges mindset.
---
I just want the ZG tiger because i’m still a big salty I never got it before it was removed.

Can you explain how it would more optimal to have one druid attempting to roll HoT's around 40 people, than to say, have 4 druids managing HoT's across 4x 10 man divisions (gr 1/2, 3/4 etc.) ?
---
I think a great deal of the nostalgia of classic WoW will be lacking in this reboot. The greatest part of it was how original and fresh the game was. Those first two years was a learning experience for everyone. And was that sense of the unknown and making friends with so many people in the same position you were that really was the camaraderie of the time.
---
That being said the game was a huge pain in the ass in many ways. The effort to get enough gold to afford a 100% speed mount, took weeks of grinding. Organizing 40 Man raids and getting them on time and into the location was a nightmare (no wonder many officers seemed insane). Simply wanting to go to Scarlet monastery was a 30 to 40 minute running the gauntlet through horde territory. 
---
Some people claim that the game being too easy and handed to newbies on a silver platter is what makes the game pale in comparison to it's vanilla incarnation. The problem is the game is just the same progression in each the last 3 expansions. Level up, dungeons, heroic dungeons, raids, heroic raids repeat. Just changing the style locations and some nice cinematics is all there is to the game now. 
---
Making the game harder based on its earlier version won't make the game better.
---
Upvoted because one of my GMs did this for me, too. The community was really something then. You built your reputation in your realm with others as much as you did with the factions.

Getting the ZG tiger. Back when that was an exotic mount.

Beauty is if this were retail they would have a good reason for treating you like the only Hero of the Horde.

Hey, that was far better than trying to watch porn one warped screen at a time on the old dial televisions (you know the kind where you have to turn the dial to change the channel and you as the kid were the remote)
---
It's not that people think they want it, it's that they're lying about wanting it, for reasons I don't quite understand. It's not nostalgia, it's dishonesty.
---
You seemed to just not read at all or completely miss the point. Let me run the major point of what he said to you. " Players will want to get to rank13/14 in both versions because of how powerful the gear is, and players will always choose the path of least resistance to do so ..."   
---
You seem to live in some fantasy land where just because this happened on private servers, the SAME people who played on those servers (and others that at like-minded) wont be there on Classic release ready to get every drop of honor they can, however they can.  
---
Also, I don't necessarily agree with your analogy, but I understand what you were trying to say. I'd be more inclined to say a private server for an MMO (in this given context, in-regards to social/gameplay behavior) is more akin to a psychological experiment, like the Stanford Prison Experiment. Since the private server is the recreation of something, people get to reenact (just like with the official release of Classic) how the game was played back then. This also opens the floor up for new discoveries that man not have been noted the first go around, that being the original release date. So trying to discredit what was done in a social experiment that is the private servers is ridiculousness; the behavior is nothing new, it's nothing special. It is a repeated learned behavior that the top pvpers in Vanilla have picked up on thanks to those servers and will take that knowledge with them into Classic's release.
---
Sure, but statistically speaking, not nearly as many people as have come out of the woodwork here on Reddit.
---
The naming restrictions are the only reason I'm going to roll most of my characters on a straight PVE server. I'm going to make a mage named Faucet and tell people that if they want water they have to turn me on. :(
---
Skinnings good if your Horde in the barrens, so much easy animal cash. You can drop it later but I prefer it while leveling.
---
This is why I'll play dwarf hunter, the ultimate anti rogue. Trinket stun, put a flare down, stoneform out of crippling poison or blind, hunters mark if I see them and kite away baby. I attack all undead rogues on sight, but orcs and trolls I'll give a chance if they seem cool. See you in Azeroth "Stabzyoo"
---
exactly. that's why i don't want it in. I don't want any incentive to level quickly on pvp servers, as i want to enjoy the gameplay without feeling rushed. that will come in phase 2 whenever more people are done leveling so it won't be absurd for people leveling from 51-60 when super rushers abusing it for easy honor. I don't like the system because it incentives boring killing of level 51s as the most efficient method of farming at that point, which isn't real pvp imo since they don't have a chance
---
"lots of people now know how to break a record in the same way, and they have to compete for resources to do it" does not mean that it will be done more quickly. 
---
Which is not to say that it won't be, but they could get bogged down slightly running into each other
---
Can someone answer some quick questions? About how long do yall think phase one and two will take? Between each phase do people usually get bis for that phase or is there no downtime between them. Just wondering if i will be playing catchup the whole time.
---
1: Form groups around your amazing resto heals  
---
2: "Sorry no rogues."  
---
3: "I'm need rolling all leather."  
---
4: Build yourself an awesome tank set  
---
I'm planning on going druid and seeing what's most viable for me at 60. I don't mind healing but I'd prefer to roll feral since I like PvPing a lot.
---
They are always the most popular class at 60 on pservers. The myth that Warriors are hard, especially in 1.12, needs to die.
---
What kind of time commitment is r10?
---
(No way can I get r13 with my job)
---
You usually don't want to HoT that many, it's mainly just the tank/tanks that needs constant healing.
---
thank you for your service 
---
jk (just kidding)

Catseye ultra goggles + Track Stealth

Good luck
---
karma police here. this is indeed swe93's post 6 months ago, so it is legitimate and not stolen. However, posting it again for that sweet karma could arguably deem him a whore.
---
Enough to farm for your epic mount 10 times over.
---
My point was 50G before flasks in easy to do. I just got a little wordy :( 
---
Only 2/9 classes see a +damage increase from flasks. If your healers never go out of mana and melee don't die there is no real reason to flask Titans/ Wisdom until AQ40/ Naxx when encounters become longer duration
---
PVE and RP servers tend to favor Alliance. Pure PVP servers tend to favor Horde.
---
The factions were mostly balanced. Some servers became severely imbalanced as time went on, but generally they were even in the beginning.
---
60+ most likely
---
So true.  Anyone who has chosen skinning is guilty of this while still being annoyed when they are on their non-skinning alt
---
Dude, punctuation other than ellipses exists.
---
You're just replacing one grind with another so no. Mandatory reputation and achievement grinds are one of the things I HATE about retail. Gold at least I can transfer between my characters.
---
"Moonkins and Shamans are legit DPS, they just need a little bit more mana efficiency and they'll be amazing!"
---
Queue PvP turning into a massive mess of overpowered Ele/Resto Shamans and Balance/Resto Druids that can't be OOMed unless drained.
---
I think we are just misunderstanding each other.
---
And also you wouldn't be a Night Elf. I fucking hate Night Elf hunters, especially female ones. Always the biggest assholes. 
---
I don't gank lowbies at all - unless it's a nelf hunter. If a group of lowbies run past me, I will pick out the nelf hunter and obliterate him and only him, the rest of the group will be left alone.
---
No doubt this mostly happened for the gameplay reasons stated in previous comments, but from a roleplay perspective it could have never happened. 
---
A big part of Horde Classic lore is that the Forsaken are merely tolerated, definitely not at the center of it
---
That sucks man, I came in late TBC,/Early Wrath, so I'm more than used to most of the old ways. But I was so excited to play Vanilla, like you I also hopped on the PS train. And I have to say, I am not disappoint; I actually missed all the little things that made the game so old school. It really takes me back to the days of playing DAoC, or Everquest as a kid.   
---
Couple that, with my love and passion for playing rolling league restarts in games like PoE, I don't think I'll mind having to restart all my progress just to do it all over again. I really do hope you can find a middle ground for Classic if you do truly love it.
---
Why are people so worried about phase 2 and open world pvp?
---
It literally will only affect pvp servers, and if you choose a pvp server then you should be expecting to participate in world pvp.
---
Being ganked (unfairly killed) is a part of wpvp.
---
Will it not be World of Warcraft: Classic?
---
I never played the 4th gen of pokemon, so the Lucario name confused me. Was never aware it was released while vanilla WoW was still going.
---
That's exactly why I've taken over places like Redridge in the past. You go there, start terrorizing the town, and everyone flies in from Stormwind. TM vs SS is a classic example of that.
---
And quit with the moral bullshitting. It's a video game bent on faction war. Sure, maybe solo camping a single lowbie for no particular reason makes you a bit of an asshole, but killing people at will as you pass by is hardly some moral quandary. 
---
But it's ok, I'm sure this is exactly the kind of action Aristotle had in mind when considering the virtuous life. You're making him proud by attempting to be an upstanding, righteous citizen of your local PvP server. The contribution to humanity is simply without equal.
---
"The tank pulls cause he's tanking" ... Oh, my sweet summer child.
---
Though it would be nice if everyone knew their role, the phrase "who cares, we aren't dying" is something you will hear spouted by hunter/mages all the way to 60 (not talking about poly/trap pulls). Never mind the fact pulls take twice as long cuz the tank is frantically trying to gain aggro after the fact.
---
pservers have messed up my player expectations.
---
[x] Doubt
---
Maybe in retail, but on TBC private servers, I was always rejected from pugs on my Paladin tank, being told that they were looking for a Warrior instead.
---
I was always wanted for tanking Kara though, mostly because with a Paladin you could solo tank pretty much the whole instance.
---
I'm not religious, and music is the closest I come to spirituality, for sure.
---
I also happen to do Brazilian jiu jitsu, and I wouldn't describe it as a religion, but you'll hear dozens of accounts on their sub-Reddit about how "Jiu jitsu saved my life", either literally by self-defense, or figuratively by giving them a purpose, focus, optimism, confidence, health, etc. I think that there's a sort of sub-categorical philosophy that appeals to the majority of both jiu jitsu and Warcraft players, but I don't feel that they "deify" anything about it so much as they're simply impassioned about it.
---
I have a strong feeling it's going to get broken too, just only by Joana again.
---
heh at least Swedish is one of the easiest languages for an English speaker to learn, as its grammar is Germanic as well, and there's a fuckton of shared roots in the core vocabulary
---
PvE is my safe space and I’m ok with that. I don’t like getting ganked all the time and I get ganked because I’m an average player. I enjoy the game, content, and story. If I want to get killed every turn I make and teabagged I’ll play COD.
---
I know I will get downvoted for this, but PvP realms are the classic way of playing. You're basically removing any sense of danger.
---
You're supposed to be feeling scared every time you're going in to Blackrock Mountain to do BRD. You're suppose to feel nervous when questing in contested zones. You're literally removing part of the games immersion. You're taking a step towards BFAs current state. Why are you people even here, on this subreddit?
---
Time to re-macro that image of the family cutting the cake
---
Whisper the healer between pulls! They dont have to heal everyone...
---
Was there even anal spam in vanilla?
---
I thought it began mid tbc or whenever it became possible to link skills in chat.
---
I was a night elf hunter because I wanted a pet tiger and I liked Illidan from Warcraft 3 :(
---
I never really did any world pvp anyways but still :(
---
very early on it didn’t but it did for most of vanilla.
---
No way haha. 
---
My cousin was in Unknown Entity!
---
Demise basically taught me how to play Shaman if you remember that dude.  
---
He was good buddies with my cousin and had probably the best if not the best gear on the server.
---
Neither druids nor priests can ‘raid DPS’ tho.
---
And hello concussion blow to you sir!
---
So it sounds to me like you shouldn't be playing on a pvp server since you have little to no interest in the entire reason pvp servers exist.
---
No one knew how to forfeit duels?
---
Then they are idiots. Paladins are categorically superior main tanks in Kara. It is not even close. Gruul is the only reason in T4 not to have a paladin tank everything.
---
You’re comparing it to the private server scene, which this is not.  The ‘large private server that I’m not allowed to name’ had tens of thousands of players in their pool.  Classic could very well reach millions.  If the population of a specific server gets too low they can always merge it with other servers.
---
A thousand of em
---
No, not really. Most people back then didn't know all the / commands.
---
90% of the time they'd just accept and get sapped or gouged. MMOs were expanding back then. Every day was someones first MMO.
---
Lots of morons for the picking.
---
Classic isn’t the private server scene.  Each server isn’t going to be competing with all others.  Merges, transfers, etc. will all be options.
---
&gt; That's exactly why I've taken over places like Redridge in the past. You go there, start terrorizing the town, and everyone flies in from Stormwind.
---
But you could have just gone to a zone where sixties would be already and cut out the middle gank. You do not do that though. You do not go to the place where you have a 100% chance of world PvP against other L60s. You gank lowbies, which has a very real chance of leading to nothing except you ganking lowbies.
---
It makes you go hmmm...
---
&gt; And quit with the moral bullshitting. It's a video game bent on faction war.
---
"I'm not an asshole, I'm *roleplaying* an asshole!". Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. You can play WoW your whole life without going out of your way to gank level twenties on your sixty.
---
&gt; Just because you want to gank people nonstop and get a little egoboost
---
What? You seem upset for no reason. PvP servers aren't anyway invalid just because they weren't the first servers to come out or anything. I don't understand where you're coming from.
---
Thanks for posting this! I don’t want to make a separate post and was wondering if you could help me by answering some questions. 
---
With the build you shared: 
---
1. Are you opening fights with stealth cat?
---
2. Are you using starfire only after nature’s grace procs?
---
3. Is this viable in bgs or only world pvp?
---
4. Is it better to lower the casting speed of healing touch by .05 or the interruption rate by 70%?
---
5. Why didn’t you take improved bash for 1 second longer stun? Are three points in improved stealth not enough?
---
6. Can this build be viable in dungeon set 2 or the PvP rare set? (I don’t want to raid)
---
7. Can you share a bit about how a fight and/or a rotation would look like with this build?
---
8. Should I just twink at 49 (if I’m not planning on raiding), or should I level to 60. 
---
9. Sorry last question - is insect swarm worth grabbing, or should I put more points into feral?
---
Thank you so much!
---
&gt;If the population of a specific server gets too low they can always merge it with other servers.
---
Merges are way way worse for the community. That's why.
---
Ah, okay. I played the bulk of vanilla, so I may legitimately have a memory of being a scrub getting sap-trolled before the change.
---
"I am going to use an analogy to effectively compare my emotions towards the two different types of servers, as I think that PvP is more authentic and better"

---

---
If you're gonna pvp you're gonna want feral charge so x/11/21. NS is alot more useful then moonkin form is as well.
---
dreamstate wasn't a talent until TBC
---
Youre probably right, I didnt get serious until tbc. And by serious, I mean spamming and trolling in chat apparently.
---
I like it, I'm not sure I want to waste 11 points to get it.
---
Damn, I think my guild took 24 minutes just to run from Vael to Broodlord.
---
Ty for reading
---
As a Cuban, every single person defending this dirtbag makes me sick.
---
It was slang for half boomkin half resto
---
The majority of level 60s*
---
yeah it was, but not until TBC when the talent was implemented. No one said dream state in vanilla because the name just didn't exist. Dream state was a mana regen talent in the balance tree during TBC.
---
Ty.  For the Horde!
---
Did we even have the Capitals' channel at launch?
---
I can't find any patch notes to that extent right now, but as far as I remember it wasn't a thing early on
---
The name existed in that druids went into a dreamstate in lore
---
Not to Boomkin
---
Dreamstate was not a term used to refer to balance resto until tbc when the talent was implemented. IDK what else to tell you.
---
And mage is warrior’s hard counter..  mage should pretty much always beat warrior regardless of gear
---
okay great argument
---
I was early Vanilla (pre 1.12) up to the end of TBC. Raided up to Naxx (downed 1st boss) and PVPed like a madman (Knight-Lieutenant, back when they had titles). Also loved arena. Dropped it shortly after they launched WOTLK.
---
I liked TBC, but was forced into it. I didn’t ever plan on upgrading past 60 but there were no more Raids or BGs active after TBC launched.
---
Anyway, you can sure bet I know what to expect from Vanilla, and that I value what made it special.
---
That said, there is no denying that the game has aged. The graphics have aged. The gameplay has changed. AI is nonexistent. Its hard to ignore that it is 2019. I wish the game was more engaging visually and combat wise.
---
For kara, yeah, pugs were fine, but any other raid, "nope we want a warrior tank"
---
I understand that and am using language that I learned later in tbc to reference what was essentially the same thing in vanilla because that is natural and normal and you should understand that since you obviously understand what a dreamstate druid is referencing and also because we were talking about mixing balance and resto so it's the same thing I'm sorry I used tbc terms to refer to vanilla stuff that is the same
---
Kind of a tangent, but I really want to make some addons of my own but I’ll also be wanting to play...
---
Pretty much none of the quest line is soloable, so most of your 40-man raid group is gonna want the head, because whoever gets it is gonna need help anyway.
---
Fun fact: it's champing at the bit, not chomping. Blew my mind when I found that out, I always thought the same.
---
Do I hear blasphemy uttered within the walls of classic ?! begone heathen !
---
Jokes aside , classic will be difficult to walk through again if you've gotten used to the fast paced/ease that the current wow has adopted, I bet many like you will feel the weight of the repetitive endless grind that seems almost redundant , but if you think about it that is mostly because you believe that you've moved on to stronger/faster character progressions , something like " I've leveled up so much over the years that my character can destroy entire maps of these puny mobs in a second", it's that very notion that people have gotten used to the ease of killing/getting things that will end up being the biggest barrier to classic for some.
---
But I would also like to say that I did the same thing you did and having gotten to 60, I do not feel the same way you did, it was long, hard ,I had to grind a lot and a shitton of farming but I didn't feel like that was a negative tbh, the harder it was to level/get gear/complete dungeons/raids the more satisfying it was, so in that regard I disagree.
---
Follow Joana's lvling guide and you will be fine.
---
The purpose of a pvp server is to engage in pvp combat.  If you want to take your time leveling then pve and rp servers exist for that.  I don't think it's in any way unreasonable to want the original pvp reward system that was in place for the great majority of vanilla to be implemented from the beginning on the designated pvp servers.
---
You forgot: tells people "play on pve server noob" once he kills the lvl 36 player as lvl 60.
---
This is the correct answer.  We used to do this all the time.
---
right now with Vanilla repacks and speedrunner testing, 1:30 is considered a great, top notch time. 2:00 is a very good speed.
---
Casual play expects 3:30-4:00 for (no competition) - check out a [fairly casual 1-10 warlock run on an empty server](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcMayHVG5RY)
---
IMO, realistically on a fresh launch, even with sharding, That 90-120 minute solo to ten might be 2.5-3 hours for tryhards. A 3-4 hour casual will be 6-8 hours to ten.
---
TL;DR: if you do 10 in 2 hours, you're fine.
---
The demographic playing on a private server and the demographic playing on sanctioned blizzard servers will be completely different. You will get a lot more casual players just playing for fun on classic, which shifts the player distribution.
---
That guild sounds great!
---
But it's not as 1337 now is it?
---
There are 90,000 people doing the same route, point for point. Congrats on being stuck on step 19 for 47 minutes waiting in a line of people to click on a thing to move on to step 20.
---
Just roll with a squad man, world pvp is too much fun to pass up.
---
Ah, a rogue.
---
As a person majoring in English, any and all corrections such as these are appreciable. Thank you for allowing me to be slightly more correct from this day forward.
---
"Shirk" is a godsend in FFXIV for legitimate reasons.  If only it existed for people like this in WoW.
---
&gt; That's why merges happen.
---
Congrats. You're now in a server with all of Asmongold's fans.
---
So why was that stickied "find old friends here" post removed a while back, and why isn't that vanillafriends site stickied at least
---
Not sure if I understand. Could you stretch this out to a 10 minute video?
---
Ditto. Well played, /u/Thadros.
---
I'm doing the exact opposite. I rolled a human lock on an alliance medium pop PVE server back in Vannilla. This time I'm rolling an Undead lock on a hopefully high pop PVP server. I will become the ganker.
---
I played a Mage [pretending to be a Warlock](https://imgur.com/UXmXjQv). This time I think I'll actually be a Warlock.
---
Actually I heard a warlock say that Soulshards should get a name label on it of whos soul it is so we can keep them as souvenirs. I support that idea.
---
Oh there's no need to apologize, don't worry about it. We're definitely having a bit of a mis-interpretation here for sure.
---
This is my biggest long term goal.  I love grinding rep for some reason and am excited to get back to it again.
---
Try that when he's level 60 and you're 35.
---
I would agree with that - make each Phase twice as long at least. :)
---
Except maybe Phase 2, but all others it would be great.
---
You should roll on a PvE server. You post indicates that you would enjoy this playstyle more.
---
You can unflag to avoid FP ganking and only request duels with equally geared people.
---
Struggling to decide between hunter or warlock. It's been so long, but I'm trying to think of the negatives back then such as going out and taming your pet, having to get ammo, feeding it, melee deadzone, etc. Might just go with Lock because I know how much of a headache that shit can be
---
You know the quest/mob exp is fine when you run out of quests at 58-59 and end up having to grind the last level or two, if even that isn't accurate to vanilla standards then the difference must be so damn close that it wouldn't even be noticeable or worth mentioning as something along the lines of  a few minutes of /played.
---
No, they won't.   
---
  Any guild worth his salt is gonna have a chosen member before the patch even arrives, rolling for it is an absolute waste because of the unholy grind and sacrifice it requires to even attempt to do the questline, 99% of people shouldn't even attempt to do it.  
---
  Any guild that doesn't has this cleared up will have a bad time, good luck trying to get 20+ people grinding for you when you just took their head and you're not even gonna use it, potentially even killing the guild.  
---
  40 people rolling for something that MAYBE only one of them or two is gonna realistically use is the stupidest thing ever.
---
right cause "must" == "probably"... sounds like I may have hit a nerve.
---
I just hope we get an elvUI addon with the quickness.
---
but heal
---
It's nice to hear there would be no favoritism, but I wouldn't blame you if there was a little of it haha. 
---
Personally I would love to play ele shaman in both pve and pvp, but I have options for alliance side too with mage, lock, rogue, or fury warr!
---
Honestly I started the game with horde  end of TBC and have been Ally since Garrosh came in Cata. Whatever the plan is I am willing to go with it as long as the people are friendly!
---
The Pally can giveith, and the Pally can takith away!
---
They’ll progress slower but world buffs and having every consumable isn’t required to complete the content.
---
Except they are inaccurate, we don't know how comparable private server runs are to vanilla server runs.
---
Thx
---
Mulgore best starting zone
---
Really the only consumable you need is mana pots. A few fire protections for some fights. I think with just those, most 3 night a week raiding guilds, even with regular average players, would progress through to Twin Emps without too much trouble. They won't just breeze through BWL in one week, but they will make progress each weak and clear MC/BWL without any drama in a few months.   
---
    
---
In AQ40 though Twin Emps and C'thun are serious fights. Average players will need to outgear and consumable up to get past them. Gear and enchants from ZG/AQ20 will help a lot.  
---
  
---
Likewise similar story in Naxx - 4Horsemen, Gothik and KT are hard fights people will not derp there way through. Just regular raiding guilds will clear them but they will require a lot of consumables and practice and good gear/specs/rotations.
---
gusano
---
things like vendor prices are accurate
---
(Follow this map)[https://i.redd.it/9mfxzmi64ci21.jpg]
---
Lying hard when the acknowledged real vanilla record is under 5 days and the private server record is 3 and change? Agreed 6-8 days for experienced players but ones with planned routes will be under 5 for sure, even if they did it in even less on private servers.
---
Inb4 private server so it doesn't count, it's still 98% relevant.
---
Rogues don't gank hunters much, coz rogues fear hunters more than any other class but they keep that info to themselves. Shh, you didn't hear it from me.
---
From now on I'M doing the pulls, you useless little shits.
---
If you are so worried about Phase 2 you should probably think about a pve or normal type server.
---
Leveling as a hunter is so easy you won’t even notice if you never upgrade your gear or even if you don’t buy spells.
---
Really you just crush everything.
---
I'll check one box for the Horde, then, float that across to my in-person family. 
---
I'm going mage as my server-first, enchanting/tailoring, with my second 60 going to be either druid heals or warrior tank. I want tailoring for bigger bags to hold more loot, and on a fresh server, it's not like I can just go to the auction house and outright buy 16-slot bags or whatever they were. I want also to be one of the first people to fill out the book of enchants so people can remember me as a go-to for that sort of thing later on, but it also lets me enchant my second alt's gear to give them efficiency boosts as they level. 
---
I'll probably do resto druid with herbalism/alchemy to start collecting potion and flask recipes second, so I can boost the guild's supply of consumables for dungeons we run, as well as again, making a hypothetical third character's leveling experience even easier with both enchants *and* potions! 
---
I like to always think of how the first character sets up my second, the second one sets up the third, etc., as well as my teammates. I'm hyper excited to begin, even though I'll probably just end up setting a reminder for this conversation three months from now when it likely drops.
---
Not really. It's impossible to predict. What they need is adequate solutions to the inevitable drop off. Sharding, a launch day server distribution strategy and a server transfer rebalancing strategy would do it.
---
Yeah everyone knows warlocks are weak af in the low to mid level ranges so they gank them before they grow their fangs.
---
Sorry if the information has already been posted, but do we know the time between steps? Just got back into classic stuff, leveling on private servers and a max level one to see what I like
---
Tiger mount is the best.
---
Our raid leader would have to yell that shit when we had MC on farm. Bunch of cats to herd.
---
On private servers even casual guilds ask you to come with world buffs and fully consumed because it’s such a small chore but helps with progression immensely.
---
I don't think any of them will scale. Sometime in vanilla original life span a lot of SP scaling on proc gear got removed.
---
Just wait till you discover the annoyance called soulshards.
---
Yesssssss!

I'm curious where you read that the exp was inaccurate though, do you have a link or  just "trust me bro" ?
---
What a worryingly large portion of the #nochanges crowds actually means is #nostalrius.
---
Paladins and shamans
---
Horde has warchiefs blessing which is an extra worldbuff, and orginally only hordes could use the winterspring E'kos, but that was later changed because ally is a bunch of crybabies.
---
I think Classic has managed to fly under their radar thus far. Assuming it gets big, they won't start noticing until the first couple of quarterly reports come in.
---
Alliance actually has a useful Racial Profession Bonus.
---
Leaving a comment here, curious for the responses.
---
You forgot black portal opening.
---
10 is super doable. The higher ranks are only hard because the rank decay becomes terrible. at around rank 8 you won't be able to miss a week without losing a lot of progress but depending on your server you wont need more than 400hks a week for like a month to get r10 and that's really not hard at all.
---
Think the hat needed honored, maybe revered, but I'm pretty sure honored. You had to save all the quests until you'd maxxed out on rep from guards to hit revered.
---
That or grind the one mob in blasted lands that was on like a 6 hour respawn timer who gave like 1 or 2 rep (I don't actually remember how much he gave, only that it wasn't much).
---
You definitely didn't need exalted.
---
&gt; In Classic a lot of people will play for a couple weeks to experience a fresh server and never touch their characters again. So if you have a population cap of 2500, after a month the server is going to be peaking at 2000. A 2000 player peak means a significant amount of time the population will be under 1000. This will continue to dwindle throughout progression.
---
You have described exactly the reason they're considering sharding for launch.
---
I feel like most folks that were the age I am now didn't have much experience interacting with large groups.  Not that I did at the time either, but kids are usually more open to learning that stuff.
---
&gt; 1. Are you opening fights with stealth cat?
---
I usually stealth at a distance to root with this spec -- sometimes I will open with a ravage if it is against a cloth wearer. 
---
&gt; 2. Are you using starfire only after nature’s grace procs?
---
I usually open with root &gt; starfire &gt; wrath (if I have time for it) &gt; moonfire &gt; insect swarm -- I usually use natures grace for a quick wrath, depends on the situation though.
---
I usually spam wrath in wPvP to proc natures grace, will sometimes spam it in 1v1 as well depending on the situation. It's such a cheap spell and does unsuspecting damage when you have a good amount of spell damage, you want to be spamming it as much as you can for natures grace procs imo when you are playing as utility in wPvP. 
---
&gt; 3. Is this viable in bgs or only world pvp?
---
Viable in both bgs and wPvP -- you will be the xfactor in bg's if you keep your distance and evade your enemies effectively with this spec. 
---
&gt; 4. Is it better to lower the casting speed of healing touch by .05 or the interruption rate by 70%?
---
I personally like having a quicker healing touch -- I don't like interruption rate talents for many classes unless its at 100% (eye of storm for shaman, martyrdom for priest), just my preference though.  
---
&gt;  5. Why didn’t you take improved bash for 1 second longer stun? Are three points in improved stealth not enough? 
---
I think this comes down to personal preference again. I've done thousands of wsg's and when I've gone 3 points into imp stealth I've noticed that I will get noticed a good 25% of the time when I'm in the enemy's flag room -- when I put all points into imp stealth I very rarely get noticed. Although the extra second for bash stun is very enticing ... the choice definitely comes down to play style.  
---
&gt; 6. Can this build be viable in dungeon set 2 or the PvP rare set?
---
I don't think so to be honest -- it's a very gear dependent spec to pull off in my opinion. You can make all the right moves, but if you don't have the spell damage as well as adequate mana pool you will be very gimp with this spec. 
---
&gt; 7. Can you share a bit about how a fight and/or a rotation would look like with this build?
---
Against warriors/rogues/hunters(dead zoning) -- root &gt; starfire &gt; wrath (if roots doesnt break from starfire) &gt; moonfire &gt; insect swarm &gt; bear form to wear them down &gt; bash if you want or switch out of form and apply natures grasp &gt; root &gt; starfire/wrath depending on situation &gt; moonfire &gt; insect swarm &gt; bear form
---
Cloth wearers -- stealth &gt; ravage &gt; wrath &gt; moonfire &gt; insect swarm -- very situational against priests/mages/warlocks, but I will usually try to take out a good chunk of their health with ravage if I can. 
---
This is all situational though, I'm usually shifting out of travel form a lot to gain range, using engi when applicable. 
---
&gt; 8. Should I just twink at 49 (if I’m not planning on raiding), or should I level to 60
---
I've never twinked at the 49 bracket so I cant advise you on that, I'd recommend pushing for 60 ... but if you're not going to raid it will be a tough spec to pull off. 
---
&gt; 9. Sorry last question - is insect swarm worth grabbing, or should I put more points into feral?
---
Insect swarm is vital for this spec imo, at least for my play style, so I would say it's worth grabbing -- especially if you are going to go deep balance like in the build I posted. 
---
There are so many play styles for druid's though, a fair amount of people will probably disagree with my play style, it all comes down to the individual and how they want to play the class.
---
They should add AH to the phased roll out so people understand why IF/OG were the goto cities.
---
World buffs and consumables are not neccesary for progression, they mostly just help speed things up. Obviously some defensive pots on the maintank and mana pots on the healers should be used, but other than that? You might get stuck somewhere in naxx assuming your guild has players that are able to follow the tactics.
---
Actually tho, Hunters are top tier dps in MC
---
I think this is perfectly reasonable.  I always played on a PVP server because my friends all roled on one but outside of like...a handful of big world pvp events I never attacked the other faction outside of battlegrounds, regardless of my level or theirs.  It's like...Ok, I could attack that guy and probably kill him because he's not suspecting it or prepared or he's trying to solo some tough mob but how is that fun for me?
---
So PVP servers for me just mean "A server where level 60's grief redridge and Scarlett Monestary so leveling is going to be obnoxious because you're friends play here."
---
Keep in mind that town raids were insanely disruptive to low-level players who could not possibly affect the battle in a meaningful way, so they were left essentially unable to progress for whatever period of time the raids lasted. It could be argued that this is "realistic" but Blizzard obviously wants to optimize for people continuing the play, not leaving out of frustration that they can't progress in the game depending on the whims of others.
---
Do you know how to optimally recover the steemweedle cartel after getting the pirate gear?
---
Not wherever you player. Sorry.
---
I'm going to port over Gearscore if nobody else does. I also have a pretty spicy inspect stats addon, but if Blizzard removes addon capability to check inspect talents (because they weren't introduced until TBC), I won't be porting that over.
---
Ah, been so long
---
You also dont have to worry about the &lt;10/3000 players (0.003%) per faction/server that will obtain the epic gear pre BWL.
---
pve servers are safe spaces for people without keyboards
---
Just google the item yourself
---
The idea is to stock up on high level herbs. Stacks of which that will sell for 10-20g depending on the herb, gromsblood, plaguebloom, etc. Herb will give you much more gold in the long run vs skinning.
---
I lived in rural America and had dial up until wrath of the lich king. Had satellite at launch of vanill so brother could play at same time. At wrath got cell phone internet. The internet my parents have now is even worse than cell phone internet. 
---
Not everybody lives in a city or suburb.
---
Not really, sharding is going to improve the quality of play for the first couple weeks. There is still going to be people who only like speed running to 60 and are going to quit as soon as they hit it. There is still going to be people who quit because they feel like the fell behind the curve. Classic will probably have a lot better of a retention rate than a normal p-server because it is more "real", but I would imagine most people who are interested in playing Classic are going to be playing at launch unlike 15 years ago when one person would quit and 20 would take their place.
---
RP-PVP servers are up in the air right now. Ion has expressed that he doesn't want them for classic release but his reasoning is flawed and reactionary at best. There is a big push to have these servers at launch on the classic WoW forums. We are hoping they will change their minds and give us at least 1 RP-PVP server on launch day.
---
Horde has the Barrens chat.... =epic
---
Yeah but sharding is how they can raise the cap beyond what it's supposed to be without ruining the gameplay in the early areas.
---
Slow main hand will be the best option. Sinister strike is op.
---
:(
---
Swords is a lot easier to level with yes.
---
There are some higher level specs where you ambush gouge backstab eviserate to kill mobs, but I think you need around lvl 40 to properly use them. 
---
You don't neccesarily have to change to daggers at 60 though. Swords is a lot easier and a lot better with lower gear, dagger becomes really good around t1-t2 gear level. I suggest practicing the classic hemo spec first, and then moving on to learning dagger.
---
I have to chime in and say to you guys butching about this to fuck off to a pve server.
---
I want this chaos nightmare pvp. You want a pve server. So fuck off to that right? It's there for you to fuck off to.
---
Or DC right as your 40 man raid pulls a mob pack in which I’m suppose to off tank one of the mobs.
---
Yeah having such high level items is a concern. My main thing is what is stopping third parties from selling HK farms and just being way more effective. People will spend thousands for a service like that early on.
---
I’m no heathen. We fought alongside, adventurer.
---
I clarified my experience in a response above. I Journeyed from early Vanilla to the end of TBC. My grind was hard as could be. I only discovered thotbot when I was mid 40s and addons late into my raid game. I loved the experience and cherish the memories.
---
Still... does not change the fact that this game is now 15 years old. The issue is not how powerful my character was, its the fact that mobs are simpleton punching bags from lvl 1 to 60. At this point, I feel like I would level to 60 just to be able to face actual smart human foes in PVP.
---
There a several, several guilds downing raids early-middle of the second week of pretty much every 'F R E S H' server that comes out. You can be sure people are going to take **actual** classic much more seriously than the n^th private server release. Especially when there is stuff like streaming where being the 'world first' could build notoriety and an audience enough to build a platform to turn WoW into your career like many other streamers have.
---
Because Lore. Undercity was more a rebellion against the Scourge if I recall correct.
---
There a several, several guilds downing raids early-middle of the second week of pretty much every 'F R E S H' server that comes out. You can be sure people are going to take **actual** classic much more seriously than the n^th private server release.
---
Well the starting areas are still pretty bad without sharding/dynamic respawns even with 1k pop, but I think we agree that a large server cap with things like sharding in place to mitigate the negatives associated with a really populated server.
---
#noTBC, take the game in a new direction and have two separate worlds
---
World buffs are not required at all and I think most content can be brute forced down by gear or skill without consumes. I'm not sure a very very casual guild will have enough of those to succeed though. Not saying casuals are bad, but on average just won't have the same experience, focus, or opportunity to get op gear. 
---
I do think some basic supplies are necessary though. Maybe not in mc but later on for sure. Almost any longer fight without mana pots would be the end of the line. I think most super casuals will get cock blocked at vael as is tradition. If you can get vael you should be capable through bwl. Aq40 would not be a fun time and would probably be as far as they got. I'd be surprised if they made it past sartura (no consumes, no lips) but nothing would technically be impossible if raid dps was good except maybe c'thun would be impossible without mana pots or leet dps. Naxx they may get spider wing and a couple bosses in other wings, but it's impossible to clear without a more serious raid. I'd love to see someone try lotheb with no consumes.
---
I think there are bigger challenges they will have though. If you can't get consumes you probably will lack adequate resistance gear. If you're too lax on attendance you will have to worry about your tanks making the raid. They're probably lax on spec and raid comp so dps/healing will be low, putting more pressure on people with less gear and less consumes. The problems compound the more casual you get and if that's their mentality mc will be all they could clear. There is a sweet spot if that's your playstyle but it requires people to have that expectation and good attitudes. Otherwise they'll get tired of wiping and leave the guild or quit altogether.
---
The Alliance has the gnome master race and the horde doesn't.  
---
Really the only worthwhile distinction.
---
Please tell me you still play Heroes 3
---
Horde has Gromgol base camp, alliance has two tents and a campfire.
---
&gt; You can't have different servers at different patches it doesn't work
---
What?
---
&gt;it's never been done by blizzard before.
---
This is the bigger issue. I'd say it's a pretty easy solve. Add a "Fresh" tab that lists servers less than one year old or some other more appropriate length of time.
---
When Cataclysm came in and wouldn't let me skin Worgen anymore );
---
hes sadly just talking shit. ele shaman is sick throughout all of vanilla in pvp. there is awesome gear in mc ony bwl and zg to get.
---
Fair point. Personally, I've always hoped to see Classic eventually adopt the OSRS approach, while keeping however many servers purely Classic for those as want that.
---
Which is part of the problem Blizzard is facing here, I suppose. I know I get frustrated by the number of people who started during TBC or Wrath who want to see Classic naturally flow into those expansions, not least because most of the problems that eventually changed the game to the point I didn't want to play it anymore had their root in TBC's design. That and I hated the blood elves being added to the Horde simply so it would finally have a "pretty" race for the children to play.
---
I realize I'm probably not going to get my way on any of the above, which is why I'm ultimately hoping Classic will keep my attention long enough for Pantheon to finally see release.
---
Most BIG BIG streamers are going PvE servers for this exact reason. Asmon/Tim/Lirik etc.
---
who said we are getting 1.12 talents? I thought blizzard specified it is based on patch 1.12 not that we are getting 1.12 talents.
---
mhmm
---
100% agree.
---
World of Warcrack is what we used to call it, then and now. 11 years sober and I’m still chasing that dragon. No game has come close. Once a junkie always a junkie.
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
Will it ever stop?
---
IMO your biggest consideration is Purge vs Dispel. You seem focused on PvP, so factor in that Priests spend more time defensive dispelling, specifically Horde Priests. Horde Priest tends to be played a bit more as a "pure healer" (you aren't going to have much time to mana burn and dispel buffs from enemies because you are the only one that can dispel your teammates save a felhunter getting lucky, and your Shamans are all as you say playing a more hybrid role)
---
Alliance Priest is kind of the opposite because, well, Paladins.
---
Choosing Priest has a ton more nuance than any other class in Vanilla IMO
---
My PB is about 52 minutes and we weren't actively trying anything special other than just getting through it asap.
---
I borrowed from my guildie, when I had enough to pay him back (weeks later) he already quit.
---
no bg's would make leveling suck so bad though
---
Multiple choice has been the option most keenly missing from all the surveys I've done so far. Granted, I'm thinking more along the lines of my being a raging altoholic being asked which character I'm going to play (AAAALLLLL OOOOOFFFF THEEEEEEMMMMMM), but multiple-choice would certainly be appreciated in general with census options in the next one.
---
Ambush is a pain to use because not only do you have to be stealthed, you have to be behind the target and really the only way to do that easily is with distract which costs energy and slows you down. Furthermore it's really only effective against low armour npcs. So it can be fun for stabbing caster types but is very bad against anything with high armour like a lot of beasts/humanoids in plate/dragonkin etc. In addition it is very reliant on weapon damage so if you haven't upgraded your dagger in 10 levels you're in for a sad time.  
---
So yeah, there's a good reason people recommend to stay away from daggers while levelling. I think hemo is pretty viable and fun if you want a more 'rogue' style of gameplay that focuses on stealth/finishers rather than just endless SS/SnD/Evis spam.
---
I'm downvoting you here, simply because I always downvote such posts on principle.
---
I still chuckled, though.
---
If he calls his pet back, then you can afford to drop form, dot up him and his pet, put up a Rejuv, and get back into form by the time he sends his pet back. If he heals his pet, then he runs out of mana even sooner than usual (and he will run out of mana - before the Druid even needs to use Innervate).
---

---
These surveys are not very accurate on how it will be in game, people will reroll a million times before they actually level a char to 60. Hunters are a super noob friendly class because of how easy it is to level I have a hard time seeing them being the second least played class at 60. For example, through all these years of private servers, never have paladins/shamans been the second most played class at 60.
---
I can definitely see their point, but when classic releases those sorts of posts will likely be in the form of criticism of the game.  I don't want to see it, but censoring it is definitely beyond the scope of the mod team imo.
---
These forums attract so many people because we can talk about stuff like that, and censoring the bad conversations along with allowing streamers to self promote is a double infringement in my eyes.
---
Every other game sub only allows unrelated accounts to post content in the form of clips or videos.  Why now is classicwow ok with self promotion, but against criticism or discussion about future possibilities?
---
FYI: I like the classic communities content creators, but the sub itself will suffer if this sort of attitude is an indication of how things are going to pan out.
---
im actually not that familiar with druids in vanilla but every raid wants a shadow priest no?
---
Hmm can't remember the fight. What is it all about?
---
I played vanilla so maybe we are mistaken. I was meaning, trying to remember all the annoyances. I didn't mind them back in vanilla, but now after playing modern WoW for so long, sometimes things like that can change your opinion on a class
---
just makes sure u have a dagger at lvl 20 for the poison quest, ambush n shit will onehit the mobs
---
#NoChabges!!!
---
Yeah but you fail to recognize that a big enough streamer will literally have their guild mates LOCK DOWN entire zones from the enemy factions during their streams. They will have body guards escorting them around ready to CC any rogue who gets through. 
---
(or like Kayoh said they'll just play on PVE in which case your argument is completely invalid and they are even more likely to get Scarab Lord)
---
Fact is your logic is flawed because no matter how balls to the wall some try hard guilds might go to dick over the streamer that person is going to have a fuck-ton of people come to that server SPECIFICALLY for that Streamer and will be willing to help them just to get their Fangasm going on.
---
op. lol.
---
We are getting 1.12 talents. The talents (and general class mechanics) were a mess before their revamps, and progressing through them up to 1.12 just means some classes get their revamps before others do.
---
The Forsaken start at Neutral (one rep below normal) with other Horde factions because according to the lore no other Horde race trusts them at first.
---
Compared to the other melee classes getting their instant attacks at 40, and paladin not getting one at all, ya.
---
Rebel camp has no flight path either during Classic, some are gonna be in for surprise
---
Thanks, learned something today.
---
Honestly just think how often are you gonn get behind a npc target then an actual player... not to likely from any of my experiences not much more explanation than that done
---
For the Alliance sir dwarf
---
That sounds more accurate to me. I'll edit that comment. Thanks.
---
You place the egg in the center and the event starts which starts spawning waves of mobs, there are 4 braziers in the corners of the room, you put them out with blood that drops off the wind serpents and generally you stick to the walls and move as a group, but there are also these dragonkin channelers that spawn and you have to interrupt them from casting on the avatar of hakkar or else the event ends and you cannot try again, that's it for that run.
---
Keep in mind this sub and people who bother replying are a minority. I still think shamans, warlocks, tanks and any kind of healer will be in just as high demand as it was in vanilla. 
---
Regardless, it’s not even a problem for rogues and mages, just show some initiative.
---
That's working under the assumption that private servers are a good approximation of difficulty. Which is a reasonably big assumption to make when crucial mechanics like resistances and boss armor are largely guesswork on private servers.
---
Note that I'm not saying that this will be enough to keep Ragnaros alive for months, like originally in vanilla. Just that it can easily be enough to throw an arclight spanner in intricate plans to down him in the second week (which would likely be first raid restart).
---
As a Horde at heart being strong armed into playing Alliance with friends, gnomes make the best scouts because no one really cares if they come back alive. Also, they're chosen first in situations that warrant cannibalism.
---
Org -&gt; fly to ratchet -&gt; take boat to BB -&gt; fly to raid.

big fuckin atrocity

---
Some of the best news yet. Gonna be a great summer.
---
I’m pretty sure a coordinated guild could kill 1 player, regardless of how many “bodyguards” they have.
---
Some googling says it goes yellow at 90, and I think grey at 125 which would skip silver too.
---
Be aware you can't smelt the ore, so its just 1 skill up per node. They note that there is also a bit of tin and silver that naturally spawn in there too.
---
If you really want to be a Moonkin, then you should raid as a Moonkin. Most of your upgrades until AQ40 are going to be cloth. You're also going to want neck pieces, rings, trinkets, weapons, offhands, and cloaks. If you raid with a consistent group as a Resto Druid, then you're not going to get any of that stuff until every single Mage, Warlock, and even some of the Priests have it. You're going to spend 99% of your time playing a spec that you don't want to play just to get the leftovers.
---
If you raid as a Moonkin, you're not going to be competing with the top guilds. And you're still not going to get the first Choker of the Firelord or anything like that. But you will get that gear sooner than you would get it as a Resto Druid - and you actually get to play the spec that you want to play.
---
Personally, I'm not a fan of the Balance tree. I think the idea is that it's supposed to be "balanced" between melee and casting, but I think Feral actually does that better while deep Balance pigeonholes you into being a pure caster. That said, I remember a Moonkin every time I see one @ level 60. They definitely stand out.
---
&gt;1/2, 4/5
---
ftfy
---
I feel like this is end game stuff, where you're on the brink of falling asleep and you wanna squeeze out just a few more hours haha
---
A little, sure.
---
But warriors are a broken hybrid in vanilla. The best tank and a fucking good DPS. No downsides.
---
Apparantly thats all fine though, no hybrid tax for them.
---
You wake up late for school, man you don't want to go...
---
It is super hard for people like us to think this way, but a lot of people are going to do 0 research and just play what they want. There is obviously a reason a lot of people will play warrior, but there is a sizable portion of the casual playerbase who will apply 0 research at the character creation screen.
---
It's still melee range?
---
Daggers is fantastic in PvP spec-wise.
---
Swords in PvE encounters such as leveling and the early raiding content you’re better off swords (also depends on what good weapons you have, sometimes you have shit outdated daggers and godlike swords) 
---
But once you’re in some T2, daggers 4 days. Especially if you can get a Core Hound Tooth
---
I just want milk that taste like real milk.
---
"Swifty"  
---
Am I glad I was Horde because that prick lived and breathed ganking. He bit off more than he chewed, though, when he decided to bring his business to Winterspring. You don't piss off the "raid gathering" mafia.
---
I tried Rhodiola and while it does make you focused it made me incredibly irritated, which is a very uncommon trait for myself. But different people different effects. 
---
I had a lot of luck using Modafinil. For me, the stuff is absolutely insane, I've never been so focused in my life, on top of the focus I was in such an incredibly good mood especially at work, because working gave me something to focus on and I really enjoyed doing it!
---
I laughed WAY harder than I should have.
---
“Green Dragons” thought I was reading stuff about osrs for a sec lol!
---
Swords for leveling. Daggers are great for PvP.
---
Depending on class a big tangible benefit comes from the special on equip effect on your gloves / boots - example rogue has +3 seconds to the duration to sprint, which is pretty useless in both PvE and PvP. The flip side for example is hunter gloves (?) that gives +% damage to multishot which made it IIRC bis for any AoE PvE encounter through BC.
---
The effect is the same between the R10/R13 items, so if the effect is strong enough, it easily outweighs the stat loss of the actual item.
---
Struggling between Rogue, Priest, Shaman.
---
Always loved healing, Resto Shamans are in high demand for raiding. Priest Shadow PvP is really fun for world content and farming, and Rogue is just awesome.
---
My concern is that Rogue will have a harder time finding a guild position later on because of competition, and Priest will be harder than Shaman.
---
God damn.
---
Lmao? Druids are one of the best —if not the best— 1v1 class in Vanilla
---
That might work when you're farming content and dont have other stuff to farm between raid days.
---
I think that by far the coolest distinction between the Alliance and the Horde, specifically in Classic WoW, is Paladin vs Shaman.
---
Horde have Shamans, Alliance CANNOT be shamans.
---
Alliance has Paladins, Horde CANNOT have paladins. 
---
This changes the way that the two sides Handle PvP encounters when organized and all classes are present. 
---
Shamans have Windfury and totems to empower their allies, which creates a very Offensive and ruthless rageful combat style that we already would consider from Horde races. Shamans have offensive dispel(Purge) and no defensive dispel. 
---
While on the Alliance, there are Paladins, who have healing burst, Freedom to escape, LoH for protection, and a Bubble for themselves. Paladins also have Defensive dispels and defensive dispels only. This causes the Alliance to thrive by playing somewhat defensive and knowing when to use their défensives offensively(if you follow) and vice versa, which is part of why Paladins are so strong in PvP. 
---
Also extra cool little thingy but it’s more about Priests is that all priests have different special moves based on their race in vanilla. For example the only Priest who can ever learn “Fear Ward” in Classic, is a Dwarf Priest, while the only priest who can learn “Devouring Plague” is an undead priest. Also Offensive and Defensive specialties. 
---
This all builds with the Lore in the fact that the Horde is somewhat attacking Azeroth, and the Alliance feels that they are defending it.
---
Blizzard always sucked at making world PvP content, though. Perhaps they could have drawn inspiration from DAoC.
---
If you dont have other stuff to farm between raids, absolutely. I agree.
---
Me and a friend still get together twice a year app. And have a lan game and challenge each other. Usually an all nighter. So the answer is yes :)
---
True, but if you bring a paladin you'll want that paladin to perform the maximum efficient role for their character slot.... which is healing.
---
I was 7 when it came out, but I never played I was too young honestly. This will be my first time playing.
---
That data is of Shaman/Paladin combined. The real faction side situation is around 6-7%. Which is very common, even on pservers.
---
Basically Druid is least represented and Shaman or Paladin are second lowest on either faction.
---
You can smoke bomb from a distance without being stealthed and then regain all the energy before you are ready to ambush, and with imp stealth that doesn't take long. As for the damage, obviously the big problem with this setup is that once you have done ambush gouge backstab evis, you kinda run out of things to do, so you need to either kill squishy enough targets or have high enough damage.
---
They have not confirmed the inclusion of oldschool mounts yet, right?
---
no :)
---
Thank you mods for keeping title only memes off of this sub.
---
Currently planning on hunter, would play druid in a heartbeat if balance was any good, but such is life.
---
No confirmations from what I’ve seen. If I had to speculate they would be included and then removed if they are recreating a Vanilla-esque timeline.
---
I disagree with this. The current approach is fine. I think only memes that required at least a second in photoshop should be allowed to filter out the terrible low effort ones. No need to limit memes to one day a week.
---
Inc welfare SL for Shroud then
---
Agreed.
---
Look at Asmongold. If you have 300 people follow you around and he asks 40 of them to go paladin he could have infinite Divine Intervention cast on him to keep him from harms way.
---
I think people underestimate just how bad the situation will be if you have thousands of streamfans swarm one server.
---
Smoke myself into a Waking Dream and do quests for BiS gear at any given level to give me a better chance against gankers.
---
They shouldn't have dishonorable kills at all.
---
Could be wrong but I feel like they've really been listening to our feedback so far. They've made a few changes based on player feedback to their announcements, such as the loot trading issue. 
---
Because of this, I think they'll wait to see what the feedback is like for the PvP schedule they just announced before they give us a firm release date. That way they'll be able to anticipate the time it takes to make any changes. 
---
I'd really love to be wrong on this one but we'll see. Hopefully we at least get another update this week! Last week was rough. I need my fix, man.
---
Hi, /u/Boxerboy02
---
You say that but when you have the power to call in multiple raids possibly hundreds of players to aid you not even the most skilled and organized players can withstand those numbers.
---
Even the best PS guilds have their limits. Eventually they lose world PvP engagements when the opposite faction calls in enough bodies.
---
Agree. Great work mods.
---
Honestly curious: How did Lezontas scarab lord grind go?   
---
I havent followed the last pserver openings, so I'm a bit out of the loop.
---
I think you're vastly overrating how much skill it takes to raid as a mage.
---
You will need to be *atleast* Maintank/officer/raidlead/guild lead. So be ready to open your own guild or work your ass off within the guild to gain a leading position. 
---
Some random core raider will not be someone who is assigned to acquiring Scarab Lord
---
Kobold candles are a good one to stockpile.
---
He got very close, just needed a couple of world quests when mass alliance raids started wiping them at their every attempt to do the quest, so he didn't finish it in time.
---
If you’re a hunter or warlock solo devilsaurs in un’goro and stockpile devilsaur leather.
---
Warchief's Blessing was removed around... I want to say patch 1.8 or so. Fairly early on at least.
---
Black Lotus.
---
if you can stomach healing a few hours per raid night(usually 1-2 days) you actually tank dungeons better than you heal them, just make sure to make the group and let the healer know you also roll heal pieces. For pvp you flagcarry wsg, or you can go with a balance or feral spec for wpvp until bgs are in.
---
Did somebody say?
---
If you're first dps to group not hard at all. If your last and they have no cc, well very.
---
Dungeon prebis can be hard to come by, every warrior hunter rogue wants the same as you, and you have no leverage over a tank warrior wanting your stuff. If you have a guild or friends, it's not so bad though.
---
As for finding a raidspot, it's really not that hard at all.
---
Horde have a nice quest hub for almost all zones 1-60. Alliance don't.
---
Devilsaurs, herbing, mining, buying elemental fire with all your stockpiled gold.
---
Not true at all. Warchiefs blessing was not removed in vanilla at all, and it was always horde only. Though you could technically get mindcontrolled as alliance to get it, but as far as I know that was bannable.
---
how bout a horizontal voter enabled non-flying OSRS style shit slide?
---
I'm curious what the shirt originally said.
---
What about the annoyance of having to buy ammo and having a bag slot as a quiver? To top that off, you have to constantly feed your pet and tame new animals to learn higher rankings of different abilities. And finally, hunters have to try extra hard in raiding and their dps still isn’t as good as a warrior, mage, rogue, warlock.
---
1 big red bull when you start playing and then just drink water rest of day.
---
He's insulting everyone playing on pve servers?
---
You mean objectively *worse* I was almost rank 10 and clicked blink, polymorph, all shields, probably some off-spells like fireball, and definitely rank 1 frostbolt.
---
How does my "i dont need 100% bug free game at launch" become added post naxx content and "blizzards new baby" in your head ? Thats some next level assumptions there.
---
Especially when i mention the wrong lamp color as example.
---
I'm all for #nochanges too, but do you really think having HS tavern brawls would hurt the game?
---
Shit, it was 2.1. My bad.
---
Well duelwield is shit while leveling and rogue wears leather so I guess it's fair.
---
And im sure they havent actually made the phase content yet, just decided whats in what and just need to make phase I be in the release. They can make the phase II changes in the 3-4 months after release.
---
Sorry
---
It is the other way around every priest wants to be shadow and every guild wants them to heal.
---
sap breaks stealth in vanilla
---
My 100%  random guess is 3 months for Phase 1 6 months for Phase 2. Then somewhere between 3 to 6 months for the following phases. I have a feeling Phase 2 is going to be longer than all of the others
---
I see I have -4 votes...so since I asked the wrong question, here is another: I there was one addition you had to add, what would it be then?
---
They don't know how many retail players are going to try out Classic WoW, which is pretty much the reason they want to have sharding in the beginning. To get a lot of players on one server so they don't have to open up too many and end up with empty servers.
---
This is so much better than having to dig through different posts, thanks!
---
You think that if they upped the boss resistances and armor (on the assumption that private servers made it waaay easier than it was), a 40 man group of private server veterans will fail getting through MC on their first go through?  
---
Everyone knows the raid, everyone has characters with 1.12 talents, and there will be 16 debuff slots (private servers keep the debuff limit to 8 at the beginning of the server).  Not to mention all the progressive itemization there might be at launch.  I predict rag will be downed within 10 days.
---
Warlocks and druids where always closer to 5% and rogues closer to 20%. 
---
Who knows what will be though FOTM seems to hold alot of sway comparable to 2004.
---
Just saying, if they have time to fix shit like a wrong lamp color (or missing one), i think they feel pretty good about REAL bugs. And i really mean that they can work on the game AFTER release. 
---
it IS in phases. You dont need perfect phase 5 at launch.
---
This looks photoshopped. The edges are suspicious and the lighting doesn't look correct.
---
Be a rogue my man. You’ll find guilds and groups. You’ve payed your dues as a healer, go gank people and have fun
---
Yes, one of the strongest aspects of Classic is that it caters both to Casuals as well as to hardcore players. The leveling phase is a lot of fun and you cn enjoy it by just playing a few hours a week. But don't excpect you'll be clearing any of the 40 man raids as a casual.
---
What part of my comment made you feel I was alliance scum?
---
Lok'tar, friend.
---
i want to talk to him.
---
The video series in question, World of Roguecraft, was filmed on patches 1.10, 1.11, and 1.12. So, definitely possible in classic.
---
Perplexity = over edited crap. He pauses the video when he hits a nade, like it's hard to do.
---
How much notice do you need to give your employer?
---
I have to give 2 weeks notice for PTO. Then ill tag on my sick days at the end
---
Everyone and their alt wants to roll enchanting so lots of people will spend their money on trying so enchanting mats may sell better than usual. Aside of that you can AoE farm stuff like undead in WPL, midlevel murlock packs and Barrens packs for cloth. Wool will likely be in a deficit, other cloth less but when first aid and tailoring must be trained it will use a lot of cloth. The only problem is high auction fee for better cloth. Also with farming high enough undead in WPL you have chances for BoE epics and some are really worth a lot. Plus as mentioned gathering pre-MC BiS consumables and their mats, devilsaur, black lotus etc.
---
Also there may be some options if content progression will have some leaks via uncut mobs and stuff - like green/blues from Silithus cultists, summons even or black lotus, rich thorium veins spawning in silithid hives if they remove those mobs or turn-in items for Argent Dawn dropping from plants and elementals. But this part is pure speculation - if there will be one some quick reactions would be required.
---
If the release date is a Thursday, I'm gonna take 2 days PTO for a 4 day weekend, grab a bunch of adderall, and just no-life it for 4 days straight. If I'm not at least level 40 by the following Monday I'd be surprised.
---
Alliance has the only race that likely reproduces by laying eggs. I'm an Alliance player as well, but I refuse to recognize those things as people.
---
&gt;  won’t it be a matter of luck
---
I wouldnt call it luck. Its still the people that put the most time into it. Phase 2 first week is going to be interesting. :)
---
The timing is totally speculation atm. People like TipsOut on YouTube seem to have pretty reasonable guesses, but I feel like the progression will be a factor.
---
there are sugar-free variants :)
---
They speak different languages. To me one of the coolest things about faction-based MMO always was that you couldn't even talk shit to the enemy and just had to deal with them yelling KEK at you.
---
I said myself that I am sure that the record will be broken, but I really don't trust the pservers guys enough with all the fine details to take into account pserver records. Let's wait and see how much the new record will push down the old ones.
---
This is Blizzard, they have a hard-on for quality control.
---
The Necrotic Rune loot from the Scourge Invasion would likely become unattainable (unless they just did the event forever).
---
I honestly think this is more of an advantage than a disadvantage.  
---
I'm playing warrior and play 95% of my time with mates. So having the high health, defstance, shield wearing brute the first to be targeted is an advantage, so my shaman and priest buddy have a bit more time to stay uncontested.
---
Do you say no because you would not be interested or because you think it would hurt the game overall?
---
The implication all along has been that it is comparative. Comparing using keybinds to clicking. That means saying "bad" in this context is like saying "worse than keybinds".
---
Yeah I bet you were much more efficient and in turn a better player than all the people who used keybinds.
---
Oh yea. Damn totaly forgot how it works. But I remember it dropped a purple cloth for my mage &lt;3
---
I'm gonna' straight up cheat when Classic drops. My first character will probably be a druid and my brother's going to main a warrior; getting groups together will be as simple as walking into Orgrimmar and swinging a stick for the .03 seconds it'll take to gather three DPS.
---
Do you think it would hurt the game(classic) or would you just not be interested?
---
Can be tricky if 5 melees are runnig around and you hit 3 other with tab first. Clicking the enemy name in the BG frame addon is fastest, clicking often 2nd fastest and tabbing slowest because you might be unlucky cycling through others first.
---
What about drop rates for quest items and did he funnel gold to that account or did he grind his own gold while leveling?
---
Why? We can't just talk here lol?
---
Warrior is still the most played class at 60
---
I think that's key to the future of vanilla.  With OSRS I was strictly no changes at the beginning, but a couple years out and the game was dying real fast.  Fast forward to present day and it's more popular than RS 3.
---
How can you tab in 10v10 or 200v200? Tab becomes unreliable the more people are around might have to cycle through.
---
- i would not be interested in it
---
- it would change classic, which is NOT intended by the player base nor blizzard
---
- i think it would not make the game better
---
You must be smarter than this.
---
Lol y'all saying wrong sub like that is the proper way to say, I should have never posted in /classic
---
Challenge accepted ;)
---
I never understood that…
---
I mean, Don't you like GOLD ?
---
It's literaly free stuff inside this hyena guts, just grab it oO
---
I wouldn't make a rogue your main. Rogues are super fun and I had a great time leveling a rogue on a vanilla pserver. Finding a group for a dungeon while leveling was nearly impossible, but at level 60 getting into raids wasnt an issue.
---
Indeed and I think a lot of people answered with the prism of what the class was from TBC onwards in retail which is not what they were in vanilla. Lots of rerolling, dropping before 60 in previsions. Not all people coming in classic were vanilla player, IMO.
---
Well yes, I was a wizard, harry.
---
I too remember getting chain-sapped by a Rogue in the early days of Vanilla.
---
Grab those devilsaur leathers before the gold farmers get up to level and farm them into oblivion and corner the market. My personal route for easy gold is to farm pets. Not gonna say which, but it was a very lucrative business for me when I played retail.
---
True and those are better. But overall I think you would want to avoid all fizzy drinks.
---
Not too concerned about dungeons while leveling, it's mostly raiding I'm concerned with!
---
5 populated servers? That would be like 15000 players online at once.  This is nothing. The demand for RpPvP servers is easily large enough to warrant a server on EU and one on NA. On the polls RpPvP servers were more populat than RpPvE servers. Adding them post launch is a bad idea because all the RpPvPers will choose one PvP server to make it the unofficial RpPvP server. If RpPvP servers then arrive the RpPvP players will just transfer over and basically kill the PvP server when it comes to population, something Blizzard clearly wants to avoid.
---
In the end it was a statement by Ion Hazzikostas. Unlike Ion the Classic team doesn't seem to be disconnected from the player base, which is why I'd still bet we get RpPvP servesr at launch. If they don't, they don't really have to add them at all.
---
Proximity to zeps and ratchet made Org only *very slightly* further from BRM than UC, but Org had:
---
* a much better bank/repair/AH layout
---
* important endgame quest chains (ony attune, etc)
---
* the pvp officer's hall
---
* lack of buggy elevators
---
* orgrimmar bank roof
---
Well raiding end game with a rogue shouldnt be too much of an issue. DPS is DPS, and guilds aren't too picky with them just so long as you can dish out the damage. Rogues can bring a lot to the table in a raid.
---
Im looking forward to see your face when you find out that there is no such thing like "Scarab lord" in vanilla, there is just a Mount
---
It’s going to be interesting. I fully expect it to happen and the FPs in Badlands, Burning Steppes and Searing Gorge will be hot spots.
---
I expect to read a LOT of salty posts of players (especially people taking a more casual approach) complaining about getting ganked in the few precious hours per day or week they can play.
---
Yes, PvP should be seen as the Standard, not PvE servers. This dosen't just go for regular servers but for Rp servers too.
---
On the ClassicWow-EU discord there was a poll on which RpPvP servers even scored better than regular PvE servers.
---
&gt; Was Avenger's Shield (the main reason the spec works) in the game in Vanilla?
---
No. 
---
ProtRet was fine, not optimal, but fine. If you have the intention of playing it, all the power to you, I hope you enjoy it despite the minmax attitude that everyone seems to have these days. Just don't expect to set foot into a serious raid with this spec. 
---
Tanking dungeons up until level 60 should be fine, so you can go ham there as well, especially in the undead dungeons. 
---
ProtRet requires you to put in more effort than others so be prepared. Also be prepared to have less open-minded people constantly give you shit without having had the time to prove yourself.
---
you are absolutely right.  
---
this will suffer from the same problem as warmode in BfA did.  
---
once the scale is tipped on faction balance your server may not ever recover from that.
---

---
If you try to tank as a DPS spec, you're gonna have a bad time. Not that it cant be done, but you're really just shooting yourself in the foot if you're not specced to tank as a tank.
---
I think it will be the same as in retail now. From my understanding and I could be wrong but blizzard allowed addons to do more in classic and restricted them over time. My guess is they will use the current API for addons
---
Priests: dwarfs are very nice for those 8/50 Bosses with fear. Is nice for pvp. Humans slightly better for the rest of the 42 Bosses. Nelfs are, ofc, the most awesome looking and nice to shadowmeld sometimes but slightly worse in pure numbers. All get to raid. Pick whatever. 
---
Warrs: full dps-spec can tank but need gear to do it and need a group that knows what to do and how to handle thenselfs. Might be best to do with guildies untill you have good gear
---
switching to PvE servers is not solving this problem.  
---
a PvP server needs its casual player base. they are the lifeblood of a realm.
---
if you think that world PvP will result in epic and fair battles then I guess you will be in for a rude awakening.
---
I agree, but it's his choice and it should be respected.
---
People have different play styles which is why all server types should be available.
---
Same for Paladin mate :)
---
&gt; How far behind are human and night elf priests from a dwarf I keep hearing about fear ward being overpowered but just how much better is it? 
---
It's a big plus for some encounters (Magmadar/Ony notably), but you shouldn't feel required to play Dwarf. Majority of bosses don't have a fear anyway. Any priest &gt; no priest. 
---
&gt; My question about a warrior is can you tank all the dungeons in a dps raiding spec or do you need to respec to do dungeons?
---
Leveling? You can tank without points in prot. You get Defensive stance and taunt at lv10 -- after that, you can tank.
---
I was in a top 10ish guild on a large private server and when time came to loot the head ... nobody wanted it. It is a huge commitment essentially for an aesthetic mount that even with thousands of hours invested into trying it , you might not get it.
---
So yeah if you are very committed you can get it as a random core raider. In fact on same server best guild on server gave it to their core raider.
---
Nice to see I'm not the only one. I don't have enough PTO built up to take time off work even if I wanted to, but with 4 days off every week why would I need to?
---
The only downside is those are weekend 12s. No [Hook of the Master Angler] (https://www.wowhead.com/item=19979/hook-of-the-master-angler) for me. :'(
---
MATLAB can overall do a lot of functions more easily.  Its amazing for any form of data analysis and can make pretty graphs and stuff for you as well.
---
Excel can do most of the same functions but it's not as easy, doesn't natively give you visual representation, and not friendly at all if you messed up your equations.
---
Thanks for the reply! I was hoping AS was in Vanilla &gt;.&lt;
---
Are the benefits of ProtRet (higher survivability, more steady damage) compared to Ret present in Vanilla?
---
And yup - I'm already prepared for the torrent of abuse. Like I've experienced, Prot Pally PVP just seems to bring it out of people - no idea why...
---
There is a repeatable quest in Feralas iirc that gives rep with Streamweedle without losing rep with Bloodsail. Dunno if it gives rep all the way to exalted, though
---
Never forget the day we upgraded to isdn 64 kbps and I was able to occupy the second line for raids lifting me to 128 heavens

The lore in this game and how it actually factors in to how the game is played makes WoW the best MMO to ever grace my PC.

---
Tauren druids would like to have a word with you.
---
I would personaly choose troll over UD in general. 20% mortal that you can spam (and only druid or mage can dispell it) is godlike against paladins, if you think about it than only other mortal effect comes from Warriors since rogues dont use wound poison. Wotf is obv way better than berserking, not an easy choice to make :-)
---
I really wish there was a way you could learn a different language, like in DnD. Being able to talk shit back would be awesome.
---
you'll be one of the first one to cry if your servers BG Qs are hours long or you can't find open world PvP anymore cause your faction has driven out the casuals.
---
ever entertained the thought that some PvPers prefer actual fair PvP over honor zerging the other factions low level or low gear players?
---
Achievment is just 1 way of getting it. With gold there are 1000 methods of farming for it.
---
I like gold farming because its something you are always doing and keeping in mind.
---
&gt;At first I was totally against this and thought that this is really odd news as Blizzard has shown and has stated their concern with the power level of gear (possible database issue/not having previous item stats?). However, I don’t think it will be as bad as some are saying. I’m definitely not an expert in ranking items, so based on ClassicDB, the Rank 12/13 PvP armor sets are rated just below T2, while the weapons are rated around the high-end level of BWL and mid level of AQ. So it depends on the time it takes for the first players to get to the high ranks (12-14) vs. the servers PvE progression.
---
For pve:
---
The R14 weapons are best in slot for rogue and warrior until Naxx, or well technically if you are gnome/dwarf/NELF then cthun dagger is better. As for casters, they are just slightly worse than AQ BiS gear, blizzard has said no thing that they would delay these items so I assume they will be in the game too.
---
As for the blue and epic set. The epic set is usually not so good in pve, except the warrior legs which are best in slot until patch 1.10(phase 5)
---
But most classes, using 2set bonus from the blue set is best in slot for a long time. For warriors chest+shoulder is BiS until you get either AQ chest or t2.5 shoulder. For hunter 2set is BiS until you get a full set of either t1 or t2. For warlock 2set is BiS until you get T2.5 pieces. For mage 2set is BiS until you have cthun BIS, most people will use rank set until naxx. 
---
So we are talking at least AQ level gear, being rewarded for pvp. Some of it, for very little pvp, you get amazing boots+chest as a r8 warrior for example. 
---
&gt;The Honor System was release about a month before the Battleground patch
---
It was 8 weeks to be exact. And I think dedicating a pvp meta that only existed for 8 weeks to an entire phase is way too much. We don't know how long these phases will be, but presumably phase 2 will come fast because DM came early, and presumably P3 will be around 6-8 months after launch because that's BWL release.  This leaves a hell lot more than 8 weeks for the terror that is pre BG honor farming.
---
Thats not true the dedicated tribute is the one present in retail - You also seemingly neglect to mention that some of the unarmoured mounts do not have variant's that are present in the level 40 mount series.
---
They have no value other than the base gold price, they are literally a mount option - people holding them up on the pedestal current only do so because in retail they were rolled over. However, this only really is as prevalent as it is because Blizzard offered the option to chance them to new armoured mounts.
---
There was a program call get right!  Lol, it would save and continue the download.   Ah 30 min download for a 3 min song.   The good old days.  Lol
---
I second this.
---
&gt; Don't PuG do it with people you know, you are going to have a very sad time sitting in /2 looking for groups. 
---
Clearly you've never played this game before.
---
Pvp
---
That costs in reagents. The edgelord does not have time to farm 20 silver. His attention is elsewhere.
---
Uh, sitting in /2 looking for groups is part of the social game you're talking about. I want to play with new players even when I'm in a guild.
---
&gt;vast majority of players are not going to be making decisions based on optimizing honor/hour.
---
No but those who care about ranking are the ones who are gonna play a fuck ton and those are the guys who care about honor/hour and will do whatever it takes.
---
Improved sap doesn't 90% of the time.
---
what? u go to gromgol then fly to kargath, ur way is just stupid
---
If y'all do go horde I'd love to tank for a guild that's isn't gonna be super demanding as I do have fairly limited time.
---
Thanks for that I was thinking that would be the case looks like I won't go warrior unless I can get a guild that needs a tank.
---
How far behind would you say nelfs are to humans because everyone knows nelfs look the best. 
---
Thanks for the answers
---
Tank, hands down. Everything else is just Easy-Mode that can be done half-AFK. Tanking requires a lot of concentration and responsibility. Much more rewarding, much more punishing. I like extremes.
---
Gearscore ( ilvl ) will not be destructive because its an indicator that the guy hase zero idea about the game.
---
Best thing is just inspect people, see where they got there gear from. And talking to see if they are knowagable.
---
Quality shitpost. I approve.
---
I got to level 35 before I realised I was still wearing a gray belt I picked up 15 levels prior that just happened to have more defense than the green one I had.
---
If you're interested in joining the most hardcore guilds as a priest, you are gonna be questioned why you didn't roll a dwarf. In PvP you are missing out on some really strong abilities.
---
Any regular progress guild wont pay much attention to your race. In a regular progress guild there are so many other factors that are much more important. 
---
While leveling as a warrior you can tank all dungeons. When you hit the level 60 dungeons it will be tough if you don't respec to prot until you've collected some tanking gear. Once you have your tanking gear sorted out you don't need to be protection to tank dungeons.

I love the second episode where they go back and forth with rogue kills and warlock attempts lmao
---
Rogue "roll this class just to be cheap." 
---
Great video, but i still prefer big blue dress. Not sure why.
---
100% I think if you spec 3/3, no?
---
I think the main benefits of protection in pvp in vanilla is the reckoning talent where you can stack up to 5 melee hits and use them all at once for a large burst. Unfortunatly I don't think protection adds that much surviveability compared to ret or holy in pvp to weigh up the reduced dmg/healing. With that said im sure you'll have alot of fun with it either way!
---
When I played in 2005, I never saw any political rant or racial slurs ever. Barren chat was Chuck Norris jokes. Also barely any ganking (played on 2 pvp servers). Sometimes I wonder if people on here played a different game than I did.
---
False. Diminishing Returns always existed in PvP. Roots were the only originally unaffected category of CCs (in patch 1.4 DRs were added for Root effects as well). Cheap Shot and Kidney Shot were on separate DR tables until WotLK. Abilities like Sheep and Sap had very long duration in Vanilla but the 2nd one would still be half duration. E.g. 30 sec Sheep --&gt; 15 sec Sheep --&gt; 7.5 sec --&gt; immune.
---
Starting in TBC, the duration of all CCs was capped at a maximum value in PvP of 10 seconds. This was later further reduced to 8 seconds. The duration could still be longer in PvE. The cap on PvP CC duration often gets confused for "DRs" but it's a very different mechanic.
---
I frequently see players get the history of this wrong.
---
Nope :(
---
Yes, Prot has its benefits. As you said, more survivability. I wouldn't argue more steady damage however: the additional damage Prot brings is best suited in an AoE situation where you can tank multiple mobs that beat themselves to death with reflects from effects like shield spikes, ret aura, holy shield and blessing of sanctuary, while maintaining a consecrated ground beneath you.
---
In a single target situation Prot is more steady, yes, but that's because you just don't have the added damage that SoC brings and trade it for Seal of Righteousness, which does less. 
---
There is a guy/gal on [Barrens.Chat](https://Barrens.Chat) who specializes in this sort of thing, named Caspus.
---
I just know when I was playing retail in the last few years any guild doing mythic progress already had tanks sorted.
---
/2 and BFA aren't the same thing.
---
Low effort as per ydays post, reported.
---
Doesn't seem like it. Official store has a shirt with the BfA logo, and the Warcraft 3 Reforged logo, but no Classic.
---
My googling hasn't proved productive either sadly.
---
Ruint blints to see if its day or night.
---
Years ago I ganked a lowlvl undead rogue with the name „Ibetyouded“ probably 2 hours long and I had fun.
---
Then your warriors rogues and mages are sleeping on the job haha. In my recent experience the only fight hunters should excel at is shazz and even that depends on which strat your guild uses. Dont have to take my word for it tho, you can actually look up real numbers on RealmPlayers/LegacyPlayers and see both top guilds and random lower level ones too.
---
It doesn’t matter how large your friends list is or how many guildies you have, there will still be times when you need to pug randoms
---
Man, me and one of my mates got the game started night elfs played for quite a few hours after installing it. I said to him im going to bed. I woke up the next morning and jumped on and he was online I was like ah up early man?
---
He was like "OMG I have not slept, I've made it to Stormwind and Ironforge I will have to take you!"
---
So begun the massive journey, avoid the crocs through wet lands looking at the map to make sure we were going the correct way.
---
Honestly, I will have these vanilla memories until the day I die, I cannot wait to play this again to re live all these moments many years later.
---
Will i be able to solo the devilsaur's as a 60 rogue though?
---
The one I'm playing on has a 6 min spawn time at peak hours.
---
I also started playing during WOTLK. By the time I got my first guy to 80, wrath was halfway to being over. I didnt get to beat ICC until cata was a week away from being released. I had a ton of fun, but I knew I had missed out on the best parts of the game. I've been wishing upon a star ever since cata came out that they would re-release classic wow. Seemed like a stretch of the imagination at the time, and I literally shit my pants when they announced it. I cannot fucking wait for classic wow to finally come out.
---
Wait. Why are we calling them edgelords? If Classic is all about social interaction which translates in merciless pvp, hell these guys are living the true experience.
---
Those were the days
---
I'm planning on power leveling my priest. My 1st alt will be who I stop and smell the roses with. If it's a druid, he'll eventually even stop to smell the roses permanently at level 39, lol
---
Excel is probably the one program I have a higher /played on than on WoW.
---
The most advantageous thing about Excel compared to those other tools you mention is that every finance professional knows how to work with Excel. Also, each computer with Office on it can open and edit Excelfiles without having to do additional installations. In a corporate environment where installations are usually managed by the IT department this gives Excel an immense advantage.
---
I guess you can compare Excel to a Warrior tank and the other programs to Druid tanks: Both might be able to get the job done, Druid tanks might be even better in some niche areas, but because of the wide availability of the Warrior as a tank (in comparison at least) people tend to prefer them.
---
I would like to correct that short. Being introverted has nothing to do with being unable to speak with people. That's some form of Social Fobia.
---
Being introverted just requires you to "refill your mental battery" by being alone, or with only a few people. You can still be extremely social and outgoing.
---
Me too, but my guess is Excel.
---
Well when classic comes out, guilds will be picking up tanks like crazy. It's hard to find dedicated tanks, so they always get a bunch and then sort out the filthy casuals. So long as you can make time for raids, you shouldnt have any problem
---
Is there any system to which days you do and specifically which you don't? Perhaps you could raid there.
---
Either way, pugging probably will be the way. I suspect it will be possible to pug previous raid just fine, so even doing AQ pugs doing naxx and such.
---
If you believe
---
I'm hoping to get with a guild early on that plans to have a raiding schedule that I can fits with mine. If i can, going heal them guild warriors if they are in my level range. Dwarf priest reporting for duty o7
---
Taurens can /moo way more immersively. If /moo is't immersive then it's not a real /moo.
---
Nobody said druid but they always do max damage. Weapons don't matter because they are just stat sticks.
---
If I was healing I'd look for a +healing set (i.e. T1), or the pre-raid BIS heal set. If I was tanking I'd look to gather some of the pre-BIS tanking set.
---
For pvp, the consensus for 1/29/21 seems to be any gear with STA+INT. That may be a mix of both of those sets until you can get some T1 (lots o stamina and INT) or the blue PVP set, which has a decent range of stats for PVP, as well as a great +15% movement speed bonus with the 4 set bonus.
---
I was reading some old vanilla forums and many feral/HOTW Druids commented on how their kill potential surprisingly went up when they tried dropping AGI/STR gear for INT and STA.
---
Your most useful prot talents for pvp are 1)reckoning and 2)imp HoJ
---
Now, reckoning is probably not the one you remember from TBC onwards. Vanilla reckoning gives you a charge everytime you get crit by an enemy and gives you an extra attack on your next swing per charge (Can hold up to 5 charges at a time).
---
It works much better with seal of righteousness than command most of the time due to each reckoning swing doing additional damage while command can proc only once per attack (That's how it works on the private server currently, not 100% sure about how it will work in classic).
---
What Prot/Ret Offers
---
+Higher burst with Command Crits/Stronger Judgement if you are NOT being hit
---
+eye for an eye
---
+2 handed wep spec (6% dmg with attacks)
---
But if you go down to reckoning prot tree, you won't be able to get more than 1 point in vengeance and sadly no repentance either.
---
What Prot/Holy Offers
---
+divine Strength (about the same with 2 handed wep spec)
---
+divine intellect (Better than benediction)
---
+plays like ret but can heal aswell
---
+Has consecration (it's a holy talent in vanilla, and its your primary tanking ability for threat)
---
+Spiritual Focus (70% chance to avoid losing casting time when hit)
---
+illumination (100% mana returned on Heal Crits)
---
+Divine favor (one guaranteed holy light crit)
---
You be the judge.

p.s.Currently playing a paladin on a private vanilla server.
---
well to be fair, 5/10 and 8/10 is more comparable even though it's the exact same numbers as 1/2 and 4/5
---
If you rush to 60 you don‘t do dungeons, and buying a blue boe will cost you too much, maybe there is somewhere a quest reward that is an upgrade, also my fault i didn‘t say i‘m from orc Pov, so yes the mace in uldaman is also a good choice as it has 2%cc and as a human you benefit from the extra skill
---
I would find a new job. That sounds like a horrible schedual
---
From my perspective, as a NE priest who cleared naxx in original vanilla..
---
I picked NE priest because they looked waaaay better in every item in the game, and I honestly had no idea about racials at the time (I was 15 years old iirc), but when I got into theorycrafting and how I wanted to optimize my Priest, I got extremely jealous of the human racials. The fearward didn't bother me AT ALL. but losing Desperate Prayer AND 5% more spirit (which I focused quite heavily as I always went for the best balance of spirit  &amp; +healing) really bothered me. 
---
However, playing a NE I got Shadowmeld, Starshards and Elune's Grace, which I also LOVED. Shadowmeld made leveling a breeze, always fun to trap people by shadowmelding and suprise attacking them. STV was a joke because of shadowmeld as well. Hunters were a joke in PvP because of Elune's Grace, and PvPing in general was extremely fun as a NE Priest. Shadowmeld is in my opinion heavily underrated. See a warrior closing up on you? shadowmeld and DoT him to get him into combat -&gt; no rage for this poor sucker.. Proceed to have shield up and he still don't get any rage from hitting you.. and Starshards just helped as well in all kinds of fights.. Holy spells spellocked by a mage? cast Mind Blast then starshards and you have your holyspells back. 
---
Shadowmeld + Starshards made me win 95% of all my duels outside Ironforge back in the day, I was out there whenever I could, after farming consumes for raids, and obv when I wasn't raiding. And I loved it. Sure, dwarf and human is better against certain classes, but even the racials in classic WoW are rock - paper - scissor. 
---
So play whichever race you like best.
---
First off, it will definitely be annoying to get your prebis because you want almost the same gear as fury warriors and also hunters, but getting in raids will not be "hard" it really depends which kind of guild you are looking for, but generally try to find a guild early on and if you are a good player and you can perform in raids finding a core spot shouldn't be too hard.
---
There is genuinely nothing we can do about it. We can try and keep the conversation itself civil though, and we definitely try our best to do so.
---
i'm curious, why exactly a shaman ?
---
Everything points towards that things are going to be as in 1.12 with regards to everything.
---
I can guarantee this kinda stuff did not happen in 04-06 but they did and still happen in p-s. Modern times have brought the worst in people.
---
I m pretty sure that when wow came out ADSL was already a thing.
---
Yeet. Shift working is probably worse for your health than being a heavy smoker.
---
If classic doesnt come out until September I will kill myself. They better release that shit in June.
---
Not in a hardcore guild maybe. I'm playing in a casual guild of former classic players. We're all in our mid 20s to mid 40s and have a life going on. Nobody's going to sacrifice his fun in the game for faster clears.
---
So I for one am playing a shadow priest and everyone is fine with that. We still clear shit smooth. It's not 2004 anymore, classic raids are absolutely doable without 250% commitment to min/maxing.
---
Working for police, love the job. Sadly the benefits of the job come with a messed up shift roster..
---
Mages, Hunters, Locks, can farm Devilsaur leather, Warrior too if you are good, Rogues can make really good gold/hour by pickpocketing BRD mobs or farming RFD for chests/blues and disenchant them. Hunters/Locks can solo farm Mara and sell the Ring and also the Tinker sword to people. If you are really ahead you can also just farm elemental earth in badlands early on for a few days and stockpile those.
---
Hardcore play stands for 1% of the community, the rest is just casual in different brackets (more or less playtime).  Considering this is classic and it actually has an ending compared to progress WoW I dont see myself rushing and burn myself out. I would like to try and find/do things I never did back then. I wanna progress trough the raids but Id be fine being done for by BWL ending. I never did like AQ anyway nor did I finish them back then either and truth be told most of us wont be running Naxx like we think. Im going in with my rosetinted goggles but I have no doubt in my mind how cruel the grind can be. Trying to be insanely effective with limited time will/can burn one out. Hell its why I sometimes stopped to exp and just go fishing to get my batteries back. Whats wonderful about Vanilla is that you exp isnt all that matters, even if the exp takes longer cause you like to get your professions up for example thats time you dont have to spend after 60 either.
---
For guilds you'll be fine. Where rogue sucks is finding spots in 5mans, especially BRD. Hope you can find a Druid tank.
---
couldn't be more wrong
---
source: I played on the most active pvp server in vanilla and was on the minority faction.
---
No, every single day of the week I can have off sometimes. At the same time every day is possibility that I am at work, shift time depends on schedule.
---
I don't mind doing pugs if I have to. But would love to be part of a guild of course.
---
I know, but you know what I mean. And there’s a good chance these titles are retroactively rewarded if they make TBC servers.
---
As a rogue? Farming Lotus might be an option. Idk how viable pickpocket runs will be.
---
World buffs will not be as easy obtainable as on p-servers. That is totally unrealistic. 
---
With that in mind and the progression. 
---
I don't see Mc, Ony, Bwl and 20 raids as a big issue for anyone. 
---
Casual Raids being a bit slower, which is kind of the point of these raids. 
---
But you need consumables for aq40. 
---
There is no way to get past huhuran without farming the gear and consumables everytime!!! 
---
The damage is too insane.
---
But you can do the first Boss and Satura. 
---
The same goes for Naxx, there are very easy bosses, but you won't get past some. 
---
The biggest issue in Naxx and Aq are also the insane long trash pulls, which are also deadly. You would need a lot of time to clear everything, without doing maximum damage.
---
I mean some of the trash instantly kills you. Lol
---
In short: casual raids will slowly progress towards Nef. 100 %
---
And then their best players will get poached by progress raids for aq40 and naxx, because there is a hurdle if you won't put in the time to farm.
---
Just a short tale from my experience with vanilla wow:
---
I was 12 years old, and I had 100 bucks from my birthday. I went out and bought WoW and 3 months worth of subscription. Downloaded the game on my dad's computer, had to wait until the next day to play it while he was at work. Started up the game, and it told me I had to download the expansions before I could start playing.
---
Oh yeah, it was 2009. I never played vanilla.
---
Combat is all about that +5% hit. Swords or daggers, it's really down to what weapons you can find while leveling imho.
---
I would still hear that shit while fishing in Ironforge. God damn morlocs screech embedded in my psyche.
---
MC and BWL will almost certainly have pugs going on after the first few months. As for world buffs, just be there when they pop Ony/Nef head and maybe get trib buffs too if you can ahead of time and you'll be just fine.
---
If you just play BGs on the weekend and only play casually 3-4h a week tops, I would say R5-6 is the tops.
---
If you play pretty seriously (time wise, ~10h/wk pvp) and BG because they are fun and enjoyable, R8-9 is pretty viable solo.
---
If you want R10+, you need to start thinking of the system.  DHKs are really bad, and the time effort must be substantial and consistent.  R10-11 is probably the reasonable try-hard-solo ranks.
---
All about living that Gnome life. My warrior will be impossible to click. My very existence tilts the enemy.
---
Damn it, now I gotta find VODs of this ;)
---
I've always been a filthy mouse-clicking casual. When classic finally comes out, I'll try to do better.
---
/2 is for trade  
---
LFG is most often on /4
---
Similarly to how someone on a PVP timeline thread said that PvP rank grind was "unethical".
---
The situation will resemble early TBC.  Where every sane raid healer was drudging through arenas for a weapon only surpassed by a Vashj drop :|
---
I love that it looks up synonyms for dark. I used to look up google translate for Nordic translations for cool words to make names and sometimes thesaurus’s
---
I pugged MC, BWL, ZG and AQ20 on the last big pserver.
---
I personally enjoy joining pugs with 1 or 2 good friends a lot more than having to dealth with guild drama and a good 5-10 people in the guild that are dickheads.
---
The backstabbing, shit talking etc. is just very annoying.
---
I'm a DPS addict. I've tried tanking, it was alright. Getting praised for being a good tank is nice, but I sucked more often than not. Healing was the worst experience of my life. Many people died at my unskilled hands. I dont think I will ever roll a healer.
---
I love DPS because I feel like there's not a whole lot of pressure on me to be the best, and that makes it easier to do my best. When I'm a tank and I let people down, it makes me feel like I suck at life. Forget about healing, I've never been more flamed in my life than when my GM told me to respec to holy paladin and even after they rushed me through raids to get me healing gear, I still couldnt hack it. Fuck healing.
---
Often it depends on your reputation in the community.  
---
Be nice and play to the best of your ability, and people will eventually add you to their friendslist (or even intive to their guild).
---
In Bwl I stopped being a clicker and never looked back.
---
That one change was a huge game changer for me.
---
Back then I had such a bad pc, that I couldn't play certain Warcraft 3 maps (Azeroth Wars) and my brain somehow thought that playing World Of Warcraft was going to be different.
---
Entering stormwind at high play times always meant that my game would crash, so I had to visit it only at night. And once I had a better pc, i also didn't have the money to play wow until after wod was released.
---
10k pop feels like just another x-realm bullshittery.
---
You pug with people and have a high chance to never see them again. Your reputation does not matter as much, because you can hide in the huge mass of people.
---
If you implement 10k servers, you might as well implement 4x 2.5k servers and x-realm them. Would have the same effect.
---
I think you grossly underestimate how many fans want to kill their favourite streamer instead of protect them.
---
That would be in pservers
---
Fuck off, it sure as hell will.
---
I havent even chosen my faction yet much less my class... Lol
---
Pservers are overrun with this because of 0 moderation
---
Swirly Ball.
---
Depends on how early early is.  
---
If you poopsock it to 60 in neck breaking speed, don't expect to sell your services or goods for tons of gold, cause noone will have any yet. Best case is, that you stock up on whatever you want to sell and start selling once the economy matures.
---
well the amount of saps in the meme and the post above is just never gonna happen even if sap only breaks 10% of the time.
---
"/poke, hey mind looting this corpse, I need my fix."
---
On nost and the following servers you had a good 50-60% chinese and russians who didnt or couldnt talk english. Therefore effectively you had a 5k population to interact with. The rest might as well have been bots as far as interacion goes.
---
A 10k server pool might as well be x-realm regarding community.
---
Soon, my fren. soon.
---
The last breaths of a dying horse that just wont stop clinging to life.
---
Fair enough.
---
if you go ham at least twice a week, and your faction wins lots of BG's, it can be done in a few months. It also depends on how competitive your faction is. more competition means longer grinds for everyone.
---
I'm glad I'm not married and dont have kids, because I too will be sinking all of my spare time into this game. I've already told my friends that if they want to hang out with me, they best be bringing a laptop, because its gonna be WoW 24/7. 
---
Long story short, I'm looking for some new friends.
---
If they release PvP items at 1.12 stats. What's the point of doing MC/Bwl? Wouldn't it be better to grind R14?
---
Absolutely not you don't get to experience it.
---
And look at all the Pserver carebeaers popping off. Good grief.
---
Go back to shitty pservers if you want that experience, kiddo. Vanilla isn't it.
---
Pservers don't even come close.
---
Fucking trolls.
---
A big disadvatange of 10k players would be the wPvP ganking in phase2.
---
On most servers merges would only be necessary around AQ40/Naxxramas.
---
So having 2,5-5k caps would be a lot more enjoyable for less hardcore players. Running through a gauntlet of 4 gank groups is a lot less punishing than running through a gauntlet for 16.
---
You can see this on K\*\*nos 3. 4k population when the ranking was in full swing to 10-12k on LHC. Getting from Morgans Vigil to BRM was a lot less rage inducing on the former than on the latter.
---
\#nochanges
---
the trick is to have a guild or a few tanks/healers as friends and make your own groups. this way you can deny other rogues/classes from joining your pre bis raid farming
---
if you try to farm your pre raid bis gear whilst being an anonymous rogue joining random groups, its gonna take a while.
---
and as long as you make a name for yourself, as in show that you know your class, top dps meters, help others, being friendly etc, you'll find a raid/dungeon spot in no time. classic is a grindy game and it rewards effort, skill, and socializing. no matter what class you play
---
So essentially you can raid 50% of the time. Maybe more if your 12 hour shift ends/starts conveniently. Priest healer would probably be best able to get into groups if you were already thinking of that.  Find a guild that is fine with the rotation and you missing raids.  This will be easier if you are good at what ever class you end up playing.  Probably best to spend time on your days off questing or running duegeons with guild mates, even if you can’t raid that week. A guild should have 40-45 raiders. Be prepared, be skilled and I bet you can find a guild that won’t care if you miss every other week.
---
Just wait until TBC comes out in a few years and do it then like I did
---
wait..
---
Name: Sasuke
---
Lmao the classic era.
---
I'd say that's a heavy speculation, as they're not recreating anything from the timeline (so far) except content releases. They're explicitly not recreating class changes, which is a significantly more impactful part of the game and its balance than the original mounts.
---
I'm a bit confused. Is it this set for a mage http://classicdb.ch/?itemset=343 or this set http://classicdb.ch/?itemset=546 that is the correct rank10 PvP set?
---
Why do you expect everyone to roll enchanting? Afair it's pretty hard to actually make money form enchanting, unless you get those high end enchants from raids?
---
Yes, it will be fun. Vanilla WoW is a lot more like an RPG instead of some kind of action raid simulator.
---
When you finally lvl up, or when you finally get something. You feel a great sense of accomplishment, something you never do anymore in Wow.
---
A huge majority of players in vanilla were "casuals", only a few % of the playerbase even went inside of a raid dungeon.
---
If this is truth, then gearing does not sound to shabby. Then I can heal in dungeons and still get upgrades for pvp. Thanks for the feedback!
---
Well yeah your damage doesn't come from agi/str in HotW builds. Your bear/cat damage is pretty bad with no LotP/NW/OOC. The aim is to tank things in bear, throw out mf/is and let maul/thorns + the dots wear them down. How much int/stam you have is the large factor in how successful you'll be. If you're in a situation where you're not worried at all about incoming damage you can use cat form for a bit but it's not going to be impressive damage and if a rogue jumps you in cat form you're dead.
---
What you are forgetting is the incentive. 
---
On LHC there were alot less ranker than on N'st, because the rank rewards were relatively shitty. If you didnt go for R14, it was just not worth it.
---
You had your average neckbeard like Tribe, Monkeynews who go R14 always. But on N'st you had shitloads of people going R7-R10 for the 2pc bonus, because it was released with ZG which was like a month after BWL.
---
On LHC PvP participation was dogshit in comparison to N'st. 
---
So I am happy that they introduce the better gear to make shitloads of people do the R7-10 rank. 
---
If there are a select few ubernerds going for R14 I'm happy they do it. It's not like the day BWL comes out the first people will have direct contenders in form of Ashkandi etc.
---
Yeah that really sucks it might be possible as a healer to be on an on and off schedule, healer spots are not usually that consistent from my experience.
---
Not if a rogue gets you first ;)
---
Congrats.
---
Shaman and paladin need to be combined or you should devide all the other classes in horde/alliance. It is the way to get the right percentages. 
---
Shaman and Paladin is usually a very popular class it is just many streamers get the math wrong and thereby spread the myth.
---
They're all welcome to try :)
---
As an UD rogue, considering to gank between raids, I approve this.
---
So do whales.
---
Oh I’m sure someone had the exact number somewhere but since humans have the spirit-buff, they regen more mana. Which ofc is nice but not gamebreaking. I’d say that decent skill and understanding &gt; racial
---
&gt; What classes benefit the most from this gear set? 
---
Priest benefits a lot since their tier gear isn't great for PVP. Rank 11 will be easily achievable, I managed it while also raiding three nights a week.
---
Finally someone else gets it... not every one of us had the blessing of playing a high pop server during classic. It’s not fun and games when you literally are unable to even play bgs, it’s actually ridiculous and can’t imagine it’s even fun for the premading faction.
---
"George Bush cut my medicaid. Ima beat his ass!"
---
Well, yeah, but calling Neanderthals more stupid than homo sapiens is potentially not only false but the exact opposite.
---
i've powerleveled over a dozen chars over the past few years.
---
i recommend everyone to stay away from energy drinks. if you really need your caffeine just drink a coffee when you wake up, and maybe one more halfway. don't use caffeine late during the day as it can mess up with your sleep, which in turn will make you level slower the next day(s).
---
the trick is to eat food that actually supplies you with energy for a long time. avoid high carb, sugary food. 
---
when i'm on a powerleveling binge i eat stuff like beef jerky, dairy, etc. i drink one coffee when i wake up because i'm a total wreck if i don't. eat a big meal for breakfast and go for stuff like beef jerky whilst playing
---
also get out of your chair and stretch and move around a bit every once in a while. get the blood flowing again. i do this whilst traveling in game every hour or so.
---
I love D&amp;D, just wanted to say that. Go D&amp;D!
---
Should have just got killed by the guy 9 levels higher tbh.
---
Why does he need to be a hunter or a warlock for that? Mages can solo Devilsaurs too
---
PvP titles might become a thing and also unobtainable going forward. I wouldn't be surprised if the pvp system changes at some point. I'm not saying it will happen, but cross realm bg and/or the ranking system could easily be justified after some time, given that those happened in vanilla and that there might eventually be some pressure to make pvp gear more accessible, and more need for cross realm bgs as populations dwindle.
---
My heart mourns for what you're unknowingly signing yourself up for..
---
The thing is if you have 300 people following you around I guarantee you at least half of them are gonna try to fuck you over by tagging quest mobs before you can get them, etc. I think you underestimate how many people want to troll streamers for the lulz rather than help them.
---
Because a lot lot of people lists enchanting for their toon. It won't be smart/efficient but that seems to be decision many have made.
---
for what it's worth, on pservers it is doable if you know how to play rogue. they hit like a truck but so do you. better gear would obviously make it easier
---
I see a lot of posts about whether or not X meme spec is going to be  viable. Literally everything in the game is viable, especially if you want to put more time into it by using Engineering. 
---
I think conceptually people don't understand the old talent/skill system. You have access to every spell regardless of what spec you are (despite a few abilities that are talents only). If you are better than another player, you could probably play 0/0/0 and beat them.
---
I say play what your heart desires. You may be handicapping yourself slightly but it's not like there is anything super competitive about Classic PvP (unless you want R13, which 99.9% of players won't get).
---
PvE servers aren't without their problems either tho. A big streamer playing on a PvE server means the enemy faction (in addition to the assholes on the same faction) are gonna troll the hell out of them in any other way possible. Tagging mobs before they can get to them, etc.
---
never had a problem finding a group as a rogue.
---
If u play a Rogue u can wait for someone to kill the mob, sap him and skin the devilsaur. 100% BM move
---
Play what you want to and just let the guild know what's going on. Most non world-first guilds are happy to have extras in their raiding roster as long as they're competent and have a good attitude.
---
If you really want class advice, a healer is the best bet, but non hunter dps should be fine too. Tanks you kind of want to show up more often.
---
interesting. thanks.
---
Yes you should, even earlier as a hunter or warlock.
---
&gt;pvp
---
You are flag carrier in wsg. You are best flag carrier. Embrace it and kick ass!
---
Smoke bomb, implying imp stealth increases energy gain. Do you even Rogue?
---
almost everything you do at 60 requires a steady amount of gold income. it's a huge part of the game
---
the grind for epic mount isn't even hard. just takes time, like every other aspect of vanilla.
---
As long as you show some initiative it won’t be hard. The major problem with dps classes is that they get used to jumping in groups and not taking charge. 
---
If you just create the actual group, search and invite people actively instead of just letting the healer or tank do literally all of the work, you’ll have no trouble.
---
this
---
I always see people talking about "finding groups" like they are this thing that just exist out in the wild. If you can't find a group just make one. As soon as you find a healer/tank then you're 90% of the way there. If all you do is sit in org saying "dps lfg x" then yea it's gonna be tough.
---
Finding spots in raids wont be hard. So just make your own groups instead of hoping someone else invites you.
---
If you roll a NE priest you'll still find raid spots very easily, you just won't be an instant shoe-in.
---
Until he 3 shots you with gravestone sceptre before you broke through his shield
---
As a rogue I would suggest skip Devilsour and jump asap in  RFD to picpocket/kill bosses for lewt and also picpocket BRD mobs. Why? Because you will have 0 competition which means you will flying through those dungeons.
---
Sure, Devilsour might yield more gold but man you will have competition and I think it's not worth the time.
---
Picpocket those dungeons, reset, repeat. This is what I will be doing.
---
Faction rep and lore. UD aren't central to horde.
---
Maybe find a guild that will let you raid every two weeks and pug the in between weeks? Or use the extra week for other grinds or an alt or something.
---
Who will buy your fish when noone has any gold at early levels ^^
---
He probably thought he was in ‘hights lope’ subreddit
---
I'm guessing this is because nodes have to be accessed more than once, where as herbs are a one-click thing?
---
What does it mean?
---
ahahaha
---
Fire rogue was a thing. They did nerf it into the ground though, and this happened during vanilla, not exactly sure of when, but before the tbc pre-patch for sure. 
---
Elemental damage on weapons are still great for leveling though
---
Avoid Burning Steppes if you don't want to get trampled, is pretty much my advice.
---
You land at the FP in Morgan's Vigil and BAM you get jumped by 5 level 60's who are trying to rank up.
---
So try to level to 60 before P2 sets in, then you can at least defend yourself!
---
Probably cause its a really cool profession in vanilla. Ench Alchemy and Engi all great fun. Moneymaking thoughts aside.
---
Its not, even with bg flightmaster are still camped by hardcore players on pservers while they wait for bg to pop. The only difference will be that in phase 2 even casual ranker will do it and that everyone will do it longer because they are not interrupted by a bg popping while doing so.
---
God bless Abbot and Costello. :D
---
Hmm never really experienced that myself, always seemed like few people had enchanting and it's a real pain to level and dosent bring you much. Maybe im wrong :P
---
Its a big pride to max out ench and get some rare recipes tbh. Myself i rather go engi. Now to pick goblin vs gnomish :-(
---
You are not corrected, the XP values were wrong. Client was reverse engineered from wotlk so all quest XP after lvl 30 was increased by 40%. It was like this for a longtime, so it can be proven if you compare xp rewards from quests looking at joanas videos vs varrakwows. Additionally a lot of quests are bugged and easier on pservers.
---
So journeys run is far from legitimate.
---
Why do you say that?
---
Well if i knew i would be getting the rare recipes, then hell yeah I would go enchanting, but they are very rare and most of them are from raids. You will have to be extreamly lucky to actually get a hold of those and just dosent seem like it's worth the gamble at all.
---
Yeah im having a hard time chosing what im going for as a holy priest, tailor, engi, herb/mining and so on, I want the gold, the fun and the gear :D
---
That's exactly how my girlfriend feels, so she's hyped as hell for Classic. Almost more than me. She got me into playing retail WoW again, so I'll introduce her to vanilla WoW!
---
I feel this is relevant here  
---
[https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=86](https://youtu.be/k1t0A1cqGcw?t=86)
---
Hehe I feel vetter knowing Im not alone on my struggles
---
Thats not because nobody would play warrior. It's because most of them don't want to tank anything or only go with their group/guild.
---
I work 07.00-19.00 2 weeks and then some time off after that. For me its fine, and i am core raider. But your night shifts fuck you over. Tell the guild what your situation is and everything will be just fine. Just remember that the days you do work 12h and have a raid after work. Be ready outside the instance, with required buffs, consumes and what not. Do not let 39 ppl wait for you 👍 Good luck!
---
Go with rogue. Rogues scale very well with gear and I personally think the rotation is much better than spamming SB.
---
Once you get those juicy daggers from AQ40 and Naxx, the backstabs you will drop will hit like a truck and cloth users will be deleted very very fast.
---
Also you will be the most feared class in WPVP. You will have the major advantage of picking who to fight.
---
Warlocks are strong yes i agree and I am not bashing the class, but I think roge is more fun.
---
Memes transcend reality and math. 90% of the time happens every time.
---
Id say Shaman beats warrior even easier
---
Theee burning Cruuusade
---
Are you sure it's modern politics? To me it seems we are in a global retro phase anyway, so it's hard to see the difference between modern and historical bullshit?
---
It’s also significantly harder to do so. Adding and removing mounts is a much simpler task which I could envisage Blizzard doing
---
Here’s what you do after Naxx:
---
You roll a new character or flex your current characters super strength and help other people build their characters up as well.
---
You play the market.  You PvP.  You duel.  You go for loremaster (I know, no achievements).  You sit in a tavern with your buds.  You go to a random spot in STV and just fish/chill (well, maybe not STV). You try out the other faction. You attempt an in-game pyramid scheme.
---
There’s so much in the base game that I don’t know how I’ll even be able to do it all.  No additional content necessary!
---
Horde is basically easy mode. Their fps and zepplins and cities are all more geographically convenient for travel, questing, mage portals, world boss proximity.
---
The quest rewards they get are far superior to alliance. For example horde get 4 2h quest rewards for 40-60 bracket, alliance get 1, it's shared with horde. They get a plus hit trinket at 35.
---
Their racial are insanely stronger for pvp. An aoe stun, fear break, stun resist.
---
Only thing alliance has going for them is paladins, but horde cried about that and got them in Tbc.
---
Go horde to play with all the toxic pserver minmaxing edge lords. Go alliance if you're a man.
---
Smoke bomb = distract whatever its called. Imp stealth makes you move faster to the NPC and you will still have full energy at the time you are there.
---
I usually camp the two next to the spring
---
Phfah, peasant!   
---
I was playing on broadband in 1994. 
---
/r/broadbandgatekeeping
---
Nobody has mentioned it but I’d think fishing will be a good money maker as well as tailoring because everyone will need bags for their main much less all the alts they plan on leveling
---
Urgh I remember tanks and healers doing this all the time because those fuckers knew they could get away with it due to it being hard to find replacements. Ngl I saw red for a split second reading this comment thread, nostalgic in the worst way lmao
---
Patch 1.2.0: Sap: Players now have an increasing chance to break free of the effect, such that it is unlikely the effect will last more than 15 seconds.
---
1. You are rude.
---
2. To my knowledge it respawns once an hour on the whole 4 zones. Each node respawns in multiple days by that definition. Meanwhile other plants respawn much faster than that.
---
EMT here. Facing the same problems as OP. 
---
Schedule isnt that bad - new studies conclude, that you can break up your 7-8 hours of sleep. Just as long as you get 7-8 hours of sleep during a 24 hour period.
---
Which is why you go horde to avoid that friggin purge!!!
---
Also I’m curious what the best gold making class/spec will be in vanilla... because monk and druid are king in current content if I’m not mistaken.
---
Change step 1 to amazing bear tanking. It is really solid in dungeons, without stuff, and he hates healing.
---
what is this shit?
---
Farming crusader ench in e plaguelands
---
Depents.
---
With no Gear, ak naked, i guess rogue since its able to kill ppl.
---
And then its a scale, at the start of classic UD Shadowpriest will be insane, since you just need abit of Stamina to beat everything.
---
Same gos for SL Warlock, this class would peak at t1 gear more or less, sure it gets alot of spelldmg later but t1 has compareable Stam values to Naxx Gear, and SL Warlock is a monster anyway.
---
Next would be Hunter and Mage, both have alot of tools to overcome hard Situations but both need abit Gear here and there.
---
Overall i would surely say the least gear depented class is UD Shadowpriest, but on the flip side its super hard to get gear on sp.
---
SL Warlock needs abit more gear but is super easy to Gear. And Mage and Hunter allmost need no gear in a few situations and abit gear in others.
---
All for PvP ofc.
---
No, it has that vintage patina now for authenticity.
---
Tanks can't relate xD
---
Yes, same about Forest Song (ashenvale, ally camp at the east).
---
Druids are better tanks around MC than warriors due to gear scaling and lot of elemental tanking involved. You can tank MC if you desire.
---
DPS is not out of the question with a casual guild either.
---
Sure would be. But not everybody can play 14 hours a day.
---
Please that is clearly a dwarf fury warrior, he uses a throwing weapon
---
If you can play 20 hour a day then yes.
---
Different private server shortcuts
---
Sorry, I should have mentioned that I got my Pala only to around 50 before BC launched. So I know the old talent trees and everything - it was more a question of: was Prot PVP a **thing** back in Vanilla.
---
Devilsaur will be best g/hr but it is an investment which will take weeks for you to get the gold out.
---
If you need cash ASAP you will be best to do pickpocket runs in BRD or find a good farming spot like bats in EPL which have good vendor greys. You can make 50-75g/hr those ways.
---
Maybe have a sticky threat that contains all the blue posts about classic? Might help stop some of the questions that have already been answered
---
The honor system and BGs has nothing to do with world pvp. Random world pvp, raids etc are complete shit for honor and people know that in 2019. Even if people don't know that, thanks to the honor system if just 1 person knows that it's enough to force everyone.
---
What happened before BGs was completely due to novelty. it was not going to last BGs or not. Without BGs someone somewhere would have inevitably figured out that "this is shit honor compared to camping low 50s, I can basically get free rank 14 if nobody else does it" (yeah right).
---
Let me give you a clear example: 
---
Many guilds wipe on Onyxia, she does a fear on the tank and then wipes the entire raid with cleave and tail swipe it only takes a few seconds, meaning all 40 players die again and again and again untill you figure out how to solve it. If you have a dwarf priest the problem is solved instantly and 40 players never wipe time after time. 
---
Human vs NE is so small that generally no one bothers to optimize it. The 5% spirit is suposedly only of your base(non item) spirit. 
---
Warriors tank dungeons with DPS or PvP talents all the time no problem.
---
And no hearthstone.
---
why the fuck have i never thought about that possibility?
---
I don't think many hardcore guilds are going to want to take a streamer, not on a PvP server anyway. All these people saying they'll have armies around to protect them - maybe up to level 20. You think all these hangers on are going to make level 60 to help them in Silithus? I doubt it
---
Depends on what loot tables phase 1 ships with. People are suggesting devilsaurs but the leather shouldnt be in the game until much later.l
---
The server size was not a core design principle.  It was a technological limit at the time..... this has been addressed several times.
---
They may decide to keep it but there has been no confirmation of that.
---
Well, I've seen quite a bunch of guilds favoring shadow weavers rather than pure shadows. Namely priests with enough points in shadow for the debuff, but the rest on healing talents (i.e. holy or for a buffer-like disc for PI). 
---
And, anyway, that's only if you have enough locks to work with. If not, it's just not worth.
---
Check out Drakova on youtube, perhaps the most insightful when it comes prot/ret paladin pvp.
---
Thanks that's what I was kinda hoping to here since I'm going to have to look at my priest for the next few years might as well like the way he/she looks
---
Hunters can farm Dire Maul North (Tribute runs) and Maraudon (Princess).
---
Warlocks can farm Maraudon (Princess). 
---
Mages can farm the Lashers in Dire Maul East.
---
Doing DMT runs on a hunter is the best way to make gold though.
---
I've never seen this and I've looked at nearly every post on this sub for the last 8 months or so.
---
Nothing beats killing things for their stuff.
---
Pretty sure no private server runs 2.3.4 in tbc though its 2.4.3
---
I see 👍
---
You do. The zone is obscenely good for the level range. It takes private server levels of ganking for it to drop below other zones.
---
shaman.
---
 you should only play druid, only if you are really feeling like it, and can't see yourself playing something else, cos overall this class is rather weak (apart from running for flags). no offense to anyone, but thats just how it is, and there reality of the situation both for pve and pvp. 
---
also dps options, capabilities and possibilities of a shaman is much larger aswell. and you havent even seen windfury yet, or what geared elem shamans can do.
---
there are two reasons why you ever want to go for a druid: 
---
1. you are in love withthe class. you really feeling it stylistically and don't really feel it playing other classes and characters (if you can - go play that other class).  
---
2. or if you want to make a flag carrier in pvp.
---
thats pretty much it. druids are good for tanking 5mans, and duels with a speicifc build and gear. but thats all rather niche things.
---
Better vocals maybe?
---
If any, WoW Classic is gonna be a social experiment in how ppl change playing a game then and now.
---
Awesome thanks for taking the time to reply. 
---
It's good to hear that you cleared naxx as a nelf that's pretty much my goal just clear each raid as they come out.
---
So when are they releasing The Burning Crusade? Which leads me to another question - when is Wrath of the Lich King coming. Which brings yet another one, what's the expected time on Cataclysm. Which again leads us...
---
Streamers aren't gonna be trying to get into a hardcore guild, they're going to make the hardcore guilds, with them as the GM. Or try to, anyway. They get more than enough applications but how many of them are really dedicated?
---
Is this countered by a single dwarf priest or is it made easier with a few of them I'm sure someone in whatever guild I join will be a dwarf priest.
---
You guys aren't allowed to cancel holiday requests?
---
Can I kite as a druid in un'goro for the devilsaur leather?
---
Or should I stick to Maraudon farming in the beginning?
---
Oh but for the simpler times when streaming wasn't a thing and the only chance us plebs had to see the top tier content and world firsts was a horrible mishmash compilation from Nihilum &lt;3 I loved those videos :D
---
I guess streamers are very public about what their plans are and sure they got the time because essentially they get paid to play, rather than having to take time out of a real job. But on the other hand.. don't underestimate a few people who have banded together and aren't well known that they could do it too under the radar.
---
How much fucking gold \[name of guy who caused the wipe\] just cost me! @\*%@":!!
---
I love both these classes. When i heal on my druid i am sometimes unwanted in a 5man group because i do not have a res. In pvp i have no fast healing spells and sometimes people just die before i can get them up. In raids it is the same thing no fast heals means people die more when things go wrong.  
---
So in endgame performance the shaman &gt; druid. That does not mean druids are not worth playing though. The best experience i ever had was leveling a druid. Both shaman and druid can put up a good fight as Resto spec.
---
And alliance has WAY better PvE racials.
---
Paladin is much better at pvp than shaman.
---
When blizzard gave alliance shamans, they also gave them bloodlust. 
---
Alliance cities actually look like cities. 
---
If you want to be a whiny child feel free to roll alliance. The adults will be on the Org bank, thank you very much.
---
Thank you kind sir
---
Yea im in the same boat, played healing priest throughout vanilla to wrath, i remember i wasnt even lvl 60 back in vanilla for more than 2 days before i got a guild wanting me to join.
---
I'm gonna main a rogue this time around though because i can feel that is what i burn for. Always had a rogue as alt nows the time to experience one from the start :)
---
Dont worry about the dps role getting harder invites, its what you enjoy that matters the most.
---
DM won’t be out 2 weeks from launch
---
Just have people roll. Ultimately if DPS ignore the roll at that point they're vastly more replaceable than a tank
---
Yes, it has been discussed several times by Mark Kern and Kevin Jordan that it was entirely driven by design.
---
[Proof #1](https://youtu.be/izCBaGfGJCg?t=2394)
---
[Proof #2](https://i.imgur.com/nSg2ebl.png)
---
Do you have proof from Blizzard employees that it wasn't driven by design feel free to provide it.
---
Quite impressive how many wrong and biased information you managed to squeeze in a single post. 
---
&gt; For example horde get 4 2h quest rewards for 40-60 bracket, alliance get 1, it's shared with horde.
---
That's funny because I found 8 2H quest rewards for warriors in the 40 to 60 bracket and they are all shared, neutral quests apart for 1, which reward is worse than Bonebiter anyway.
---
Speaking of, Alliance has a much better weapon progression than Horde since they have Westfall Staff into Bonebiter into Resurgence Rod while Horde has no equivalent blue quest reward between levels 18 and 46.
---
&gt; They get a plus hit trinket at 35
---
It's a [lvl 46 rec elite quest](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=7862) in an open air dungeon that most people won't complete without a full group of 50s.
---
&gt; Only thing alliance has going for them is paladins, but horde cried about that and got them in Tbc.
---
Completely irrelevant, this is Classic.
---
&gt; Go horde to play with all the toxic pserver minmaxing edge lords. Go alliance if you're a man.
---
[Okay](https://classicdb.ch/?spell=25895).
---
Completely agree here and I am somewhat suprised the comparison to OSRS isn't mentioned more, or at least given the credit it deserves as being a pioneer in terms of bringing back the old version of a game that communities requested for years and making a success out of it.
---
One big difference that I would note however is that OSRS dev team engage heavily with the community and always request their support with polls etc to gauge whether some new piece of content is acceptable. Blizzard are to my mind, notoriously bad for not giving a crap about what the players want and they just do what they think is best, consequences be damned. I mean perhaps that is changing and they are listening to feedback more these days, as a latecomer to finding out about classic WoW I am unaware how much has changed from their original plan to what we know now, based on community feedback. 
---
I would certainly hope that they will engage with the playerbase and ask for big changes rather than their old style of "this is happening, suck it up".
---
i remember porn jpegs loading line by line like a fax , hd video ha i wish, kids dont know how good they have it
---
Find new friends.
---
Yea a single Dwarf is enough but it is handy to have more. Yea just pick a NE if that is your Race. Healing priest is arguably the most sought after role regardless of race.
---
In theorie its the most effective. Its 20 seconds to pre-farm an extra shard Vs. 20 minutes travaling time for others.
---
But that is the kind of minmaxing people hate.
---
As a resto sham in PvE you want the mana tide totem so you'll have to change since ele/resto is better than deep resto for pvp. You could find a guild that accept you as a ele/resto in raid tho.
---
Disci priest is good for both pve and pvp, every caster will try to befriend you for that PI buff ;)
---
How hard it is to get rank 12 or 13, is depending on how hardcore the pvp grind is on your server correct? 
---
So pushing on a pve server could potentially easier than on a highly competitive pvp server?
---
great. let them play rogue. If people still think rogues are op in 1.12 and that is the reason they want to play it those people are dumb as a brick.
---
Ah man my guild cleared all of TBC content with a Paladin main tank (Shout out to Facci if you see this ;)) They were an absolute boss, particularly for the large trash pulls in Hyjal and BT.
---
The reason its easier is because Sword almost always use the Sinister strike combat build that means you dont have to worry about positioning.
---
This is why levelling as Backstab dagger rogue is so frustrating.
---
Ambush dagger might be great at start of levelling but once you get higher lvl and mobs starts being tougher you cant one shot them anymore.
---
Even though its logic to recommend you using swords like you say and switch, i still cant help to think you will lose some valuable experience not levelling as the build you want to play at endgame.
---
But i guess thats just me, im going to level with daggers.
---
Max utility. They can heal while doing white hits, unlike Druid. And probably do more damage than a priest.
---
Leveling is a small part of the journey if you intend to play for a long time.
---
Former lock player here (though pretty casual). I actually liked this. Summoning others is not hurting me. If I wasn't a lock I would probably also have to walk to the entrance. We're the only class that can help others by making them not have to walk to the entrance. That's quite an honour.
---
(And my DPS sucked, so I was happy with every utility I could make useful to get re-invited into groups ha)
---
If the other people in the group are being douchy. Well, at lower levels we could always say "oh haven't got the spell yet, too expensive atm" and make them walk anyways &lt;3
---
And also for whatever reason blizard almost never does the merges.
---
Is it the best? Yes.
---
Is it mandatory? No, you can get yourself a Robes of the Exalted and it will do the job just fine.
---
Was planning on rolling a warlock in classic was just wondering how well they fare against melee classes like rogue and warrior in pvp? Do you just get destroyed or can they fend for themselves?
---
Actually a legit point. Wonder if Blizzard changes it so you get the title with the other rewards.
---
Rolle NE female and dance on ironforge mailbox.
---
Deciding between orc hunter or orc shaman. 
---
Shaman was my OG vanilla toon in 2004 so it has a special place in my heart, even if I did heal as 30 enhance 21 resto wearing random mail I thought was good because it was blue. 
---
Hunters I have extensive experience on private servers with and do enjoy, but find it infuriating when I get counter engineered and stomped due to dead zone. 
---
I’d be looking at 30/0/21 ele / resto to PvP and raid with my friends.
---
Friends are going warlock and warrior so I’d help my warrior friend with heals Wf totem. I’d help the warlock very little as either but he’d help me a fair bit as a shaman due to x2 wipe prevention, health stones, different gear etc. 
---
I’m leaning shaman for easy 5 man gearing. 
---
Thoughts!?
---
I'm fine with both : nerfed or not. Since they'll both bring #Change in some way. 
---
Nerfed : not authentic. Not Nerfed :  too much players will use this to generate golds, it's like 30% in vanilla versus 90% in Classic so it'll affect golds value
---
I actually heard the title is in the game but it gets overwritten by all the pvp titles. So theoretically if you never got an HK you could have Scarab Lord as a title.
---
I want to play either warrior or mage, love both classes. I'm just afraid of it, since the majority of people will also play warr/mage since it's 2 of the most popular classes. 
---
If I play either of the classes, will there be a lot of competition? Should I be afraid? Or am I overthinking?
---
As well, planning on rolling mining/skinning in either case, solemnly for the money making. Is that dumb to not have a real profession since lvl 10? 
---
Thanks!
---
Can't decide Horde or Alliance. Was hoping to find some friends before launch to aid me in this decision. If I'm Horde I'll be Undead, if Alliance then Human. I can't decide between Priest or Rogue. I played both during original Vanilla and TBC and had a blast. I like healing but I'm edging toward Rogue because I enjoy the DPS side of things too and Priest is kinda pigeonholed into a healer only role in PvE which will be my main focus..
---
I like farming from lvl 55-60. It is boring AF and 5-10% slower but i like it for some weird reason. Get an addon that tracks the value of vendor trash a mob drops(like mobinfo) and just kill stuff all around. 
---
I am not going to give up my spot but you can have 1k G when you ding 60 if you do it right. Done this both as a druid and a hunter with below 6days played to 60.
---
if you want to pvp with a 1hander and shield you should probably go  prot/holy with spell damage gear and heavy focus on on-hit reckoning bombs. (if you go like 20/31/0 or 21/30/0 or 25/26/0 you can tank 5mans, raid/dungeon heal, aoe farm and pvp in the same spec
---
The gurubashi chest part is so accurate lol.
---
I agree, but If they nerf this I feel like Trib and mabye Maura princess farm would also get the same treatment. Or whatcha think?
---
TLDR
---
Maybe that's the case on Private servers but the title did not exist in Vanilla.
---
The title itself was added in 2.0.
---
For the Horde!
---
Imagine not having stealth or kick key bound as a rogue, yikes.
---
It will highly depend on the pet you will have when encountering them and the spec you’ll have (SOul link spec brings you the highest win rate imho). You’re going to have a hard time against warrior, as they are basically going to be immune to you fears/seduce under death wish/ berserker rage.
---
Undead rogue will also be difficult to kill but you still can manage to kill them with the line of dot you put on them... but you might also be dead
---
Or, you know, just use the good private servers... More pop than live ever had, and the content scripting nowadays is the same as vanilla. I'm currently playing on Tauri (MoP) and Netherwing (TBC), both feel like playing live, both have 1,500+ players at any one time. For reference, live servers were capped at \~2,000 IIRC, and very rarely had a queue to get in, so the population was probably around the 1,500 mark again.
---
Amazing reply. Totally forgot ProtHoly! Thanks for the info. I'll do some more research!
---
People dont realize this, aswell as boss armor factor among other things are basically zero on private servers making already strong classes like Rogue and Warriors even more so.
---
This is awesome, forgot about ProtHoly completely!
---
Their can‘t be enough warriors though. Tanks are highly in demand in general, solely getting loot in raids for furys could be a little problem cuz there is a lot of competition.
---
As a mage there won‘t be an issue because they are very popular in general. Their great CC skills, high damage, conjuring water/food, portals etc. are highly appreciated in every group.
---
I'm planning on rolling horde so I won't have to deal with will of the forsaken, but is there no way to kite warriors? If I stay in their "dead zone"? What kind of utility do locks have?
---
"Légolàs"
---
Isnt Gearscore totally bullshit in vanilla though? Like that friggin cancer epidemic that came with that addon in the first place.
---
stvietnam!
---
I hope that, if classic succeed you'll able to rename all of them "Classic" ! :)
---
In terms of crafted gear LW is very strong for hunters with the devilsaur set. Although it might be hard to farm the leather since the competition is very high.
---
Here’s the thing, when I’m tanking, if I want to roll on some DPS gear (Mask of the Unforgiven, Dal’Rend swords) I won’t want a Rogue. Most of the time I don’t mind, because we’re not always competing on loot, but there are times.
---
That's cool.  They will have a few extra months of farming MC then.  Enjoy haha
---
Would devilsaur beat out tier 1? I was thinking about that but I’ve never played a hunter so wasn’t sure
---
yeah kiting is a legit strat as a warlock, especially if you're affliction with imp. curse of exhaustion. Void walker saccing is very important vs warriors and rogues, it allows you to get casts off without pushback (this is where fel domination from demo comes in handy). Humans Locks can actually get some crazy stealth detection, Orc Locks can sometimes resist stuns more than others which makes them handy against rogues.
---
Just rolling on a random high pop server and finding people there should work.
---
Even on private servers it’s very good money so it will be even better in Classic.
---
When the "find old friends" Google Sheet was converted to a website with a shop (VanillaFriends), we spoke with the people running VanillaFriends throughout the process. We agreed that because a shop/donation link was on their main page, we didn't want to promote it as a major resource anymore, but we *do* have it linked in our Wiki as a compromise, and the people running it are allowed to repost the link as a separate post about once a month.
---
Lol 2.3.4. Kind of proves that these are all fake shortcuts.
---
Thanks
---
For a casual guild, as you level and do dungeons just make friends. You will be invited before you know it.
---
You sound a bit more hardcore though, so I’d keep an eye on this forum and any other wow forums, probably on their main site. Any guilds that you have to fill out a form to apply will be a really good fit for you :)
---
Shhh, don't leak the secret.
---
with imp sap you have the 90% chance to remain stealthed but... it doesnt matter anyway if the sap lasts long enough for you to restealth naturally
---
Good players will exploit your deadzone as a Hunter, you have to position yourself really far back and try to disengage as the fight comes closer to you.
---
If you are keen to heal and don't mind the totem gameplay then Shamans are fun, also 30/0/21 is pretty fun in PvP.
---
&gt; For example horde get 4 2h quest rewards for 40-60 bracket, alliance get 1
---
That’s not really accurate. Alliance get a 2hander for finishing SM. Horde don’t. And, it’s speed is much slower than Ravager, making it WAY better.
---
Your list is a bit off.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Mining
---
I don't recall the yellow green grey values though. I tried finding them I knows its out there somewhere.
---
Anyway I very much recommend abusing incendite or lesser bloodstone.
---
Do I have any options if they catch me off guard with the wrong pet? If I'm with a VW should I just instantly sacc it?
---
We should there is a version for Vanilla private servers currently with the added AFK dancing character and everything.

T1 is better, but getting that many pieces of tier takes time. 
---
I would honestly still recommend engi, it's a really fun profession. As for 2nd I like skinning as a hunter. Most of the crafting professions really don't do much for you.
---
The rexxar campaign in frozen throne was their little stepping stone.
---
If you don't wanna play Heals then you won't go wrong with a Rogue, I played it in Vanilla and had a blast. There is also the possibility of being your guilds only Shadow Priest if it floats your boat, but I'd say Rogues are way more fun rotation-wise in PvE anyway.
---
Still pales in comparison to mage aoe in brd No?
---
You go soullink and just facetank the warriors.
---
If I counted correctly, it's 62x sap. That means
---
0.9^62 = 0.00146
---
So there is a ~0.15% chance of that meme happening
---
I always regret when I pick a class based on what other people are playing. Play what you legitimately enjoy, it's a game after all.
---
Quick question as i have never played classic but other expansions :
---
are the buff  as important as of today runes and vantus glyphs in order to clean the raid? 
---
i mean is the raid DOABLE without all those buffs and maybe 4-5 buffs like the flask, food and drink only?
---
Wouldnt be surprised if these neckbeards theory-crafting the fastest way to level since 2006, actually find a way to bend time and space so they can be level 60 within one hour.
---
Nah. Multiple mock shortcuts of the same client. If only we could all be sophisticated like OP.
---
If you care about how you're going to look at various stages of progression (in BiS gear):
---
Rogue: [https://i.imgur.com/KwgFWAa.png](https://i.imgur.com/KwgFWAa.png)
---
Warlock: [https://i.imgur.com/988fKCs.png](https://i.imgur.com/988fKCs.png)
---
Credit to Blubbstrahl for the above
---
I'm the guild master of a raiding guild (EU) and we get all of our members through advertising on the internet. The same thing applies for every other guild at the moment. I'm sure recruitment will experience a boost when the game drops too though.
---
Haha, that's great.
---
Rogue or warrior? Decisions decisions
---
The classic druid discord server has TONS if resources for this, specs included. For example, the generally accepted best flag carrier spec is 8/12/31 as it's the most survivability you can get in one build.
---
People change and so do their interests. I have been playing on PS's for more than a year and absolutely loving it. These anecdotal experiences I don't think provide any new insight - your interest into something 10 years later might have changed, or it might have remained. The game is still exactly the game it was (that's the whole point of it after all).
---
Basically, they will have more mobility than you (harmstring is going to drastically remove your way to run away). Then, they have 3 utilities : charge (but must be out of combat) intercept and fear.
---
Fear can allow them to catch up, if your are not that far but still out of reach.
---
Charge will be used once, at best.
---
Intervene will provide the ability to catch up, stun you and harmstring you and therefore stay close to you. 
---
Consider your fear not useful against a warrior, so the only other disengage you will have is going to be mortal coil.
---
So a typical scenario (if we consider fear useless) will be:
---
Charge, harmstring
---
Mortal Coil, dot, dot, dot
---
Intercept
---
Harmstring, mortal strike
---
And then it’s a dps race
---
If the fight last more than 40 seconds -berserker rage/death wish/berserker rage- (it’s not going to happen), your fear will be useful.
---
Was thinking of going priest (healer) but i still need to find the right profession combo to make some gold for the level 40 mount asap... 
---
Was thinking of Skinning/Herbalism. Then drop skinning for alchemy?
---
Need Advice.
---
Also, never played a priest in classic, hows the leveling?
---
If you don't have Fel Domination + Master Summoner you've got a fat chance of summoning another pet during a fight. If you do you can of course sac your VW and then fel dom resum a succubus for extra CC. Or if you have a different pet out you can resum a VW then sac it.
---
is suggest trying both if possible at 60
---
they are about as different as dps gets
---
i recently tried warriors and rogues and i just dont think melee is for me i enjoy that caster playstyle.
---
if you enjoy melee id go the rogue
---
 I don't care too much about the looks, but I think Rogues sets look a bit better
---
If I go Rogue it will be Orc and if it's Warlock it will be Undead.
---
Skinning tailor. Loot everything you can and sell it. You should have enough around 40
---
Yup I’ll be slamming Guayaki Yerba mate
---
Yes, it's a p server problem. With right click report those are muted instantly.
---
I'm guessing the people who have to schedule months in advance aren't able to reschedule it after that time is up.
---
Also level in shadow, you will be able to heal everything till the 50s the  respec to holy 53+ :)
---
Would be cool if the content phases lasted for a while, so you actually got to play a bit with full tier 1 instead of having the opportunity to get 5 pieces only to replace them right away.
---
I beg to Shadow priest you in pvp tiers
---
Is Troll the best horde priest? I was think of Undead but does the racial on horde side matter that much?
---
Do you want the ability to gank?
---
Are you comfortable with having to stance dance?
---
Do you want to the ability to tank?
---
Do you like Plate or Leather?
---
In PvP, would you rather be paired up with a healer or solo? Warriors are not very powerful without a healer whereas Rogues can hold their own.

Back then, a handful of friends and I created our guild and we formed an alliance with other guilds for raiding and made more and more friends and grew that way. I was guild and raid leader until leaving the game at the end of WotLK. This time, I won't have any of that shit. It's basically an unpaid full-time job with organizing raids 4-5 times a week. I'll leave the management to ambitious people other than myself this time.
---
In Classic, you met like minded-people during leveling as well as after reaching 60. You see can easily distinguish someone motivated from someone just doing "whatever". Almost all my rogue colleagues I met when grouping up for double-instance stealth farms, while running ubrs, seeing how they were doing, not just afking but trying to out-dps each other in a healthy competition, even when it didn't matter. A player playing a dps class will always care. 
---
Or you meet this one tank, who just doesn't half-ass his shit, or the healer who smashes his keyboard to heal like fighting for his life in a whack-a-mole contest.
---
When others are doing fine and you are just always a bit better, raiding guilds notice you, regardless of class. I would say at the beginning, most of it will happen on the server, because 2/3 of forum applications are not going to be desirable, when they have to perform ingame.
---
Also keep in mind that the biggest challenge will be finding 40x lvl 60 players in the beginning, which is also a big chance.
---
I played Rogue and Priest when I first started playing back in Burning Crusade but can't decide what to play for Classic. I had a lot of fun in the short time I played Rogue but I feel like rogues are going to be the most played class in Classic. 
---
I did mostly healing on my Priest in BC-MoP so I'd like to try shadow if I roll a Priest this time. Is shadow viable or are Priests mainly forced into healing specs for raiding/PvP?
---
Also, should i sell the leathers to the vendors or AH? I always used the AH but lately ive been reading its better to sell light and medium to vendors...
---
Also, how can tailoring be profitable before 60?
---
He said "in vanilla" so I didn't want to leave Dire Maul out :p Obviously it will be a little different before DM comes out.
---
If your raid diligently waits for rogues to disarm before rushing through it can be quick. When pulling all the orc warlock-like mobs in the room you then sapper charge with 20 people in raid on 1st floor and do the same before broodlord.
---
The list is not intended to be all inclusive, so yeah I skipped a few unique nodes.
---
If you're interested in Healing in end game anyway, then Druids are probably better. You'll just put yourself in Heart of the Wild spec (0/30/21), which will allow you to tank 5 mans and to farm mobs off easily when you'll need to (no other healer has it as easy as Druids in that regard), as you'll have Feral DPS. Your healing won't be very good but that's not important, as you're expected to heal worse than pure healers anyway. Raids will need to take Druids anyway for gearing reasons, as taking to many people of a single class in a raid makes everybody getless class related loot, which also makes people unhappy.
---
You'll have better access to raid gear than with a Shaman (as Druids are really rare, especially on Horde side, more so than Shamans, so you won't compete much against other players). The solo PvP will be alright, as you'll be able to Insect Swarm/Moonfire Dot your enemies down with good heals and good Bear survivability / decent Cat DPS against Cloth/Leather targets, more so than Healing Shamans. In group PvP however Shamans are way, way better in most situations, as they have a dispell and faster heals. But sometimes Druid mobility might be more useful, even for healing, and not onyl as a flag carrier.
---
Outside of that, Druids have it level easier and faster, can fill any role in Dungeons, can run away from almost any fight in WPvP, have cool utility spells like beast CC/Aquatic Form/Stealth to avoid ganking, but they will also need more Gear sets than Shamans at high level if you want to try out every spec, as Feral DPS/Feral Tank/ Healer/ Balance DPS have all different gearing requirements. If you don't care about Balance and will mostly Heal/Tank/Farm it's not that different from Shamans though, as they too have several different sets required. If you want to top Healing/Damage meters in PvE or PvP, don't count on it with a Druid though (but keep in mind nobody will expect that from you either). With a Shaman it would be easier.
---
Both racials are good, the only problem with Devouring Plague is that it can be dispeled and is on a long cooldown. Shadowguard is also good since it can proc Blackout stuns to melee hitting you.
---
I personally think Troll if you're going to play a Healer w/ blackout and Undead if you want to play Shadow.
---
Yeah. I never like being amongst the majority when it comes to classes or races in video games, for whatever reason. I like to stand out a little bit. Ego, I suppose.
---
My idea. Is to type in general chat or make friends along the way and then. Get this. Get into the guild they are in. Crazy plan I know.
---
Any estimate on gold/hour as hunter?
---
It does not. Even from a min/max standpoint the difference is negligble, so just go with whichever faction appeals more to you.
---
I searched the subreddit for "guild" so this didn't come up. Thanks!
---
Shadow is very viable in PvP. In PvE there will be room for only one Shadow Priest in a raid. This is because your DPS is not the greatest and you only need one Shadow Priest to apply the Shadow Weaving debuff for Warlocks to get harder hitting Shadowbolts.
---
Serious question from someone OOTL: What happens after Naxx? Does the game stay the same content-wise until the populations drop, or will they start implementing era-appropriate updates like Jagex did with old-school RuneScape?
---
Troll racial is best for PvE. Undead racial is best for PvP.
---
Depends on your preference.
---
Used the looking for group treat here on reddit and found a guild around 4 months ago. Been chitchatting and theorizing vanilla for months with these guys now and it already feels like a new "home".
---
I work 12a-8a Thursday and Friday nights and 8p-8a Saturday and Sunday nights. Central time.
---
I do work mostly alone at night so I could play while I work but if things start breaking I would have to stop and call oncall techs.
---
I hope I am able to find a guild that raids my weird hours and needs a holy paladin.
---
If I invite a rogue to my group depends on two factors:  
---
First, group composition, if you'd put us at too much melee I'd try to find someone else. However, vanilla isn't as melee-unfriendly as eg tbc so also depends on the dungeon we're running.  
---
Second, the first impression I get from you. If you have a super edgy name and are a ud/gnome you drop way down on the list. Your guild membership also factors into this.
---
&gt; i mean is the raid DOABLE without all those buffs and maybe 4-5 buffs like the flask, food and drink only?
---
Yes. I was in an endgame raid guild during BWL through Naxx, we were fighting for server firsts and maybe top 200 EU/World? Can't remember the specifics.
---
Anyhow. We rarely buffed up like this, perhaps if you got the boss to &lt;5% a few times and needed some extra DPS. 
---
That said, our guild had shitloads of money. We farmed MC/BWL and later AQ for money runs. People would spend thousands on gear, and that money went primarily to supplying flasks/pots/food for the entire guild. Even most of our repair/respec costs were covered, especially for tanks.
---
They're both good for PvP, but against a competent healer your DP will get dispelled, whereas shadowguard procs blackout against melee.
---
What's it like to play warrior? Is it very frustrating to gear up and get resources? 
---
I am considering warrior because I like tanking and it is a high impact role which I'm a fan of; but the horror stories of difficult levelling and high expenses scares me. 
---
Would be Dwarf Warrior if it makes a difference.
---
Best options imho are either eng/mining or herb/alch.
---
Eng means making your own thorium arrows and potentially seaforium charges for soloing trib runs if that's a thing, AND junper cables for a potential res!
---
Alch means transmutes but also making your own mongoose pots and element protection pots meaning you'll be very self-reliant.
---
Skinning/LW isn't worth it, you only want devilsaur and that's only until you get T1 gloves.
---
Dad of 2. Can play 1-2 hours/day. Want to do as much as I can, get into groups easy and pvp casually.
---
Hunter? Mage? Or?
---
I was. It was my alt (main Warlock) but with decent gear it was great. DPS was a bit shy of DW Arms, but I had a ton more fun with it.
---
T1 gloves singlehandedly render dwvilsaur obsolete for hunters so it's basically all down to how fast you get those. Or if you find other +hit pieces you could break the set with the rank 7 pvp gear for example.
---
Forgot about making ammo as engineer!
---
What do you think costs more, ammo or mongoose pots?
---
The difficulty is relative. Like yeah, you have a harder time leveling but it will only be a difference of maybe a day or two game-time wise. If you play optimally it's not that bad, you just won't be able to do multi pulls without your cooldowns. If you practice your hamstring-rend-swingtimer kiting you'll be fine. I also recommend leveling Arms, a lot of people recommend Fury until 40 but they make that suggestion based of a private server /sit crit bug that won't be available come classic.
---
Mages get into groups pretty easily. They have good DPS, provide food/water and good CC vs humanoids.
---
Thanks for the tip! I'll check him out
---
My guess is 3 months per phase (depending on aq war effort is where this will vary depending on server)
---
Or we stick to #nochanges and play the game like it was in 2004-2006.
---
In final fantasy XIV you can only use flying mounts in certain areas. For example you can still not fly in any of the zones from the base game. A good solution I think would be to implement something similar, no flying anywhere that isn't designed around it.
---
Hej, jag bor i Stockholm och har inget emot en intervju, tycker att ämnet låter spännande. Hör gärna av dig så bestämmer vi något!
---
It doesnt matter if you get killed. Its that you get more honor kills and honor than others. And that requires time (and understanding where you want to be at certain times). People are NOT going to try rank solo, more likely its 5 man partys or something like that.
---
Man, you guys really are looking forward to the shitshow that is WoW PvP judging by all these giddy posts.
---
I mean if that's your thing, knock yourself out. It's just...weird. We are talking about the same WoW "PvP" here, right? What is the appeal there?
---
Or did all the Vanilla-PS edgelords move over to this sub? :p
---
I'd love to know too but to avoid ending up on a server being overrun by people who speak a language I can't understand.
---
World buffs, maybe ?
---
I'm not a dickhead for saying I dont want you to change game mechanics because I feel like it will ruin a portion of the game for me. Southside vs tauren mill relies heavily on those game mechanics.
---
Honestly, you could find a guild who would be willing to take you as a backup player. But, you'd be on the bench at the start of raids, and would only be pulled in when a player doesn't need gear on a boss. It's not optimal for you, or the guild, but that's pretty much the only way you're gonna be raiding outside of PUGs.
---
It averages at around 80-100g. Sometimes more if you're lucky with books dropping. It depends on how good you are at it really. Killing Gordok himself is actually the easy part. Getting to Gordok may take a few tries before you pull it off successfully. The better you get at it the faster you can speed-run it which equals more gold.
---
If we didnt have hard "hs must be in kargath" rule i always had HS at gromgol. Made moving around so much easier.
---
Just find one of the bigger guilds who run double raid teams(albeit pretty casually). If you’re a dps/offheal you can usually grab a spot when you have the time to raid since those raids often put the last 5-10 people.
---
Mages can’t aoe in BRD due to 2 types of mobs. One Nets you in place and the other one in the arena heals I think
---
Indeed, since the mounts are always in the game files it’s just a matter of adjusting which items(mounts) the mount vendors sell. It’d take longer to write a forum post about it than to actually do it.
---
I rather have everything mixed up. But maybe at the LFG treat there are some swedish only guilds? Idk.
---
I'd like to play on a server with as few Swedes as possible, so i'm all for this coordination.
---
"Invite what"
---
"what?"
---
"Invite the mage, what"
---
"the mage what?"
---
I can already see the confusion.
---
Powerleveling in Vanilla must hurt... it is agsinst the concept of vanilla. Btw. the first raids suck in comparison to the leveling phase. Take your time and enjoy the trip to 60.
---
I am french and there are gonna be french servers, right ?
---
Naxx is wotlk. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm but good sarcasm doesn't need indication, only context. Here's an example: I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.
---
I don't know any people. 
---
Have I been playing MMOs wrong this whole time?
---
Because they are stuck in 2005 and not aware of the current meta most likely.
---
If you get to 60 within a decent timeframe, I have no doubts you'll be recruited or asked, merely on your ability to reach 60 early on if you're not in a guild. That's how my tbc and wrath adventures started.
---
Might not be doable as the mobs that Mages farm on pservers are supposed to have a Net ability on official servers.
---
I don't know why are you getting downvoted. But for example you can stay in one zone (Barrens) from what lvl 10 up until lvl 30. And I love Barrens. So only heaven for me.
---
This meme deserves more attention it’s Fucking gold.
---
It’s gonna be fun, hopefully I don’t short straw and end up on a fucking tuga server again. Portugal; I love you but learn English or at a bare fucking minimum, don’t expect everyone on planet earth to know Portuguese
---
Some rank solo. I know a few who hit field marshal solo. Even if they don’t, the situations will be random which group has more players, etc. Things like hour long cooldowns can decide the whole thing where in places like wsg, you can use them to win a fight but the other team will rez shortly. Not true in the world. Just saying you’re adding a ton of variables with this.
---
What is implied with the loot reconfigurations at p5?
---
I’ve given up trying to predict what classic demographics will look like. 
---
Will it mirror private server numbers? Probably not.
---
Is the reddit survey an accurate predictive tool? Not sure.. 10k responses is a pretty good sample size, but we don’t represent the majority of people who will play classic. Filtering the survey results for the 30% who haven’t played on a private server changes the class balance slightly. Maybe this is a more accurate projection?
---
Is it worth considering class population in retail? As an example, over the last few expansions rogue has become one of the least populated classes. Perhaps this archetype is no longer “in vogue”? The same “cultural popularity” could be used to explain away low hunter numbers in reddit survey results perhaps... or are people here aware of hunters end-game scaling woes &amp; staying away for that reason? 
---
And of course.. people answering surveys won’t be the majority of classic players. Who knows what the masses will play... but then again, will they stick it out to 60 - or simply be around for a month or two and move on/return to retail? In which case, these surveys are an accurate representation of life at 60.
---
Tl;dr - play whatever you want &amp; do what it takes to stand out in the crowd
---
The whelplings. He’s talking about the whelplings. Be prepared for the grind of your life if you’re gonna do this tho.
---
gnome engineering
---
tauren herb?
---
also as a side question what benefit do those give?
---
Boring as fuck, but an insane farming spot.  
---
There were a few nerfs on pservers which made it a little bit more difficult to do, however it was still worth.  
---
The other difference in pservers is the /camp command which ports you at the entrace of the dungeon you're in. We're not sure if this will be in classic.  
---
If you have to die at the end and corpse run from Thorium Point to BRD, you can expect between 35 to 40 raw gold per hour. Not counting the potions, rubys, and the occasional Gut Ripper you put on the AH after your session.  
---
Also, the more gear you get the easier it gets. 3 Piece night slayer lowers your vanish cd by 30 seconds, which makes dying even less likely.  
---
Also also, if you manage to get enough gear you can solo 2 more bosses to add to your gold per hour.  
---
* Pyromancer Loregrain for the fiery weapon formula.  
---
* The Barman you sell your junk to at the end who sometimes drops the Legendary Barman Shanker, to be vendored, as we will most likely have weapon speed normalized at launch and it wont be as good as it used to be.  
---
Another thing to keep in mind is the fact that one of the gold per hour sources was added in patch 1.12 - the rogue's diary which sells vendors for quite a lot.  
---
Even if the diary is not in game from the start this still remains the best gold farm you'll be able to do as a rogue.
---
AMEN
---
it will depend a bit too on if the rogues diary item will be available or not since that single item vendors for almost 50s.   it'll still be good regardless though. I'm not sure how it compares with other farms though.
---
can't a guy just have a question without being so worried? jesus christ some of you are really salty, why? we are going home again
---
I would add that armor is up there with stam/int as a priority too.
---
&gt; I don't mind world PVP if it's SOMEWHAT fair, but 3-4 level ?? hunting down a trio of level 35~ is just pathetic.
---
It is. It'll make me rage. But it's a better game for it.
---
To me, PVE feels less like an MMORPG. Something i've been missing in recent WoW expansions. Adding that sense of getting caught up in world PVP is what makes a world come alive.
---
Yeah mate who has time for 1 hour mc or 1.5h bwl.
---
Cool cool :)
---
Have you considered that maybe the yellow/green/grey values of the node ate shared by those of smelting that ore? If so, you can look them up: https://classicdb.ch/?item=3575#created-by

**Looking for a Guild**
---
* Region : EU
---
* Server Type : PVE
---
* Faction : Horde
---
* Aim : PVE (Semi Hardcore) Pref 2 days/Week
---
**About Me**
---
Really exited about this 'new' adventre, I'm trying to find a guild that will allow me to taste the Horde side of this conflict. 
---
My main focus in Wow was always PVE (explained by my realm type choise) be it dungeons, raids or brainless farming to relax after a tough day at work.
---
A bit about my WoW in game history:
---
I started playing the month of the vanilla release and continued since then up to BFA, with a break in the middle when i skipped the PandaLand exp.
---
In Vanilla my guild sadly never cleaned anything past mid AQ40 (Something i want to change this time :D ) 
---
At the end the old school experience was more for my taste this is why i ended up comming back to Pservers (Vanilla/BC/WotLK) 
---
Those times brought various raiding expériences from Casual to Extreme (4d/w)
---
What I mean by semi HC is a guild with some PVE ambition, planning and structure that give enough time for IRL. I have Nothing against giving my all 2evenings a week / crunsh some Numbers and get my gear ready. On the other side i hope the guild will give me some slack other evenings and the members will know how to chill outside of the raiding environement.  
---
**My Char**
---
Orc - Warrior
---
DPS in raid (But i do enjoy dungeon tanking from time to time)
---
Mining / Blacksmith *Armorsmith*
---
You can contact me through discord : Maara#9126
---
Cheers and see you maybe IG !
---
Thats a example thats very far from the truth.
---
Even if you have 1-5 dwarfs in raid, you have to communicate whos fearwarding who and when, rotate those CD's. Some warrior skills bugs out FW in private servers, so you need to refresh them. And TELL the tank if no fearward are available so he knows to stance dance. 
---
On boss like magdamar, fearwards are just basically small dps / hps increase, and doesnt really matter to the kill at all. Ony and nefarius it does matter.
---
I personally have no issue with the points you are bringing up, but at the same time I don’t think you’re wrong at all either so. 
---
Sure the time investment required to be a hardcore raider or high rank pvper might  be too much for me but the fact that they exist &amp; that the grind is there for the people who can take on the challenge is one of those things that make the game even more awesome. It’s one of those in-game goals/dreams that seem out of reach,  but are cool/fun to think about &amp; adds to the feel of the game if you understand where I’m coming from.
---
I had a great time just playing on pservers &amp; doing so quite casually with the goal of pre-raid bis. Coming from someone who played wow for the first time in late BC &amp; started ”actually playing” in Wotlk, I thought the pserver vanilla experience were far better than the retail experience has been since basically forever...(nah but seriously, the enjoyment I got out of the pserver isn’t something I’ve had from wow since like 08 or something). 
---
I do believe that rose colored glasses plays a part but based on my own experience as well as bunch of other friends who didn’t start in Vanilla, the nostalgia part of it all isn’t that big of a deal, it’s just a great game in all honesty. 
---
Your point about people growing tired of the game by the end of vanilla is understandable. I mean with barely any new content for a while &amp; the playerbase being aware of TBC being on the way as well as Blizzard themselves focusing on the expansion mostly, it’s not that strange that people were bored.
---
I mean as soon as BC was released, the game waas growing as fast as ever again.
---
This was more meant as a discussion, I’m not really disagreeing with anything you said.
---
(My english might not be entirely on point, so please do excuse any errors here &amp; there haha)
---
I was NE priest in vanilla, my raiding guild never ever commented on my racials. And we also only had 1 Dwarf priest.
---
Its all about finding the right guild, if i came across a guild that only accepted dwarf priests i already know it isnt gonna be a guild for me. 
---
GL brother *Shadowmelds away*
---
Hey guys. I stumbled upon this thread because I am german but i wont play on german servers. We are an international guild moving completely over to EU english speaking servers and we will choose one as soon as we get the names. But we got so many different nationalities in our guild that I thought IF you like you can join our discord now. We got around 1k people on it from all parts of Europe and also alot of skandinavians and localized channels for each BIG language in europe such as EN, GER, FR, ESP and skandinavian channels and will add more later. Maybe we can all move to one server. So that  we will be a big community from all parts of Europe but at least all in one spot :D  if youd like to join click this one here: [https://discord.gg/u2Ztehw](https://discord.gg/u2Ztehw)  cheers :)
---
If you assume that every player replace 10 pieces of gear per tier on average each phase that has 40 man raids in it would have to be at least 6 months long in order for you to be ready for the next raid, and that's if not a single piece of loot goes to waste.
---
So that would mean that phase 1-2 would last 6 months, phase 3-4 would last 6 months, phase 5 would last six months and phase 6 would last 6 months for a grand total of 2 years.
---
Ull see a lot of "reserved" runs
---
For 3 months straight.
---
I hope so, it was the Grim Batol realm for Portuguese and Nordic people at Vanilla. Would hate to play a month in a server just to find out my people were on another or the server went empty after the tourists.
---
Have Blizzard mentioned anything about free transfers in the firsts phases?
---
&gt;People like TipsOut on YouTube seem to have pretty reasonable guesses
---
Here you can see it in 3 seconds and dont have to watch a 10-15minute video saying what can be said in one picture.
---
" if tailoring provides a BiS item for mages the way it does for priest with Truefaith Vestments? "
---
Yes sir, Robe of the Archmage. If you plan to min-max I'd suggest once you get the robes, ditch tailoring and pick up Engi+gathering profession of your choice. People would argue "but Bloodvine is BiS later, you'll want tailoring for the bonus". It isn't if you're actively raiding BWL and are up to par with items in there.
---
I'm looking forward to the game being slow paced enough that I actually have time to sking during instances etc.
---
Psst, hey buddy, all we need is each other anyway.
---
My friend is going to roll a resto Shaman. Any suggestions for a good PvP combo?
---
I'm Portuguese and yes it's true. We know how to speak English in general but must of us were just spamming kids. People have grown up lets see if it shows in the chat.
---
ANAL  Thunderfury
---
This has been asnwered a million times. Look up a video or something regarding rogue leveling and weapon progression.  
---
Generally you want to go combat while leveling and assassination/subt in pvp. Either 21/3/27 hemo, 21/8/22 daggers, 16/12/23 daggers with imp sprint over cold blood.
---
And yet, the people who spend most times still are going to be at top.
---
not only melee. it procs of ranged attacks and spells too.
---
I'm Swedish and I want to play with people from different countries and talk English.
---
&gt;No time to gear and also 35 - 40 people got to do this.
---
People kill Rag in greens &amp; dungeon blues + consumables - there are even some lvl 30ish quest rewards that are decent pre-raid gear for certain classes. If you know all of the mechanics &amp; boss strats, it makes things less dependent on gear. There will be guilds that have all of this incorporated into their strategy and work as a team to get to 60 faster than anyone else &amp; decently geared. Seven days is pushing it but I'm certain that people will be doing it.
---
&gt; Have Blizzard mentioned anything about free transfers in the firsts phases?
---
They have not. But I would imagine that they would offer free transfers off of overpopulated and underpopulated realms.
---
If you want 100% asap then I would recommend farming black lotus, plagueblooms (for mongoose elixir) and devilsaur leather.
---
https://youtu.be/OJkaD3pmAs4
---
I love how the tower looks like its from 2040 compared to everything else, here i was rocking some generic HP.
---
&gt;but due to rerolling and being indecisive (and 14), never reached 60
---
Are you me?
---
Warrior is the obvious combo, Windfury totem is love. Rogues also benefit from it. But just about any DPS works well with a Healer. Shamans have trouble getting away from people on top of them so if you pick a Mage, Lock or Hunter you'll be able to CC Melee that are wailing on your pal which will buy him precious time healing.
---
DELET THIS
---
I did a pvp server once. I played with a level of ethics. I didn’t kill anyone on the other faction if I didn’t get any honor. If everyone played like that it would be more enjoyable but having high level people take you out constantly or camping areas got to me.
---
Simply, there’s the few that have to ruin it. But I completely agree with you.
---
Oh shit ur right fam what am i doin lol
---
oh really, well damn it is quite powerful then.
---
The battle for azeroth i've been waiting for.
---
PI is definitely not mandatory unless you're playing in premade bgs, or with a really good caster friend, and in phase 1 obviously there will be no real PvP going on, it is used in PvE when you're farming raids every week and just need the damage rather than more healing (use on a Mage as they have threat reduction and Warlocks do not).
---
During phase one a safer healing focused build would be better
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsm0oZfhtcc0Vx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsm0oZfhtcc0Vx) 
---
I'd use this spec for PvE and casual PvP until BWL, ZG, MC and Ony are on farm, then switch to PI for more damage and for premade PvP
---
As for Spell Warding, no way, Heal and Greater Heal are your most used healing spells in PvP and PvE, casters will be trying to CC you rather than burst you down, because realistically they can't kill you unless a Warrior is on top of you with MS
---
Decisions. Im sick of it.
---
Im a main druid at retail since cata. Its my favourite class.
---
I love the utility, the kiting, the flag carrier role, the lore, the quests, the world pvp, etc. I like the playstyle. In hots I main lost vikings and abathur, so I really like being a pain in the ass.
---
But I miss one thing. I like killing people, fighting and being a 1v1 good. I know druids can do prety well in 1v1 due to the healing and kiting (Ill run HOTW spec in case I finally take druid), but I dont wanna be a 0 dmg class.  I dont need the oneshot burst or the 1# dps, but I want to be able to kill this f\*\*\*\* gnomes. Oh, and I hate pure healing (Im fine with the support role, like heal, stun, dps, heal, stun, dps). Also I can stand healing in raid for some pvp gear (but Id prefere to dps)
---
So pleas, help me guys. Those are my options:
---
Druid&gt;warlock/shaman&gt;rouge/shadowpriest&gt;hunter
---
Never: Pure healing, warrior, paladin, mage.
---
I like: Worldpvp (group but alone is my favourite), bgs, utility, being a pain in the ass, killing those aliance bois, being hard to beat.
---
If posible: Easy to find a spot in groups, cool visual spels.
---
Love you guys &lt;3
---
tl dr; I LOVE DRUID BUT I HATE HEALING PLEAS HELP ME
---
LOL
---
Tryna blow up my spot bro? The grind is hard enough as it is without having a bunch or filthy casuals stealing my mobs
---
Skinning/Herbing or Skinning/Mining while you level. You can sell your leather to vendors for extra gold and pocket the ore/herbing for a later profession or AH it.
---
Priests are pretty good while leveling, they almost never have to drink because of Spirit Tap and their reliance on wanding to do most of their damage, make sure you are picking up new wands every few levels. There are plenty of ways to choose your talents early on but usually people will get spirit tap and wand spec as soon as possible and then b-line to get Shadowform. Some people even respec at 40 to get Shadowform quicker. I've also seen certain builds revolving around Smite spamming early on, at least until you can respec at 40 to get SF.
---
I need some enlightenment.
---
If you play on a PVE server you can't get any type of pvp progression till phase 3?
---
I mean, you have the honor system but no bgs so how can you get honor? Duels?
---
&gt;couldn't bother
---
you wouldnt have gotten it anyways :)
---
I was in the 8th grade, and had a full playlist with these kind of songs! 
---
It was so badass!
---
The game isn't designed around faction wars. It never was and never will be. Deal with it and stop trying to establish that bullshit as fact.
---
You can run feral. If you learn to pkwershift people will take you to groups for your crit buff and you can off tank.
---
Yeah. And if you don't want to participate, you stand there and laugh at the desperate Hordies trying to annoy you into flagging.
---
Vanilla have it's shortcomings. The game got progressivly better as time went on up until midway through Wrath of the Lich king.  
---
Then the paradigm changed and the game started to get worse in the aspects that matter to the players in this sub.  
---
Vanilla have the longest and most epic journey of leveling. It has more "zones" that any expansion and the most diverse content. It has lots of hidden gems and unique experiences as well as the best chances of gettign to know the people on your server.
---
No expansion could ever give you that. And after the LFR and other "ease of life" changes, you simply had much fewer chances of organically getting to know the most important aspect of the game: i.e. the other players.  
---
So while Vanilla balance is a weird, class roles poorly implemented at times and had quite a lot of grind content compared to the "press 1 button to do all of the content in one weekend" of modern retail WoW, it had a charm and the possibility of the epic journey.  
---
The true "tragedy of the commons" for wow was the WoW team focusing on the players who never managed to get that epic journey in the older versions of the game. They were so eager to give everyone a ride, the ride got so uexciting and to streamlined that much fewer people had unique experiences along the way.
---
My advice to you is to Not play on a server with streamers/influencers. Not play on a elite/cutting edge server. and Not play in a Elite cutting edge guild.  
---
   
---
Play in the guild types that were the most common back then, the "casual one" where raiding might have taken a long time, but everyone were welcome. Don't go raiding with 40 man raids consisting of 12 warriors, 7 rogues, 7 mages, 3 Locks, 1 Druid, 2 hunters, 1-2 priests and the rest either resto shammies or holy paladins.  
---
Don't pick professions on "what will make the most gold", but rather "what would be fun for me?"  
---
Don't pick class/specc on "what is the very best"  (but do try to do the best you can in the specc you pick).  
---
Try to find others who are willing to do the same, to enjoy the game as it is, not as "the fastest way to break it".
---
Maybe because he wants to play classic. Just a guess.
---
Not forced but it will make your life 10x easier.
---
Do know that healing in classic feels more fun than in retail so there's that.
---
&gt; There a several, several guilds downing raids early-middle of the second week of pretty much every 'F R E S H' server that comes out.
---
These servers are often massively undertuned because the creators are basically just guessing what the actual stats were. We all know the tactics and early raids really aren't that difficult compared to their modern variant so it's likely that Rag will be downed within the first two months or even the first month.  But it takes AT LEAST a small week of **playtime** to get to 60 alone (the world record I believe was just under 5 days). And even hardened gamers need some sleep. And that's just reaching sixty, not counting the time it takes to gear up. There might be some really hardcore lone wolves doing a Method-style marathon where they play 16 hours/day and sleep the rest of it, but to get a raid roster of forty fully geared lvl 60s together in under two weeks and down Rag in your first reset (because the first week will be spent levelling/gearing so the second week is the earliest they can raid) is downright implausible. Private servers are not a good example.
---
People really overestimate the willingness of level 60s to travel across the continent just to try (and usually fail) to find the one rogue that's killing every lowbie leaving TM.
---
As a Druid you will certainly be a pain in the ass, you will also be pretty much unkillable in small skirmishes. Druids slowly chip away at the enemy rather than frontloading big damage like other classes. As a side not Druids are the preferred flag carrier in WSG so you have that going for you. In raids you can do quite well off tanking if you are dedicated enough. Feral DPS is quite low but if you are in a casual guild you might be able to squeeze in as Balance.
---
Please no! I want to keep my normal life!
---
That I'm fairly sure they aren't.
---
Even if you have an endless supply of ore, you wont be able to smelt your way from 1 to 300
---
And then what? The streamer group with 30k of Asmons viewers will wipe the floor with the guild and then ress him and continue as before within max 3 minutes.
---
I'm not gonna say your ideas are bad or that it's impossible to improve the game. What I am gonna say is that you either want Vanilla or you want something different. I want Vanilla.
---
I am properly torn.
---
Took a hunter to 60 in 2005, hitting 62 before quitting during TBC. I absolutely loved the range aspect of hunter, enjoyed the PVP immensely and really liked the utility and ability to level with relative ease. However, due to I suppose inexperience and general lack of knowledge my spec was a mess, my gear was all over the place and things like macros and rotations were a myth to me. (Yes, I was a clicker) I didn't really bother with professions either. Despite this, I still managed to complete MC with my guild and that was as far as I got. I also loved the lore with Dwarves, and hunters in particular. (I used guns as far on as I could, because pew pew)
---
I don't feel like I did the class (or the game) justice really and would love to approach classic with a slightly more methodical and educated frame of mind, take my time and actually appreciate the more intricate idiosyncrasies of the hunter class (read: not be a complete retard)
---
But. The big elephant in the room is the thought that I have already "done" a hunter and would be missing out if I didn't try other classes. I don't really have a desire to heal as I enjoy getting into the action. Paladin does the lore side for me very well but I am concerned I will get burnt out with the slow and tedious curve to 60. I also understand I would ultimately end up healing, too. 
---
Why is this so hard?
---
Also, is it really worth it to vendor the leather? Shouldnt i be using the AH to sell it?
---
So you should probably pick the longest name out of realm list :P
---
Hahahahaha!
---
I know. Literally all the blue posts recently were such great news. This one is like a punch to my gut. The vast majority of players will have dropped off by the time AB gets released :(
---
Geese definitely cost more but ammo is easier to make, but you get more out of geese. I know that's not a conclusive answer; I'm having a hard time deciding what is best myself in that context!
---
You could just talk freely, and you would report gold spammers accordingly.
---
If you can keep up on weapons warrior leveling is not that bad.
---
MC doesn't have a fuckton of PvP gear that is worth farming for PvP dedicated players. If you are embedded in a good guild then yes.
---
But if you rely on PUGs then I suggest you just focus mostly on professions, making gold, consumables and getting good PvP pieces from 5/10mans, all the niche PvP items that you want to grab around azeroth, engineering recipees etc.
---
Basically the best preparation for a PvPer before phase 2 is to get rich and do all the other things first. MC/BWL pale in comparison to what you get from a combination of phase2/3 ranking, engineering, consumables etc. No need to focus too much energy on raiding.
---
No. And as the guy below posted, none of them were Thursdays.
---
Rendering this a shitpost.
---
I would’ve supported that until realizing how long we’ll have to wait for BGs
---
Now I have mixed feelings. The BG delay is brutal
---
Oh hey mowsen. Seen your livestream before
---
Oh fuck off.
---
Like 3 guys per region will have them
---
Stop fucking whining.
---
No you need millions per rank at 11+ AND standing.
---
You could spam general from lvl 1?
---
It will be the same as it was towards the end of vanilla. Outside of AQ/Naxx (since plenty folks never saw those raids due to quitting/time/etc), folks knew fights and how to gear back then.
---
It would suck to wait that long for ab
---
u meant exclusion. having them would be normal and unlike they say something about it, we can assume they are in.
---
I suggest you don't roll a Druid if you despise healing. In vanilla they are very much a hybrid with focus on healing. Only very dedicated players will be offtanking/tanking in raids, which is true for *both* Warrior and Druid tanking. If you just want to tag along you going to heal in raids.
---
Goldmaker.
---
Me saying don't PuG was a little to broad of a statement just do it with friends like you described, I just get the feeling a lot of people  are going into Classic with a not so great attitude.
---
Hunter.
---
It doesn't scale
---
Use search bar next time.
---
You dont really need to gear ppl to clear MC...
---
Holy paladins don't resoec
---
People are going to downvote you because they need to convince people to join their PvP servers so that they have gank fodder.
---
It's simple: if you like getting ganked, and camped, and waiting for your 2 min respawn for hours at a time, roll on a PvP server!
---
Jesus the denial in this post. You are arguing based on an absolutely deluded idea that "it worked 15 years ago".
---
15 years ago they had to build around massive user growth.
---
Now they have to build around 90%+ of the population leaving in the first few months. 
---
&gt;Merges are better than the community leaving when they don't get to experience Vanilla, yes.
---
Just lol. People will leave when they fail to make a group for a dungeon after 5 hours of trying because the server is dead as are many others.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0p0xhMLZx0xoZVxsofo
---
Open from stealth with pounce - rake - rip, then moonfire and insect swarm and kite baby kite. I think this playstyle is the most fun. You have so much utility with charge and a big boi heal with NS
---
There’s no actual answer to those questions, but I would say that it’s all very dependent on how successful classic is and for how long.
---
If you change the resistance/armor values you just make the raids a bit slower or faster. For experienced players this won't matter at all in terms of how many days it takes them to clear a raid.
---
I thought Horde has a couple dozen fewer quests than Ally
---
Is it true that 2 warlocks from different factions that cast curse of tongue on each other can talk demonic with each other?
---
Nope, not happening
---
well done!
---
Engineering bullets/arrows.
---
Alchemy always good, will be rich msn
---
As an alliance player back then  I never understood either the use of either Anal or Windseeker spam. I also remember closing down barrens chat everytime I played alts on Horde cause it was childlish and lame and as I said never understood it. still dont.
---
Why do you say barman Shanker will have normalized speed? I thought have 2.0 was the point of it
---
Blood hounds can see you stealthed as well.
---
Torn between Warlock or Mage alt. I'll be using the character for mining/herbing and farming on a PvP server. Let me hear which one you think is better and why. Thank you.
---
Not being able to /camp will put a significant dent in the gold per hour.
---
Pserver camp is what makes a lot of those instance farms possible
---
Fyi if you switch the b ang g in the title it says „druid guild and bear“
---
Thank you for your attention.
---
Yes! I really think we should call PvE servers what Blizzard labeled them in-game: “normal” servers. PvE makes it sound like you never have the option for PvP, which you really do!
---
Barrens are a megazone that basically all 4 horde races need to quest through, and 3 (orc, troll, tauren) are designed to quest there due to location of their starter zones. Even as Forsaken skipping Barrens completely is nigh impossible, as you would run out of quests to level. Alliance doesn't have anything similar.
---
R14 is not available for the vast majority of players, including hardcore players. Dedicated PvPers will get to rank 10ish maybe a few ranks higher. If you don't no-life &amp; account share you wont make it to 14 I don't think. Especially not this time around.
---
Also outside of the weapons not all the classes benefit from the epic set as much as others in terms of PvE efficiency.
---
Why did someone pop all those buffs for meaningless trash? lol
---
I need this T-Shirt. lmao
---
Whats your need for the Spam tho?
---
I will be playing with my husband who is going to be a paladin and I can't decide on which class to roll. I've only played in MoP (shadow priest) and Legion (druid). Our main focus is going to be PvP and I want my class to be good in 1vs1 and small scale. I also don't mind healing/tanking in dugeons and raids. The only 2 classes I can't see myself enjoying are Warrior and Rogue, so could you guys please help me choose.
---
Ive seen this happening but I don’t know if it’s a vanilla thing or not.
---
I always loved chunking half a clothie’s HP in a single ambush
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow
---
Can I ask you why? :o
---
Yeah annoying backstab positioning makes it an easy call to go swords
---
It’s fun to level daggers if you plan on a lot of wpvp but backstab position can get really frustrating
---
&gt; You sound reactionary
---
Not a fan of being whisked away to some gulag, no. 
---
&gt; Also atwt clearly just debunked the racism in his comment
---
Doesn't matter, once a racist, always a racist.
---
On a PvE server you can pretty much forget wPvP outside of community events. A few people will flag themselves initially, but it will go away really fast if there is any challenge involed and random wPvP will die out. I mean not wanting to wPvP is quite literally *the* reason why people join a PvE server.
---
Damn well if thats the case I have bad news for you about most adults over 40
---
&gt; and why would you care if someone is racist, if you post on cringeanarchy
---
I care about people playing by the rules they themselves set forth.
---
Well, I hadn't seen it before
---
Well, they are still really good
---
sorry I don't speak zek.
---
Someone is lost
---
Still need a decent bow and stats
---
Warlock/mage need only to buy recent skills. Their gear could be grey tattered cloth and they still wreck
---
Until classic where it would be insanely expensive / not doable to get. Black lotus is heavily modified in psvrs. World
---
Buffs work differently.
---
It's just a joke, sort of. 
---
They wouldn't be my #1 pick though. If we were to draft nationalities i think they'd drop out of the top 5 sadly.
---
Gee I wonder why people might be trying to undermine a system _designed to criminalize half the world's population_...
---
Must be some nazi shit or something.
---
Shadow priest, the only class that ever fucked my mage up consistently. Never did learn how to duel them as a frost mage
---
Cute.
---
Rogue not gear dependent, but warlock is..... lel
---
On pservers there is no pay wall to create an active account unlike retail servers. So pservers have a lot bigger problem with spammers. To counteract that they place limits on the chat. In original vanilla there were no restrictions on chat.
---
Dunno but it's unplayable without pfui
---
I was referring to the racism dude, you have a bad case of persecution complex and some really strange double standards
---
If anyone's getting scarab lord in classic, you bet it's gonna be streamers.
---
They have lots of minions (fans) that do things for them and carry them in raids. They'll gladly help asmongold or whothever getting his mount/title.
---
That might happen anyway, I’m pretty sure it was common knowledge back in vanilla
---
I'm not sure if it'll be possible in classic, but a decently geared rogue could take out the fire elemental near the anvil for occasional "ace of elemental" cards.
---
Basically there are two parts of itemization and it looks like they will only timegate the release of items not change the stats with the patch cycles.
---
The items that were released early but changed later are still going to be released at the start, but as they were at the last patch.
---
Some of the more powerful items that were released later are still going to be timegated to release later.
---
&gt; Before normalization occurred in patch 1.8, the damage of instant attacks included the weapon speed as a factor to attack power, thus greatly benefitting slow weapons with high swing times. Because of this, slow weapons with lower weapon dps could lead to a higher total damage per second than fast weapons with nominal higher weapon dps, which is counter-intuitive.
---
One notable example is the Barman Shanker, which was at this time considered by many as the best rare dagger due to its exceptional high swing time, although there were other rare daggers with higher nominal weapon dps (or item level) available.
---
I just vendor. Its quicker. It's not really profitable, but it will set you up for the higher levels :)
---
Yep, you right. For some reason I thought the range was slightly higher?
---
oh right.
---
Are you a Cuban or a Cuban American, big diff
---
Thats outside of the normal route you run. Pyromancer and The Barman, aren't. Going for that boss is not worth it.
---
One frame is all you really need
---
That's been taken a bit hyperbolic honestly. Every raid doesnt want a shadow priest, but a single shadow priest CAN be a raid dps increase if you have enough other sources of shadow damage. If not, it's a deadweight priest.
---
Leveling is just a bit more tedious than average. 
---
Vanilla WoW doesn't have hard leveling, it's just that compared to hunters' steamrolling one  warrior gets quite tricker but it is no issue as long as you keep your weapon updated, learn and use FA and maybe use the hamstring-kite trick.
---
Not just you. The elevators had the problem of deciding you touched the wall just in the right spot to wallwalk and then you fall to your death.
---
The elevators go down at about falling speed, and it's a long enough fall to kill.
---
1. Calling you out isn't being rude.
---
2. Then it's not once a day isn't it?
---
You can't play a boomkin at level 39...
---
I play the game and meet people and see what happens.
---
So far the official Servers don't have enough PvE-Horde Guilds who are recruiting. I just chill for now.
---
That's true iwas actually planning to play RP-PVP,i don't even RP but I find you get a nicer community and a bit less moronic trolls, sure you get the level 1 trolls who come on with the intention to ruin someone's RP session but they soon get bored. Generally I find RP communities to be more mature. 
---
Hopefully if enough of us complain loudly enough we might get one at launch!
---
Can confirm. I am indeed you.
---
Woah
---
They tread lightly on the topic cash shop and classic.
---
Eng/anything you want.
---
Farm DM tributes and you dont need a prof for gold income but a prof for gold dump.
---
DM tributes are fun and can get you close to 100g per hour after you master it. Only left to see if it will be possible to solo the king in classic.
---
Oh yes that's a point perhaps it could be used to address faction balance
---
Any guild that forces people to use all those consumes, and then wipes stupidly on a regular basis, will have trouble keeping players. It's just not worth it to go through all that trouble to farm, etc.
---
There were loot addons, but you preclude the possibility that someone who knew someone with TF could whisper them and ask for a link, then go to /1,2,4 and start the link chain.
---
Warr, Rogue, Hunter, Mage will be the most played classes. Paladin and Shaman will be low because of single faction and Druid will be low because it's just worse than the other equivalent classes unfortunately.
---
If you live in the south go to Braums. They have the best tasting milk.
---
&gt; naga bosses 
---
They're flamewakers reee
---
Yep fair point you certainly want agood mix of experienced players and newer players for server health, i perhaps away round it could be to only allow pre registration for say,  half the intended population of aserver and the other half to be allocated to whoever chooses that server at launch.
---
I can't decide between druid and priest. I want to be a healer or support. I have no interest in raiding, but would like to heal dungeons. My main focus will be PvP. I really enjoy open world PvP, solo que battleground and also premade battle grounds. 
---
1. How do priests do in open world pvp - will every rogue and warrior I run into eat me alive?
---
2. Will druids be invited to premade BGs outside of the one you need for flag carrying?
---
3. Which class will allow me to use my healing PvP spec for PVE dungeons and be successful.
---
4. How much of a pain is it to not have a resurrection on a druid for dungeon runs? 
---
5. Which healer would a DPS be more happy to see in a Arathi Basin group?
---
Oh im sure it was but not for me. I just got an upgrade to a whopping 5mb last week!
---
So fresh servers at the time when casual players probably get around to end game content. Nah I hope they wait at least 2 or 3 years for fresh servers.
---
Atlas existed but iirc until an item existed on the server you'd just be disconnected if you linked it so thunderfury spam may not happen for a few months may have happened before but the first Anal/thunderfury spam I noticed was in tbc
---
Warrior was the first toon I ever created and the first I got to 60 in vanilla. I don't recall ever once thinking that it was hard. Some classes are certainly easier, but warrior is just fine.
---
[this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ubxhMxsLxG0oZVcbo) is a pretty nice spec for playing a bit more of a damage heavy build, check out StormX videos on youtube to see it in action. not 100% sure on how he spent his points in resto nor natures grasp vs wrath, but you'll essentially be able to heal and deal damage as a druid.
---
In vanilla, you had to pay for a copy of the game that would be attached to an account, and pay for game time. This alone made being banned for gold spamming expensive.
---
On pservers spammers need to get to level 10, which takes time making it more expensive for them to spam.
---
The game costing real money will ultimately make the game better, because it will weed out those who want to troll or ruin the game but aren't willing to spend money to do so.
---
I presume there'll be a lot of people doing so, not too many bothering w/ LW so there'll be a surplus. Not to say some leathers barely sell at all.
---
You just won't ever be near the top of the e-peen meters, and Mages will constantly want to remind you of this (especially when you are rolling against them for caster gear.)
---
They are heavily reliant on consumables if you don't want to suck.
---
The long cast time of Starfire really holds them back from doing more damage.
---
You will need to ignore Priests who demand that you Innervate them, because you will need it yourself.
---
Im trying to kick my dr pepper habit and slowly ween myself off. I dont remember the last time I had a sip of water. Its that bad:/
---
I feel like Trib is in a different category from the rest because it is the highest g/hr and also gives a lot of potions that will affect the AH substantially if there are multiple hunters running it.
---
That's a good point. There's not much reason to withhold BGs, just their rewards/rep gain
---
Lol I saw OPs post and bought one off amazon for 10 bucks for the feels.  Now I feel stupid. Thx tho.
---
Get T1 and 2/8 T2 in the beginning as a druid it can go really fast. Also for pvp in P2 don't sleep on a balance spec like 30/0/21, you can do pretty well with it ganking in the world solo or in a group (better starfire/moonfire crits, better range on your spells, no charge but cheaper shapeshifting). P3 you go resto fc spec  8/12/31 for Warsong Gulch and BWL.
---
Items also worth mentioning early on:  blood of the martyr (Strat quest), Rubidium Hammer (BRD, 1-hand hammer with 120 armor on it). Also get skull of impending doom, medecine furbolg pouch, tidal charm, engineering stuff (net, reflectors,  speed boots are most useful) and you're pretty much set for ranking (oh and also a lot of gold for faps).
---
For P5/6 I would just wear a mix of 3 pieces Rank 13 + T2.5/3. Get as much  stam as you can, damage is pretty brutal late in the game...
---
Just my 2 cents... I personnally  never ranked to 13 but the 3-piece bonus definitely seems worth it... Other than that it's just a feral set and I don't thin you want to be wearing 6/6, deep feral is not an ideal spec late in vanilla (you're better off playing defensive with a stam/healing set+end of dreams or qiraji war hammer).
---
&gt; Ull see a lot of "reserved" runs
---
Those runs will take 10x longer to put together, because only those who don't care about that item will want to go.
---
I imagine that will be less of a thing, but I see more "brd emp only" or "ubrs rend/jed runs", where they're going for specific bosses and planning to go multiple times.
---
Anal [Charge] hahahaha amirite?
---
Yes! You were a beast on the damage meters iirc. 
---
Let me know if you are looking for a guild for classic!
---
Meh raiding just isnt an option for an off spec and my lack of time so I will just focus on pvp. But after talking to people about I'm sure that I want to play balance again in pvp cause it is so much fun
---
if one person links it, other can link it from his message. shift+click. The name is just obnoxiously long so ppl entertain it.
---
Yeah I defiantly think it would need to have acap on sign ups which left at least 40% of the server space remaining for people who didn't pre register to join. Yep for sure iwould resub early if that was required to register.
---
You know 24 months is 2 years, right?
---
Alliance, EDT. Looking to roll on RP-Pvp server if they have one. Just regular PvP if not.
---
As others have said, there is a real life money cost to creating a blizzard account and not one to creating a pserver account. 
---
Additionally, blizzards reporting system/ticket system/larger staff will ideally ban gold spammers at a rate that prevents them from being effective or even seen.
---
Same
---
These are great! I love the build up in the siege of theramore
---
Don't hold back, spill out your anti-Swedish feelings!
---
I'm Swedish, but I somewhat agree with you. Swedes aren't Toxic in the way a lot of others are. But they're toxic with having a "I'm better than you"-attitude. Which is quite annoying.
---
No one can be better, because if you did something good. That guy needs to tell his story about when he did something better.
---
I'm stereotyping my own people, I might get hanged.
---
Unless you are extremely lucky or well-connected in your guild, the R14 weapon is probably on-par with AQ40 weapons in terms of overall time investment - the R14 grind is very unforgiving, though. You CAN NOT take even a day off towards the end. After it's over though, you are free! Raiding is easier on your schedule, but it's usually a longer-term proposition.
---
1. In the early levels Priests can shield/renew and flash heal without spell interruption. They're beefy and can 1v1 without much issue. With shadowform post 40 you become even scarier. At 60 in heal spec, you'll have more difficulty defending yourself.
---
2.  No. Only 1 druid in minmax premades. Priest/Paladins/Shamans for the dispels/purges, damage and better heals.
---
3.  Don't overestimate dungeons. You'll just have to drink more
---
4.  If nobody dies, you won't have to res. 
---
5.  Priest. Can't beat defensive and offensive dispels.
---
Loatheb
---
Most efficient 1v1 with shadow priest is healing priests :D outlast them on mana, mana burn them and wand to keep in combat
---
thats why there is a word hybrid, hope you will met one 39 hybrid at least once in 15years and get rekt by CC chain and interupts :) but yeah i should not consider even spreading the word about balance druid pre40level right? kappa
---
For Warrior; what do you guys reckon professions wise? I like the sound of Blacksmithing, but Engineering seems to be actually good for you in terms of boosting performance &amp;c.
---
is this still needed in patch 1.12 ?
---
Mage. Teleports to get to herb zones, possible AoE gold farming in instances and the fact that mages require less gear to be powerful in pvp.
---
He going holy or ret?  
---
If he's Holy then I would go Warrior.  Even if you focus on pvp, running dungeons for gear is a big plus.  With healer tank combo you can run any dungeon without much hassle.  A warrior gets more out of a pocket healer in pvp.
---
If he's Ret, I would do rogue.  Ret's damage in pvp is awesome and more bursty with timed stuns of a rogue also you won't step on each other's toes gear wise in dungeons (leather vs plate).
---
Hahh. 
---
Pservers are full of reserve runs.
---
legends say that thunderfury linked in vanilla was the original thunderfury linked so often it was always in chat to link again
---
Silithus
---
I dunno, that last one seems right on the spot.
---
This is a thing on "Mights dope" private server. If you kill a cloth casters pet/minion both mobs kill full xp which is wrong.
---
Most drops rates for quest items while close to accurate are still also unfortunately wrong too. Then there is all the scripting flaws which again, have been improved but are not the actual scripts.
---
All the little discrepancies add up to a large time difference.
---
My rogues name was Dagindabut
---
As there are no relevant BoP Blacksmithing Items, Blacksmithing is not relevant if you want to choose your profession based on efficiency.  Engineering is a musthave for warriors in terms of efficency.  
---
Saying this, ofcause you can also choose blacksmithing if this is what makes you happy
---
You’re saying it’s the equivalent of the Olympic torch? Gotta keep the flame alive then
---
That's not an neanderthal's skull.
---
I will most likely have mine in Theramore during starting phases and then Silithus once AQ is available.
---
Do engineering get net o matic. Have fun.
---
I imagine we'll see a lot of stockpiling of nature resist gear &amp; potions in the phase before AQ releases. Bad news for anyone needing to kill the earth elementals in Badlands for quests.
---
If they are doing full progressive itemization lots of classes have no reason to do various instances for gear, where as in vanilla most people didn't understand quite how the game worked yet and wanted gear (mostly their t0 set) out of pretty much every high level instance.
---
Not sure if you misread, but the two she didn't like were Rogue and Warrior
---
If your goal is to get into groups easily, then heal or tank. 
---
Any dps is secondary
---
They have already confirmed sharding, unfortunately. There's no need to raise caps, genius.
---
You want more players? Go back to your pservers, Vanilla isn't for you.
---
If its a tank making the group, he can reserve about anything he might need, it will still be fast.
---
If its a dps then yes. Worst i have seen is a dps warrior looking for a tank while reserving good war items, he never found one obviously.
---
I would like to share my story....
---
First time I played wow I must of been about 11 or 12. I played on a veery bad private server, nothing worked and there usually would be around 50 peaple online....I though that's huge back then.  My English was very limited at best as it was not my native language.
---
So on the private server there was a tekwport you could make by typing "TP Arena" it would take you to Gurubashi arena in STV. I would usually spend my time there just looking at higher lvl peaple and admiring the gear they had.
---
I would tell all my friends and school mates about this game...
---
One day in school another student told me about the retail version ( I thought I was playing the actual version of the game) how there are thousands of peaple online and how everything works etc... Same day after schools u begged my parents to buy me the box and some game time. It was a very big amount of money for them now that I remember but my mom managed to convince my dad seeing how exited about it I was.
---
Probably a month later there I was installing the discs and jumping up and down the walls from exitment.
---
I started playing, created a gnome warlock and gained a few levels. I decided to go to the arena, though with this many peaple I will see some great looking gear and admire it. I tipe the magical "TP Arena" and nothing... Tried again, once again nothing.. Got quite upset, I though my game is broken and somethings wrong. Young and foolish me decided to create a ticket, opened up a Lithuanian to English dixtionary and started writing what probably was the most confusing ticket ever.
---
I got a replay some time later confirming of course that everything is working as intended.
---
Few days later I met up with my school friend, told him about the incident hoping he will explain to me what the hell was going on, he had a good laugh, told me that's the private server thing I was playing on. Next thing he said was that I had to go to IF to see the high level peaple.
---
Got home, made my way to IF and got blown away, probably spent about 2-3 days just running around it and inspecting peaple.
---
And the rest is history, can't wait to return to the world of vanilla wow when good gear means shit...
---
Sorry, long post
---
At 60, Silithus indeed.  While leveling, definitely some place near where I'm grinding.
---
I made one and started recruitment for it on the official wow forums, the weekly reddit post and the two discords that allow recruitment for classic wow.
---
So those are your best places to look. There are guilds already recruiting raiders, like my own, and more are popping up each week.
---
I'll be always a Huntard ❤
---
I leveled a warrior to 60. It was painful, definitely more difficult than a hunter/priest/lock I previously leveled. Past 30 it became way easier. Also in PvP you won't have intercept until you do the berserker stance quest, so you will be kited 24/7 until then.
---
Other than those levels, warrior is awesome. Especially the tanking, i loved running 5mans and ubrs. The attention needed to pull, manage aggro and watch your hp is more engaging than mindlessly spamming a dps ability.
---
Gearing up is not that difficult if you are prepared to tank. If you're a good tank, people will whisper you to run 5mans the second you login (nojoke).
---
I leveled a warrior back in the day and it wasn’t so bad. If you like the idea of tanking and being plated up sword and board badass DO IT! Lots of auto attacking mobs and single target pulls if I remember right. I say go for it if that’s what speaks to you.
---
"The Turing Machine is run entirely by punch cards"
---
Dead
---
No different to the guilds back then following boss guides (which was most of them)
---
You can spend a lot of time waiting to rez cuz of the timer. Doesn’t mean your group was not as good or dedicated. Bgs don’t have rez timers.
---
Don’t forget sap unstealths, poison quest requires 80? Or so lockpicking and everything and your mother will see you stealthier and Aggro if you aren’t literally at their back center.
---
Enchanting can be really good early on if you are one of the first 300 enchanter and you manage to get some recipes like crusaders. You will be able to enchant every fresh 60 farming their pre raid bis while asking for a good tip.
---
Once other enchanter catch up, it will no longer give you lot of gold unless you are lucky by getting one of the first raid recipe.
---
If you dont manage to be one of the first 300 enchanter you will be broke for life so be sure to be able to nolife the firsts weeks.
---
Swedish here aswell, you're completely right
---
In Vanilla it was indeed Silithus.
---
Yeah I know it's there. But looking at the sidebar isn't something a lot of people do on their phones. Now blue posts are coming in kinda weekly it might be easier to just sticky it as a post for a bit so people don't ask the same questions over and over.
---
Or other warlocks?
---
any items added to the game before 1.10 will be in the game and with 1.12 stats.
---
That would make it impossible to for anyone needing to interact with the citizen NPC's for trade or questing. I guarantee if they implemented this someone would make it their goal to keep them running back and fourth 24/7.
---
Hunter or warlock will send their pet to you.
---
Mage can blink
---
You cant sap a druid
---
And these are the classes that can manage to solo a devilsaur
---
Well arathi did come out later than the other two BG’s so it makes sense.
---
I am in same boat!! I rolled rogue back in the day and later on rolled a warrior. Loved both of them. I feel like partying up will be a lot easier with warrior 🤔
---
And if I roll rogue I am torn between undead and orc lol
---
I plan on playing a PvP server this time (rolled PvE originally) so I think rogue will be my ticket to start then maybe an a lot down the road?
---
IIRC the anvil is right outside the bar.  You just jump down and maybe aggro one elemental you have to kill.
---
I don't remember the route I took, but I remember solo-farming that elemental as a Rogue in Vanilla for some piece of fire resist gear.
---
for horde Kargath makes the most sense at least until AQ is out
---
Lionheart helmet would like to have a word with you.
---
With decent tank gear you can kill them in bear form.
---
Whatever I'm currently questing.
---
Sap cannot be blinked but can ice block it
---
I found this strange, during my time on retail I raided as the only English player in a full Swedish HC/Mythic team and did not experience any toxic/elitist attitudes, made some really good friendships and have been to visit multiple time IRL too
---
Yeah I wouldn't put a whole lot of weight behind the census. Usually on private servers it's Warrior &gt; rogue &gt; mage &gt; hunter &gt; healers/lock
---
Poor fuck should have just tanked it himself.
---
Lol the chaos for 90% of people will be sitting at a spirit healer while being corpse camped and the flight master is dead so you can't leave.
---
I'm rolling PvP but I forsee some major bitching when people realize its not a "war zone" rather its high levels obliterating low levels non-stop.
---
They both speak it, but no player can understand it.
---
Minmaxer feral druids will go with enchanting for the Smoking Heart of the Mountain.
---
Kargath like everyone else. You just have to walk outside the door of the inn and people will throw gold on you for portals.
---
I too misread that haha.  That being said, warlock would fit pretty well with either a holy or ret paladin.
---
TL;DR: before normalization barman shanker did more damage on instant attacks than core hound tooth from MC, after normalization it did less. A bit if math to explain how this works. 
---
Core hound tooth: 51.3dps, 1.6 speed.
---
Barman's Shanker: 36.5dps, 2.0 speed.
---
Backstab damage is weapon damage x 1.5 + 225.
---
Ambush damage is weapon damage x 2.75 + 319.
---
Assuming 100dps from attack power.
---
Before normalization: weapons speed x (attack power dps + weapon dps)
---
Shanker:2.0x(36.5+100)=273 weapon damage, 273x1.5+225=634.5 backstab, 273x2.75+319=1069.75 ambush.
---
CHT:1.6x(51.3+100)=242.08 weapon damage. 242.08x1.5+225=588.12 backstab, 242.08x2.75+319=984.72 ambush.
---
After normalization: (weapon speed x weapon dps) + (normalized speed x attack power dps), for daggers normalized speed is 1.6.
---
Shanker:2.0x36.5+1.6x100=233 weapon damage, 233x1.5+225=574.5 backstab, 233x2.75+319=959.75 ambush.
---
CHT:1.6x51.3+100x1.6=242.08 weapon damage. 242.08x1.5+225=588.12 backstab, 242.08x2.75+319=984.72 ambush.
---
Shanker/CHT, backstab before normalization: 635/588, after normalization: 575/588.
---
Shanker/CHT, ambush before normalization: 1070/985, after normalization: 960/985.
---
I'm not really good at playing games(mechanical skills wise), after a lot of years of playing games and really trying i can see that. Just want to know what class could have me doing good in pvp(because i want to play on a pvp server) and still give me a raid spot in my guild? I thought about hunter, mage or priest.
---
Leaning to mage because of the needing to respec to farm on others, while i also am leaning to priest because i really like spriest but i don't know how hard would be to get a raid spot(and if all goes wrong i could just go holy/disc and heal).
---
I really like Hunter because i saw some vids on them in raids and i really liked their type of gameplay (kiting and that kinda of stuff), but i don't know what the chance is for me to fuck up because of high ping.
---
P.S.: I'll have like ~150 ms.
---
P.S. 2: I would probally like dpsing more(because i find it easier) but have no problem at all with healing.
---
What do you think it looks cool?
---
Answer to yourself 
---
Then proceed to create character
---
Troll is probably the best for both PvP and PvE. Undead's DP is good ... if it isn't dispelled, and it can be, very often, not to mention its mana cost. I'll just copy past this answer from a PServer SPriest (**Fleyz**) who was asked on Youtube about Troll vs Undead shadowpriests  :
---
 
---
Quote :" ***I originally created the UD after I had finished everything on that, I decided to make a troll purely to mix it up. I now almost entirely play the troll and the UD is left offline.***
---
**Reasons:**
---
**1) WOTF vs Berserking** \- WOTF is only useful vs A) Classes which fear (Priests / Warriors / Warlocks) B) Those classes need to land a fear - I play an extremely cowardly play-style, very rarely getting feared. C) You can use Berserking vs EVERY CLASS. D) Berserking Mind blast is one of the hardest spells in the game to interrupt E) Berserking Mana Burn is the fastest stationary mana drain in vanilla F) Berserking Mind control is Savage.
---
**2) Hex of Weakness** is a 30 yd range curse which reduces healing by 20% for 2 mins. It also reduces the physical damage done by the target by a minor amount. My tactic with Hex is that I'm purely using it for the healing de-buff. Which means I can use Rank 1 Hex. Rank 1 Hex costs 35 mana and has NO COOL DOWN. It can only be dispelled by Mages and Druids. I've racked up some serious playtime with my priest and I can count on one hand the amount of time my curse has been dispelled. I use max rank Hex on melee who are training myself or someone on my team who is decent (for a bit more mitigation) Hex also affects POTS, Healthstones, Death coils and Whipper Root Tubers. On Retro-wow the food which everyone uses form the vendor restores 5% of you HP every second. This food counts as a "heal" so the Hex can further slow their regeneration.
---
**3) Shadowguard vs Touch of Weakness** \- Shadowguard is similar to touch of weakness except, it doesn't apply a curse debuff to the attacker reducing their melee damage (BAD) and cannot crit (Which isn't always bad as it will not proc enrage on warriors training you). However Shadowguard hurts melee and ranged attacks and can proc blackout and shadow weaving, has a low mana cost and gets an absurd % of spell damage and has a stack of 3. Meaning you need to re-apply it less (Touch of Weakness has 1 charge).
---
**4) Undead is still strong**, don't get me wrong. Undead can even be stronger than Troll in certain situations. You can't use Devouring plague in 100% of fights though and one simple cleanse from a paladin really does hard counter DP. Also Dwarves who have any idea know they can stoneform out of it. "
---
Here's to hoping they have a plan by then. Old-school RuneScape suffered extremely low populations once a good amount of people hit end game (took less than a year thanks to the abundance of online guides and the concept of EHP)
---
However, once they took everything that made OS good and ran with it to come out with suitable content, the game exploded in popularity. I really want to see that kind of re-born success in WoW!
---
Kargarth in phase 1 then probably feralas in phase 2 for Dire maul grinding
---
You could unlock the door, get on the balcony and jump down, however at that point your runs will be getting quite long + the run from thorium to brd. You will hard pressed to make the 5 runs in an hour.
---
What stops me from forming a raid and entering a 5-man dungeon? Or does the rule only apply to raid dungeons?
---
I've never been that indecisive in a class choice before.
---
Rogue or Deadlock in ally side.
---
Rogue downside:
---
OP (I don't wanna play a class considered op by other player)
---
Overrepresented
---
Warlock downside:
---
Undead will counter me
---
I would recommend Mage, very good for 1v1 and small scale.
---
And also paladin can help you a lot.
---
As a horde rogue my favorite alliance word was UDEN
---
"HELP"
---
Gadgetzan is pretty convenient imo, easy to get to Theramore (for Onyxia) as well as Silithus.
---
I'm not sure how well it fits with MMOs though, since I played in a full Swedish guild as well (except for one guy being Dutch) and everyone were mostly nice.
---
But if you play Dota, CS etc. Other maybe more competative games. You'll find that Swedes are worse than anyone because they use a lot of "i'm better than you, scrub"-insulting etc.
---
Versus alliance warlocks ya, purging void sac. was like "haha you so screwed".
---
I did exactly the same lmao. Gnome mage for me.
---
How funny would the plost twist be, if its actually you with your 2nd account.
---
3-4 hours is plenty to both raid on a schedule and farm consumeables if you so wished :)  
---
I think alot of the draw of vanilla is that you can play it at the pace you like, if you wanna go ham you could log in on day one and not go to bed untill both ragnaros and onyxia were both dead.  
---
The majority of players will probably be leveling for the first month, leveling takes up alot of time, but you'll always have new people to meet be it through group quests or finding new dungeons to run.  
---
Will you be at a disadvantage for not playing 18 hours a day? possibly, depends on your goals. You probably wont get rank14 or play in the most hardcore pve guilds on your server. But could you reasonably clear bwl and make good progress in AQ40 and Naxx with a "casual" guild? sure.
---
I'm in the same boat. Thinking of either lock or mage. But sheep is also countered with WotF, right?
---
Duskwood is also contested territory though, staying just over the border won't keep anyone safe.
---
Horde kind of HAVE to do Kargath.
---
As a gnome tho I'll have it in Tanaris- good Southern Kalimdor Access - it's actually almost as close to DM backdoor as Feathermoon and it's the closest to DM. Really the best hearth IMO
---
Since when were we ever talking about speed leveling compared to normal leveling?  He said not getting all totems would make shaman leveling unbearable.  I disagreed because I've leveled shamans with only earth and fire with no problems at all, and 6 days played by the way, using the exact method that you said was too slow...  I think it's fine.  Now if you're talking about speed leveling, then you need to lead with that, but that's not what we were talking about.  Having almost full or full mana at the end of mob kills also keeps me prepared for world pvp while leveling, and I've always been on pvp servers.
---
People are just sleeping all over how useful wotf is.  I almost never used devouring plague after I got to max level on my undead priest in vanilla but I wouldn't give up wotf for anything.  Extra fear break and ability to also break enemy priests mind control?  Yes please especially as a primary healer in BGs.  Didn't hurt that I could also prevent fears on ony/nef and keep landing those important heals on the MT.
---
With the right gear!
---
This is how I make gold on pservers, solo un'goro as a rogue. I can fully solo a devils with AR and Eva up even with shit gear. While waiting for cds I try ninja other faction's using cc.
---
not BoP
---
I would actually recommend rogue, if you suddenly need to go AFK u can just stealth and afterwards continue questing / PvPing (of course if you choose PvP realm)
---
Only downside is that you will have a bit harder time finding groups, and rogues might not be best for "casual" PvP whatever that means :P
---
i can only support going arms, the utility you lose by going fury early on will get you a hard time if you are playing on a pvp server and tanking dungeons too.
---
but not world of roguecraft level good.
---
I don't trust like that
---
I was just talking about efficiency. It’s BiS and you don’t need BS to wear it you could buy one I was just saying :3
---
Blind pet. Vanish re-sap / blind the mage. Blind druid. Improved gauge if blind on cd.
---
healers suck alone? hybrids are probably the best duelers in the game
---
Pservers are full of people spamming for reserve runs for hours sometimes. 
---
I never said they wouldn't end up in the dungeon. Ask yourself this: someone is spamming for LF1M: [the thing you want] res. And someone else is spamming LF2M: no res.
---
What group will you want to join? I'd say the no res, because then there's 2 LF1M, and one is crippling themselves weeding out potential members.
---
[this](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345) enables feral druids to be super strong in raids and also pvp. it is so good that it holds up for feral dudua till tbc because of the insanely good active it provides
---
this guy memes
---
Also, unlike pick pocketing which is intentional, or mage aoe farming which is just clever use of mechanics, solo hunter tribute depends entirely on taking advantage of ai pathing exploit to kite the boss endlessly.
---
I can see blizzard fixing the pathing and make it impossible to solo, but still doable in pairs, I.e. rogue druid.
---
Night Elf or Tauren Warrior
---
I CAN’T DECIDE
---
&gt; A big disadvatange of 10k players would be the wPvP ganking in phase2.
---
Completely agree. I think there is a good middle ground in regards with server caps, and around 5k would be about it. That would probably be enough so that servers survive, and avoid the merge/transfers later on.
---
Oh look, the fun police steps in with censorship and regulations.
---
I consistently beat rogues/mages/warriors on all bosses in MC, and these people were tryharding and good players. You probably have never seen a good hunter. Hunters are really strong early raiding, but they scale bad. Most hunters are just lazy nabs. You need good ping, perfect timing and auto attack timer, Hunter rotation is the hardest dps rotation in vanilla.
---
A lot of "dps warriors" NEVER want to tank. A lot of hybrids NEVER want to heal.
---
In vanilla, you can play whatever you want whenever you want. That doesn't mean what you want to do is desirable or beneficial to a group over another class/spec who can hands down do it better.
---
I dont know what faction you play but youre more than welcome to join my guild and we can try and fit you when youre online.
---
Exactly this
---
&gt;Black lotus is heavily modified in psvrs
---
Not really. If you check the price of black lotus in pservers it is the same as old classic prices. Why? Because while the spawn rate was increased, it was increased because of the increased playerbase. 6 times as much demand + 6 times as much supply = same price and same accessibility for the average player.
---
I always played warrior dps in the recent vanilla servers and im kinda torn between going paladin for fun stuff like gathering aoe farming gear, healing raids for pvp/offgear or going druid feral/resto to do basically the same, fulfilling a hybrid role with 1 specc. And then there is the warrior which i know i will regret not having leveld up when i see all those fury warriors decked in those rare epics...
---
You would be pretty hard pressed to stay in the barrens until lvl 30. Unless you decided to grind mobs from like 23 - 30.
---
I've done barrens lots of times and pretty much always go at lvl 10, by the time I finish southern barrens I'm usually 21 - 23 depending on whether or not I skip the silithid digging quest and the harpy leader quest.
---
Why are you commenting issues that you are clearly too thick to understand? They didn't confirm sharding other than maybe first month in starting zones, which doesn't solve anything. 
---
&gt;You want more players? Go back to your pservers, Vanilla isn't for you.
---
Alright, keep living with your delusions. Just know that when the game is dead 6 months in its gonna be because of people like you.
---
&gt;Really the only consumable you need is mana pots.
---
And you can use greater mana pots which are cheaper. Unless you are using mana pots on cooldown, it is more cost efficient to use 2 greater ones than one major one.
---
Can someone remind me what quintessence is?
---
And that noggenfogger. Can't forget the importance there.
---
This was my initial thought but I didnt play a mage in vanilla
---
It will be even faster than this. Every hardcore guild is already gunning and planning for this. MC is a cakewalk.
---
I just like how you spelled peaple
---
Thank god you’re alliance.
---
For warlock, undead don't counter you that hard pre-60. If you have your voidwalker out for sacrifice and a healthstone while leveling, you can beat any class at the same level while leveling. 
---
At 60, it's an annoyance, but you're not going to lose a fight just because of WOTF.
---
blessing of freedom you wantz it
---
but you also wantz windfury totem
---
How do you know which servers will be high pop on launch day?
---
Tauren Warriors are the best tanks in the game. And they are Horde. And they are like really cool minotaurs.
---
It will cleared by a raid of 57+ in greens within a week. It does not take anywhere near that long to hit 60 either, especially with a guild working together. If there are 16 debuff slots and 1.12 talents their is no way Rag isn't down within one week of release.
---
To me rouges offer the least amount of utility in a 5man.
---
Locked chests are really rare. Doors usually have keys you can acquire.
---
Rouges do okay dps but do not like switching targets, are melee dps instead of ranged and have one of the worst CC.
---
&gt;while Horde has no equivalent blue quest reward between levels 18 and 46.
---
This is actually false. Crescent Staff from the Wailing Caverns quest actually kicks ass. I usually use it straight through until I get my WW axe at 30
---
And what about the other bgs?? Ill be invited for ab or av???
---
The first bear I tamed in Dun Morogh. Kept that furry guy through several expansions, even if I didn't use him much.
---
What is the superior shaman race? 
---
And I’m talking looks, not racials.
---
Challenge accepted.
---
If you’re worried about UD countering warlock you should consider how orc counters rogue
---
This guys and remember there are genders so if you feel forced to be a orc but don't want to be a hunched barbarian then be a female orc they look sweet and are always  SCARY in pvp as only really good players tend to go female orc.
---
For pvp, if I like utility and dmg, its better druid ot shaman??
---
Do you think on pve there is no griefing? they can ruin any rep grind and there is nothing they can do abot it, just tag and steal the mobs.
---
Watch pvp movies always does it for me.
---
Hi, /u/kingdom9999
---
Sounds like you should go with Mage! They have easy spell rotations for raids and great tools for PvP that dont require much mechanical skill. (Frost nova, blink, polymorph). You can make your own food/drink and sell portals for gold! 
---
Hunters are more mechanical, especially in PvP. Kiting is definitely more difficult against humans than PvE mobs! Plus, you have to worry about arrows/ammo in classic, and that's just no fun. 
---
Healing can be frustrating when playing with extra lag. It is important to cancel spell casts to not overheal and to start regaining mana, you may not be able to do this as easy with lag.
---
&gt; You want more players? Go back to your pservers, Vanilla isn't for you.
---
You really don't have any idea as to what you're talking about do you? Do you have any idea as to why we are getting classic? Hint, it has a HUGE reason to do with nost, which had 10k+ pops.
---
Curious; Why do you think a 2500 capped server which will need to merge/transfer later on, would be better than a 5k capped server that would not need to merge/transfer later? Remember, a huge part of vanilla is the community.
---
"Vanilla isn't for you." Gtfo with that shit anyways. Extremely toxic and inflammatory.
---
I’m thinking of rolling either an orc or troll Shaman on a pvp realm. The thing is I want to be able to wpvp people and with the Shaman being more healing i’m not sure how good I will be able to defend myself or attack others.  I also want to be able to raid/dungeon so I think Shaman would be easier than other classes to gear on. I’m rather new to the class but I like how many options they get with totems.
---
The other choices are Warlock, Priest and Hunter.
---
Hunter is the one i’m most familiar with as it was my main for years. I’m likely going to roll one purely for pvp since I do like Hunter pvp. I’m trying not to main as I do want a new experience.
---
Warlock is the other choice i’m very interested in as I find them fun. I’m just a little worried about group slots since there is going to be a high number of dps.
---
The ghost saber from Darkshore. I remember going to get it at level 19 (they can be 19 or 20) and managing to tame it, then going into wsg and parking her at the flag on aggressive while I ran up above and Shadowmelded and waited. Fun times! That’s the only time I enjoyed pvp lol
---
LFG - **Warrior \[A\] \[US\] \[PvP\]**
---
Looking for a guild that can raid **Sunday evening** and **one night of the week Monday-Thursday**, Preferably 9pm-12pm EST (6pm-9pm Pacific)
---
I realize that's asking for a lot, so I'm super flexible on type of guild/region. I am happy to play "hardcore", be a main tank or OT, play fury, play casually and/or do a lot of PvP. I'm planning on leveling fast and gearing up quickly at the start. I usually play the AH a little bit so I'll have all my consumables! 
---
PM me!
---
Getting his Insanelovin on the run
---
Maybe if your proposed changes weren't so shitty people would listen to your advice
---
Yea i am pretty smart.
---
You should contact /u/awesometographer to crunch the numbers on the census
---
Owls. After leveling with one on a private server I can gaurantee you everyone is sleeping on owls. They can learn claw and dive so if you really feel like having a cat you can just get rid of screech and replace it with claw but screech is op op and generates more threat than claw even with only 1 mob
---
I’ll be doing both PvP and PvE. 
---
I’m just not sure about Orgrjmmar 🤔 unless there are a bunch of people who hang out at thunder bluff.
---
Opinions on Druid vs Shaman? Trying to PvP but also get into PUG raids easily.
---
It'll take you a lot longer to get to 60 than most, that's fair to say. You might want to consider fast leveling classes like hunters. Or something like a Priest which is a good leveler but also easy to find dungeon groups with if you heal.
---
You'll still be able to get through MC and BWL in a casual raiding guild, no problem. AQ40 and Naxx might prove more difficult.
---
Yea this is a huge one.. What do you think is better?
---
You don't get camped to oblivion either at all times, thats equally ridiculous to assume
---
    1vs1 and small scale
---
Druid, Warlock. Both paladin and druid are tough to kill individually. Warlock offers the damage and paladin brings support.
---
    healing/tanking in dungeons
---
Playing druid with a paladin in 5mans is really nice, either of you can tank or heal and forming a group will be a breeze. You're also less likely to be denied by minmaxers that don't want a druid tank/healer as you'll have your paladin for the res/heals.
---
I have basically the same exact question but deciding between Priest and Paladin. I do plan to raid and do PvP, but not push world first or R14.
---
having 1.12 talents is also not blizzlike so what is your point?
---
haha thats like the smallest ammount of the playerbase ever :D
---
Shaman will have an easier time getting into pug raids as up to 8 shamans is feasible for the totem utility. Also good as resto/ele in PVP.
---
I would say Mage or Warlock, both are fun magic DPS in PvP that have a good role in PvE. You have to consider that Warlocks in the Alliance have the problem of having to fight against Undead with Will of the Forsaken, but leveling with a pet it's very fun and like having a personal tank. Mages are great in both PvE and PvP, and can make food and portals that are always very helpful in Vanilla. Plus, you can make a lot of money with that.
---
Swedes love DOTA! Maybe thats why they have that extreme anti-noob(scrub) mentality....
---
got azshara though, it's really close to forest song so it's fine :)
---
It was bad enough in Vanilla and TBC that when Wrath came out I had re-rolled a priest and not looked back. 
---
It is likely worse now because people know how the balance ends up and that rogues are pretty good at near everything.
---
I’m stuck between one of the 4 healers. 
---
Right now I’m leaning paladin, but the slow leveling and wearing cloth while raiding has me questioning that. 
---
It’s a 3 way tie between the others. A friend of mine is rolling warrior so they’ll all technically work well with him in BGs.
---
Just join a casual non LC guild and you'll be fine. I'd personally recommend not playing warrior or feral druid but it's absolutely fine if you do. They just tend to require a little more work to get going
---
Do whats fun. Fun is number 1. Always.
---
Blacksmithing can be a lot fun if making your own gear is appealing. It really does increase your personal attachment to your character.
---
Okay, that is not actually wrong...
---
Yeh only 2 changes the games need druids need a bred for 5 man dungeons. Honor system should change a year after Naxx release.
---
I tested a spell power rogue build the other day. I sorta mix-n-matched pre-raid bis rogue items like devilsaur set, truestrike shoulders, etc, with some +spell power gear, weapons that proc fire dmg, gloves that proc fire dmg, shadow oil, etc. 
---
I was holding around 400dps.
---
Have no idea if this will work come classic, though.
---
I used to hide the phones before an important boss in bwl/aq lol back with 40 man raids having 1 person dc for a few minutes was just expected. often a few people during each encounter tbh.  it wasn't that punishing though with 40 people
---
Female orc ofc
---
It's honestly ganna be kind of funny when everyone realizes that things they thought were possible actually aren't.
---
oh boy yep, totally misread that.  I would still like to know Holy or Ret for pvp.
---
Rak'Shiri from winterspring. Still have him on my hunter today. Can't get him in retail so I used him up until I quit retail.
---
Always preferred the boar for its charge move!
---
Mage. 
---
There is a lot of travel time in vanilla. Cut that down by being able to teleport and have your hearth stone in a random spot that fits you best.
---
You really are the worst bot but I like you for doing your job. Good bot.
---
But owls can't learn prowl and hide with me in shadowmeld.
---
Affliction warlock. DoT&gt;DoT&gt;DoT&gt;CD&gt;Deathbolt&gt; Win. Super easy for beginners imo.
---
Paladin if alliance. Priest if horde. Simples.
---
And it's completely correct.
---
Middle Kalmidor is not really used that much as Alliance or Horde in endgame (excluding Ogrimmar ofc).
---
The only real disadvantage you have in mobility therefore as Ally is Aszhara just because of how far it is from Darn or Tanaris (or even Theramore) and upper Eastern Plaguelands because of the distance from Ironforge.
---
There will be plenty of people willing to defend as well
---
I didn't have luck with drops so I grinded a lot.
---
Mages have easy raid spots in casual and hardcore raid guilds. Their pvp is also good, but it is mechanically a little harder than most classes. 
---
Shadow priests get one raid spot in most guilds, but they may make you heal early on when everyone is undergeared.
---
Back in the day I had an impossible time finding people to run sunken temple and DM.  I picture a lot more people running a lot more dungeons, which as a person who usually plays healers, I am VERY excited about it.  Also being older now I know i've grown more patient with people.  I'll be ready to help out noobs
---
boar cuz they are so cuddly OwO
---
Orc for shamans. Hunter or warlock is probably the best choice if you plan on wpvping. Orc again for both of them. Stun resist racial to strong.
---
My friends have been pushing to play on PvE server because they are pretty casual and not great at PvP.  For the first time since the announcement, I’m feeling totally fine with going that route.  I will flag to get some rank, but now I don’t have to worry about being camped ad nauseam.
---
I get hybrids not wanting to heal. They are basically forced into healing virtually all group content. But warriors get to choose between dps and taking. Also, tanking is easily the most fun and rewarding role in the game (I know that's just my opinion, but it's true darnit!). 
---
Warriors that won't tank are missing out. Warriors that won't tank and try to reserve warrior great are straight up stupid.
---
Gear progression is a **lot** more important to the MMO experience than getting your talents changed through patch notes.
---
Releasing content in this way means that you will be releasing tiers that players already outgear. That's a hell of a lot more of a problem than 1.12 talents.
---
I have a funny Vanilla story, so a friend of mine quit playing and gave me his account but since he was a Rogue same as my main i didnt really play it for few months, one day i decide to play his account i buy subscription and log in. He had both parts of thunderfury ready but nothing else, so i work harded to buy all the mats. His guild has disbanded so i joined another and not so long after, after a raid we head towards Silithus to create Thunderfury. So i summon Thunderaan and we kill him, BUT the quest item to complete the quest is actually NOT soulbound to me and since there was no masterlooter i had to sweat out few minutes until everyone has passed on it :D i wonder to this day if someone else took it, could they have gotten Thunderfury like that. Im guesing it was fixed not long after that but ye.

Shaman. Druids don't have much damage. Druids slowly wear people down. Shammys blow people up. Both hard to master in pvp.

Male orc.

Shows how good this game is when you still can't decide after MONTHS (or even YEARS) of waiting.
---
Personally I can't decide betweeen [Paladin + Hunter] on Alliance or [Priest + Warlock] on Horde.
---
Alliance has Ironforge, Horde has Tirisfal and  The Undercity
---
Paladin PVP sounds exciting, but PVE is blue robe sadness. Priests look good on every tier, especially Female Night Elf and Undead, but there will be a lot of Priests to compete with (on Horde a lot of Shaman will take healer spots, and on Alliance people might be specifically asking for Fear Ward, especially in pugs).

All classes are suitable for beginners. You have a lot of time to learn until you reach level 60.
---
That said, levelling both classes is fun and rewarding, and neither class has a terribly difficult raid rotation. Go with what you like to play.
---
Bonebiter (ally sm q reward) has 3.4 speed, Ravager has 3.5 speed. Bonebiter is definitely better though, but it's because of its higher dps and stats
---
That’s right. Sap should go first since you can’t sap if a mob is in combat. Tank can aoe aggro after, other CC, etc.  I don’t think vanish is that big a deal imo.
---
There's a EU community Discord, I would suggest you join:
---
https://discord.gg/DfEFBFt
---
And there's also a Guilds Discord for Classic where you can find a bunch of guilds recruiting. It has over 3,000 members:

---
&gt;PVE is blue robe sadness
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2z29Rk8814w)
---
Orc for horde pvp and pve. Gnomes for pvp. Human for pve. NE and taurens (puke)
---
Sap is kinda rough CC for 5-mans. Polymorph, Shackle, Freezing Trap, etc are all better.
---
But, if you want to use Sap, you need to Sap, then have the Warrior charge/shout very quickly afterwards. Helps if you have a Power Word: Shield on the Rogue before it saps.
---
Not many kids will be playing Classic WoW, as it's old and not that appealing to kids these days. All the kids who were playing Classic in 2005 ar now grown up, so I can predict that the main community will be  grown ups with nostalgia syndrome and people who want to try WoW as a fresh game.
---
All I'm longing for now is a god damn release date :'-(
---
Nope, only charm, fear, and sleep.
---
Hey buddy.  I too am an adult who wants to play classic but has obligations, such as a baby.
---
I’m making a weekend guild which raids 11pm-3am EST on Friday and Saturday.  Horde PVE.  We are going to have fun clearing the entire game at our own pace.  Currently recruiting all classes.
---
If this sounds cool, drop me a DM and we can talk more!
---
You're supposed to not use it unless specced for it, or like you say, you only need 1 CC and the tank is ready to pull almost simultaneously.
---
There is little question that WoW has some passionate fans who have driven the direction of the game from its earliest days.
---
Likely going to do the recruiting serverside and if the server specific forums pop up there as well.
---
I can't be bothered to look for people before the launch.
---
Just follow the white flag and you will find your way home.
---
The reason we are getting Vanilla is because Blizzard sees there is money to be made and we have been begging for years.
---
I don't want server caps past vanilla since it will ruin the experience.
---
Nobody wants 10k+ servers because of Nost. Nobody wants 10k servers or higher than Vanilla server caps other than a handful of children who only played pservers. 
---
Pservers isn't a classic experience no matter how you cut it. Go play retail or back to pservers with you. You'll be a tourist, anyhow.
---
I am in the same boat, but that’s okay. Just enjoy the game at the pace you have time for. World firsts have already happened with this content, so why rush? Just enjoy the Classic experience.
---
&gt;Most people won’t get there
---
FTFY
---
There is a EU Discord, actually. Feel free to coordinate there if you want, and if you have a channel idea then I will look into it. As long as everyone speaks English.
---
This post has triggered me so hard I will now be rolling PVE instead of PVP.
---
Thankfully Asmongold isn't even gonna hit 60 before giving up, writing a twitlonger, doing an AMA on his dead subreddit and then playing Apex with his slavemaster gf.
---
Sorry, I should have clarified that they suck at getting honor solo. If you want to go more pure healer you have to have a dps with you to get anything.
---
Personal opinion, no game dev should reward that behavior
---
I believed this back then and still do, the honor grind is one of the worst systems in the history of the franchise
---
The white lion se learn stealth from on STV vietnam
---
I expect if you engage in conversation you'd know this, so the length of sharding doesn't need to be mentioned. I'm talking about sharding for the reason the other child stated - early influx of tourists before the realms die down.
---
Everyone knows it's only during an UNDETERMINED amount of time. This is already known and doesn't need to be explained but if you are having issues putting 2 and 2 together I suggest you go back and read blue posts on Blizz's forums.
---
Good to hear that posts about post-Classic content have been approved previously. That would explain why mine got removed with the comment "it is not related to Classic at all"
---
Yeah Orcs are pretty great aren’t they lol, females have a decent model too. 
---
Shaman just has me a bit conflicted because you can do some neat stuff with troll berserking casts and pve healing.
---
Legit question, how do you like your G213 keyboard. I’m thinking of getting one.
---
Warlock or mage for new player to vanilla?
---
I've been thinking about what i want to play for a very long time now, im left with two choices right now, warlock or mage. Im going to be playing alliance. My main interest in WoW has always been raiding and im not really very interested in PvP, other than some occasional battlegrounds. (Im very bad at PvP so thats why)
---
I was only making a comment about your name =P
---
I have talked about the pros/cons of several "changes" type of things and some encouraging discussion happens but its a little too much of the "REEEE NO CHANGES" for me.  
---
Do you mean that druids should be able to have a normal res for dungeons so that they can be the solo healer and not worry about corpse runs for random party members who die?
---
I would love to see a tweak to pally tanking to allow some sort of mana regen for protadin.  The 'gain mana from being healed' would be great and would allow at least a little bit more viability for 5 mans/raiding in spots.  The gear itemization is still crazy wierd for them though so they'd never be challenging warr or druid, just something interesting to allow the class to be playable a bit more.
---
Nordic heavy servers are helpful to do raid scheduling in.
---
Also everyone has a pretty reliable internet connection.
---
Wouldnt advise hunter. Sure Autoshot+pet guarantees you to deal damage even with high latency but on the other hand you'd probably struggle not to clip your aimed shot and do your raid rotation correctly. Lag can also cause problems with Feign death. 
---
Mechanically hunter is very intense in pvp if you want to be good. To play optimally I think 50 keybinds is a minimum, you'll need to manage your pet, stings (and downranks), aspects, autoshot timer, different projectile travel time, your range and deadzone, your delicate CC, your trackings, use macros, know how to kite. Honestly if you want perfect control over your pet, downrank and bind all your utility spells, and want to use items and consumables optimally you'll easily have 50/60 binds to manage while constantly having to be on the move. 
---
So if you want a class that can do good in pvp with few keybinds and lag I'd recommend spriest. Rogues and mages can do well with not too many binds but they rely on timing so lag can be really punishing. Spriest has strong dots so it's not as much of an issue. Raids will probably want one spriest and that's it though so you'll need to respec or find an hybrid build that works for both content, if your guild is okay with that. PvP premades also like hybrid priests over shadow priests usually, if you're into that. Shadow is more of a 1v1/wpvp/BG fun spec. Priests are always wanted and are one of the few classes that get to wear their tier sets, and have a cool class quest at lvl 60. I never liked the fantasy but I have to say the class was really well designed in vanilla.

Transgender orc.

lol there was a guy named "BudSmoka" in my guild who they made change his name.

Wasn’t silithus completely unavailable until the lead up to the AQ patch though??

---
That Gnome master race doe.  Super stoked for my pink haired Gnome Mage.
---
This is my biggest worry finding a guild. I don't want to accidentally join one with a bunch of MAGA obsessives.
---
Had a red raptor I named PMS. Made some fun combat log, btw naming pets was a lot of fun.
---
especially Druids' Redemption and Priests' Divine Protection
---
Come on, we all know that the 4 horsemen required a 40-paladin raid.
---
Yeah I feel those two are really going to throw people off.
---
Noice info bro
---
You had me up until the no gsnmong part.
---
What do you consider "barely any gaming" because 60s in STV where the bane of my existence 30-45 in retail.
---
Maybe he is bribeable, but I hope he is also bearable - it is never easy enough to find a tank.
---
Again, dont take my word for it. Go look up top parses on RealmPlayers lol
---
I've decided on Human Warrior, but only if my wife levels with me, she usually mains a priest, honestly I dont care as long as it's something. I'm leaning towards hunter or rogue for my alt (or main if she stops playing before the warrior gets to 46ish
---
because people are stuck in the past with rose-tinted glasses and such things
---
Ughhh. I'm in the same boat man. Dad gaming does not leave me much time and I want to spend that time playing the game.
---
Ah got it
---
if you've got to 60 you are not casual.
---
I played a shaman in vanilla. I'm thinking of switching to alliance if I decide to play classic. Is tanking really that stressful? I like the idea of bein a badass in plate. Also, how bad is it really to level up as protection? I want to practice tanking in lower level instances, but I can't pay to respec all the time. Thanks.
---
5% smarter.  Cant beat that.
---
There was probably a sent X number of messages in X seconds, but I dont remember exactly. But yes you could use General chat
---
Honestly I think that there are a ton of systems in vanilla that are not the most well thought (including this awful one), but I think some people look forward to this grind. Personally I am a little confused by the decision to release it without battlegrounds because then the grind relies on teaming up with horde players, or just spawn camping leveling players.
---
My best MMO memories come from FFXI, but WoW isn't far behind. I really enjoyed my time in vanilla wow. It was such a drastic change from FFXI. People say vanilla was hardcore, and it was compared to retail, but it was casual compared to FFXI. Nice change of pace.
---
1.4 I believe
---
Warlock is pretty neat to level, you got voidwalker with taunt and you almost never have to drink. The voidwalker also helps you soloing harder mobs if you're alone. But personal I would chose mage over warlock, but maybe that's because I used to play one in vanilla and I've always loved their utility kit with blink, frost nova etc. :)
---
I asked another thing.
---
I understand that a pve server won't have any wPvP. However they will release the honor system in phase 2 for all servers I guess. By phase 3 when bgs are out even on pve servers you will be able to get a PvP rank. Am I right? You won't probably be able to get much far but you will have one.
---
Now my question is: on a PVE server you won't have a PvP rank till phase 3?
---
Pretty sure they will not be as predictable as they were on pservers.
---
Holy shit instead of ganking random I can tank streamers now..... 
---
The PvP action is gonna follow big streamers around like crazy. Their fans will be rushing to defend them while ganked try to gank them.
---
Then some poor little 2 sub streamer picking flowers will get rofl-stommped by the streamers Tauren Warrior fans while the rogue snipers just lol
---
LFM Hogger
---
Need help Jasperlode Mine!
---
That's what I mean.
---
Do your research on your Pre Bis gear and find a good group of friends to roll with, you can do almost anything casually until end end game Naxx and maybe AQ 40. That's not saying you won't be able to do those things as well though. Maybe check out a leveling guide and plan a route to max your time out. Just play smart and chill with friends.
---
Was thinking about this aswell. Hopefully this can happen, although I don't think it will happen before they release the server names. Neither will it happen before there is like a Swedish classic community. (found a discord server with like 72 members only) 
---
When I played retail it felt like all my friends who played on different servers moved to the bigger "Swedish" servers in the end. Would be nice to skip that part haha.
---
But I am with you! Tell me if you know of any Swedish communities or  what server will be the swedish/Scandinavian one in the future! :D
---
Do you have WoW buddies? If so, then rogue isn't so bad for grouping/gearing. If you're going at it alone, then you NEED to make friends along the way with healers/tanks/etc, or you might have a pretty lame time finding dungeon groups.
---
For example, when I'm putting a group together, I literally will not invite a rogue, unless no one else wants to come. The only times I will bring one, is if I know the rogue and he's well above average. I won't hesitate to invite other classes, though. If I'm a rogue, then there is 100% no way I'm inviting another rogue, no matter.
---
If you're talking about raids, then there are typically 5-6 rogue slots. So it's not tooo bad.
---
Turning in all those Librams has to suck.
---
You no take candle.
---
I do this except with undead mages/rogues.
---
Then another streamer comes along with a video about how Streamer A is bad because they're hogging all the resources and not giving anyone else a chance. And Street Brooklyn now has a comparable force.
---

Fuck you :)

Spending 90% of the run skinning and not helping for shit
---
Green wind serpent named Cthulhu. It looks excellent, has high dps, has a 20yd range nature damage lightning breath and gets agro quickly and holds it. It is excellent as a PvP pet as well as PvE.
---
Snarler!!!  Took forever to find him.  And when I did...blizzard announced next day they would be removing pet resistances.   😢
---
I am in a similar positon; Alliance Hunter/Paladin, or Horde Shaman. I would love to be usefull, take my time, bring some cooked food or pots/potions, scrolls etc.
---
But on the other side, I would love to be independent and able to do "mindless" grinding, and hunters are one of the few able to pull of some unique stunts, DM/Maraudon solo runs, kiting fun stuff, collecting pets etc.
---
Shamans are so aesthetically perfect, incredibly versatile, can never have enough of them, and able to be very aggressive in PvP.
---
Thrall didn't even want to let them join until the Earthern Ring (which was exclusively Tauren at this point) reminded him that those people faced the same troubles the Orcs did and that turning his back on them would prove he learned nothing from the last 4 wars that involved his people. However it is believed that the reason the Tauren were so protective of the Forsaken was that Magatha Grimtotem saw allies in them, allies that would help her people take Thunder Bluff from Cairne.
---
/2 [The Nicker]
---
Any spec can tank while leveling, just toss on a 1h and sword
---
Yes a normal res for 5 mans because it slows them down at 60 if someone dies.
---
I think the scarcity might be what started it - and started the nature of the chain. On my server, the second person who got it (the first person was a stoic, silent, IF bridge AFK kinda guy) would link it in chat every now and then just to be flashy, which would then start a chain cause suddenly everyone else could link it, as if they had the damn thing.
---
Rogues are very difficult at early levels of gear while warriors aren't so bad. That reverses with high gear levels. 
---
Soul link should win pretty much any 1v1 but melee are still very annoying to deal with. On the other hand, warlocks are great vs. casters so it's kinda like rock/paper/scissors.
---
it depends.. for pve i enjoy horde, because you can actually go 2h fury as orc. And for pvp i would favorise alliance not only because freedom but also because ally has more healers in pvp pugs and this makes a big difference
---
well. sap -&gt; cheapshot + stop AA. -&gt; cheapshot -&gt; backstab -&gt; eviscerate -&gt; profit
---
If you plan on raiding I would chose a class that’s easier to gear up with pre raid bis.  Healer for example takes less work than a melee class. I’ve been playing priest on a pserver lately myself.
---
This was me. I rerolled horde when TBC hit and made an undead rogue on a pvp server. He became my main until I quit in WOD. I wanted a cool name and google translated "blade". Got the name "Vesica".
---
Only took til wotlk before someone I was grouped with asked me "you do know your name is Latin for "bladder", right?" Oh how my guild laughed. 
---
Screw google translate.
---
tl;dr Grimtotem hag was always a bitch.
---
Hi, /u/madzzgj
---
Silithus was around before the AQ patch. There was a few quests, elementals, a great place to level mining. 
---
1.8 fleshed the zone out with more quests. 1.9 AQ release.
---
123
---
Male Undead Rogues
---
Sorry to hijack a thread directed more at EU realms, but do we know if theres going to be dedicated latin realms as well?
---
I do NOT want to get stuck with the players that are currently on Rag/Gally/Azralon, etc.
---
no?
---
If I wasn't married and my baby girl wouldn't be around I would dive in without a hesitation. Fuuuck. I feel like a heroin addict. I neeeeed this. Do I? I think I do.
---
Based on my experience in vanilla between the two I greatly preferred Priest healing for dungeons.  I had more utility for healing the group, I had shackle for undead, I had mind control for humanoid, etc..  Overall I always felt more in control while healing.
---
For PVP I did not like playing Priest as much as I did Druid for both BG's and wPVP.  Being able to heal with HoT's, Stealth, and SS into travel/aqua form to evade enemies was great.  I had some success using a hybrid spec on my druid I believe but it has been a long time.  Priest may have to respec for PvP effectiveness.
---
I hated not having Resurrection on my druid for Dungeon runs.
---
Shamans can spec into good heals and wicked burst dps.
---
Don't negotiate with changers
---
#neverforget :(
---
Lupos pre nerf when he still did shadow damage and ignored armor.
---
That won't get me to 60 any faster. Sounds terrible.
---
I wonder if they are going to tweak the war  supply requirements for AQ.  Otherwise it will be opened the instant it’s live.
---
Yeah there's a few early BC pets because that's when the site got archived.  But if you can't figure out that those pets aren't available, then you shouldn't be playing hunter maybe.  It's still the best site that has all pets/skills/where to find them.
---
You still need to grind the rep so have fun with that
---
I still can’t believe people are posting stupid shit acting like Blizz hasn’t always had a developers and creative department run by directors who are seeking to make a profit. Blizzard has always been a company with a view to profit, Activision didn’t just swoop in and change that.
---
About 6 to 8 hours a day on the server I was on. I was friends with most of the people in the premade so it didn't even feel like a grind. we all just BS'd on ventrilo and steamrolled people in arathi basin.
---
Whaaat how is that against tos
---
Reserved runs are legit if that person passes on ever other item in that dungeon.
---
Found the Rogue
---
&gt; I don't want server caps past vanilla since it will ruin the experience.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Nobody wants 10k+ servers because of Nost. Nobody wants 10k servers or higher than Vanilla server caps other than a handful of children who only played pservers.
---
You're right, not many want 10k servers, they want ~5k. Very few actually want 10k. Can you critically think as to why a 5k server will be better in the long run than a 2500capped server that needs merges? Like sit down and think a bit about it.
---
&gt; Go play retail or back to pservers with you. You'll be a tourist, anyhow.
---
:Thinking: I've only played WoW since Nov 04, yeah I'll be a tourist. Honestly haven't played much pservers since 2016. I might log on my rank13 druid and do some world pvp, then log off after a few minutes, because I want to keep the launch exciting. PS: No need to be toxic man, relax. Wondering, did you actually play during 04-06? Have you played on a popular pserver? PS2: Also, you realize blizz is all about making changes that instill the essence of vanilla into classic, even though they didn't happen during the original release, right? That's something they learned from pservers.
---
I guess we shall see.
---
I regularly see "Looking for guild" posts even when the sticky is at the top of the page. A lot of people don't look no matter how prominently stuff is displayed. Another sticky would just take up space. :)
---
Isn't loda swedish?
---
Most dungeons have a typical path that 99% of groups will follow with some packs that are easily avoidable. If you build a 5-man team with specific classes for CC and evasion abilities (hunter's feign death can be fun as hell) then yeah you can do some fun things. Tribute runs in particular sound like they'd be up your alley.
---
Sharding is a hard topic.
---
They could just make dozens of additional servers so the leveling zones won't be as crowded.
---
But the problem is that after some time will start to abandon the game and the servers will become more and more deserted.
---
I personally would take no sharding any day and just suck up the inconvenience of leveling.
---
Nah, 3/3 is still only 90%
---
My favorite was Echeyakee, just such an awesome looking pet especially that early.
---
God that pissed me off. You ask for help in the general chat with a higher level guy camping you over and over again and they just tell you to play on a pve server if you don't like it. As if the point of a pvp server is to just get teabagged by someone higher level over and over. No dude, the point is to rally people to come and help you out, 5 lvl 35s can take down a level 45 pretty easily.
---
So I am going to be playing Druid, My Duo Buddy will be playing a Shammy, We were going to recruit a Warlock for the Summon, and then the other two I guess could be CC classes.
---
This! And learn the sneaky jumps in WSG!
---
First skip that comes to mind is in Scholo, skipping the room before the Viewing Room. Once you get the key off Rattlegore, you have someone (preferably Hunter or Rogue) pull the whole room from the raised platform above that you first enter the dungeon on. While all the mobs start pathing back to the entrance, rest of the group jumps down, unlocks, and enters the Viewing Room, then the puller either feigns/vanishes or dies in the room within LoS for rezzing. Even after the reduction of mobs that happened when dungeons got capped at 5 players, that room had some pretty tricky pulls. Saved time or headaches if your group was undergeared or the tank wasn't great at pulling.
---
So if you’re In a group on coms this is normally how it goes down.
---
Mark up everything for the pull with stars circles and squares and whatnot.  Usually if you sap you’re spec’d so you don’t break stealth but if not you all have to act quickly.  Mage would poly while the mob was running and priest could shackle.  You cold also have a hunter trap and feign death and the tank would grab up the extras.  
---
If you had a hunter, mage, priest, rogue , and warrior it goes pretty smooth.  Usually the tank would only have to hold agro on one target.  Sap is usually broken next because you can’t resap. Then hit the trap and poly or shackle at the end.  This would total in 4 total cc’d targets allowing you to handle groups of 5 mobs easily.  With a good warrior and proper heals though 2 cc’s were just fine.  Just make sure you’re focusing on what the warrior is targeting, kill, Warrior grabs the next mob (usually right before target is completely dead), then just repeat until all the mobs are down.  
---
Don’t forget in some places warlocks can banish, druids can also root, and even paladins and warriors have a small stun.
---
In a push with good heals a rogue can stun lock and evasion tank, same goes with some hunter and warlock pets.  Succubus can also charm...
---
this is the FBI don't move
---
Just disappointment. Just lost a 3/4ths of my total power.
---
Apparently drug-related?
---
it must be nice to be able to convince yourself that you are not a bad player simply by choosing a server type.
---
let me guess... rogue?
---
Same boat here. World PvP is rarely ever fair or fun. It almost exclusively consists of ganking someone who isn't in a position to fight back. The fact that virtually all of the live PvP servers were 90% loaded towards one faction by the time Legion ended to the point that Blizzard literally decided to make world PvP an opt-in feature in BFA says the majority of players agree with you.
---
Did you even play in  04-06? This happened constantly to me while I was leveling alts. One of the main reasons I had so many alts was because I just logged out when getting camped and played something else in a different zone while he waited for me to rez.

I'm making an alliance NOR/SWE only guild, and I also have contact with other norwegian guild masters for both factions. We will try to roll on the same server. I only hope we get those RP PVP servers cuz if we do, that's where we will be.
---
The game and the subreddit is named "classic". Nowhere does it say this has to be the base game only.
---
&gt; I am not going to give up my spot but you can have 1k G when you ding 60 if you do it right.
---
I'm not gonna tell you how you can do it, but *trust* me you can for sure do it.   
---
I bet you have a girlfriend that goes to another school, too.

warlock
---
Never really understood if people were actually like this, and they all just gravitated to rogues naturally.
---
Or people just submit to the meme religiously and just be shitty to be shitty cause they are a rogue.
---
Not saying *all* Rogues are that way but there is certainly a pattern.
---
What exactly are you asking? Youre asking if its do able, but have also seen videoes of it being done - So, are you wondering if the mediocre guild will be doing it? 
---
The thing about trash skips is that it only takes 1 guy to (most likely) wipe the entire raid. Some of the skips are very tricky to do since they require coordination from several people. For instance for the some of the BWL skips no one in the raid can use an item that changes their character (say noggenfogger), and everyone has to disable pets etc. 
---
In my experience, in mediocore guilds there is always one guy not paying attention and then its just better to clear the trash. 
---
The problem with wiping the entire raid is that you will lose your (buffs) and a full ress normally takes longer than killing a pack.
---
Yeah, but I'm not trying to kill them in my version.  Just waste like 90 seconds of their time and then Sprint away into the sunset.
---
I played both to lvl 60 on a fast rate pserver. They are very similar, but Warlock is more complicated to play since they have to manage pet, have more complicated spell rotation and some spells require Soul Shard which you have to farm from mobs. 
---
Mages have a more simple spell rotation and they don't have to farm anything since they can conjure food and drinks. You can teleport to all 3 major cities which is super convenient when leveling.
---
Warlocks will be most likely more in-demand, but I would still recommend you playing a mage.
---
It's one of those, you could be right but you are most likely wrong.
---
We get it
---
Worst case, and simplest scenario: buy the level 15 Smoldering Wand from one of the major cities. It's certainly later than the earliest enchanting wands, but completely eliminates any need to mess with professions, the AH, or other players.
---
You do it with spell batching. After the tank pulled you got half a second to sap.
---
Can't decide between Rogue and Warrior, for PvP and casual raids. I had a Warrior alt in Vanilla that became my main for later expansions, so I'm very familiar with it, but I barely had a chance to offtank/DPS Vanilla raids and found it SUPER fun. I would love to experience that as part of an actual raiding guild. Plus my friend's rolling a healer, so in PvP I'll have a pocket healer and we'd have no trouble running dungeons. Fundamentally I'm a warrior player in RPGs, I like charging in and starting fights. 
---
But...I always kinda wanted to have a Rogue, too. They were always my nemesis in PvP and it's a chance to try joining the dark side. Playing a new class might freshen the 15-year old game for me a bit. I'm all too familiar with the Warrior skillset, and it's hard to get that excited to be charging, mortal striking, hamstringing, etc. Fundamental Warrior gameplay didn't actually change THAT much over the expansions except to lose stances. Plus I'll be fairly casual this time. I'm worried about the time and gold investment that Warriors need to raid and acquire gear. I'm hoping to raid, but I won't be at the cutting edge by any means. Rogue seems infinitely better at world PvP, still can benefit from a pocket healer, and should perform better with low gold and gear. 
---
Ahhh!
---
I've seen it done in the MDI so that is BFA. What I'm wondering if those Mythic dungeon style speed runs are something that happens these days. 
---
I haven't personally seen footage of it however.
---
ty for the reply anyway, I'm already considering going Rogue too :D he's gonna be ret
---
Thats where you use emotes.  Not custom ones (theyre just gibberish), but you can always point and laugh at them.
---
On the other hand, you're very unlikely to get full T2 plus your BWL BiS weapon(s) in 11 weeks. There will absolutely be a considerable stretch of time where those with R13 or 14 will be vastly better geared than raid guilds that clear all content every week. If you're not being fed a disproportionally high amount of loot, the average time to obtain full T2 is like four months, so if the ranked rewards are made available during T1, there will be a lot of players who have the R13 set before anyone has even half a set of BWL gear.
---
WC blessing is so freaking good. Having that and onyxia buff when low level makes you a beast. Had it on my level 9 hunter and my pet was able to easily tank 4+ mobs at a time.
---
I'm talking about the chat toxicity, not camping. I think you mistook my comment for an independent one.
---
Not sure what you mean by "style", people skip more trash packs than they did back in 2005 if thats what you mean.
---
Well the idea is to mess with professions early to grow organically into your ultimate profession goal. It also gets you a wand faster.
---
same.
---
You'll probably have to go tank since druid tanks have stealth and can skip mobs that way. Mages are always useful.
---
Haha very true.
---
I have a whole series of vietnam rock to listen to while in STV.
---
The community seemed to want no changes, this phasing is closer to it than releasing BGs simultaneously
---
When BGs got released, specially cross BGs, world pvp died in my server. I'll be happy to see it again for a little while

No old school mounts? Completely unplayable. No ChAnGeS!
---
People won't be obsessing about T0 pieces so much.
---
There is a guild called working adults guild floating around on here. I’m looking to join that.
---
These are strictly my opinions and I could be entirely wrong. I raided high end in vanilla and pvpd enough but nothing past rank 10. 
---
&gt; 1. How do priests do in open world pvp - will every rogue and warrior I run into eat me alive?
---
They do fine, but it'll never be a quick battle if you're holy/disc. You have to make the decision early if you're gonna try and stall and run and hope they get bored. Or Outlast them and win after a couple minutes. Shadow is the best 1v1 spec however imo.
---
&gt; 2. Will druids be invited to premade BGs outside of the one you need for flag carrying?
---
At some point any healer will do. Unless you're with an ultra try hard group you'll usually always have a place.
---
&gt; 3. Which class will allow me to use my healing PvP spec for PVE dungeons and be successful?
---
I'd say they'd both be fine with dungeons but I'd give the edge to priest. But if you're not a flag runner and you're a pure healer it should be ok in both.
---
&gt; 4. How much of a pain is it to not have a resurrection on a druid for dungeon runs?
---
In my experience you go into runs not expecting to wipe even if you know you are. Battle rez is always a plus but running back is pretty expected and people should get used to it pretty quickly.
---
&gt; 5. Which healer would a DPS be more happy to see in a Arathi Basin group? 
---
Probably priest. But in my experience having ANY class that wanted to heal me when I was dps was amazing. They're always a welcome site.
---
Early you'll be in a rough spot but as you level and get high stam gear at 60 you'll start to win just about every 1v1 you come across.
---
An old friend I played with at the beginning of BC camped and camped for this pink hawkstrider from Mulgore. She loved that little thing. Playing with her and the few other guildies we had as we leveled up was so much fun to start the xpac. Zumwa I hope you're still out there and enjoying wow.
---
And my axe!
---
This is why you roll for the privilege to skin not after doing so.
---
You can also always run a NE hunter and shadowmeld ;)
---
DUAL WIELD AND SHOW THEM DUNGEON RATS WHO IS THE BOSS IN TOWN!!!!
---
Or.. get destroyed and kicked from the group :(
---
If you and the warrior will be playing a lot together shaman will pair nicely.
---
If we focus on rank 14 for weapons which has the biggest impact on pve and pvp, It takes minimum 12 weeks to go from rank 1 to 14, if you constantly are the first of your faction, so technically, you will not have lots of people with insane stuff before phase 3. 
---
After that, consider the impact on rank 14 weapons minimal, as you might have another rank 14 every 1 week maximum on average.
---
Demonstration:
---
From rank 13 to 14, you need to go from 55k to to 60k rp. You have a 20% RP decay per week, so minimum 11k.
---
If you are first, you earn 13k rp, if you are within the 0.2% (assuming 2000 players of a faction which is big, you have to be in the top 4...) of your faction, you gain 12k rp, else, you gain 11k or less so you will remain at the same rank of diminish.
---
Basically, 5k points maximum are distributed to rank 13 players per week (if they all are in top 4), meaning that you might have maximum 1 rank 14 per week on average. (Maximum if people coordinate, which is was the case on my server, on average because you might have multiple people on the same week, and sometimes no one)
---
Oh boy, I hate the Barrens! Such a bland yet mandatory zone that takes foreeeever to get out of. I guess I just prefer the Eastern Kingdoms aesthetic overall.
---
Is that even a question? Mazzranache is undoubtedly the best pet in the game. His strength is unparalleled and his beauty knows no bounds. There is no greater beast.
---
My head says Druid because I can raid as Resto, but also be able to tank dungeons.  My heart says hunter because I just enjoy many things about how the class feels and the lore behind it.
---
Is finding groups as hard as hunter as some are making it out to be?  I would just hate to go with hunter only to regret it at 60 and feel compelled to re-roll to something more desirable for dungeons/raids.
---
.....um...oops
---
Is FD cool-down 15 min as it was in tbc?
---
Well your decision is whether or not you want a new experience or old one. Personally I want a new one but that is up to you.
---
You can kill the pirates for rep with the cartel, I think the tanaris pirates were the most efficient
---
They may not have changed the very basic concept of "companies want profits" but they absolutely changed the mentality of the company from "let's develop the most fun games possible and the profits will come naturally" to "lets crank out mobileshit for china dollars."
---
I tamed Ishamuhale, the red raptor you have to kill for a quest in the Barrens and kept him as my only pet to 60. Despite being on a pvp server I kinda low key role played my hunter. I came from WC3 RoC and TFT and to me it was only common sense to have a raptor pet as a Troll. My Troll also looked just like the WC3 Headhunter units, bar the face paint because despite WoW being out since 04 face paint is STILL linked to hair color ffs.
---
If we're being honest though I am not a pet collector and while he worked well enough for pve in pvp I never used a pet. Feign Death into an Ice Trap is literally the marksman hunters best utility and I couldn't use it with my pet. The fucker would combat lock me making it impossible to drop a trap after using Feign Death, I think it changed sometime late vanilla or tbc but eitherway it would still get me killed because he'd be standing next to me obviously alive while Im trying to fake an Alliance into thinking they killed me. I have fooled so many Alliance by feigning death at low health that unless they make him auto unsummon upon using FD then Ill probably not use a pet in pvp like I did in the past.
---
On a side note I hated the change where mounting desummoned my pet because I always thought it looked so cool for him to run next to you, sure he was liable to die but c'mon they coulda made him nuetral while mounted but noooo, ruin my immersion.
---
Those zg serpents do solid damage even if you aren't beast mastery. I like playing survival more than anything, but beastmastery with that thing is a blast.
---
A warrior who is unwilling to tank or a hybrid who is unwilling to heal can gtfo of any group I'm in. The whole point of group play is to play as a group (duh) and that means someone has to heal and someone has to tank.
---
The advantage of playing a warrior or hybrid is that you can get group content done easily because you are able to do that. Any warrior or hybrid that insists on dps'ing when they are needed for another role are being selfish players.
---
I'm speaking as a druid who will almost certainly be tanking and healing my way through dungeons to 60, and will probably be healing raids.
---
When I want to be 100% sure of being able to dps, I've got solo content for that.
---
Is it me or there is no link attached to your post ?
---
if youre duoing then priest plus lock youll have absolutely no downtime and youll both be very in demand for raiding plus horde is better :)
---
Read the community info you lazy peon.
---
Druids have the least slots of any healer in raids.
---
RIP ND Lupos. We had a good run boys, and holy shit were my 900 beast wrath crits felt throughout the Plate-wearing world
---
I've just been tweeting at Ion now and then reminding him that there is massive interest in RPPvP at launch. Sad state of affairs, I hope Blizzard does the right thing and releases an RPPvP server at launch.

---
I will take 100x more pleasure on a pvp server by doing everything in my power to stop streamers getting anything.
---
&gt;Pservers are full of people spamming for reserve runs for hours sometimes.
---
As someone who does a lot of reserve runs this is just flat out untrue. I can fill a reserve group to any instance I want in about 15minutes as a tank. Even if it took longer its much preferrable to running the dungeon 40 times and losing the roll on the item the first three times it drop.
---
I really don’t know if the stun resist will work as a flat 25% come vanilla. I think it might have diminishing effect after applied on top of the 15% base stun resist. If that is the case then it will be only like 7%  extra chance to resist a stun or something
---
My first character was a Tauren Warrior. I had a friend over, I was about 11 back then. We played for about 30 minutes each switching back and forth.
---
After a few quests my bags were full of Plainstrider loot. I had no idea how to sell stuff.
---
We looked around for, god knows how long until I called my uncle on the phone asking him how to sell stuff to which he replied "Hover over different NPCs untill your cursor becomes a pouch, click on that npc to sell and buy stuff. 
---
Cleared my bags and we continued our journey, I became level 9-10 where I spent all my silver on a crap mace from and NPC. 
---
Days went by, I became level 22-23 and it was there I finally noticed I havent chosen the right server to play together with my 3 uncles...
---
I started an Orc warrior on the right server after that.

When I play a druid it's because I *get* to tank 5 mans. It's a privilege not an obligation!
---
It's my money and I want it now
---
Activision became the parent company in 2008 and the wow shop didn’t go worldwide until 2013. So Activision oversaw WotLK, which was (imo) the best expansion WoW has done. They did Cataclysm and Legion which were fantastic expansions and MoP which was good. I think they only really missed the mark in Draenor and in BFA.
---
So to say they don’t want to make a ‘fun game’ is just complete bollocks.
---
I have only played druid at 60 in vanilla and while I did not do any PvE. (Wanted to save that experience for Classic)
---
However, I did a lot of PvP and I felt like druid was a pretty good class right out of the gate at 60 but it is a unique playstyle for sure and is something you have to consider. There are some good videos about the druid playstyle on youtube.  
---
You will most likely be expected to run the flag in WSG, which is fun but has a pretty high skillcap if you want to do it well. (World pvp as a druid is awesome in my opinion since you do not really die. You just run away if it is a bad matchup)
---
But as the other comment said: Shamans do have an easier time getting into pug raids and scale much better with gear if you go for the popular ele/resto build in PvP.
---
Shamans are also a very versatile class that has an answer to many situations but they are pretty easy targets in BGs unless you have some help from your team. Once you are geared you will be one of the highest bursting classes in the game. 
---
I strongly recommend both since they are super fun. I will most likely main one of these and have the other one as an alt.
---
No link , look it up worth a watch
---
Yeah Asmon has been slowly getting worse and worse in my opinion. Him quitting Bloodborne and whining about simplistic technical difficulties was what did it for me. Haven't really been back to watch since. It's sad but true.
---
You an actually skip a whole lot more than that. By doing the bridge pull, you can have the group jump down and invis pot into the room with all the whelps and drop into the holes near the wall.
---
Kill Rattlegore, loot the key and camp out of the instance. Do the bridge pull again and go for the last room.
---
The entire scholo run should take about 10minutes with a group that all use invis pots and dont screw up.
---
Off topic but is your name a reference to the mighty barbarian crag hack in the heroes of might and magic series?
---
nope its 25% straight up, vanilla doesnt have diminishing returns.
---
Fair enough :)
---
Orc Rogue or Undead Rogue?
---
Played most facets of both classes at 60. I raided up to naxx on my rogue and tanked/pvped a ton on my warrior. 
---
Rogue was fun because they were kings in vanilla. They are too tier dps in raids and their gear and weapons translate well to pvp. There are some fun builds in all 3 trees and some nice meme builds like seal fate/prep. Lockpicking is very useful and can let you into places like BRD and UBRS before you have the keys to do so. They are a very reagent based class, so you will need to have lots of vanishing powder, blinding powder, poisons, and thistle tea on you.
---
Warriors were tough as nails to get to max, but once you did they were a great class to play. I got to rank 11 on my warrior in vanilla, and smashed the hell out of people with an arms spec using Zin'rokh. I also did my fair share of tanking weekly ZG runs for our guild and managed to get him some gear in BWL towards the end of Vanilla. Nothing quite like being the guy the boss hits in the face while your raid murders it.
---
Where can I put in an order?
---
Fúria do trovão anal.
---
I'm going Skin/Herb for cash until I can realistically start getting Felcloth for the Mooncloth procs, then I'll drop skinning and powerlevel tailoring using saved and bought cloth. Once I have my robe, it depends how much money I'm making from Mooncloth or Mooncloth bags, I might drop it for alchemy if I don't fancy leveling an alt to 35.
---
how do you shadowmeld with that long, red beard?
---
I mean you can play however you want. But by talking about 0.002 delayed response (it’s much more than that too btw)it sounds like you’re making an argument in favour of clicking not being a big deal? Well it’s that delay on every single thing you click, so it actually adds up to a considerable amount. If you take 0.2 seconds longer on 5 abilities, I now have a whole second ahead of you. Click all you want man, but it’s a disadvantage. It matters WAY more in pvp, if you don’t care for pvp then I wouldn’t worry bout it.
---
Lmao legion fantastic.
---
Id lean forwards mage,  but both are great to have around. Warlocks are good wing men. Soul stone, curse of elements and summons will make people want you around. Mages are just as handy. Free food/water for you and your group is great. Especially with how tight money is in vanilla. Plus polymorph and frost nova is amazing for dungeons.
---
A one handed shield and sword, obviously.
---
Just PvP enough to get the blue set, it’s better than anything you will find in MC.
---
Put my app in for mod, hope to hear good news. :)
---
These posts makes it seem like it's the other way around, holy shit.
---
I suggest dropping redbull and using methamphetamine instead.
---
Start at 10mg around level 20, then double the dosage after every 5 levels. At 58 double it again.
---
A bit safer but more expensive alternative is cocaine.
---
In my opinion enchanting wands not worth it (at least a greater one, lesser maybe ok (especially for horde), but you get more regen at lower levels so usually not a problem to get to 10, where you can get your quest wand for alliance (darkshore quest)). kargoz is usually a smart guy but i don't know what he was thinking doing this video, jsut wanted to show a cool gimmick i guess, but its just a waste of time to do in term of efficiency especially on a new server, where there is a competition for mobs (even in case of sharding) and where you need to get ahead of the pack, and keep staying there you cant take your time to do professions. 
---
and bfd wand (you can get at like level 20-22) is better and will serve you for like 20 levels. and some wand you can get from questing arent much worse, than some from quests. So srsly don't knwo why would you bother with all of these.
---
another trick, you can just ask for wands at low levels (around level 5 and higher) in a general chat, "does anyone have a green wand drop?" green wands just drop for ppl (they drop for any class, fors instance a warrior that doesn't need it) sometimes so you can just buy it for some small price, or in debt, without bothering with any professions.
---
pretty much all non gathering profession you can level at 60 in a few hours just from ah without much problem. its time inefficient to bother with them while leveling.
---
because you get more gold at 60 from mobs/dungeon/farming etc., so its more efficient to get to 60 first and then level proffesions that you want.
---
so you just get truefaith vestement first, and then once you have it you level tailoring for it. and its fine. again tailoring is super easy to level. all you need is some gold (like 200).
---
btw thats how it works with many profs, if you get some cool rare recipe, you level professions for it. not other way around, cos without it profesion is usually quite useless. cos baseline crafting professions are pretty worseless on their own in vanilla, without coll rare recipes. (apart from engineering)
---
so ya, it honestly very straightforward, pick up skinning, vendor shit so you get enough money for mount, and then only bother with profession at 60.
---
if you want to rp, or something, thats the other story.
---
Guide to an early wand? Buy one, it is that easy. These wands are also a means to make gold so the AH will have them in no time.
---
It looks like your comment was an independent one, but I think I see what comment you meant to reply to.
---
What are your lists of negatives from your previous warrior(s)?  Seeing all the cons listed out might help you decide, plus other people might want to see that as well.
---
We will see.  After the way HotS and Hearthstone were monetized, they lost all of my good faith.  But then Overwatch rescued it, with the last of the Blizzard Old Guard (Jeff Kaplan) carrying the torch.  I will follow whatever industry path Kaplan blazes, but for the remainder of Blizzard, I'm in a state of cautious optimism.
---
Yeah I think streamers are going to be the ones that get scarab lord. I know my name says twitch\_booshies lol, but I'm not even going for it. I'm not big by any means and have a wife, kid and another full time job.  But the streamers that play 8-10 hours a day right now and will be big dicking it even more when its time will EASILY be able to do it. 
---
I think the hard part is hoping that there arent other guilds out there trying to dick people over. I think as soon as the first one is completed there needs to be some server collab to wait as long as possible to finish it so more people can possibly get it. Itll be rough those because those guilds will want to go into AQ. I think the best possible sollution is having someone finish the quest line on a tuesday night / wednesday afternoon and hold off on the final turn in a day or two to allow the other people to finish up. That way you get AQ runs in before reset but as many people as possible get the reward.
---
Holy nova is just enough to let you farm the lashers in DM, though that won't be an option early on.  Another option would be SM farms also with holy nova.
---
as a prot warrior, if you are your guild's main tank, just ask for stuff from the guild bank.
---
TBH I'd just level max dps retribution, tanking in dungeons should be really easy just from having mail/plate, if there IS an issue with staying alive, equip a shield. Make sure your gear is up to date (within 5ish levels) and has sufficient stamina, and be sure you're in a good level range of a dungeon. You shouldn't need to tank build until higher levels, dps levels you faster. But in the end it's up to you and your journey.
---
There is no greater, but he has a runner up: Strider Clutchmother.
---
Just like the pink king, Clutchmother is one of a kind, a single rare found in the most remote parts of Darkshore. And while she lacks his hot pink feathers, she dons a coat of turquoise and orange, like a neon sunset. 
---
All these people yearning for Ghost Sabers, stalking the northern ruins - if only they the ruins of south hold a beast far more magnificent.

The pet I spent days trying to get my hands on in vanilla. Humar the Pridelord. The black lion. I got him in 2005 and hes still my hunters main pet on retail today.
---
This really has almost nothing to do with Classic WoW and has been removed (Rule #1).
---
In Vanilla, I think I had a cat on my NE hunter, because it could stealth.  I didn't really know much about the game until TBC, however.  In TBC, I decided a bat was best for leveling, because Screech and Bite is a good combination (Screech is a focus dump, Bite is better than Claw if you need to use other abilities like Growl and Screech).
---
On a P Server I am on, I opted for a carrion bird instead of a bat.  Similar abilities, but I liked the stat layout better.
---
Once you get geared you’re not going to have too much trouble with any class 1v1 as a warlock.  People always say that shadow priests are the kings of 1v1 but honestly I think it goes to Warlock.  They may not be as flashy as a shadow priest but they have much more sustain and can even go 1v2 or 1v3 if they are skilled and have the gear.
---
Why do you think tanks and healer are in demand in vanilla? They live the hard life. Say goodbye to your epic mount, you will never get one.
---
omg yes!
---
People figured out the translator because you would spam nonsense words like SEE DO A P and it would translate into NO ANAL on the horde side. (Not I don't actually remember what translated into what, just providing an example)
---
I chose a warrior in vanilla so that I could beat on stuff and kill alliance, and had no interest in tanking. I didn't even learn defensive stance until I was almost 40 (though that was more because I was a nub). This time around I'll be rolling priest as I love healing. Tanking just isn't for everyone

I think the difference is that you didn't know certain things would be needed until the raid was released.  So before Naxx was released, players might not have stockpiled frost resist gear, but knowing ahead of time that Phase 6 will require Frost Resist gear, players might store it early.
---
Activision acquired blizzard in July of 2008 and lich king dropped in november of 2008. You really think that activision oversaw the development, marketing, balancing, and testing of a full wow expansion in 3 months time immediately after a merger?

As for Cata, Legion, and Kung Fu Panda - that's just like, your opinion man.

This was a classic

Leveling herbalism while you level is really inefficienct though. Skinning for sure, but it seems just as logical to swap out herbalism for Tailoring in that case on your leveling journey. Not only can you get the wands early, but you can level Tailoring organically, get Dreamweave gear around 40 and not have to worry about running in circles for herbs while you level. You could still drop Tailoring for herbalism once you're done with it while also choosing when to drop skinning (which could be for Alch if you don't want an alt). The issue in that case is whether or not it's worth the effort to go Engineering too.
---
The biggest issue tends to be finding tanks for example strat live and BFD never have enough tanks willing to go unless they are being bribed to do it. Really sucks because the BFD quest wand lasts a long time for casters.
---
I think you just have very little experience in starting full blown wars in PvP. You go wherever you're likely to attract people. In that past, that's been places like: SW Gate / IF Gate, SW / IF City, Tram. But, if you can't get inside that easily, you can start at places like Goldshire, Redridge, or Duskwood. In addition to those, any beginning zone of an expansion minus Wrath for some reason (HFP, Cata starting zones, etc).
---
You gank someone, especially if they're in some sort of large scale guild like alliance and IRON on KJ, and then everyone comes swarming in.
---
And if that person chose a PvP server, they've signed up for the potential of getting ganked. Not playing by some moralistic code you devise that becomes convenient when you don't feel like rerolling to a PvE server for some reason. I've leveled dozen of alts and have been camped as well. Yes, camping and getting camped sucks and I generally don't camp anyone who hasn't camped me, but that doesn't I suddenly denounce an entire person's moral character due to it. They're fucking with me in a video game. Is it annoying? Sure. But I can just log off and go do something else if need be, or call in friends, or get on my main and go fight them.
---
I hadn’t thought of it from that perspective before. Thanks. I remember getting WoW for Christmas in 2004 and not hitting 60 until late March or April 2005 - and I no-life’d it between college classes.
---
It could really take make several more months to hit 60 if I only play 10 hrs/week. However, I have a ton more experience with the game so I have a feeling it will not tale quite as long this time.
---
I hope that's sarcasm.
---
Watched a guy forming a bwl group LF 1 rogue (dft res). Was pretty funny to watch 45 minutes of shouting
---
Literal the act is the reward.
---
In my experience, bag space has been more valuable than future use of an item in most cases.  Unless it's going to be BIS, I think people would opt to clear their bags of items that aren't going to be used for a long time. 
---
For example, in Phase 1 &amp; 2, I don't think the Frost Resist gear that players will use in Naxx will be stored, because Naxx is so far away (unless that gear is BIS and/or nobody will buy it off the AH because they don't want to waste their bag space).  
---
But in Phase 5, players might start looking into farming frost resist gear.
---
If you were horde... and typed J I A F F ... things happened
---
One option is to roll them both, and I would recommend going to 60 with the mage first.  Play that class as a main because they are just damn fun and easier to gear and survive world PvP with during Phase 2.  
---
Then level a warrior in your off time and feed him gear and cash from your mage.  Leveling will be so much nicer. 
---
If you only want to pick one, I would go warrior.  They take a much longer time to ramp up so better to get started early.  Plus if you can hit 60 in phase 1 you will be absolutely spammed with invites to tank dungeons.
---
&gt; The only part of the chain that involves actual skill is the 5 hour BWL run
---
The Eranikus fight in Moonglade is easily more difficult than the stupid timed BWL.
---
zug zug
---
Honestly it’s really up to you. Female undead has sick animations (you do a flip when you evisc) and wotf is amazing for pvp.
---
However, if you plan to be a raider, orc is objectively better. The racial is essentially a free 150-200ap trinket and it doesn’t break stealth so you can use it pre-opener in pvp. Additionally, the 25% stun resist racial of orcs is god-tier.
---
No I suspect they managed the 2 years it was active? It also wasn’t a merger it was a share acquisition. Which is exactly my point, the business would still have been run by the same people. Yeah my opinion, widely shared, take a look at the forums.
---
You could always work both at the same time. Keep Sword MH/Dagger OH while leveling to keep both skilled up so you dont want to waste time doing that at 60.
---
I wanted to main a warrior like i did back in the day. But seeing how many warriors there are gonna be Im thinking something else. What’s the best class that can be either a healer or dps. I would like to level as a dps and possibly role a healer in raids later on...
---
LoL, childish? I’m 29 and i still fully speak Barren Chat..
---
Idk if it was a server thing or faction thing, but all the Horde would say "Tell" for a private message, and the Alliance would say "Whisper"
---
Just farm DMT (if it is possible)
---
You can do it almost as fast as a hunter.
---
&gt; Then they make an alt account to talk shit to you on there if you’re not on a pvp server.
---
That's the real one, it should've made the starter pack. It seemed like every asshole always had a second account entirely devoted to harassing anyone he killed.
---
How much more further is it from DM than Feathermoon?
---
It's not that you can't get a wand other ways, it's just that this gaurentees a wand and potentially sets up your future professions. A good point on recipes though -- I forgot you don't need to have the profession ot get the recipe in Vannilla. But still, there's no harm in Tailoring being your second profession in your example--you can level it however you like, ideally getting the Dreamweave gear around 40. Oppositely, if you wanted Enchanting, there's no harm in that being your second profession. Just like with Tailoring, there's no requirement to actively level it while you level unlike the gathering professions. 
---
We all agree that skinning is a must, but it seems to be helpful to level either Tailoring (which you'll need to level regardless eventually) or Enchanting (should you want it end game) from the start. The gain in doing so gets you the early wands and saves you time at the end all for very little time investment at the start.
---
What? Owls are meta on pservers
---
I really wanted to go Warrior this time. I played Hunter in Vanilla and Priest in BC/WotLK/Cata. 
---
My research so far indicates pre-raid BIS for Prot or Fury is no walk in the park - but by the time I hit 60, maybe DM will be out so it won’t be so bad.
---
Maybe I can actually get Dal’rends this time!
---
Only way to get honor prior to BGs is world PvP. So unless people on a PvE server flag themselves by choice, there’s no way to get honor prior to phase 3.
---
Now here are the real questions real people are asking:
---
Will T2 have their [original placeholders](https://external-preview.redd.it/Txh9b2piEdknq6PlZ7wFS8onKvqiYjW8QV4zt1HQ3LE.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=5c7139b69d37a15d6d2c7d643d6e28f51c816b8e) before Phase 5 (Patch 1.9)?  These are important questions, I want to have my neat sultans hat as a warlock.
---
Well using this method, you could be the one selling them if you wanted. Or not, that's your call on time investment.
---
DM wont be out for quite a while though
---
I would’ve made the Phase 2 graphic spread buttcheeks with a horde and alliance tattoo on each cheek.
---
No other notes, great job!
---
Dm wont be out for a long time, and he is talking about first few months specificly
---
Can anyone confirm that having a pet out will keep you in combat when you FD? I was looking forward to using the FD/Frost Trap in wPvP and not being able to do this with a pet would be a bummer.
---
Maybe you are childlish then. Not that 29 is really grown up. Which makes you around 15-16 years back then. Ofcourse you love it.  People praise this friggin local chat like something godlike. And all I see is stupid toxicity and retarded spam.
---
Hmm... Will probs go mage. A friend of mine is rolling lock so will probably be better.
---
Don't forget druid hibernate
---
You could always manually type out [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] though
---
The low level wands are a gigantic help to priests but I find in the amount of time it takes me to make a wand I would level outside the range it would be useful. You just don't get enough greens at low level as a solo player to level enchanting fast enough for it to be useful. The only scenario you are making it early enough to be useful is having people funnel you greens or buying material off the AH which at that point why not just buy the wand? Plus spending time leveling this stuff slows down your normal leveling a lot.
---
There's a simple rule to follow. Take the server that starts with the first letter your country starts with.
---
I hope guilds that compete for world firsts on retail will also compete for world firsts on Classic. It would be really cool to see, especially Rag and Ony due to the rush to 60.
---
I really, really appreciate you taking the time to respond. I really want to play druid, but I also want to be competitive in PVP and I'm feeling like I can't do that unless I raid (which I'm not really interested in doing). Unfortauntely it seems like I won't be able to play druid, or that I should stop at 49 and remain there. At least at 49 I can gear up very well and that will put me on an even playing field with players who aren't twinked lol. I really just wish they would treat classic like an organic game and make balance changes so that more classes can be played in a fair way. They could
---
Nobody is talking about this but it is all I am thinking about.
---
Meh, I'm doing herbalism while I level because I'm never gonna get rid of it, and doing it from scratch at 60 feels like such a colossal chore. I may have to spend a little extra time in zones picking but I'll grind XP while I do it. If I find at any point before I'm 40 that I'm way behind, I'll wait, get the mount+carrot+spurs+enchant and go back to catch up. Considering I'll be 40 in a few IRL days it's really not worth the headache in working out how efficient it is, for me at least.
---
Thanks, how would that hybrid build look like? Is it that hard to find a raid spot as a pure spriest?
---
This is the classic subreddit sir, not bfa
---
Personally, I think a guild can be serious about progression without having all these over-the-top requirements . All you need are people who will log on consistently to raid. People should have a raid related spec and raid "ready" gear.  They should have reagents, mana/health potions, food/water and a basic understanding of what their role will be in the upcoming encounter(s). That is all you really need for a guild to find success. I think the only thing we did in Vanilla was ask our guildies to save the head buff for progression night, which is reasonable imo.
---
With gear and practice, raids become faster and "easier".
---
This is the type of guild I want to be in. This is likely the type of guild I will help create. Serious about raiding, two times a week, 3 hour raids. We won't have server firsts or clear all of MC in the first week, but we'll have MC done before BWL is live, BWL done before ZG, and AQ40 before Naxx.  
---
I am sure the race for world/server "firsts" are fun, but players will be burnt out, especially as they feel they are "done" with content and just waiting for whats next.  It'll cause drama/unrest/attrition.
---
Yes, but do you have a healing set for when there's a warrior tank in the group?  :P
---
Go warrior! I think if you don’t, whenever you see another warrior in cool gear you’ll think “that could have been me.” 
---
As for the time you can play: you’ll eventually get geared as long as you don’t quit. Plus as a warrior if you’ve only got a couple hours, you won’t have to wait around for 30 minutes trying to find a tank if you want to run a dungeon.
---
Unless you want weapons - hunter for example in full T1 w Rok bow is going to have a better QoL than pvp-only-guy
---
Supporting a product that is already developed =/= developing that product from scratch. Activision was not in charge during the braintrust meetings that defined what WOTLK was. They bought a gold mine and it was essentially a turnkey operation at that point.  I didn't realize that a shared opinion makes it more valid lol
---
Seconding this. Played all classes to the end in one xpack or the other, but never toucher a hunter. The amount of interesting tools, skills, pets, techniques and quirks they have in vanilla makes me wanna play one with my limited time, but I also have a strong love for playing hybrid support classes like shamans, druids and paladins... The wonderfull agony
---
Back in the day there was a video of and MC run where the group split up into 2 groups.  They tackled multiple bosses at the same time, one group hitting lucifron and magmadar while the other group hit gehennes and garr.  It was pretty amazing.  If someone knows where its at I'd love to see that one again.
---
You get reduced honor if you kill the same guy repeatedly during the same 24-hour window. After a few kills, they don't really give much. The honor gain also depends on the victim's rank, and someone 40-boxing throwaway characters will not be very high ranked. You could probably get an okay chunk of daily honor from killing 40 characters a few times each, but I don't think it'll be enough to sell it as a service.
---
What will happen is people AFKing in BGs up to R10 or something and selling the character. That's a lot easier to do and we've seen how difficult it is for Blizzard to deal with this kind of abuse since it requires player reports and individual investigations. It only takes like a month or so to get to R10, so if there's dozens of players doing this with multiple accounts on every server, plenty of those characters will fly under the radar and get sold.
---
Hi, /u/bass619
---
Gathering professions and/or killing elemental's one at a time for their crafting materials. At least that's what I did on my Holy Priest on a private server. Once DM has been released you can farm that as a Holy Priest. There's no need to spend gold every week to respec for farming IMO.
---
Devilsaur leather before the mafia is set up, herbs in general, farming good vendor trash. 
---
There's always options, you just don't have better ones until phase 2.
---
Hmm, didn't consider the effects of lag on healing, now i'm really thinking about going mage... You think it'll be hard to get a raid spot? I know guilds need a lot of them but don't know how populated the class is.
---
I love it... i thought i'd try it out i loved it so much i bought the mouse to go with it.. 5/5 so far doesn't seem like the tiles wear down either.
---
There are drops that are available only during the Scourge Invasion at the start of Phase 6
---
Being able to summon the lazy tank is what got me into a lot of 5m dungeon groups in the first place. Their selfish behavior makes warlocks more desirable as a class.
---
I remember being invited to a UD strat group at 57 back when people used to run groups of 10. They said all I had to do was run to the instance and summon the tank, then I could afk the rest of the dungeon. I didn't afk it, but my dps was terrible. Yay for lazy tanks.
---
Group up with a guildie or two. I always played with a friend and we would aoe down shit like crazy. Prot warrior and a mage can farm A LOT. Same with a healer having a pocket DPS.
---
Remember, it's not a solo game like retail.
---
Armored boar from RFK. Accept no lesser substitute.
---
Everyone wants to main a warrior because in the end game you have great prospects. Reaching end game is a totally different story. I'd be surprised if warriors didn't end up as the class most rerolled away from during the leveling period.
---
I can't find the quota now, I believe it was on classic cast, but a previous admin to a private server said some where in the region of 70% of warriors reroll before level 60 and that was far and a way higher then any other class based on their data
---
Vanilla wow did not have level restrictions on chat and I don't see any reason to change that now. Pservers implemented these restrictions in a futile attempt to combat gold seller spam, because those servers are free to play on so it's easy to churn out account after account all day erry day to keep the spam going. Additionally, level 10 isn't a very effective cutoff. It's really easy to get to level 10, even in vanilla. The fact that it takes longer than just logging on isn't in and of itself much of a deterrent.
---
Classic is going to share a subscription with BFA, meaning it's going to cost $15/month to play. That paywall is a significant deterrent for most of the two-bit operations that plague free private servers. Additionally, Blizzard has software and staffing that pservers don't, and so they are able to be more on top of this than pserver staff are.
---
Lastly, we have to remember that at least one pserver was literally spawning gold and PvP-ranked characters to sell and were directly contributing to the gold seller spam by providing the gold to be sold in the first place, which means even less incentive to deal with the problem.
---
Yes, I do! However I almost never use that set because I'm making the groups myself as a tank.
---
I like that we're still calling everyone who works at/for/with Blizzard "Blizzard".
---
We trust the Classic team, because they're the ones making the good calls. No one said that the classic team's good choices are causing us to trust the money men.
---
i think there are a lot of players who are in the same boat since so much time has passed since vanilla and there is a lot of return interest. i'm planning on just going at whatever pace i can since i don't have the time to no life this game anymore.
---
It does discourage literally invading a quest hub and clearing out all the NPCs etc. Without DKs, a few level 60s could just take over something like Crossroads and render the entire Barrens unplayable for as long as they think it's funny. DKs make this difficult to do because the civilians will keep respawning and attacking.
---
First question is: hunter or druid? I main both classes in retail, primarily the druid, and love them equally. While I play my druid more, my hunter was my first character and is way nostalgic. Arguments so far:
---
\- I like supporting people. Druid can do that, hunters can't.
---
\- Druids fill a niche and are always wanted. I won't bring anything unique as a hunter.
---
\- I love the pet mechanics beyond anything else, even the druid forms.
---
\- I'm kinda sick of not seeing my armor as a druid. Points to hunter.
---
\- I'm extremely nervous when it comes to tanking/healing, and I'm new to classic dungeons above 30. I'm talking "so nervous you literally start to shake" levels here. I don't mind healing/tanking in the open world, but as a druid I'll have to deal with dungeons sooner or later, and while you eventually learn, I want to play this game to relax. Hunter will never have to worry about that. It'll make me seek out dungeons twice as often, and if they're my first character I can sue them to learn the dungeons, and then return with a druid alt.
---
What do you think?
---
\---
---
And then there's this one, which is weird but... I'm thinking of doing an "try-everything" challenge. Two servers, one for Horde and one for Alliance. Eight characters, one for each gender and race, spanning all eight classes available to each faction. Obviously I'll never finish that challenge, but after thinking about it, it sounds interesting and forces me to try races/genders I haven't done previously.
---
Do you think this sounds like an idea? Problem is it means I'll be restricting in playing what I know I like, which could also be a problem since I'm rolling on an RP server. Or maybe I should just do it half-half and consciously try some things I haven't done before, while still keeping around a few favorites. 
---
Actually, I might do that instead.
---
Whoever decided spammable crowd control with no diminshing returns was a good idea, clearly didn't actually play the game.
---
Fear ward is amazing for raiding. Many raid bosses have aoe fears, especially in the early tiers. Fear ward takes the edge off a lot of fights that rely on that mechanic. It's a great bonus racial, but at the end of the day you need to play what you want. Any race can be good at any class - it's all about the player manning the keyboard and how good they are at what they do.
---
As for warrior - you can tank all the 5 mans and 10 mans as DPS specs. Just let your group know ahead of time to ease up on DPS on initial pulls. Also, make sure you experiment with your abilities so you learn what works and what doesn't work when holding aggro. Most 5-10 man content will be tab/sunder, but you can do some mild aoe tanking with demo shout and shield spikes. There are also potions you can pop to give yourself a fire based thorns aura that stacks with a druid's thorns.
---
You are just too stupid to understand the context.
---
As twas the classuc experience
---
Ghost saber and the blue/white tiger from the quest at the very north edge of winter spring under what I dubbed Pride Rock that was freaking tough to tame whose name escapes me. Those were my two favorite!
---
I know, but it's a common mistake.
---
Exactly. I wouldn't go anywhere near a streamer guild. Especially if they were GM. Loot drama inevitable
---
That's the thing, there are no niceties when it comes to this quest chain. It happened before either on a private server or vanilla WoW where two guilds made a deal to wait so more people could get it, then the one guild handed it in in the middle of the night and nobody in the other guild could get it by the time they found out.
---
Guilds are going to be lusting to screw each other over this time. Especially if it's a streamer's guild. Saying they'll easily be able to do it is ridiculous imo, there are so many factors where you can get delayed. Streamers aren't the only people in the world who can invest many hours.
---
Back in the day it was more like /1 PENIS
---
Anal Thunderfury was more Cata/MoP.
---
I suppose in a few hours I'll decide whether I actually want this comment in my post history.
---
Same.  RIP Stinky
---
Your pet will lock you in combat when you feign death, the way to counter that is to press ctrl+2 which makes him stop attacking. Once you get that down its easy.
---
Well, he has to get to level 60 first, which will take a lot of time, especially for a casual. Then he needs to find a group for MC or Ony first which can also take quite some time.
---
There's going to be large numbers of people with the full R13 epic set. The R13 grind is way shorter than R14, you can do it in two months if you put in a lot of hours and there's room for several new 13s per week as opposed to 14 which is usually just one per faction. If you don't think that it'll be problematic for PvP balance that a sizeable subset of the playerbase will have full sets of T2.5-equivalent gear just a handful of months into Classic, I'd like to see your reaction when that does indeed happen and nobody can compete with those players for many months.
---
A crab from darkshore named mr snips
---
I mean everyone kept Ony scales around as soon as they dropped, so that wasnt a big issue until you realized you just needed a bunch of cloaks for Nef (and most people used them for Drakes too, because, well, people were worse back then).
---
Items that were farmed for speculative future content were never valuable. There were very occasional people who farmed them (things like Wildhammer rep or that random phylactery that was rumoured to be part of an Ashbringer questline, but that was BoP as well), but it didnt affect the economy.
---
If youre wondering about preraid gear, its very different on pservers. People didnt really farm "BiS preraid gear" back then, they just got some half decent items and then raided generally. Dungeon popularity tended to be rather equal across the board (except I remember LBRS was still woefully unpopular). On pservers, most people tend to be after specific items/bosses. Casters rarely do BRD (except after the gear update, and even then, only for Arena) and its super heavy on melee, while melee almost never do Scholo (except Warriors post gear update) and is really heavy on casters.
---
As for most of these "meta" type questions, well probably see somewhat of a mix. It will most likely be similar to back when I started playing pservers back in 2011, where theres still the tryhards that played back in the day, but with a majority of retail noobs that are just kind of all over the place.
---
Only issue with this is it sometimes drop you 200 yards up in the air when you teleport. Not optimal when you have a bunch of world buffs. If you have slow fall or quick on the blink button its ok though I guess.
---
Instead of a spec that can ONLY raid, but is highly optimised to do so, try to find a compromise. Go for a build that can do both solo PvE AND raiding, even if it can't do either as well as a pure/dedicated spec.
---
5 more min.
---
Yeah, but sometimes that tank is a guildie.
---
I had a lot of fun healing as feral with HOTW and a +int gear set. Mana regen... who needs it? My mana pool was insanely huge.
---
Scattershot makes your pet passive and if you are not using scattershot in pvp you are doing it wrong.  Always use it against a rogue, it's free dps with no downside and does not let him imp. gouge you + restealth. Never against a warrior, it gives him free overpowers and they can mass taunt it to break the freezing trap.
---
Clumsy dorf
---
Undead rogues have the added benefit of instilling a primal fear into anyone that watched a PvP montage from 2005 - 2007 which is worth considering.
---
As Alliance mage I do Tanaris. It's conveniently located for Ony, DM and Silithus. Plus it has a bank.
---
Warriors, Warlocks, Shadow Priests, and Shamans can beat them fairly easily. Good Mage wins more often than not. Depends on if they have Engineering or not, but Rogues and Hunters can beat them pretty reliably as well. You guys must be remembering T2+ druids vs fresh 60's or something. Druids are only good when they have the right gear. And then all they do is win through attrition. Most people can just go away from them if they are gonna get outlasted.
---
Hunter is a good choice, because you can solo the best. Helps if you don't have a ton of time to dedicate towards finding groups, not to mention being the fastest levelers. You also aren't as reliant on gear as other classes
---
Yeah for sure. That's why I still kept a healing set.
---
Sap/Sprint, Sheep, Charge worked fine for lots of stuff.
---
The thing is that you only have 16 debuff slots for your raid so you need to be strategic. You'll usually take one spriest for the shadow vulnerability debuff, to boost warlock dps. Considering lack of hit gear for warlocks in phase 1, I'm not even sure guilds will bother with that at the start. One priest can take the shadow vulnerability talents and still heal so some guilds will do that too. SW:Pain and Mind Flay take debuff slots so you can't have several priests dpsing in a raid for sure. To find a raid spot you have to be the one priest that your raid will allow to go shadow so yeah it can be hard but not impossible.
---
I'm no priest expert but theey have different hybrid builds for pvp, for instance you can go 21 in shadow for Silence and put the rest in Holy or Disc. Obviously if you want to heal raid and heal/support in pvp without respec it's probably better to go Holy/Disc hybrid. Still, some talents are purely pve while some are purely pvp so you'll have to make choices based on progression/how hardcore your guild is. As a priest you also have spells based on your race, and different roles in group pvp depending on your faction, so you may want to look into that.
---
Choose a hybrid spec. Fury/Prot or Holy/Shadow
---
I'm especially interested in pvp and I'm stuck between a warlock and spriest (I would heal in pve).  I thought I had settled on priest, but I've been feeling more pulled toward lock lately, but I have some concerns.
---
What I'm looking for: I want to be tough to solo in wpvp, even if my damage isn't explosive.  I'm totally fine winning a war of attrition if I'm able to pretty reliably 1v1 people of the same skill level.  Once battlegrounds come out, I want to be sort of a ranged harasser, interrupting and inconveniencing people, doing spread damage, cc'ing, and again be a bit tanky.
---
My concern about warlocks is that people talk about how bad they are until higher gear levels.  I feel like this is usually focused on pve, but is that true for pvp, too?  Does an sm/ruin lock in MC or MC/BWL gear have enough hp to feel tanky?  Does an SL lock in that same gear do enough damage for anyone to even notice you?  What is nf/conflag like at those gear levels?  I think Nemesis is the best looking set in the game, if I can get helm/chest/shoulders of t2, are those itemized too poorly to want to pvp in?
---
I will raid to see the content at the appropriate level (I had my first character to about 40 when TBC came out so I missed the 60 dungeons and raiding) but I don't really care if I'm healing or dpsing in pve.  The only real concern regarding pve is whether or not I would be able to easily get gear that is also good for pvp without having to wait until every other caster has all of their gear, and it seems like lock has the edge there.
---
Sorry for the long ass post, thanks a million for any insight!
---
The idea is to use Tailoring and LW to get the greens and grind mobs on your main for linen and leather to get XP while doing it.
---
My friends want to be on the Alliance and I’m starting to agree with them because I originally thought that the Horde dominated in PVP, during vanilla. Although, I recently found out that both factions were pretty evenly matched in Battlegrounds in 1.12.
---
Now that we’re choosing the Alliance my options are, thankfully, more limited. I still can’t decide, though. Maybe you guys can help?
---
Most Important to Me:
---
• A class/race combo that’s better than anything the Horde offers, so I don’t get faction-envy.
---
• Easy to gear up, easier than most to get BiS.
---
• Easy to get into raids with.
---
• Great at PVP because that’s what I’ll enjoy spending my non-raiding time doing (and what I’ll do after I get BiS post-Naxx, if I ever manage to do that).
---
• Fun to game/grief with, easy to avoid getting ganked/grieved with.
---
Nice (but Not Important) Additions:
---
• Above average at getting gold.
---
• Fun gimmick/non-combat abilities/spells.
---
Currently, I’ve looked heavily at Night Elf Hunters (which would definitely give me faction-envy, Dwarf Rogue (seems to be the best race of either faction for a Rogue, given that I love PVP), Gnome Mage, and Gnome Warlock (I’d probably only get faction-envy when I fear an Undead and he breaks free, but at least it won’t be a Dwarf Priest saving any class I free with Fear Ward).
---
It’s coming pretty soon and I’ve been wracking my brain over this literally since the day that Classic was announced.
---
This is the worst post I've seen in a while.
---
Pointless to start arguing as I witness from the other comments.
---
Please think before you post again. Thank you.
---
Spell batching refers to the timeframe the server has to handle user entity actions on other user entities. Not user interactions on regular NPC entities
---
what you may be referring to is sever lagg from one of the plagued private servers. On proper retail servers you have no dice to pull that off on a regular basis
---
I'm sorry. What did UD do to you?
---
then a mage opens a portal pretending its a summon
---
I'm also for mage. 
---
Warlocks are good and typically in higher demand, but they require some management. Soul shard farming can be a deal breaker for many.
---
With Mage you don't have to worry about going 60 levels only to realize you hate soul shards with a passion. Plus you have portals, which will make any player happy. They're more relaxing.
---
Neither of those methods actually net 50g+ an hour, more like 20-40
---
I tamed a swamp jaguar as soon as I could. They were basically 2nd best at most categories that mattered: 1.2 attacking speed, very strong pursuit speed (before normalization) and as a cat they were one of the better archetypes in general stats. Never optimal but always strong. 
---
They also looked like Druids in travel form, so with some name shenanigans and prowl you could have some PVP run alongside a Druid buddy.
---
Ya, I love people giving advice off of the rank 14 naxx PvP video they watched.
---
There's going to be a big gap in time between getting trained by melee and being able to get the gear to be powerful.
---
Guilds arent the reason you don't succeed.
---
I honestly just wish we could queue for AV, WSG, AB from the start.  No progress on factions, no honor system, just the instanced bgs.  It was pretty boring to me doing ss tm zergs.  Structured pvp was a welcomed relief, and it made a lot of difference for the gank fest zones.  Since that allowed people that wanted to pvp to go fight others instead of spending their time looking for trouble, finding nothing but lowbies and then getting frustrated and slaying them.
---
Maybe he was the joke
---
Female orcs has a sick casting animation, so does male trolls.
---
Yeah, I’m also excited because maybe a different meta forms. Like it is impossible to believe that everyone just heads to one location to have a massive battle for honor? Like maybe having 100v100 standoff’s near the world bosses is more efficient then maybe getting someone to fly somewhere.
---
&gt; You cannot reserve Briarwood Reed and expect to find healers, because they dont need anything else from UBRS.
---
On pservers I would see "LFM UBRS Rend/Jed, Dal'Rend/Briarwood res" all the time, and they would be LFM for 4 hours before disbanding. This is what I was talking about
---
It just takes longer for clears and progression, which, in of itself, makes progression take longer. So, with REASONABLE consumes (ie. your tanks use consumes for Rag and FR and people carry pots with them), MC can be cleared in the 3ish weeks it takes to take Quintessence without farming for it.
---
BWL with no consumes, probably take 1-2 months depending on how good your people are, less if ZG is released already.
---
Now is when things start taking longer and longer. Because youre progressing more slowly, you get less and less gear each week, which means you progress more slowly. Another big problem with slow progression is membership attrition. People will quit the game, or upjump to another guild thats more progressed. The more people leave, the more new people you have to gear. While a good raiding environment is the better part of the game, theres still lots of people that want more faster.
---
Its a downward spiral, thats not to say itll crash and burn, but your rate of progression will slow more and more the longer you go on.
---
LF 39M MQ....
---
...well fuck, I've generally been pro-mergers, but I think you just convinced me otherwise.
---
Those are private server changes No?
---
Tank, healer, 3 dps
---
Lol sounds like you’re the obsessive one if that’s what you’re worried about
---
Live or undead?
---
Our raid was not able to down onyxia until one of our tanks went in with the thrash axe to generate enough rage to keep aggro above the over zealous dps.  Of course since warriors have 1.12 talents and rework, that will not be an issue in wow classic.
---
Night Elf female. They look fantastic! Tauren might have better racials overall, but they also never get the satisfaction of a ambushing people with shadowmeld. 
---
Plus tauren tanks are a little overdone, at least the male ones.
---
Yeah, but there are times where that is just not an option, Druid might root me and sleep my pet, Priest might fear him, he could get a chain dotted by a warlock, it was just the safer option to not use him but I do remember getting more use out of him late Vanilla so I know something had to have changed.
---
rsham 4 warriors
---
I can only speak personally but by the time I had enough linen to make enough greens to make the wands I was around 18 which by that time I could just buy the wand off the auction house. I would suggest going and trying your strategy on private servers to see how well it would work before you try it on live.
---
though there is no real reason to stay gnome after you've got your BoP stuff. (sure dropping engi and leveling it back up is expensive, but it beats 2+ years of begging goblins to craft charges, big ones and mortars for you)
---
Never played pservers, I might remember it wrong tho.
---
the healing and nets were in vanilla...them taking both away was a pserver thing.
---
I really did not enjoy 'looking for trouble' in hillsbrad or stv or the dueling area.  It was a welcomed relief to have bg queues and areas to gather for trouble or when it changed to queue from the battle master.  I really hope they change to have all the instanced pvp much earlier than they listed.  I wish it was out in phase 1, but like you said with no reward system until the patch.  
---
I concede it would not be pure classic, but damn a lot of classic ideas sucked.  Which is one reason the game worked as a service.  You know it will be updated with the changes and ideas they had on a white board but couldn't get in the live version yet.
---
....
---
Right. That never crossed my mind in the slightest way.
---
It will be easier to find a raid spot as a mage than a shadow priest, as there is usually only 1 shadow priest per raid that is mainly used to buff the warlocks. Raiding is classic isnt as focused on mechanics, but more the logistics of coordinating 40 people. If you are a decent player that shows up on time, doesn't AFK at random times (or during trash), and doesn't start drama for the raid group, you will find yourself a spot somewhere. 
---
There are the nice weekly posts on here where guilds are already forming, maybe one of them fits your style and you can join before launch to be ahead of others. 
---
Another bonus for a mage is that you probably wouldn't need to respec much, if at all during the first few phases. Frost mage is the go to PvE and PvP spec at the start of classic.
---
I’ve told myself that I need to be realistic.  I won’t be able to even put more than 2-3 hours in a session.  I will have to find a casual guild(if join one at all). I will run some lower level instances when able but I don’t see how I can possibly run any raids.  I do see myself hitting 60 but it will be a very very long time. On top of that I will probably have a horde and alliance server.  But when I play I will usually quest with my wife so that should make things more pleasant for leveling. I’m debating whether or not to do a pvp server because I just won’t have the time to deal with the ganking in stv.  But overall I just want to do things my way and not worry about how my progress is going and realizing that I’m a lower tier player.
---
Still 10% chance of falling out of combat, which is really annoying in UBRS where you can get straight up murdered before a tank can help out.
---
5 Paladins
---
either side, or both.
---
Yeah. I don’t really understand why, but whenever I saw an undead rogue I always shat myself a little... even though orcs are probably objectively better racial wise. Will of the forsaken is pretty sweet, and cannibalise helps speed up levelling by reducing downtime a little, but blood fury really is sweet for that burst damage.
---
Classic man.  Before YouTube.  They actually made a full blown movie and showcase show as well,  but original first season the best.  Crazy to me he whole show spun off of a short c&amp;c generals video they made.
---
Living side a priest is like half the party alone. Mind controls the crusaders, spam their aoe heals, repeat.  
---
Undead side a couple of paladins can push it pretty fast. Make one the tank and the other a healer.
---
But ultimately, it just doesn't matter very much.
---
5 frost mages.
---
HAHA I know, the guy lost all his credibility there.
---
Yeah sap is not the best cc in vanilla outside of sub spec, but you can make it work if you're a well coordinated group
---
Then the swedish guy should follow the white guys giving away tons of gold to turban guys.
---
We don’t know how long Phase 2 would last in general, but if it was 2 months for Vanilla then I doubt it would be longer in Classic (especially given the differences in amount of content)
---
Once AQ40 is out it should be pretty easy to get some gear together. You'll get the T2.5 which is quite ok for ELE. Get Lok'amir from BWL and your almost done. Neck, Ring and Trinket slots can also be easily filled up, since theres lot of stuff with not much competition. But don't expect to get the top tier caster rings/amulets/trinkets. I doubt they will hand this stuff out to you, unless you're an exremetely aknowlegded player in your guild.
---
Rag? no.  I would bet he won't be before two resets. major domo? aye.
---
They arent, smelting turns gray very quickly.
---
They aint bad to use between having lvl 50 greens and getting pre raid bis
---
Mages can blink the net. 
---
Source: brother aoe farmed brd a lot.
---
Nope. I definitely ~~did~~ witnessed both many times before the dark portal opened.
---
Unfortunately there are a lot of "purists" who *want* it to suck just as much as it did in classic.
---
They can't even fathom the idea that you can improve many of vanilla's weaknesses without detracting from the nostalgia and essence of the game.
---
Generic pugs who rely on CC from every dps - welp they won't run with that rogue for more than 1 dungeon that's for sure
---
You basically need the warrior to charge in and demo shout to pull everything off the rogue before the pull spanks that leather clad butt.
---
In addition it massively limits the pull options (no LoS pulls, no thunder clap to reduce damage taken until the entire crowd was moved far enough away from the sap)
---
Druid tank? Get your BC crap out of here!
---
I'm not saying your response in particular but others in this post. And i dont see how my idea would ruin those open world pvp battles. Being able to not be one shot by a lvl 60 trying to farm honor at a flight path would help that exactly.
---
For alliance I’m wanting to play hunter, should I go dwarf or night elf? Also I’ll mainly be doing pvp so should I go engineering mining as professions or is there something better?
---
&gt; If you don't think it'll be problematic for PvP balance that a subset of the playerbase will have full sets of T2.5-equivalent gear just a handful of months into Classic, I'd like to see your reaction when that does indeed happen and nobody can compete with those players for many months.
---
This has been the case on every large private server and hasn't been a glaring issue by any means. With blizzlike pop you're talking 6-8 people at most with R13 gear after 9 weeks.
---
We always had a rule of thumb in vanilla that people would help prot warriors farm. They would need to show up and participate of course. 
---
Nowadays most people know there’s no reason to go prot for raids since there’s really no mitigation benefits that are critical for your success, the exceptions might be the very first MC clears with newer players. 
---
Either way, if you can’t get help farming, you should focus on gathering and selling, buy what you need with the left over profit. 
---
Pretty much all professions have niche items that will sell through all phases. Some more lucrative than others.
---
Nah I rarely see anyone using them. I usually see cats
---
It’s really not that simple... you clearly think endgame is as easy as bfa
---
Never played horde, where is kargath located?
---
Pservers also have gotten multiple things wrong so for all we know the grind could be worse.
---
P.S. I unstickied this because we can only have two stickies at a time, and we think the PVP phasing is important to stay stickied for a few more days, and then we also want our [state of the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bb9nu8/state_of_the_subreddit_onward_to_victory/) post to stay stickied to ensure everyone sees it (and to make sure people know we're seeking applications for moderators for the sub/Discord).
---
We'll go back to our regularly scheduled stickies very soon.
---
Oh shit! You’re right. For some reason I remembered Ravager being 2.9 speed. Must have been something else.
---
You + 4 classes who won't role on your gear
---
Hey! I did that once. We called ourselves the My Little Pony Hunting Society.
---
Can anyone explain why DM is coming out after MC? Looking at databases the loot in MC is better than DM.
---
badlands
---
Only had his own gold, didn't get his mount till mid 40s I believe. Drop rates for quest items should be close enough to blizzlike where it's not going to make a huge impact on his overall time.
---
Given how hard it is to actually fill a 40 man roster (or two 20 man rosters) I'd say you'll be OK. I'm going to be my guild's raid leader in Classic and I would have no problem with your schedule if I knew about it ahead of time. Chances are, I'll be very happy when you log in because it will be one less person to hunt for that evening.
---
With that said, I'd recommend you finding a DKP guild. If you're only making half the raids, you'd be pretty far down my priority list for some BiS weapons and trinkets - simply because you won't be using them to help the raid as much as quite a few others.
---
Good luck! You'll do fine :)
---
Badlands, it's the best place to hearth to when raiding blackrock mountain as horde
---
That’s not too bad. I remember hearing about people grinding 100+ hours a week to get rank 14. If you can do it at a reasonable schedule, more people might give it a shot.
---
July 16th if the tin-foilers are to be believed
---
Gnome warlock seems to fit this the best. Yeah, theres Will of the forsaken and tremor totem, but that doesn't stop warlocks from being beasts. 
---
VERY easy to gear up, raids always need 2-3 warlocks, more for higher raids, fun to PVP as, you have good escape from getting griefed... also probably pretty decent at farming, and you have so many gimmicks. You can probably get invited to raids just on your Summoning gimmick alone. Also, you can form your own dungeon groups 1-60 super easy, just spam trade: LFM Heals, tank, dps, CAN SUMMON!, and then if that doesn't work, whisper warriors level xx-xx and tell them you can summon. 
---
Or a NE hunter, maybe. Shadowmeld makes for GREAT griefing material... but you'll be a 10/10 asshat if you do that. Hunters are 10/10 farmers, but the downside is most raids only take 2-3 hunters. So, you could easily find a guild that will take you in, but pugging might be a little tougher.
---
Or lastly, gnome rogue... It's all of those except for the easy-to-gear part.
---
Hunters or rogues can do a lot of interesting stuff in that regard by pulling packs far away and dropping aggro. It requires communication and some coordination though.
---
Lmao youre right I shouldve added it in, 
---
I remember we had this server clown who would make characters named after the player that made him butthurt, then he would act like them at an attempt to ruin that person’s reputation. 
---
He got banned, bought a new account and complained about being banned for no reason on the forums until a GM posted in that thread. 
---
Kilrogg-US had so much drama
---
I played vanilla on launch as a Feral/Resto druid (30/21?) and I'm having a tough time differentiating what's actually true and what are nostalgic views on the past that are not quite as true.
---
What I do remember are the stealth runs I'd do with another Druid and three other Rogues to LBRS eventually getting me my Trindlehaven(?) Staff as well as being able to tank Jin'do. What I don't remember though, is being able to tank much more as a Druid. **At what level can a Druid effectively tank as a "second choice" tank? Any standout dungeons?**
---
the same for all groups,
---
prot war
---
r sham
---
s priest
---
two warlocks
---
This is what I plan to do unless I get a lucky drop. The kargoz plan sounds like it would take too much time. By the time he can craft either wand he could be getting his first quest wand or boss drop wand.
---
I plan to go skinning and herb and vendor all mats except for swift thistle and fade leaf. I'll drop skinning around mid 50s and take up tailoring as my desired prof. Tailoring items are consistently below character level for a long ass time so the only benefit it provides is bags while leveling. I think I would prefer to suffer like others with inferior bags and instead have more money.
---
I really appreciated your comment! I hadn't ever thought about it, but getting a rare world drop recipe would be a good enough reason to specifically level a profession due to the gold ROI from churning out that item being exponentially more than the initial gold investment of grinding the proff high enough to make said item.
---
I don't care about the overall group makeup so much, but I *always* want a ret pally that knows what they're doing in strat (either side) and scholo.  Always.
---
Yeah I looked that over myself and was also surprised by Rogue and Warlock too.
---
While the statistics might be skewed I can think of a few reasons for the change (keep in mind that the stats come from people frequent the reddit, which tend to be far more into the game than your average casual).
---
Pserver meta may have finally caused a collapse in Rogue population. Its quite painful getting preBiS gear as a Rogue as Warriors often shun you from their groups in an effort to horde melee gear for themselves. Getting raid spots as Rogues was also by far the most difficult spot to get due to their abundance. 
---
Warlocks, the only complaints I really hear about them in raid is their DPS is a bit lower than other classes (a stupid complaint), their rotation is too hard (a more stupid complaint) and they have to keep up curses and DoTs depending on patch. Maybe people finally realize the idiocy of those complaints.
---
That isn't how product life-cycles work, like, at all.
---
Activision's first input would have been on, at the earliest, Cataclysm. WotLK would've been planned and thought-through to the end already.
---
Prot warrior can spec 17/3/31 for impale, 3% crit and shield slam.  This still has a lot of the mitigation talents of Prot but increases DPS quite a bit.  Combined with putting on some DPS gear if you have it and you can be a great single-target farmer with shield slam on cooldown + whatever else you have the rage for.  With decent gear you should basically never miss a mob and should crit often and thus will have a decent amount of rage. 
---
Others have mentioned you can also just group up- a healer or AOE dps with a prot warrior can solo instances easily especially if you have a secondary decent shield with a shield spike.  You can hold threat of huge groups no problem at least long enough to round up a big pull and if the mobs are grey you are taking extremely little damage from all the block/dodge/parry/miss that will be happening on you.   Minimal heal aggro, then once they're all together use whatever AOE option you have to whittle down the groups.  some comps are better than others, but its a matter of efficiency not 'can it be done or not'. 
---
Cloth drops -&gt; boss blues to DE or vendor -&gt; grey drops -&gt; white drops -&gt; greens to DE or vendor -&gt; gold drops.  It all adds up to make a very decent gold per hour. SM Cath is a popular choice for horde especially because of the convenience to a major city.  Stocks is decent for alliance depending on the value of wool cloth, otherwise its a waste of time.  Otherwise for alliance I would say to make the trip to Cath or maybe do ZF if you have decent gear.  
---
Also plenty of spots 'out in the world' to farm depending on professions.  Finding a nice out of the way mine to go into if you're a miner and you'll come out with stacks of ore no problem plus all the cloth/coin drops.   Or a relatively confined area with a ton of beasts level 40-50 = oodles and oodles of thick leather, wicked claw/large fang which are valuable, some rugged leather, etc.  
---
Healers have it a little tougher but someone mentioned to spec such that you can kind of do both.  Healing is somewhat about spec depending on class but also very much dependent on skill (downranking!) and gear.  Something like 30/0/21 as a shaman for instance can get the job done in healing gear provided that you aren't depended on for mana tide totem.   Or 30/21/0 as a paladin can be an AOE grinding tank with consecrate, blessing of sanc, epic mount and a shield spike!
---
As someone who is also considering rolling a druid to heal and do PvP can you elaborate? I only played a mage in vanilla I have no experience with Vanilla Druid
---
This the right answer!
---
Youve told this story before on here huh? Otherwise Im getting drilled with some hard hitting deja vu
---
Lol i don't really know what you're expecting here, but this thread won't end well imho
---
Greeks on rogue
---
I liked the Bear pet mostly because it suits the Dwarf Hunter perfectly and provides you with a solid tank to kill multiple mobs with.
---
I got to level 30 in bc but I got humar in about 6 hours. Named him Midnight because I was 14 lmao
---
im in that boat, ill likely join a west coast group with flexible raid days
---
Tanking in lower dungeons (SM, RFD, ZF) is easy, don't even need Protection spec. I implore any warrior to never level as Protection, any benefits you might get from Protection simply don't outweigh the massive drawbacks. I'm willing to bet that it's actually easier to tank low level dungeons as Arms/Fury than as protection.
---
Keep a one-hander and a shield in your bags and you're ready to go (just remember to keep the weapon skill a bit up to date).
---
Combat locks in PvE and PvP are completely different. PvE ends when either you or the npc are dead.  
---
For PvP a pet that's just following you around or that was chased off / crowd controlled will only contribute for 5 seconds for that person's combat timer and you as hunter can drop out of combat at any given time as long as your pet isn't actively attacking anything at that time as fd allows you to bypass that 5 sec pvp combat timer
---
I assume Americans are whatever is currently the best.
---
AQ40 is not endgame. It is actually not that hard. Every halfway dedicated and disciplined guild will actually clear it quite fast. Even my completely chaotic casual guild did clear it until the twin emperors. back then. On the latest pserver experience almost every active guild had in on farm status after 1 month. Times have changed. AQ40 was maybe quite a big deal back then, but today it is not gonna be a guild breaker. Naxx is still a different story though...
---
These answers really change a lot depending on whether or not you're completely over-gearing the instance, or if you just stepped in as fresh level 58s with crap gear.  
---
Either way, priest with shackle undead and mage with polymorph is going to be very useful in the undergeared setup.
---
I personally would wish for the instanced pvp queues a lot sooner.  Perferable phase 1, possibly I could conceed a phase 2 roll out.  I don't care about the rewards, they could still be linked to phases to not upset the itemization balance.  I just personally want to be able to queue for a BG either at a battle master or at the staging ground and get inside one.  Something to do, that is not go looking for trouble, find no one but low levels, and kill them out of frustration of finding no one else to fight.
---
I also do not see if you are grouping the servers together for the instances or if you are only allowing one server to fight among themselves.  That is not made clear in your post.
---
A solid tank first of all.  A priest would be great for the mind control aspect, or the shackle, however you're going to want them healing most of the time so I guess a paladin, shaman, or druid would also work.  Having good CC like a mage, warlock, hunter, rogue.  It REALLY depends on the players and communication.  
---
There are a few "clutch" classes out there i'd like to have on all my runs, warlocks, hunters, rogues, druids, paladins,  and shamans come to mind...  I'm not saying the other classes cant pull off some crazy last stand (warriors) type antics, however these classes usually have a trick up there sleeves that stave off a complete wipe and run back. 
---
Warlock - Soul Stone
---
Hunter - Feign death + jumper cables
---
Rogues - (can't remember the spell but it takes you out of combat) + jumper cables
---
Druids -  battle rez (I think feral can also hide as kitty and rez, right?)
---
Paladins - Bubble(...hearth, lol jk)
---
Shamans - Reincarnation
---
Healers also tend to be a bit of a drag, as you can not really do anything solo that requires killing mobs. however, they are sought after, so usually easier to join PUG raids with.
---
King of casualness is probably a Hunter with engineering... pretty low on consumables, repair costs, and farm 2-3 DM North to get 100g, keeps you floating for a long time
---
I think the grind is fine. Epic mounts in vanilla were epic, not everybody got one. Most people didn't get one, and that was fine. It was a time and gold sink and the reward for your time and effort was well worth it. This was okay. We weren't all pressured to get our epic mounts or get left behind. There were obvious perks to traveling faster, but it was seen as a reward for time and effort, not something players *had to get* and should be given with less effort.
---
I didn't play Legion or BFA, but I did play some of WoD. I personally liked the flight achievement, or at least the idea of it. I think it could have been executed better, though. Then again I'm pretty squarely in the "in hindsight flying should never have been added" camp and had zero issues being grounded through most of WoD. I also found the achievement for ***account-wide*** flight in Draenor arguably too easy, with the most tedious part just being 2 weeks of the same 3 dailies.
---
I think it's perfectly reasonable to expect people to see and play the content before they are given the means to completely skip it. I don't know if this would be an acceptable replacement for the vanilla mount grind, because the achievement grind in WoD (and presumably Legion as well) was not at all difficult, and all but the rep grind could be completed in a weekend. I think the achievement model to unlock the best mount mode still does not do the vanilla gold grind justice.
---
I would, however, be open to the addition of recolors or some unique mounts (like unarmored epics) offered through actual content grinds similarly to the pally and warlock mounts.
---
It seems to me it's a lot more work grinding the cloth, grinding the tailoring levels until you are crafting greens, grinding the enchanting levels until you can craft a wand, then making it and sending it to your level 5 clothy?! If that clothy farmed linen cloth and tailoring skill to make greens he is at least level 10 or higher. So why not ignore this strat, and buy a vendor wand at 15?
---
Which hybrid class is the most fun in PvP? I plan on healing raids but would like to dps in battlegrounds, preference melee.
---
The fact that my tm8s will be tiny and ugly, just immediately feels inferior to horde. The whole squad needs to look badass. Idk how you Gonna cope with playing alliance.
---
Yep, if you were not in the account sharing circle and followed the rules of when you could log in and farm honor, then you were sol for getting rank 13 or 14 pretty much.
---
I associate people from (insert country I know next to nothing about) with (insert random class here), because (insert nationalist/racial stereotype). Am I doing it right?
---
All viable dps casters (mages, warlocks, shadowpriests) have different preferences with the stats:
---
- Everyone benefits from dmg 
---
- Warlocks have pressing need for hit% from gear, don't benefit from spirit, benefit greatly from crit.
---
- Mages benefit greatly from crit but don't have such a pressing need for hit% from gear as warlocks, benefit most from spirit
---
- Shadowpriests have extremely shit scaling with crit%, minor benefit from spirit, have almost no need for hit% from gear
---
Like a robe that has crit and dmg, would go to mages first because shadowpriest doesn't use the crit and warlocks will need to use robes that have hit%. If the robes have only dmg it would go to shadowpriest. If the robes have hit and dmg it would go to warlock.
---
 All of this is assuming there is at least 1 coreraider reprsenting each of these classes in the raid who could benefit from the item. If the robes should go to warlock but the warlock is not coreraider then they should not go that warlock. This is because loot distribution is driven by what benefits the raid when raiding, not what benefits the individual person outside raids. Giving loot to non-coreraider, even if it would be optimal for that class, is essentially wasting that loot because he will not show up (or perform) enough in raids to benefit the raid.
---
Orc male rogues are ugly. I'd choose between both undead sexes and orc fem.
---
I agree. This 'early wand strat' either hasn't been thought through completely or is a troll suggestion. If proposed in a way to corner the early wand market it could be a good early money maker. But it wasn't exactly proposed that way in the video.
---
This, if you're struggling with Strat then you've got bigger problems than your lineup.
---
Classes with aoe or CC or both. Mages warlocks hunters. Priests with shackle undead.. Warrior tanks..
---
What’s FA?
---
pvp server? because my personal preference on pvp server is sub build with daggers... 
---
improved stealth and improved sap and improved ambush, have such an effect on both pve and pvp... helps gimp NPC casters or their pet... helps you gimp players before plate and shields are relevant ...  
---
sap helps you clear areas that have multiple mobs, sap helps you kill 2v1 situations
---
improved stealth helps you pull of those saps
---
next to blackrock mountain and the first two raids and high level dungeons.
---
As a priest, I always liked being the pocket healer for a warlock. He would life tap, and dps, and I’d just heal it up. I have no idea if it was the “best” combo, but there was no down time at all.
---
Greeks are rogues and nothing else
---
Owls are a meme for PvE and PvP, most of them have slow attack speed which is one of the worst things, you want a fast attacking pet to fuck with casters while leveling, fast attack speed also benefits from frenzy on BM tree, on top of that claw + bite has higher burst than screech + claw, and owls have -3% dmg as default. Cats only lose to ravagers in tbc.
---
It'll probably come quicker than you think considering Classic's UI is forked from Legion's.
---
Correction: a Rogue can't open the doors to UBRS.
---
I still think you can play around the WOTF pretty well as an alliance warlock.  
---
You still have death coil and hopefully engineering if you are serious about PvP and if you do not mind the (in my opinion) boring playstyle of SL lock then rogues will kinda avoid you once you have some gear.
---
I can not give too much info on either class since I did not enjoy my time with these classes. Not my playstyle but I played them on some servers since I could not contain my hype for Classic but did not want to play my main classes to ruin the hype.
---
Since I’m playing rogue I’ll be leveling with skinning and mining, saving the ore and stone for engineering and selling the leathers all the way to 60 for extra gold. I’ll likely be leveling a Druid alt for herb/alchemy and fade leaf/swift thistle farm.
---
First aid. Its bandages are very convenient for a class with such need of health sustain.
---
I played ally originally but ended up horde later in life so I'm going horde this time around. I can't decide between druid and shaman. In retail I'm a fire mage til I die but I don't think I'll enjoy it in vanilla. While I love that druids are forced to play all their strengths in order to be successful, I just feel like it won't be as successful as if I was on a shaman. My buddy is healing on a priest so I'd like to have more options. But I do really like druids. I don't know what to pick.  
---
And then I remember pom Pyro..... F
---
As a Brit rogue main, what makes you say that?
---
No Horde guilds on PvE servers in NA 😂
---
I see more Russian DKs than anything. Probably that.
---
Thank you!
---
Sort of unrelated, but seeing your username... It got me thinking.
---
How many current OTR truckers are WoW fans and are excited to play Classic? I know US trucks are way more spacious and you can technically set up a laptop or small PC up, but what about wi-fi? Maybe play for a few hours every time you're stopped at a rest stop? Surely they have free wifi there.
---
Are you saying that T2.5 is good for both healing and ele? Hopefully a casual like me can find a guild that’s clearing AQ40 before phase 6 is in full swing lol. No need to worry about top tier rings trinkets necklaces.
---
Blizzard employees have stated that morale is at an all time low and Activision is slowly taking over. I suspect it has much to do with Mike Morhaime leaving.
---
The winterspring frost saber was an epic 100% mount that only required apprentice riding to use
---
Am I mad or do mages not have theramore/stonard?
---
I have no idea. Im no trucker. But atleast in EU with our high speed fixed 4g I guess any trucker can play anywhere in any country. Since there is free roaming too.
---
Just play the game on your free time, it’s really not that complicated.
---
i don't really know where this originated, but the thought that you need aq gear for a shaman is plain wrong. gearing a ele shaman is actually rather easy since all the spelldamage mail gear is uncontested for you and you have quite some sets made for it.
---
there is already some very nice gear in mc (hammer shield shoulders t2pants) and once bwl releases you can get all the other nice t2 stuff (5/8 is cute), your trinket, claw or lok. in zg the chest is another very good upgrade and the trinket is bis.
---
sure, with aq you will have some minor upgrades, but its not like you will suddenly have a huge powerspike. the biggest powerspikes will be getting lok/claw and the zg trinket.
---
Hunter alt with herbing,skinning or mining.  
---
Ah flipping.  
---
Have disenchanting.   
---
Sell tank services for greens, when u see people spamming trade for 30mins + finding the last tank or healer are willing to give up greens easily
---
I'm trying to avoid playing on pservers to keep the experience fresh! Haha.
---
But he does go through the math and disucsses the linen grind to get there. It seems like a reasonable 30 minute detour, especially considering you're still gaining XP in the process.
---
At this point Im stuck between pala and druid.
---
Problem is it's prot pally and bear... I guess you could say I like to keep my life difficult
---
They already made enough changes for it to not be as it was back in the day, this is nonsense.
---
Wouldn't worry about it until you actually hit 60 which is going to take a few months at that pace at which point it should be easy to find either a progression guild that is doing alt runs or a really casual guild.
---
China + mage + aoe grinding
---
The RP you get is based on a comparison of how much honor you obtained versus the performance of everyone on your faction
---
In MC it is almost standard operating procedure to jump right straight after you enter in pservers these days but all it takes is one hunter to forget to dismiss their pet and then all 40 will wipe and loose potential world buffs.
---
Sasuke lol. Seen at least 2 of those. Ud male too
---
All of the skips you see in todays world were invented in Vanilla :).
---
Invis pots, speed boots, soulstone juking, feign kiting, vanish tricks, etc. Everything you can imagine was created because of the early versions of Maraudon, BRD, Scholomance, Zul'Gurub, etc.
---
With that pln, you could just wait for 40 to drop Skinning for herbalism and go back and grind once you have your mount. I'm not sure there's much of an advantage to having herbalism from 1-40.
---
My vote is orc, as that is what I will be playing. I second what the above post said about racials w/r/t Hardiness and BF. the stun resist comes in clutch so many times. I'm also one for passive racials, I like knowing that I dont have to do anything to receive the stun resist. But that's not to discount undead racials by any means. WotF can change a fight, and cannabilize is great when you're recently bandaged and need quick hp. 
---
I think it comes down to aesthetic for me, in the end. I almost always play a bald female orc. Dunno.
---
Atlasloot definitely existed back then. Atlas is how we knew the way in maze-like dungeons, since dungeons didn’t have maps.
---
Pink hair makes you at least 5% smarter, you read it first here
---
I think a big part of it is that the classic team is very small, and this isn't a headlining product for Blizzard. They likely have a ton of creative control and aren't bogged down by endless bureaucracy like retail's giant corporate team. All of the recent news has definitely restored my faith in classic, and since it's such a low-budget project it makes me hopeful that things will continue this way without too much meddling from higher up.
---
So you will be using the potentially large advantage you have by hitting 60 earler than 90% of your server by doing instanced pick pocket runs? Something you can literally do at any point in the vanilla timeline where gold/hour is static.   
---
Seems like a huge waste of an opportunity to me. Silly
---
it is that simple.  show up to raids, kill things, and get gear. 
---
whats the hard part?
---
Set small goals. Today I'm going to get to 150 in skinning. Today I'm going to get to level 25. I'm going to finish all these dungeon quests for SM finally. 
---
I find that breaking stuff down into manageable chunks makes it easier to fit into an X hour(s) playstyle.
---
Nah, pretty sure shamans don't use T2.5 for Healing in Raids.
---
All the grinding is on your main though. You grind linen right away on your main. So you're still gaining XP and you're getting the needed linen to level Tailoring. The beast grind then comes organically afterward, skinning on your main. He even mentions in the video that the strat isn't worth doing for only the lesser wand, you're doing it to set yourself up for the early greater magic wand.
---
Winterspring. I am getting the frostsaber and it's my favorite route for mining and herbalism.
---
I guess you're right. Our EU regulations actually offer a lot more free time since  I believe every 72 hours you have to take a 24 or 48 hour break, so sometimes you'll be forced to stay in one spot until the timer runs out. Our cab-overs have a lot less room though, so I think only a laptop and maybe extra monitor/keyboard is viable. The trucks have 24 volt batteries anyway, should be plenty for a few long sessions.
---
True. I totally forgot that the T2 set already had +spelldmg. So yeah, I guess you can have some pretty solid ELE gear once BWL is out.
---
It’s true that humanity never saw as many white flags as us after Iena.
---
can you still use gnome tele to tanaris though? can you potentially have everlook+tanaris tp?
---
they do, in fact some hardcore guilds prioritize shamans for t2.5 sets since its that good.
---
Shaman is a very good "hybrid" between healing and bursting in PvP since most people in PvP go for the Ele/Resto spec. Very much utility versus casters with totems, shocks to interrupt casts and purging those nasty shields and buffs from your foes.
---
Also pretty good at kiting melee but are very susceptible versus stuns. (aka rogues) The damage you can do is just a bonus but pretty needed since you lack heavily in defensives. 
---
Been playing a few days on a Shaman so I can not tell you too much specifics about the class but I have played plenty of druid and I might make the switch from a druid to Shaman in Classic.
---
If you’re casual it will take a long, long time. Your guild will have multiple other shaman who also want spare ele gear because no one likes to only heal on a hybrid. You can buy nature damage gear on the AH but it’ll be expensive, then you have to consider talent point resets which cost plenty of gold if you want to be swapping
---
can you raid 2-4 hours a week?
---
First off. Scarab Lord is not a thing until the entire legacy server project runs so well that blizzard decides to add BC to that list. Scarab Lord as title was added with 2.0.3
---
Gold?  
---
The biggest problem are  42 000 damn  Silithid Carapace Fragments. Which was - and by my prediction will be - the reason why the raid focused guilds will just pick one generic human and funnel resources into that person.
---
Streamer fanboys farming elite silithis? I want to see that happening. Because I'll laugh my ass off watching them getting anihilated in there with simple non raid and non pvp gear. The generic average Joe will get bored or sick of getting mutilated after an hour or so
---
\-  
---
Just thinking about hive regal makes me wanna puke and that damn have had the highest drop rate for them. In there you move below the cut off bit of AQ when you farm in there. That damn zone has no graveyard attached to it. If you die down there your ghost pops up on your faction's default graveyard. That means Westfall for all alliance races  (aka have fun with rez sickness and 30+ mins of travel time) and Razor Hill for all horde races. (again rez sickness or an even longer time walking as a ghost down there)  
---
They only 'fixed' that with cataclysm by adding a proper environment to AQ.
---
Actually, OP, I do think the simple knowledge that there are *technically* and canonically other undiscovered, unexplored lands out there does make the world feel bigger.
---
I'm not a fan of the modern game. However, knowing that there are other continents out there that we can't see is akin to the raids and other content out there that I couldn't/wouldn't see back in vanilla, and that gave an air of mystery and did make the world feel bigger to me.
---
Conversely the way everything has been handed to players for years now actually shrinks the world. When everybody has tier gear, has seen raid bosses, and done all the things, it feels smaller and less immersive. Having something out of reach helps maintain the feeling that it's not all about the individual player, that there's more out there. This is a good thing.
---
Only main cities.
---
Just saying if I see a shaman with a sulfuras hand of ragnaros ... I’m shadowmelding...
---
Personally I don't consider pvp with a leveling pet. And what you're not including is the ability to aggro several mobs and keep aggro through multi shot. You already multi shot on CD and with 2-3 mobs attacking your pet (which you can do all the way to 60, I've tested on pservers) the extra damage from multishot way more than makes up for the damage from bite. And a screech is 20 energy and with 2 mobs it does about the same damage as claw if not more at all levels
---
That -0.4 CH casting time tho. Also a poster below you said that T2.5 is great for Resto, I don’t know what to believe haha
---
Very accurate except replace undead with gnome and youre good.
---
Its super easy roll shaman dude
---
They can't? I distinctly remembering being terrible about getting the ubrs key and just being able to lockpick the door. Is my old ass memory failing me?
---
The only viable low level money making strategy via crafting I can sort of buy is the engineering deadly blunderbuss for the warsong quest but even that I find at best questionable. You are almost always better off just leveling faster and doing stuff at high level. Now this is as a solo player as a group player I can buy some of the arguments about being able to have stuff funneled to you though.
---
I like to imagine they have my chemical romances "I'm not okay" on repeat
---
Never gonna happen. If you want updated PvP system go play BfA. Doing dumb shit like this leads to changing other shit and before you know it we have scuffed BfA. Blizzard’s smarter than that.
---
*roll
---
I liked any pet that was bugged. Scorpions had a stacking poison debuff that at a certain rank did an obscene amount of DOT damage. 
---
I think windserpents from ZG had a fast,  spammable lightning attack that did a lot of damage. 
---
There were also the snakes from Sunken Temple or out around ZF where you could mash their poison spit and pretty much kill anything +10-15 levels higher than you for fast XP farming. That might've been in TBC though.
---
Go rogue. I'm in the same boat, have leveled warriors to 60 four times, twice in vanilla and twice on pservers. I just dont have the time to gear them to the point I'd like to, and being the most gear dependent class in game that's a no go for me. I played a friends rogue in BC and had a blast. I could take down players with better gear if I played smart. But he was 70 and I never leveled one of my own, so this time around itll have to be a rogue for me.
---
Yeah wow, they were added in 2008. The things you forget...
---
If you think a rogue will be in the top 10% of the fastest levelers, think again.
---
You have to take into account that the class simply is very very dependant on weapons, while hunter, locks and even priests will level much much fatser than you.
---
By the time he hits level 60, Devilsaur will be already on farm.  I can guarantee that.
---
You never fought a good Druid.
---
Issue would probably be threat generation. Pets don't generate as much threat as a warrior
---
I have never seen Cata referred to as a fantastic expansion by anyone before.
---
Good to know, my biggest concern is getting the ele gear late in the game and not having much time to have fun with it haha.
---
Do you stick with the Savannah Huntress from barrens till 60? What is your skill progression, if you don't mind me asking?
---
That's a good point about the passive nature of the racial thanks!
---
yeah sorry, I'm mixing up some memories here. Full T2 was not good for healing, you'll only use 3/8.
---
While Ironfoe's dps is pretty solid, its the threat generate especially in tandem with WF totem that makes it such an outstanding weapon.
---
Fury Warriors can utilize it for the extra attack rage generation.  Rogues its questionable as there are plenty of easier to acquire alternatives -- but should you happen upon one definitely spec maces.
---
Never really had an orc before.  Never realized that the racial was that much AP.
---
I'm afraid your memory is failing you. To open UBRS, you get a seal from any mob in LBRS, and then three specific bosses have a chance to drop a specific gemstone each, put those gemstones into the seal and talk to some NPC and bam, you got the key. The thing is, the key isn't really a key, but a ring, so when you approach the UBRS door, six braziers will light up, two at a time, and then the 5th and 6th brazier light up, the door will slowly open. 
---
So yeah, there is sometimes a struggle to get an opener for UBRS, but I remember having the Seal of Ascension on my warrior back in the day and charging 15g to open it.
---
You can, however, open the Dire Maul doors with a Rogue.
---
Another reason why I'm rolling PvE.
---
He didnt get into WoW til he met Taji he was an RTS guy
---
Not one mention of Broken Tooth?
---
Look at all the nub hunters
---
Yes, all the quest rewards from raventusk are excellent, lots of sp gear for casters and tons of solid melee / attack items.  Woven Ivy necklace is hard to replace especially those interested in PvP.
---
Yep hunters, mages, locks will all be 60 long before a melee.
---
Lol the run from those two starting zones is far from running across the world, it's nothing compared to night elves wanting to reach another starting zone.
---
you are right, been a long time.
---
Go whichever suits you the most tbh
---
no the GG teleporter and the world enlarger are gnome locked. But that is a relatively small price to pay imo as the world enlarger breaks on dmg/combat and the everlook teleporter has its own uses for endgame farming - or simple wintersaber
---
Aren't the quests in the very first starting area of each race limited to that race? The orc would have to start questing in Bloodhoof
---
I think it'd be more accurate to say warriors are really dope when they have the max stat modifiers for their gear and lack the UMPFH to make real impacts without them, so a warrior with gear at their level will always be insane.  This is my take after not getting a warrior to max but playing a twink warrior at 29, which didn't kill it at duels or anything at 24-25 but once I had all blues at about level at 29 in BG's he was like an industrial shit mower that most people gave to trying to fight
---
Champ and chomp basically mean the same thing. Champ means chew noisily in a very simple definition. The bit is a part of a horse's reins that goes in it's mouth. When a horse starts to get impatient it will commonly start noisily chewing on the part of it's reins that is in it's mouth. This was commonly referred to as "champing at the bit"
---
I'm probably going to be playing a shaman once classic releases. Problem is, I don't know whether me and my friends will be playing on a pvp server or not, and I can't decide on what race I want to play!  
---
Can you sell me on the different races? Lanky Bois Vs big boyes Vs green bois!
---
Probably the best for Alliance Mage is Light's Hope Chapel. I'll go Gnomish Engineering and will have the portal to Gadgetzan with that, and the HS in Eastern Plaguelands will make easy to get to the north of Eastern Kingdoms. 
---
For Horde ofc Kargath.
---
There are known spots that hit 40-50g an hour.
---
Two or three hours a day for five days a week spread out over a month and you just casually got an epic mount.
---
Don’t act like it’s impossible.
---
This is great
---
You're right, bring on all the changes everyone has ever asked for, the game is already ruined.
---
Yeah. Majority of everything here is about p-servers.
---
I believe the required level for Frostsaber Provisions is 58, so you could definitely do that.  I'm sure there are more efficient methods of getting the last 2 levels, but if you're in no rush and planning to grind the rep anyways I can't see why that's a bad idea.  I remember grinding 58-60 in The Blasted Lands at the Ogre compounds back in Vanilla because I was just in a groove and didn't feel like stopping lol.  You're gonna be spending a ton of time farming at 60 anyways, can't hurt to get a head start.
---
Yes, mages, forgot mages :)
---
To be honest I don't see much of a point with these. Talk is cheap - you have no idea if the people signing up there will a) play at all b) actively raid c) be a human with a functional brain and capable to play their class
---
Yeah yeah lol, just get the addon it is not rocket science.
---
Then, bear. Prot pally is the most useless spec in vanilla. I wish it weren't because it's also my favorite archetype. Druid also gives you more versatility.
---
I'd like to see a change to the spell, but I think instead of a normal res, I would keep the current spell but substantially lower the cool-down to keep class differentiation.  I am talking 5-10 Min.
---
I wish there was some kind of tournament to see how low you can clear a dungeon. Like, get level 5 expert level 14s and see if they can cheese what they can to kill Arugal, for example. Or doing Deadmines at level 12.
---
why respec? if you like shadow play shadow even as holy you can go farming and make money.
---
i play shadow and dont respec or care about raids. 😊
---
Most people did not get BiS before each raid was released unless they were a dedicated raider or the main tank. Remember that there is a lot less loot that drops and 40 raiders (and bench) to split it between. My guild got Sapphiron down before the TBC pre-patch and very few of us had BiS before progressing to the next raid throughout classic. Split raids with alts wasn't much of a thing for a while.
---
So in a sense, yes, you will always be playing catch-up.
---
RShaman and four fury warriors.
---
CC and tanks are overrated
---
If you know what you want to do when you log on you don’t need to put in a fraction of the hours we all used to ( for PvE at least, the PvP grind is real). A good raiding guild will clear all current relevant content in 1-2 nights of raiding, and farming for consumables is another night. So you really don’t have to play more than 10-15 hours/ week to clear content regularly. Being casual you can do even less.
---
Or just that gnome racial
---
It would have slow clear times but you could take four hunters and a paladin to a dungeon and clear it.
---
I'm also planning on that sexy kitty mount.  That grind will be brutal, though.
---
Level up
---
farm dungeons. get to know people
---
join guild if somewhat capable people
---
make guild the powerhouse of the server - or drop out to replace an inferior person in another one.
---
I don't even mean all of that as a joke. Guilds will pop up and shatter during the first few raid weeks. When BWL rolls out there will be a massive migration and recruitment drive when the generic 'I'm just here for fun' will shatter against razor and vael.
---
ele is not that gear dependant anyway. get the shield from maraudon, buy hand of edward the odd asap farm some t0 and then start killing.
---
Might be good to have two gathering professions for cash or maybe alchemy. Warriors are expensive especially as a first leveling character.
---
I always had my hearth at cenarian hold, as a mage. It was great for AQ20 runs, or DM. But it doubled as a fun way to grief a couple people in the middle of cenerian hold before I logged off.
---
If you don't have a Paladin **and** a Shaman in your group, it's impossible.
---
&gt; I'd be surprised if warriors didn't end up as the class most rerolled away from during the leveling period.
---
This. Once people realize that all the tank gear goes to the single MT and the dps warriors are all fighting over the dps gear, it's not going to be long before people realize that playing a warrior without the gear is pretty shitty.
---
I had King Bangalash from STV on my hunter from ~2006 to 2016. Free Cobra Reflexes as far as I remember.
---
And Wagamama
---
I'm just gonna play the game. Im a little worried I'll play on a server that doesn't have a guild that raids during my time off, but thats future me's problem.
---
Fickle.
---
Doing it from scratch at 40 also feels like a massive chore. The whole point of doing at least some of it while leveling is that it breaks up the monotony - I'll do the quests in a zone and then do a couple of laps herbing and killing whatever I see. If I'm 35 and way behind on herbing, I'll wait and go back then. Max efficiency? No. Just more interesting.
---
Consider the possible biases of these polls: do you think they'll have more casuals, or die hard classic fans? Which type of server, PvE or PvP, would these groups more favor?
---
I'm guessing you've leveled as protection before... lol
---
Im between Mage and Hunter. I am mostly interested in Wpvp and BGs but will also spend some time raiding. Looking for a class that can be played well as a solo/lone wolf and outplay people. Seems like both of these options could be good for that.
---
Leaning towards Mage but worried that it might be a super popular class and make me feel irrelevant?
---
Because that's how it was released in classic.
---
China is definitely mages.
---
Are you being sarcastic? Druid tanks are great outside of raids. They are more than viable in 5 mans.
---
Yeah, I think the dev team is aware that changing the length of time of this phase would necessitate a change in how long it takes to rank up and I'm pretty sure they don't want to make ranking harder than it already was. You know, cause they don't want 100 million rank 14s in bwl but they also don't want to make ranking even more cancer. That's my thinking.
---
Calm down stereotypes exist for a reason.
---
Priest also has shackle.
---
Nope, don't remember vanish breaking the sap you just used. Non imp sap is pretty awkward, it doesn't matter for good tanks, and otherwise you can alternate vanish/evasion/sprint and be cool most pulls.
---
If you have 16 debuff, you’re already dead
---
I usually go for the 5 hit in combat, slow mh, dagger/fast oh start putting points into ass then switch to hemo around 34 to 36 for better pvp ability
---
TIL
---
was like "wait wat" for a quick second
---
Druids should be able to tank any dungeons effectively to be honest, while leveling and at 60.   There's additionally compelling reasons for druid tanks to be offtanks for raiding and even situations where they could be beneficial for MT on certain fights.
---
saying "most useless" is a bit of a strech I think, I heard it's pretty great for solo farming or 5-mans. And holy pala is my like 3rd option anyway.
---
He says he will be rolling on offspec gear. Unless you have been clearing the raid for over 6 months, that's a pretty naive thing to say.
---
Their point is that we've already had 425,000 posts on it. Its been discussed to hell. It gets posted 4-5 times a day. I totally agree with the rule to remove those discussions until later on when there is something new to discuss.
---
Amen
---
Usually when I'm healing I just look around in the middle of fights and if I see a Serpentbloom node in a safe spot where I'm not pulling mobs I'll just run to it in the middle of the fight, whereas the rest of the group usually tends to tunnel on the mob pack to kill it and only start looking around after the fight is over so I find that most of the time as a healer I have an advantage at picking up quest items since I can also do it in the middle of a fight while it doesn't result in any negative effects for the group.
---
Especially in low level dungeons like Wailing Caverns, if you do a big pull where you just have to stand still and heal you can easily always just wait until there's like 2 mobs left and you have plenty of time to run around and move without needing to heal anyone every second.
---
If there's nothing to heal for multiple seconds then you as a healer moving around or picking up a herb or doing whatever doesn't cause anything negative because otherwise you would be just standing still not doing anything anyway.
---
But if DPS ditch the mobs in the middle of a fight then it obviously causes a negative effect since the mobs die slower, everyone takes more damage and the healer has to burn more mana to heal said damage so in my experience DPS doesn't often move from a fight until the mobs are dead, whereas as a healer in a lot of cases you're free to do so.
---
Dual wield is fine leveling. You really only go arms as warrior if you plan on ranking.. phase one won't have ranking so blood craze enrage fury will be best to level with, with dual wield or 2h. As long as you sit macro.
---
Not really what should I play, what Engi spec should I go. 
---
Going Shaman and not sure if I should go Goblin or Gnomish. Thoughts?
---
Don’t most hunters just scattershot before feigning (or use a macro to turn off the pet’s attack)? That will let you drop combat and put a trap down. Don’t listen to that guy, not using a pet will gimp you a lot in PVP. Especially against casters where a fast attacking pet will mess up their casting a lot.
---
I don't actually remember this part from LOTR. Time to watch the trilogy again it seems
---
yeah but that patch still technically came out in vanilla so I could see it being in the game since Classic is not necessarily bound to any specific patch, but to an overall experience. Although I personally don’t think it should be in there.
---
Yeah, all the shit flinging that goes on regarding aiming for high pvp rank is kinda dumb. We're all going to be playing a MMO for no-lifers. It's "quit liking what I don't like" crystallized into a forum post.
---
It's right at the end of the Fellowship at Amon Hen. All part of The Breaking of the Fellowship sequence.
---
Yes.
---
If you are alliance and see a BM orc hunter with a black bear as pet. RUN, this guy is dangerous.
---
Not gonna spoil why. Gl &amp; hf.
---
Where i set my hearth is not important.  
---
What is important is to make a Stonard portal everytime someone asks for *any* portal.
---
That’s still the server I play on!
---
Yes, classes will be faction specific.  
---
I cant put a number on it but it will be huge.  I'm sure every retail player will at least create a character plus all the private server folks plus all those eagerly awaiting.  Its going to be a crazy experience.
---
Sell your tanking services!
---
...
---
you dont think shamans will be getting 2.5, loks off nef, and whatever 20 man gear they want?  very naive thing to say
---
check out the classic pvp discord has lots of info
---
Youre evil
---
Rofl, okay.
---
Rank 14s (who are mechanically capable) deserve to roflstomp ppl who are neither geared nor good at the game. Sorry. That's vanilla. You put in the time, you get the reward.
---
Hunters are fun and easy. If you don't mind throwing a group together and keeping track of friends just do your own thing man. People hate organizing so if you can do that just roll hunter. Always fun and easy to level. Skill cap is pretty high
---
finland :)
---
For live it's really nice with 2 mages, war/druid tank and a melee dps. Especially early on. Later phases you won't need as much CC.
---
For UD, though controversial, I'd argue for a paladin tank. Who, ideally, knows what he's doing. If you can find a shadow priest that would be awesome so the healer, paladin or priest, doesn't have to focus too much on CC. The DPS should take advantage of the high amount of AoE threat from the paladin tank. Lock/Mage/SPriest/FuryWarrior are good picks.
---
Paladins tank, 3 mages and a priest healer. You can aoe all the shit and clear quick. Priest MC is clutch for battle mages towards the end of strat live.
---
The fact that you think that a Warrior of all classes can beat a Druid of equal skill suggests you have zero idea of what you’re talking about.
---
So cat for pvp, owl to lvl, what for pve?
---
Deathcharger still my favorite. I never got any ZG mounts but I got that damn skeletal horse after a million runs of Strat.
---
ok.. thank you for sharing
---
If you have a group that can work with you while you learn tanking/healing i'd probably say go for druid.  You'd be able to learn the playstyles in a more casual fashion without induced anxiety. 
---
If you don't have a group, I'd probably go with your hunter.  Simply put, you don't want to put yourself in a situation that causes anxiety because it will hamper your experience.  
---
As far as the challenge, if you are an extremely avid completionist with other games then go for it.  Otherwise, I'd say that you could simply vary races/genders as you pick new classes to play.  If you get as far as having all the classes maxed and feel like leveling one of those classes again, go with a race/gender combo you haven't gone with. Do what you feel like doing at the time, rather than abiding strictly to a goal that will take away from your enjoyment. If you meet your goal in the process then the accomplishment would mean that much more.
---
I know right the rootless shifty Jew smells gold from a mile away, you best store it safely
---
You say that like they'll be dealing with it personally. If you're rolling 2 raids deep you won't even notice
---
Yes, because this is Classic WoW, which is a rebuilt version of Vanilla WoW. Shamans and Paladins were faction specific back then.
---
Tested it a bit on a private server, no bueno.
---
Might be a better solution than a full res
---
I agree. With only 1-2 hours you don't want to spend 30 mins traveling. Play mage by that factor alone. You can always make an alt but with a time frame that small play mage. People also love water and food
---
Is there any maths about as to how many of them I need to kill to get the mount?
---
Here's my plan as an undead:
---
1. Pick up herbalism on the way to Brill (to help with weed quests, drop it once done).
---
2. Pick up tailoring.
---
3. Level as you normally would.
---
4. By level 10 you should have around 60 cloth. If not, farm some humans.
---
5. Follow [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a7kv6d/tip_for_getting_your_lesser_magic_wand_quickly/) to craft your wands.
---
6. You'll be able to craft 3-7 wands depending on DE luck.
---
Better yet, if you're leveling with friends, have them give you all their cloth and you can craft the wands earlier and give them out.
---
The zone was there and had mobs in it but did not have the quest hub of Cenarian Hold.
---
Thanks! I'll be a first time mage in classic.
---
Conspiracy theory time.
---
I believe that the Classic team is being left alone (for the most part), and will actually deliver a game that we will love.
---
It will become popular, which will attract the attention of the actual decision makers at blizzard, and as soon as they figure out they can turn it into a cash cow they'll pump it for all it's worth. Five years from now "Classic" will look a heck of a lot like retail.
---
Feels arbitrary to me unless the AB faction rewards were really some a higher tier quality. 
---
Been so long I don't remember them being that big of a factor.
---
Vanilla is just a better game for casuals and neckbeards alike. There is always something in the game that you can do to have fun or progress your character regardless of how hardcore you are or aren't. 3-4 hours a day makes you less casual than the average player and you will certainly be able to partake in everything the game has to offer, excluding the R14 grind.
---
Wolf probably for Ferocious Howl
---
Never made it to endgame in vanilla, why do people set their hearth to Kargath??
---
If you're in MC gear and is butthurt over people having AQ/Naxx gear, why don't you just progress further than MC and reach Naxx yourself? Also what does this have to do with FPs??
---
Can confirm
---
My thought is that it’s going to be offspec gear for everyone, so I’ll only be competing against other shamans.
---
Please enjoy game
---
As a holy priest it is not efficient you either rely on an alt, gathering skills, or grouping with others sharing the loot. The only reason I was able to afford my epic mount as a hardcore raiding holy priest back in the day was hours and hours of mining thorium veins. None of the other priests could afford it because of how expensive raiding was outside of one person who eventually bought gold from the chinese farmers.
---
As a non mage I set my hearth to the horde town in stv for quick access to both capital cities.
---
If it's that simple to figure out, then why bother trying to hide it?  Especially in a thread whose entire existence is about discussing what to do and where to go to earn gold.
---
OP asked what they can do to earn gold.  Your response was "You can do it, but I'm not going to tell you how."
---
But for ele 2.5 is still good, or is it tier 2 that is good for ele?
---
There's a lot more room under there than it looks like in the picture.  The desk itself is huge.
---
Ah ok. I thought it maybe had a deeper meaning.
---
&gt; This has been the case on every large private server and hasn't been a glaring issue by any means.
---
No it hasn't. It was the case on N*st where it was a bit of a shitshow, people just tend to forget it. Since then, the major servers have had the pre-1.11 set in place which is closer to T1. There's a reason for that. The gear is absolutely gamebreaking if made available as soon as people can hit R13.
---
&gt; It doesn't meaningfully affect PvE progression
---
It destroys the competitive aspect of raiding for most guilds as only the ones with a number of high-ranked players will be able to realistically beat speed records. It doesn't matter how good a guild is, it won't be competitive in that regard if there are other guilds that have a considerably higher gear level from multiple members with T2.5-equivalent gear a handful of months into vanilla.
---
We're talking about a period of time where anyone who doesn't have R13 will be wearing like a mix of blue gear and T1 pieces. If you don't think that makes a difference in PvP, you're deluded. It doesn't take very long before dozens of players have this gear, which will have a significant impact on any PvP scene.
---
&gt; Inaccurate blanket statement much?
---
Nope. The 1.11 epic PvP set is better than T2 for the majority of PvP specs. There are very few other specs that would do better in PvP wearing T2 than the R13 set. For quite a few specs, there *is* no other tier gear available until AQ40 because T1 and T2 is healer and tank gear for those classes. Let's look at the mage set, for instance, using only the pieces that exist in both sets:
---
T2:  
---
162 spell power  
---
3% spell crit  
---
0% spell hit  
---
94 stamina  
---
124 intellect
---
R13:  
---
**192 spell power**  
---
1% spell hit  
---
**168 stamina**  
---
95 intellect
---
If you don't think those are superior stats for PvP, there's no reason to try to discuss anything with you.
---
Can garunteed you right now the pvp crowds will be ensuring not a single streamer gets scarab lord lol
---
Because of its proximity to black rock mountain
---
Mage is a lot better in pvp in general and you don't have the frustrations of people abusing your dead zone. Plus it is easier to find groups and you don't have people immediately labeling you a huntard.
---
Truefaith vestments IS the BIS for phase 1&amp;2. Tested myself on retail long time ago. Is it required? Only when you are totally about min-maxing to limits, otherwise pick what feels right for you/brings phatt amounts of gold.
---
Boat to org and uc
---
Holy crapola! Thanks for the well thought break down
---
I know it's possible, but this sort of comment doesn't add anything to the thread or conversation whatsoever.  OP asked what to do to accomplish a goal and was told "That goal can be accomplished, I know how to do it, but I'm not going to tell you."   That's not even a partial answer....that's like asking someone how to change oil in a car and being told "oh oil can totally be changed, it's super easy, I'm not going to tell you how to do it though".
---
what would be the issue with warriors? I've played a warrior since mid tbc-bfa but never got to play vanilla so was planning on rolling warrior for classic.
---
&gt; A big streamer playing on a PvE server means the enemy faction (in addition to the assholes on the same faction) are gonna troll the hell out of them in any other way possible. Tagging mobs before they can get to them, etc.
---
And on a PvP server, their own faction can troll the hell out of them, by tagging mobs. So what?
---
&gt;best place to hearth to when raiding blackrock mountain as horde
---
Because it's the best place when u are raiding blackrock mountain stuff
---
Can buy of AH. Random drop chance ~2-3% despite of tailor in grp.
---
&gt;Warlocks  
---
&gt;rotation too hard  
---
Apply assigned curse. Press shadowbolt.
---
Group up! Make friends! That's one of the reasons I want to play a healer :D
---
Downvotes speak for themselves. You lost.
---
Because its the best place to hearth to when raiding in blackrock mountain
---
So whether they pick a PvP server or not, streamers are gonna get trolled. There’s no escaping that
---
Each healer has a distinct style of healing.  Want a toolkit that has a spells for a very diverse set of circumstances, go priest.  Want quick reactive healing with short-term buffing utility, go pally.  Want to have hots or single target heals with a larger support/utility role, go druid.  I'm not familiar with shammy heals too much, but believe they use a good amount of totem management and have smart healing if that seems to match your playstyle.
---
Couldn't be more wrong. Maybe for paladins, I haven't played current vanilla in alliance.
---
Set realistic goals and just work towards them. I've become pretty casual and certainly won't have time to raid on a schedule, so my goals are about achieving pre-raid BiS or at least similar gear for PvE, and have several twinks in different brackets for PvP. This wouldn't be too far off what I actually had back then, except for the raiding gear part (as I was doing MC, AQ20, ZG and some BWL almost weekly).
---
Besides thorium point it is the closest horde FP to BlackRock mountain which hosts MC and BWL. Since alliance like to form their raids at thorium point, horde started forming at kargath to avoid massive battles where you lose all your world buffs.
---
This is me exactly. I'm going to roll on an RP realm this time around and just immerse myself into the world. I'm going back to the 10 year old noob I was in 2004 just running around doing who knows what.
---
Great guild name. I’m excited about classic too, hopefully a release soon!
---
Heck yeah man.  My wife rolled a warlock with my hpriest.  She was a heal-driven machine!
---
I've heard it from various people/sources including an interview with Joanna himself (I *think* it was a countdown podcast he was a guest on). He also says his record is definitely beatable during the same podcast.
---
This is so true. There was nothing better than downing a boss for the first time with 40 people. You couldn't be more right with the "easy" raiding perception people have now. I feel most people who did not raid in classic are in for a shocker.
---
Thanks for sharing. I love reading these! 😍
---
Lupos if he still does shadow damage, otherwise just any Wolf will do, even though there is a rare Wolf in Burning Steppes with 1.2 AS if I remember correctly.
---
It depends on what you think is fun. I had a druid back in vanilla so I'll give you a window into my experience. 
---
Resto pve can suck since you don't get a real res but heals are solid. Not to mention that you're the only healer that can sprint and stealth (on Horde, anyway).
---
Feral pvp is some complicated stuff but you can make a big impact if you know what you're doing. Talents are going to be something like 8/22/21 so expect to play like a hybrid. Heal your warrior bro, ruin an enemy warrior's day with Entangling Roots, never worry about kites or sheeps or seduces, then switch from bear to caster to heal yourself but get stunlocked because Learn to Play Noob.
---
If you can leverage your utility well, you'll be stronger than just a gimpy rogue cat or a gimpy warrior bear. It's 2+2=5
---
It might put you a day ahead of anyone else, but the one quest at 58 grants no XP, and by the time you can do it a second time, you'll be 60.
---
And history has shown that they were right to not trust them.
---
Streamers have THOUSANDS of people watching them and willing to help out. Like some other people have posted. Viewers will be feeding them gold / supplies to get the quest done. I wouldn't be surprised if viewers even sabotaged other guilds from getting it done so their favorite streamer could get scarab lord.
---
I know there will be some deception when it comes to guilds turning shit in, but in all reality there are PLENTY of ways to communicate to your guild now if something like that were to happen. The person that is going for Scarab Lord SHOULD have ways of people getting in contact with them if someone were to turn in the quest or somthing like that early. When it gets close, keeping people on some what of a rotation to watch the turn in is a must. Most hardcore guilds, or people hard core enough that will go for SL wouldn't have an issue doing this. Back in the EQ day we called this bat phoning =).   
---
People can be dicks. You shouldn't TRUST anyone when it comes to guild collabs, but you can take percautions to ensure you have the best chance at getting SL.
---
Shadow meld into aimed shot+pet stealth is a great trick in pvp. Stone form is okay but most hunters I talk to prefer shadow meld. If you are even remotely into pvp engineering is normally considered mandatory and especially as a hunter because you desperately need more stuns to keep people out of your dead zone or out of your face.
---
So, from 0-1500 Neutral with the Frostsaber Trainers, you can only do Frostsaber Provisions.  Each turn in of that yields 50 rep (55 if you're human).  So that means 30 turn-ins as a non-human before you open the next repeatable quest.  The quest requires 5 of each Shardtooth and Chillwind meat.  Assuming a 50% drop chance, that's 20 kills per turn-in, or 600 kills to go from 0-1500 neutral.
---
From 1500 Neutral to Honored, you can only do Frostsaber Trainers and Winterfall Incursion.  Winterfall Incursion requires level 60, I believe, and also yields 50 rep (again, 55 for human) per turn-in.  This quest requires killing 5 of each Winterfall Shaman and Winterfall Ursa.  Doing both of these as a circuit (completing them together, returning and repeating) would mean 45 circuits to get Honored, where you unlock the next (and last) repeatable quest.
---
From Honored to Exalted, you can do the first 2 quests plus a third, Elite quest.  Rampaging Giants has you go down into the Frostwhisper Gorge and kill 4 of each Elite giant (so 8 total Elite kills per turn-in).  This will not be solo-able.  This quest does give 75 rep (82 if you're human) but will be pretty hard to work into a circuit with the other two as a group is required and its much further out of the way.  Doing all 3 of them in a circuit, however, would yield 175 total rep and would take \~189 circuits to go from Honored to Exalted.  Doing just the first two (solo-able) quests gives you 100 rep per circuit, and thus 330 circuits from Honored to Exalted.
---
Hope that wall of text helps!
---
Yes
---
Make it simple, as I am thinking for my Classic WoW experience after 15years. Set your end game goal on lvl39 or 49 and grind the best gear for each slot to be "lvl60 current best gear ingame" guy with realistic approach and world pvp/dungeon groups without being forced to spend another months of time for end game gear and progress.
---
Cons? Alterac Valley, Raiding progress
---
Pros - same bgs as 60 - geared vs undegeared/levelers, almost whole WoW leveling experience done with the hardest one skip (50-60), not that much time consuming for enjoying the game as it is
---
And yes I am weird, but I will not share the account with any other pvpers in guild/community to get the gear again, once was enought :) Furbolg form RP!
---
5mil might not be a bad guess for days 1-3. It’ll cut in half after a week
---
Classic priest here - HotW is bis in first phases of planned content. Tested, had it made for myself in retail and i didn't change it until aq40 (hasn't been luckiest on drops in bwl).
---
&gt; They aint bad to use between having lvl 50 greens and getting pre raid bis
---
I agree with this but T0 gear drops in the same instances as the pre-raid bis so there's not much of a window where T0 is the best you can wear.
---
Well considering the current base is 1-1.5 million and only hit 3 million at BFA launch I highly doubt it’ll hit anywhere close to 5 million.
---
Used to watch this when it was coming out when I was in Highschool. Nostalgia bomb. I think he remade the show to something slightly different after a few years.
---
That was amazing, thank you!
---
Bellygrub is my favorite pet to level with, I always go for him once I hit 24.
---
Now disenchant all your gear! Do eet.
---
Horde pve? Got a discord? Sounds like a nice guild to be a part of :).
---
I second this, I was the guildie in that scenario. Frost mage for the easymode aoeing, all the warrior had to do was pull stuff to the group.
---
Good one, but I would like to see you on 60twink or 29 39 running around and having fun, rather than 8buttons-macros end game pvp of retail :P
---
Cool thanks.
---
Silithus for rep grinding Hydraxian Warlords till honored, then set it to Gadetzan.
---
Thanks hella for the answer. I really hope the phases are long as I want this to be stretched out long as possible!! Also, I feel like I might level my mage and druid at same time.
---
Being young and silly as soon as I had installed all discs I quickly made a character without checking which server, now without realising I had just made an RP server (Moonglade) my home. Some of the strangest shit I've seen in game is still from that year on a RP server.
---
Most memorable too me was finally being accepted into a guild and you probably think "finally"?? Well 10/11ish year old me thought a DWARF HUNTER called... TheTracker... was the shit, that meant no RP guild would accept me because my name wasn't RP enough. I was crushed every time I tried to join a guild, rejected at every turn unsure of why I wasn't good enough, until one day I finally got accepted. I probably read the most adult things i'd ever read in my early years during my time leveling and talking in guild chat, but one day I was told to meet in Ironforge as there was to be a meeting!
---
I quickly ran to the flightmaster in wetlands and used the little coin I had left to make my way, when I arrived I was told to go meet outside by the entrance to Ironforge. When I got closer I could see a few things pop up in /s Discussing betrayal and how our holy paladin could betray us, our guild leader was furious (I could tell cause he used caps for everything) Now you have to understand I had ABSOLUTELY no clue what was happening, so I whispered a guildy standing next to me as the two leaders argued over the cliff of ironforge. I was told that the guilds holy paladin had betrayed us all, fled to another guild and told all our secrets me being the little idiot all 10/11 year olds are I started to panic. Trying to recall if I had said anything in guild chat about... wait for it...
---
Downloading music or movies illegally...
---
As I sit trying to recall anything I may have said to incriminate me the guild leader and paladin fight, I was praying to a god I dont believe in for my guild leader to win, for him to strike down this traitor so I could live a free man... He lost (it was poorly scripted) I was scared the paladin would tell all the guild secerets so I jumped off the cliff and logged out, not returning to that character ever again and told my friends I just didn't like hunters and changed servers to join them on the horde as a Orc Warrior (Warrior levelling I may as well gone to jail) 
---
10/10 can't wait for Classic
---
You can lead a horse to water but you can’t teach them to drink.
---
If you can’t open a phone book or a google search to find a place to change your oil or find farming spots then god help you.
---
OMG WHER MANKIRKS WIF?
---
But how many of those thousands of viewers have good intentions? Also other guilds won’t be broadcasting all of their gameplay and communication so it will be much harder to keep track of them. 
---
There’s a guild cap anyway, and anyone who’s not part of that guild has his own shit to do. A bunch of lowbies or 60s in shit gear won’t even be a distraction.
---
Also going Alliance hunter. The differences are incredibly minimal, I'd say whatever you like the animations / look of better. I'm primarily focused on PvP but will raid for gear. I'm going NE for the lulz of having a cat prowl and going into shadowmeld myself.  
---
Stoneform just doesn't seem as fun as shadowmeld to me.
---
&gt;Play my Rogue for me?
---
&gt;How?
---
&gt;Just press 2 and 3!
---
Well I don't see the point of playing a 60 twink that has nothing to do with a 60 from vanilla...
---
I actually had Stonard as my HS for a fair while during vanilla, but that was mostly because myself and a couple of friends would come "visit" Goldshire like every other day minimum. I only PvP'd back then so Stonard or southern Kalimdor didn't have any purpose for me.
---
Yes this. Some of the most fun in dungeons you can have.
---
FPS Doug getting them headshots
---
I did Hydraxian rep with 2 mages. I’d chase the mobs around and use Whirlwind. I did AD rep solo so I could get Revered for the ring. This consisted of Strat/solo runs, and farming Un’Goro lashers and Anderhol skeletons for marks.
---
Which part of what I said was wrong?
---
I gave you an upvote just because I was an honest mistake.
---
Honestly just grab 4  other random people/friends regardless of class and try to make the most of it. We used to do this in EverQuest for fun. Groups would AoE mobs stealing an entire zone’s worth of spawns, so we started our own groups called “ghetto AOE” where we pulled as much as possible and try to survive. 
---
It’s really surprising what you can pull off with unconventional tactics. Just make sure you bring a rezzer, hah.
---
Don't bother with protection for low level dungeons it isn't really necessary until BRD and even that a lot of people will argue with me about it. Crowd control and people knowing what they are doing is way more important than how the tank is specced pre 60.
---
I would probably split it into two, with one being multiple choice. One "Would you prefer to see post-Classic content and updates on all Classic servers, or on a separate set of servers?" and one "Which types of post-Classic content would you be interested in? (choose all that apply, or none)". Personally, I've never been hardcore nochanges, I'm more interested in some sort of "Classic Plus" than BC or Wrath servers, but I do like the idea of having truly authentic Classic servers available forever at the same time.
---
Yes, I’ll be making a discord the next time I’m at my PC!
---
We’ll be “casual hardcore” which means not a big time commitment, but a bigger effort commitment.  Less raids, better raids!
---
Non-Paladin healers all have specs that are used in raids (let alone 5 and 10 mans): ele shaman, shadow priest, feral druid.
---
I got it in classic and man it was crazy. Took me 4 months. You probably can start earlier than 60 but what’s the point - you are going to be farming like crazy anyways. If people are pvping there, your grinding is going to take its toll
---
Some videos have come out recently, as long as it isn't different than private servers, tank Druids have all their BIS from AQ 40 and it makes them better than warriors for a lot of bosses until they get their T3 gear. So if you are good enough and can convince your guild, you can tank some of the later raids as druid. 
---
Paladins just can't hold the threat. Prot pally is usable outside of raids but it doesn't pull the threat for raids. Now, WoW is massive, and we can easily be missing something that lets Paladins hold their own, so if you really like Paladins and are stuck on tanking, you might roll them and try to figure it out.
---
Excited for Burning Crusade?
---
Given my own loot luck and roll luck. I'll be wearing that t0 that nobody wants until i can get something useful. Because the rng gods hate me...
---
Gearing is going to be harder as a mage because you'll be competing for a lot of cloth off-pieces / staves etc with warlocks and a crap ton of other mages in your raid. Raids generally don't bring more than 3 or 4 hunters and you end up wearing your tier sets, so much faster to gear hunter.  
---
I also was recently deciding between mage and hunter, leveled both on a pserver, and decided that drinking as a mage is completely awful, and the idea of going oom in a fight and not being able to do anything just sounds appalling so I'm going hunter.  
---
Also I'd completely argue against the whole "mage is better in pvp in general" thing. Hunters have huge burst, lots of lockdown, not as squishy. They're both top notch pvp classes, I don't think it's fair to say one is definitively better than the other in pvp because it definitely depends on the situation.

Bring a Priest for shackle undead
---
Hi, /u/RaydonThaGoat
---
Most of these fucking streamers will be on to the next flavor of the month by the time this content even drops.
---
The addon is the key. It will tell if mobs drop 30S or 5S on average. 
---
I have a good spot where i can farm in peace. Alot of my other spots got popular when the youtubers came around and exposed them. Now when i go to those i have to fight to tag mobs. There are alot of MOBs in the world and maybe my spot is not even the best one. Go out and look.
---
Absolutely. Mine was named AlexTrebek.
---
The devs explicitly said that Classic requires a sub (that also allows one to play retail WoW)
---
4 months - Wow, that's gross! I mean it's not really a main goal for me in Vanilla, I've done it on Retail at level 70 after I got a taste for grinding with the Netherray etc. My main priority from 55 - 60 will be dungeons for BiS but always helps to have a spare time killer!
---
Lots of good advice here. Gear and weapons feeding to an alt or the end game of getting all those kush invites.
---
Who is a bitch to tame due to her stun...
---
Definitely a pve server. You don't want to be casually lvling up on a pvp sever.
---
I've been looking around for a spec I can do a little bit of everything with, farm mobs in the world, do PvP, and raid/dungeons. I am thinking a feralhotw druid that I can just slip into any role with just some set adjustments.

I'm afraid that with the way people play the game now, I'll be too unwanted for any role. Also I like the tankiness of the spec, and I don't mind the slower DPS, but from the videos I've seen it looks like 1 or 2 shooting is really common and that maybe there's no good reason to be tanky when everyone else can hit for so much anyways
---
Agreed with this, you don't want class envy even if you have a tougher time gearing up.
---
Then you better farm in an instance or group up and farm.  Phase 2 is going to be a free for all for WPvP.
---
I’ll be the Holy priest with the two minute res timer!
---
Depends on the application process. You can send wow armory link to check raiding progress and you can provide proof of private server experience through Legacy Armory (it is a bit buggy) or direct screenshots from your account.
---
nice
---
Easier to get into groups as well because less huntard stereotypes.
---
How do you like their Membrane keys? Good feel? Quieter than others? I don’t want an overly loud keyboard.
---
https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=19360 lok'amir il romathis is BIS for elemental im pretty sure so you will definitley want to pick it up in bwl
---
So do you play alliance or horde, and why is the other side of your desk a traitor?
---
Druids have no res outside of a battle res.
---
They haven’t mentioned timing of any the phases have they, outside of launch.
---
The Slavering Worg from SFK also has 1.2 AS

And that's the lvl 18 reward I was refering to. Or 18-20 depending on when you feel comfortable doing WC.
---
You were tied to a raid ID back then, you could come back with your raid to continue on the next boss but with all the trash respawned. When you killed certain bosses the trash leading to them was dead if i recall correctly. You also could bring new players to the raid then also sharing your ID with them. That also could result in an ID steal 😄 and your instance got cleared by another raid then.
---
Resets on EU were wednesday for the 7 day raids, US raids tuesday.
---
The reset days for 20mans idk anymore
---
Awesome, please pm me once you do so I can join!
---
I only get like one rarely two days a week can sit at my PC but with 4-7 devoted hours in that period.     
---
             
---
My solution has been to have a list of goals for each session I get to play. Obviously I make a point to be filling out my rested, it's critical for a high downtime Char. The BIG change for me however is keeping my AH alt active cultivating gold by using my laptop whenever I can. Playing the AH was not something I knew how to do when I was 14 but now it's pretty easy for me.       
---
                    
---
That way I don't get on to play my main and have an hour of "chores" to get through like grinding mats or Gold. I log on and open mail to quite a bit of cash and I can immediately jump into doing my list of fun things.
---
I've worried about this a bit - Sure, you can sign up with a guild ahead of time, but who's to say that 80% of the people on the server won't be tourists, and after a few months the server is dead? I'm hoping Blizz will be on the ball with either consolidating servers or offering transfers from dead servers.
---
Not applicable here.  This person already knows how to drink (farm/kill mobs/press the spells on their bar).  They want to know where to actually find the water, and they got the response of "water exists, but I won't tell you where it is"
---
I always play druid or warlock. TIL I'm Korean...
---
I blame bean
---
I've always wanted to gather together four other rogues, or maybe throw in a druid or two, and see what we could accomplish together.
---
They still only want your money, its still Activision
---
Hearthstone seemed to be on a good path under Ben Brode as director (not a flawless path, but not a 100% money-milking machine), but when he left it was a very very quick downward spiral.
---
Skinning LW will be the best gold if there isn't a stink chair sweatlord army griefing devilsaur on your server
---
Quite often when I see anti-token posts, they seem to be assuming it will be part of the same shared market as live servers, and I can't imagine Blizzard would actually do if that way. I suspect that if they did do tokens, it would be a completely separate supply and price and everything. I think it's potentially a good conversation to have in both directions.
---
My alliance mage's hearth will be feathermoon stronghold. Gotta farm those DM E lashers
---
I'll check it out again in case I'm missing something. I'll have to see what his linen requirement analysis came out to be.
---
Smart!! I will try do something similar :)
---
Broken Tooth is always a favorite, but probably my starter wolf. I first played human so that wolf always stuck with me till I stopped in Cata. Good dog, best friend!
---
Man, posts like these make me giggle. Just wait until you find out how CLOSE you have to be to Sap. How you will actually need to use Distract to get them facing the other way.
---
Nice work
---
Why is Gamora

I’d be spamming fade as a priest

[The dual mice are interesting, and I like the commitment to the 4:3 monitor, but you may want to invest in a keyboard.](https://i.imgur.com/uPihd6E.jpg)
---
There are maps, do I have to also explain that maps exist and if you ask the appropriate channel (google) then your answer is there.
---
Water exists, you need to go find a map and check it out for yourself.
---
PvE servers doe
---
I mean, sure that's also true.
---
Retail was re-tooled to work for the casual audience. Not even Activision is dumb enough to turn Classic into yet another game focusing on the casual audience.
---
I'm hoping that they're dynamic releases based on how the servers progress. It looks like Phase 1 and Phase 2 could be shorter based on the amount of content, and Blizz wanting to keep people engaged/subbed, but that might be my wishful thinking :V
---
Hmm, if you plan on levelling two characters at the same time, that might be tricky, if you're trying to get into raids and not fall behind on either. Your healer will be invited a lot more often and you'll have pretty high competition on loot with both mage and priest. 
---
I started gearing my priest alt seriously during BWL (as a mage main), and she was fully raid-ready due to Z'G in time for AQ. The priest was the main healer lead in a second raid group (sort of an alt run group) since I basically no-lied wow at the time. My druid alt was slower and was always a raid tier or two behind until mid-way through Naxx. I think I mostly used her for farming or stealth runs since having two "mains" took up a lot of prime raid time.
---
Cool thanks.  With the ID steal, was the raid ID basically set to whoever walked into it first?
---
People from Kyrgyzstan  play balance druid
---
Christ
---
Both :) T2.5 has 62 spelldmg more than T2. In terms of stam/int there's not much difference. But T2 looks way cooler and you'll get it earlier.
---
Never underestimate greed. I can 100% imagine them making Classic into "safari mode". Where everything is super dangerous for the plebs, but they sell packages to make you powerful. "Double hit points for $2.99, lasts 7 days."
---
Are those astro A40s?
---
Care to elaborate? Back in the day I always wanted to live the bear dream.

That desk is amazing and HUUUUUUUUGE as hell, you could slap 2 more monitors and a bunch of WoW themed nick nacks on that thing!

As long as we're back-porting future teleports, I want Dalaran Crater. You end up under the bubble and can't leave until Wrath comes out.
---
I wear noise cancelling headphones so i can't really hear the keys all that much anyways they Feel great which was my main concern.. but i do notice my mic pick up typing the odd time. But when i've taken my headphones off the keys are not actually that loud i just have a sensitive mic. 
---
for the price of this keyboard its unreal.  you can't get much better for this price. you don't need to but you can add the matching mouse then  you can download the program to customize your ghosting keys while in the gaming function, or if you want your keyboard a solid colour or a certain style of colours like wave or breathing or just flow through all the colours super slow or super fast  you can customize each style for the game you are playing. it interacts with discord also (which i don't really like but you have the option to turn it off)
---
You may not play enough for the world first but I think things will general be accomplish at an overall faster rate. The knowledge and previous experience will go a long ways and I feel even more casual players will be able to accomplish more than they could back in the original wow days.
---
Things like farming all day for repairs cost &amp; Flask won't be as needed since a lot of players will be more efficient in making progress. I doubt guilds will be wiping for hours on encounters like we did back them.
---
Idk exactly anymore, but i guess it was tied to the person whoever entered the dungeon first. If the following guys had no ID they got that guys ID then and were tied to it.
---
So you'll be going Enchanting on your main. Nothing wrong with that, but going Enchanting and Tailoring on your main from the start skips out on skinning, which is rougly 20\~ gold by level 40 you're losing. All the while, you gain virtually notihng from either of those professions from 1-40, other than the wands.
---
If you want to be an Enchanter end game, it makes sense to put that on your main, but if not, there's no reason not to just dump that on an alt. And if you take enchanting, dumping Tailoring on an alt is going to be less of an inconvienence than losing out on the gold with skinning.
---
From my vantage point, not taking Skinning is just objectively wrong. I'm not sure when dropping it is ideal, but certainly not be you have your first mount.
---
Rip TBC Tempest Keep without flying :(
---
Off the back of this comment (and me not shutting up about it), we've decided in hindsight this maybe probably isn't a great idea. That said, I do agree with some of the other mod's concerns, there are a substantial number of posts that essentially read 'Hey guys, had a great brainwave/shower thought: What if you can copy your characters over to TBC and still keep playing Classic!' We will be removing these as reposts from now on, and I don't think that's unfair. Obviously this is not referring exclusively to those posts, but there's an idea of what we want to remove. If that's unreasonable, say: We don't remove posts for our own sake. 
---
Any post that actually goes into depth, discusses implementation, or pros and cons, or just posits a new (or very rarely discussed) alternative route for post-Naxx, will not be removed. If it gets removed, and you feel it shouldn't be, modmail and whinge.
---
Yeeeees, but shaman and paladin will be high for their own factions.
---
All rogues I have ever known were Greek or Spanish
---
I'm liking the Horde artwork. Is that the hello Kitty symbol next to it?
---
Yeah, battle rez someone before you go down that has a regular rez.  Then when the mobs clear that person accepts the rez!
---
Pretty much any humanoid i believe
---
People are a lot more selfish compared to 2004, you'll see a ton of "reserved everything for me" runs, I once saw a Strath group with "All BOEs reserved" haha
---
Buuuut if you're the tank and group leader that's kind of the benefits of the extra work you're putting in so it makes it okay, that's why I'm rolling tank :P
---
Great! We’re currently recruiting ALL classes.
---
What are you thinking of playing?
---
Well then u also need to have pet with stealth/prowl to hide it aswell, and if you don't have it, then you need to dismiss it before melding everytime, which is annoying :p
---
Not with that desktop background you're not.
---
Yeah this is my take on it too. It won't take as much effort as before to make progress just due to wipe spread knowledge and previous experience. I think these 2 factors can over come the gear checks in progression much more than we could have before.
---
Goblins were not in vanilla you genius!
---
/s
---
All i remember is a Big red cat that soloed me. Fuck beastmasters.
---
I agree with the OP that it's basically the same discussion over and over again.  There are three groups of people:
---
* I like Classic and only Classic and screw everyone else
---
* I like TBC and Wrath and if you keep me from having them so help me God...
---
* I like Classic and hate TBC and I want OSRS because then everyone wins (except for Groups 1 &amp; 2, but who cares about them?)
---
There's never any meaningful discussion, where ideas are shared and perspectives changed.  It's just a regurgitating of talking points.
---
The factions side situation for palas and shamans is NOT 6-7%, it is like OP stated around 12-15 %. Shamans and paladins are really popular, I dont know why people keep spreading that they would be on the low end when theyre actually as popular as mages.
---
This is the obvious truth, that need not be spoken. Thus you’ve revealed yourself to us, nublet!
---
There are plenty of ways for them to kill the servers before this ever becomes an issue.
---
If I don't have a release date soon im going to fucking LOSE IT
---
It's been pretty common from what I've seen.
---
How is Gamora
---
What's really fun, is doing quests against elite mobs. Or a quest vs regular mobs, NEAR an elite. The  MC the elite, and make them do the heavy lifting for you.
---
So trash respawns were kinda weird. All MC trash respawned with two exceptions. Patrolling core hounds stopped spawning when you killed Mag, and patrolling earth elementals stopped spawning when you killed Garr. In the early days when people weren’t quick enough to clear MC in a single night, they’d usually clear through Garr and let the raid soft reset so all that trash would be gone the next time they came in.
---
BWL was a bit different. Once trash was killed in BWL, it stopped spawning. I’m fairly certain ZG trash always respawned. I think AQ 40 and Naxx were when all trash was tied to a bosses death and stopped spawning when they were killed. I don’t remember AQ 20 because I don’t think I ever ran it over more than a single day, but I imagine it was similarly tied to a boss like AQ 40. BC was when this was true for all raids for the first time.
---
On private servers. Warrior is the most played class because at 60 its top dps and the only tank. There could literally be millions of players on classic this summer and 95% of them have never touched a private server or done any research. Grinding a warrior out to 60 will lose its shine very quickly. I bet a launch... mages, druids, warlocks, paladins, and rogues are the most played.
---
But Blizzard defines "Classic" as the Vanilla content.  If you go into dungeon finder, the "Classic Dungeons" are Vanilla dungeons, and then they have "Burning Crusade" and "Wrath of the Lich King" dungeons.
---
Oohhh this isn't going to end well.../popcorn

I think we need to see if the game can survive the first few months before we worry about the 3rd or 4th year.

&lt;Frozen Dawn&gt; [A] EU PvP Server | Suomi PvE/PvP
---
Intro
---
Frozen Dawn is a Finnish speaking guild recruiting for Classic WoW. As we are targeting people speaking finnish, the following recruitment post is completely in Finnish. Do trust that it does not include anything that is against the rules or norms of these forums.
---
Meistä
---
Frozen Dawn on vuoden 2006 alussa perustettu aikuisille suunnattu lähinnä MMO-pelejä pelaava suomikilta, joka sen jälkeen on muodostunut massiiviseksi pelaajayhteisöksi ja suomiportaaliksi, jonka meriitit ovat erittäin vakuuttavia ja peliskaala hyvin laaja. Killan toiminta alkoi pienestä Dungeons&amp;Dragons Online -porukasta ja on ajan mittaan kasvanut ja levinnyt mm. World of Warcraftin, Warhammerin, AION:in, Lotron, EVE Onlinen sekä monien muiden pelien maailmoihin. Jokaista näistä peleistä pelataan vielä, toisia enemmän ja toisia vähemmän, ja tarkoituksenamme on myös jatkossakin laajentaa peliskaalaa tulevien pelien pariin. Tällä hetkellä killan toiminta on aktiivisinta Final Fantasy XIV:ssä, Guild Wars 2:ssa ja kestosuosikki Dungeon&amp;Dragons Online:ssa.
---
Frozen Dawn saapuu Azerothiin ISOSTI, sillä WoW Classic tulee olemaan yksi yhteisömme isoista peleistä, jossa pyritään saavuttamaan merkittävä status tulevan Classic WoWin maailmassa. Tavoitteenamme on rakentaa suurin ja menestyvin Suomikilta alkuperäiseen Azerothiin ja nauttia oikean MMORPG:n yhteisöllisyydestä ja haasteesta. Me olemme jo aikuisia ja moni myös perheellisiä, eikä meillä ole välttämättä aikaa enää raidata viittä päivää viikossa, mutta me teemme kaikkea contenttia aina raideista PvP:hen sillä ajalla, joka meillä on käytettävissä.
---
Mitä tarjoamme?
---
Pitkäikäisen ja menestyneen pelaajayhteisön, jonka riveissä SINULLA on mahdollisuus pelata juuri niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat, mutta silti saavuttaa myös menestystä pelissä hyvällä porukalla. Me emme halua pakottaa sinua mihinkään - saat pelata täsmälleen sitä hahmoa jota haluat, täsmälleen niin paljon tai vähän kuin haluat. Toivomme ensisijaisesti uusiksi Frozenilaisiksi sosiaalisia, hurttia huumoria omaavia ihmisiä. Se, oletko nopea tai hidas levuttamaan, ei ole tärkeää. Tärkeää on se, että sinulla on järki päässä ja sydän paikallaan. Meillä ei ole osallistumispakkoja, vaan osallistumismahdollisuuksia. Meillä on kuitenkin yleisen vapaan ja rennon toimintatavan ohella myös mahdollisuus pelata ryhmissä, joissa on korkeat tavoitteet, ja näihin toivommekin ensisijaisesti aktiivisia ja pitkäpinnaisia pelaajia, joilta löytyy tahtoa toteuttaa asioita.
---
Raidaus
---
Tällä hetkellä suunnittelemme, että Classic WoW:ssa tullaan raidaamaan 2-3 kertaa viikossa inhimillisellä aikataululla. Alustavana tavoitteenamme on kuitenkin clearata kaikki PvE content pelissä, mutta maaliin ei ole kiire. Tarkempi raidausaikataulu toteutetaan yhteistyössä koko killan jäsenistön kesken lähempänä julkaisuaikataulua.
---
PvP
---
Killassa tullaan myös järjestämään organisoitua PvP:tä. Myös korkeampaa PvP rankkia metsästäviä killasta löytyy ja tahtoa saavuttaa suuria asioita myös Horden nirhaushommissa.
---
Hakeminen
---
Meille voi hakea yhteisömme web-sivuilla: frozendawn . fi . Selaa foorumeille ja sieltä löytyvälle alafoorumille ”WoW Classic hakemukset”. Hakemusohje löytyy foorumin kiinteänä viestinä.

Thanks for the input. I think you are right - I would need to set goals for that play session - because it is too easy (at least for me) to get caught up in everything else I could do next.
---
Hey I'm still collecting the T0 set as sort of my transmog set
---
Usually warriors are really popular, then shamans and paladins, followed by others quite evenly, with druid taking the last spot like you stated. People really dont understand how popular shamans and paladins are for each faction.
---
ENLIGHTENED CENTRIST
---
You forgot age
---
correct. You will see a ton of paladins, rogues, and druids.
---
Because if we don't adopt the hard line against changes, then changes might happen.
---
And it might not be the changes **you** want.
---
You play casually by just playing casually, the fuck lmao?
---
Just sap and strafe back to the group while the tank picks stuff up.
---
Should note that you rarely sap in dungeons if you are not sub.
---
I was in a 5 feral druid Strath group once. It was slow as hell, but soo much fun to bounce mobs back and forth between us.
---
Yeah, I figured it would, but with the way companies are making games "Easier" for kids these days... As long as the game is challenging, the entire younger generation will fizzle out after dying to 1 or 2 mobs a few times.... Games these days you pull 20-50 mobs and there is virtually no risk of dying. It is so lame.  
---
I have not seen any official notes other then it will be as the game was in 1.12 but on the new engine. Cannot wait. I will have the most gamers I know in one location for the first time ever. Should be insane.
---
Hahaha why yes it is, thanks for noticing!
---
Blizzard defines Classic as the Vanilla content, as can be seen in things such as group finder.
---
Nice. My warlock will stand next to the bubble and offer summoning service for 50g 😈
---
Till more people play classic than retail.
---
Tldr
---
So much free real state in that desk...
---
Especially when these things are realized 90 hours into the character.
---
Google: "Gold farming classic mage -BRD"
---
Hell yeah that sounds perfect for me too. 
---
Currently thinking 30/0/21 ele resto shaman main and a frost mage for farming
---
Bear doesn't have as much utility as a warrior, such as 30 min CDs, extra taunt mechanics (mocking blow), etc.  But they do have the things needed to effectively tank.  
---
They have maul as your general single target rage builder which does more than enough.  
---
They have swipe for keeping aggro on multiple adds - this only works on a couple of targets but if you change targets between swipes you can keep aggro on larger groups.  
---
Demo roar is generally helpful to get initial aggro on several targets before getting your swipes rotated.  
---
Feral charge is nice to use to catch mobs aggroing to teammates if they pull aggro.
---
While you can't block/parry, you inherently have more health/armor to make up for it.  You take more damage, but the increased health makes it less spikey for healers (more predictable).
---
As for bear tank in raids, this guide explains their viability and the benefits https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
Those were intended, but never in Vanilla.  Therefore they were not part of the Vanilla experience.
---
Same friend. Same.
---
I saw the video, I think it's the "refresh" time estimate that is off by a bit there. I think it'll be closer to an hour and a half, not 30 minutes. But maybe I'm wrong.
---
Yeah, it’s a 25% increase in AP, so not only does it scale well with gear, but it’s also a 25 sec duration. Only thing to be aware of is the 50% reduced healing effect it has, so not really ideal to use on a fight like vael for example where there’s a lot of raid-wide damage.
---
I can agree with this. Especially me being someone who can’t invest 6-10 hours a day playing anymore
---
but no one knows that except people who play private servers or people who research. thats the 5%. There will probably be 2 million players in classic at first. Thats 1.9 million people who just pick a class they like.
---
Thanks for the feedback.  I definitely think that is fair.  Appreciate you r guys work moderating the sub, its been my go-to place lately!
---
Man I do like shit looks cool... but if T2.5 works for both ele and Resto I see no reason why I couldn’t/wouldn’t get it eventually.
---
Why is *Garona*?
---
Personally I cannot relate, I really don’t enjoy watching other people play games.
---
However, I am interested in seeing how much coverage classic wow gets, and how the community use modern tech in the way they couldn’t before. For example, organized pvp events live streamed, be it organised competitions (2v2/3v3) or world pvp/town raids. There’s a lot more potential to build a community with current technology.
---
My first alt after Tauren shammy. For PvP fun! Making dual rogues with the brother, so excited!
---
Oh, I know plenty of spots.  I'm not OP and don't need this info (I 
---
 played 'back then' and currently have a 60 i play on a pserv and am almost done helping my wife level her second 60 on a pserv).  I dunno what spot you're specifically referring to (obviously), but that's not the point I'm making.  OP knows something is possible, can't figure it out to their own satisfaction, and is asking for help.  The response is "it's possible, figure it out"....do you not see the point I'm making and how useless your 'advice' is?
---
I feel like the number could be substantially higher. There is an entire generation that has been waiting for some challenging mmo content to come out. My friends seem to think opening week could hit numbers of 7mil +. So hard to tell. There has not been a game that came out in the last 10+ years that everyone was jacked about. These stupid BR games have taken over. Quick cash grabs that take no time to develop. I understand why, but WoW is such a strong name, it might draw in more then we are thinking.
---
Nice
---
I'm certainly also planning on collecting it the entire set for whatever class i settle on. This time i want to complete the t0.5 chain, I never got far enough in it when I played.
---
The whole, I have stormrage gear and are starting on my t3 set. so why should i bother farming those pieces I wont use. And then they introduced transmogging...
---
Yes, and that's the point.
---
&gt; Pets will jump off a cliff after you instead of running through a long path to aggro the world
---
Really? I'm not aware of this working even on retail, if it does it's a very very recent change, definitely not vanilla.
---
I honestly wouldn't want them to "fix" this even if it was considered a bug because it's one of the ways to tell a good player from a bad one (I mean dismissing or not your pet before a jump).
---
You're not ready yet because you have to choose a faction. You're either Horde or you're wrong.
---
Druids have by far the best threat without being heavily geared. Druids have great survivability, aoe threat, decent damage.
---
In raids, even though druids can be hit by crushing blows, their high HP pool and armor means that with decent healers, you aren't dying and you will be pulling more threat and such for certain patch progression points making you a better main tank than warriors at certain points. For off-tank, Druids (and to a lesser extent, Paladins) have the AOE damage and threat to easily grab adds and deal with them.
---
As Horde, I always Brill. Right next to Undercity which is your link to all Lorderon, the zep to STV which is Southern Eastern Kingdoms, and the zep to Orgrimmar which is the link to the entire west and Mulgore.
---
I assume that with a shared subscription between Live and Classic, that you can buy a token and sell it in Live, and it won't affect the Classic economy.  Also, you can farm gold in Live, and buy a token, and use that token to play Classic.
---
However, I don't think that will be the subscription route most players take, because that divides you between 2 MMOs, and I don't think it's an issue.
---
If you can sell the tokens on Classic it is an issue.
---
Thanks!! I have plans for at least one extra monitor for a leveling guide (no shame, I hate backtracking)
---
Priest are decent to level If you research about spirit tap, wand spec, and keep up a good wand. The Vast majority of new players will try a priest and use smite up to level 10 and then give up when they are drinking as much as a mage and killing 1/3 as fast. Druids are really bad to 10 and then not great to 20. Shaman are slow too. Yep, healers wont be highly played and decent ones will be snagged by good guilds early.
---
If you think dozens of people are going to have nothing better to do then stream-sniping a same-faction streamer, by... following him around, and tagging mobs... For more then 20 minutes...
---
I'm honestly not sure what to say, but I think you're mistaken.
---
I know dozens of players that quit playing WoW when they made it easy.... This is far from that, so I think it will pull back in a mass amount of people that have been twiddling their thumbs playing games like LoL, Dota, Overwatch, and crap like that.
---
Dont really remember protret in wrath, so ill try to be as specific as i can. Full 31 prot is pretty garbage for PvP. Youll basically only beat rogues and warriors assuming a shaman isnt purging you.
---
A standard 0/25/26 Reckoning/Ret spec can do you very well though. Having played it extensively in retail, i can tell you that it might not be the best spec technically, its still very strong.
---
You hard counter Rogues and Warriors, beat Druids, enh Shaman, draw even against Hunters and mages, disadvantaged against Warlocks and Ele/resto Shaman and hugely disadvantaged to Priests (all paladin specs lose to priest).
---
Your strength is massive burst from reflect damage and BoF makin you unslowable/unrootable and your weaknesses are fear, lack of slowing and lack of interrupt. Fear can be trinketed and bubbled, heals have to be HoJd and burst down as fast as possible. You can make up for this in a few ways. Armorsmith trinket is handy for fears, but you still REALLY want Engi, so hopefully you have an alt to supply you. Grenades are great like for all classes, as is the netomatic trinket. Specifically as a Paladin youll want Decombobulater Rays as a slow for people running away. Another trinket thats great to have is Tidal Charm to help against casters mostly.
---
Build your stats to str/stam/crit and thats it, caster stats are worth next to nil. I was actually really mad when they did the PvP gear update because it was severly nerfed for this spec while every other class set got buffed. You will very rarely heal as this spec. When you bubble, the best choice is usually to keep attacking, because your target will usually run away during that time. I think i honestly bandaged more often than healed back then.

While theres people that will make "meme spec" arguments theres 2 strengths that people ignore with regards to PvP meta. First, its the only spec whose DPS INCREASES the more theyre hit, this means even in situations where youre outnumbered, you can usually burst 1 target down, making a net foe the BG even in worst situations. Second, your fights are FAST, when you kill someone, you can quickly move to another target, people tend to ignore the tempo this gives your side in BGs.
---
I've told it on here or on YouTube, but definitely at least once before now.
---
Hey man, is that a mechanical keyboard? If so, how do you find it? I am wondering should I go for one.
---
Everything looks neat, see you in Azeroth!
---
IKR, people treat UD like some kind of plague. What they don't get is that their racials are hard to pass on.
---
Sorry for the late reply but are you guys still recruiting? I'm planning to make a Holy/Ret Paladin for healing in raids and healing/DPS for PvP.
---
Chose your vacation late in summer, that way wow classic has definetely been released - - &gt; problem solved.
---
Why u gotta chose  exact on launch week?
---
Private servers capped the respec cost way lower than 50g
---
We always need those!
---
Great thanks! I am currently updating two computer in preparation for Classic, mine and my wife's. I bought her the G502 Proteus mouse. She really like it and I after I borrowed it for the weekend, I ended up getting the same one. I like the Logitech software and the G213 seemed like the most obvious choice considering the cost. I was considering a Razor but I'd like to sync my keyboard and mouse RGB colors seamlessly. I am about 98% sure Im going to get two G213s. I am also running a Mac and Logitech software has worked well for me.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
I went researching a bit more, think i’m going main shaman with warlock/hunter alts. I like supporting and the burst sounds fun to mess around with.
---
I'm not talking about boss resistances. Player resistances are a big deal on a fight like Ragnaros, and last I checked people were typically using *way* less fire resistance on him on private servers than was generally the case on retail.
---
Can someone explain to me what separates a "low effort meme" from a "high effort meme"?  Or what a "label meme" is?
---
Play a mage or rogue. Steer clear of warriors and hybrids. Then just play when you can you will be fine.
---
That generation is also now in their 30s. Families, kids and careers to contend with. The beginning numbers may be that high, I just don’t see it lasting long
---
Hey dude. We certainty are. We're no longer "actively" recruiting (aka no more posts on ClassicWoW) but looking to bring people on regardless!
---
Just gotta plan for it and get a cat with prowl as soon as you get to STV haha. Made it easy back in the day. Of course every now and then I would come back from being AFK to being dead but it happens.
---
Which there will be.
---
Laughs in intellect
---
Not to mention the goblin rocket boots are faster than the gnomish rocket boots. I'll be going gnomish into goblin as well.
---
Orc rogues don't stealth around like other rogues, they intimidate others into ignoring them.
---
That's what the parachute cloak is for!
---
The vanilla re-release is called "WoW Classic" and that's what this sub is about (or is presumably about, considering the sub was created *before* WoW Classic was announced).
---
750k -1m on launch probably.
---
Very delusional OP
---
If Chewbacca could figure out how to fly casually, you can figure out how to play casually.
---
&gt; The vast majority of players will have dropped off by the time AB gets released
---
That's a strange assumption.
---
My friend and I are gonna level a bunch of toons.  I don't think I'm going to do much PvP or end-game PvE (maybe just enough to get gear to make farming easier).
---
You don't have to raid to have fun in Vanilla.
---
/r/shittybattlestations
---
Logitech G230. I'd recommend buying newer headsets than what I have.
---
Nice! I've been trying to find an NA EST PvP guild that raids on weekends and that seems pretty rare which is why I was searching so far back lol. Mind sending me an updated discord link? The one in your post has expired.
---
Nice desk but youre missing at least 1 monitor
---
[Dirge]
---
That's a horde gank for sure. Wp
---
I realllly hope they buff MC boss health to balance the knowledge we now have. Private servers are a joke with BiS slots and what not. One shotting MC will not be fun
---
Bering a hunter will let you almost kill everything because when you are good other people can't reach you and then their gear will not matter as long as you don't get ambushed. My (not so well geared) mage had even problem killing my pet 1v1 when I was beastmastser.
---
However they don't scale so well as other classes and in an duell setting (especially as Allie in front of IF) you have limited movement options. In an open world PvP settings they are nearly unbeatable.
---
Doubt it. The concentration of autism is going to be spread thin across the servers. All it will take to shut down a mafia is a couple guildies. The mafia gets dicked down every other time they go down there, it won't last long
---
Sap isn't really used that often in vanilla.
---
usually only in 5 mans on the pulls where you absolutely need it. I remember in some of the DM dungeons on the ogres that hit hard.
---
Haha just hit that quest on my 40 mage. Terrible
---
You underestimate Twitch viewers. If you watched Soda and Asmongold play the demo you'd know this happens a lot.
---
Everyone keeps referring to the campers as PvP. It was about as PvP as walked into a giant hole and dying... There was virtually no ACTUAL player VERSUS player. It was one player insta killing another player.  
---
That to me was crap. When we got a small group together and fought people roughly similar level, THEN it was fun. But the camping and ganking that took place was not really pvp IMO.  
---
Yes, yes I know you stealthy Dbags loved it, but true player versus player to me is whena  rogue pops a healer and someone else comes to their aid so its not just free honor. Part of why I never played a stealther class. Not fun to me. I like the back and forth of an actual fight where you have to time abilities and pay attention to what the other person/players are using and when.  
---
So, to sum up, I clearly plan to be in a pve environment as long as possible. 
---
I kinda wish everyone would just agree on a few spots for pvp. If you go to "X" this is where the pvp is taking place. Getting insta killed right after fighting some quest mobs is NOT pvp imo.   
---
We all know Fight Club outside Org will always be there.
---
Only changed that never need to happen are LFD, LFG tool, and of course LFR. Any changes shouldn’t happen until a year after Naxx first clear.
---
Haha, understandable! Will PM you a new one in a moment. My Discord name on our server is "Weilegeber"
---
Still not decided tbh.. I only did alliance in retail. If I get ganked I can slam my fist on the appropriate logo.
---
I don’t disagree that people will come back, but just not at a 300-400% increase of present numbers.
---
A also had mine set to silithus once I reached 60.
---
I definitely remember vividly spending hours just sitting next to my brother playing wow, even though I did play myself aswell. I loved spending time with him like that, as we didn’t do much else together back then. I even remember raiding with his character when he was in football practice, and I had to tell the guildies that my microphone was broken so they wouldnt hear my super high pitch pre-puberty voice. My brother would just give me an A4 with instructions for each boss and my rotation and I did just fine lol. Great memories. I’m glad I’ll be able to play with him now together without having to share accounts.
---
Game will easily survive first 3-4 months most average players will still be leveling I agree no changes anytime soon. Maybe start thinking about them a year after Naxx launch.
---
As someone who has said this, I know it's a long shot. I'll prot give up on the idea long before the patch actually drops. 
---
But.... Damn, let me haven't dreams man!
---
Orcs are actually the best choice for both PvP and PvE. Bloodfury for PvE and Hardiness for PvP.
---
When you say pve, do you mean a pve realm?  Or just pve focus (on a PvP realm)?
---
I have yet to hear of a horde guild recruiting for a pve realm, so I just wanted to clarify.
---
I don't remember there being a FP to thorium point until they added the thorium brotherhood quests.  If that's true, then it is likely just due to momentum.
---
thats what i just did. updated everything for classic wow (and retail as you can see) Logitech has never let me down. I even use their work style keyboards. its just so simplistic and well made. i never really tried a razor i can't compare but with my keyboard im using. the only thing i would change is the wireless style mouse and keyboard. but those cost like 40-50$ more each. 
---
Ps Since you are doing Classic. and if you are playing horde feel free to group with us! we mainly PVP&gt;PVE but do it all
---
Plus thorium point doesnt have an inn
---
Substantial enough changes in boss armour can make the fight take long enough that you start running into mana problems on the healers, but it's unlikely boss armour alone will make that big of a difference.
---
However, I was talking about *player* resistances, not boss resistances. Ragnaros is a resistance fight, and private server tactics tend to use significantly less fire resistance on him than was generally the case in vanilla. Given that the way resistances work on private servers is largely guesswork, there's a good chance Ragnaros will require more fire resistance, which can make him quite a bit more difficult to kill.
---
yes
---
Nobody congratulating you on Death's Demise so I might as well. Congrats :)
---
Lol it’s obsessive to not want to associate with a bunch of MAGA clowns in game you play to escape? FOH
---
They'll tell us this Friday that the release date will be: June 21st, aka the first official day of Summer
---
Far less nodes of those. Icecap is quite expensive on servers that only have winterspring as a farming option, it is about the same price as dreamfoil. silversage and gromsblood is ofcourse more expensive.
---
Every time I hit that question chain on a private server, I ended up having to beg one of the multiple 60's farming the camps to let me tag along in a group just for the quest drops. Looking forward to Blizz-like server caps making it less of a pain in Classic.
---
Thank you for typing out such a nice response.
---
I'm probably gonna debate my class choice until the start of classic, but I'm leaning more and more towards hunter. Yeah it'd be nice to buff and do "soft-support" as a druid, but it's gonna hamper my dungeon experience and that's the thing I wanna do most. I can always level one by the side (or maybe a Paladin) and switch to her when I feel more confident. 
---
I think I'm gonna do what you suggest for the challenge too. Begin with what I know I want: a night elf (hunter), like my original main, and then go from there instead of planning it all out.
---
I'll probably regret it if I don't remake her anyway. Had her all the way from the first trail, recreated her when I got the real game and she's been with me since at least the European Ahn'Qiraj effort. Yet I never got her to max level. So this'll be the chance to finally do her justice. Sounds overdramatic, but the more I write, the more I realize I care for that choice. 
---
So maybe that's it: Night Elf Hunter, with a Paladin for alt.
---
My plan is to level gnomish, get the bop thingies, then drop eng and re-level as goblin.
---
I would never do that on a normal server, but since this is theorically capped as a vanilla with no expansions, then I think it's doable.
---
That will be fixed soon :)
---
And if your healer and tank get in a petty argument in the middle of a BFD run and the tank up and leaves, you can slam your first on the other logo.
---
I'm trying to decide between warrior and shaman. If I go alliance I'll make a warrior, if I go horde I'll make a shaman. I would do pve and pvp on either class.
---
Not sure I will ever decide on a main. Hunter, mage, priest, lock... I want to raid and PvP. I don't mind farming a little to switch specs once in awhile. I would like to be a class that is solid in BGs and solo WPvP. That brought be to these classes. I do NOT care about topping meters and I don't mind healing. I wanna hit R10 in PvP and maybe even push R11. I am interested in maybe doing some pre-made PvP.
---
Priest - hybrid power. I get to heal and raids and maybe even PvP. Spriest would be awesome to respec to for some pwnage. Bene/Ana is sweet.
---
Hunter - I really just like this class. They can Wpvp and BG well. The least mana relient. Leveing is a joke. Awesome looking.
---
Warlock - Very powerful, a little gear dependant, cool looking sets, cool pets.
---
Mage - Almost seems hard not to be a mage, portals, water, incredible in PvP. Squishy and mana relient though. Drinking water all the time.. meh.
---
Not everyone knows what is coming up, not everyone has the foresight to look up what consumables and items they will need and stock up ahead.
---
Hell, people still have trouble keeping up with their consums usually. 
---
there will be plenty of market changes and people can make bank knowing what is ahead.
---
Someone want to tell him?
---
You should gather all the guild and afk sit in a circle in the middle of orgrimmar
---
I'm in the exactly same boat. Hunter or Mage. I find hunter is way more fun and fits my playstile better, but the whole "not scaling" thing is keeping me unsure.
---
May not have been efficient, but in Vanilla on my priest I bought enchanting mats and sold popular enchants for a pricey markup for those unwilling to buy mats themselves.
---
Just like the khoisan language, I'm all clicks.
---
Thanks twitch for being a friend AND a brother simulator!
---
That, to me, is the least worrying part about it. For one I intend to do a lot more than just Raiding so its not as much of an issue. But also it seemd like at least a few hunters are required in raids for their utility. Learn to play the class well and you will still be invited to raids even when their scaling issues start to show themselves, which sounds like really only becomes a big issue at AQ and onward
---
I'm disappointed in you too.  That is literally one of the best parts of being a Priest.  Besides MC'ing folks offa cliffs... The best is in the pre-nerf WSG.  I cannot recall which side of WSG it's on, but there is this pit that I would MC ally's into, it was great because it was a literal pit.  They were stuck in it.
---
why the hell would you put 8 points in balance?
---
This sub fucking sucks lol
---
Unlike ganking someone (Which *completely* stops all player agency for them for 2-5-10 minutes, as they run back to their corpse/run a long way back to their corpse/spirit res), 'tagging someone's mobs' removes very little player agency. It's not a particularly rewarding way to troll.
---
I'd love to know where most Swedes will be, so I can avoid them.
---
I grew up with two older brothers. We got our first computer (Commodore 64) in 1985, I was three at the time. Several years later we got an Amiga 500. I spent waaaay more time watching both my brothers play than I did myself. It wasn’t until we got our first PC in the early 90’s that I really started playing (Warcraft 1+2, Diablo 1, thank you for my childhood :)
---
I loved watching my older brothers play, but I wouldn’t dream of watching one minute of Twitch. I’m happy for OP though who’s able to enjoy it.
---
Originally played a paladin when I first played at WoW’s launch. 
---
This go around, I’m either going priest or warlock. Can’t decide which, love both classes to death.
---
As someone mentioned, it's really close to Black Rock Mountain which contains a lot of high-end instances and raids. Importantly, the Horde only have one capital city in Eastern Kingdoms - the Undercity, which is located in the northern-most region of the continent while the other major(ish) hub with zeppelins is Booty Bay in the southern-most region. Setting it to Kargath therefore gives you a hearth location right near a highly active raiding location as well as the midpoint between two major hubs, cutting down time to travel to other Eastern Kingdom zones. In Kalimdor, the Horde have Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff which are pretty close, but also near the equator of the continent, so the maximum travel distance to a zone of interest is typically shorter than traveling from the Undercity to somewhere.
---
But what about taking fistfuls of your defeated enemy's flesh into your rotting body for sustenance? The edginess is incredible!
---
&gt; As long as you sit macro. 
---
Something that's said not to be working in Classic, making that strategy way more niche. Or at least it's the general comment against reckbombing (which relies on the same received crit mechanic). 
---
Arms is still better. TM, anger management, imp. OP... So much utility (and some damage) to go on and maybe tank some dungeons in the run. DW is too prone to miss, and doesn't allow the hamstring-kite trick so it's only good with top-notch weapons, quite a rare thing during leveling.
---
I dunno man, it can be annoying as hell. Especially if it's one named mob that you need for a quest.
---
PvE realm with a PvE focus.  Casual BGs of course, but mostly for fun.  
---
The focus will be killing Kel’Thuzad  someday while having fun.
---
This reminds me of when I was a wee lad. Watching my father and brother play Shining in the Darkness on the Genesis. As a young 6 year old I would just fade into watching them play. Still love listening to those old school RPG tunes.
---
There was a superstition that the first person to zone into the instance without a raid id set the loot table. I'm pretty sure that was bullshit though. But, no one was locked until the first boss was killed. Then everyone in the zone was locked to that instance until the reset. If you came back another day with different people they could join that instance as long as someone with the lock zoned in first, otherwise they walked into a fresh instance. If two people with different raid locks tried to go in together they would get split to their respective instance and wouldn't see each other. 
---
Stealing the raid id could happen if you partially cleared on one day, and then someone saved to that id brought their own raid or guild and picked up where you left off. More casual guilds could also sell their id for higher end guilds to run their bench or alts through if your guild wasn't going to finish by reset. Typically payment was some kind of loot arrangement or guild supplies rather than straight gold
---
I was a clicker my entire WoW career from Vanilla through Cata, but never a button turner. I was a serious raider too, and my guild's MT. 
---
I wasn't able to break myself from clicking until I quit WoW and started a different MMO. I forced myself to only use hotkeys from day 1. It sucked still first but now I can't imagine going back.
---
I think you should do some self-reflecting on what went wrong after that. How could that even be possible? Did you really enjoy playing at all? So many questions...
---
Maybe to you. Different people enjoy different styles of games. I am certain I have been jazzed about a few games in the last 10 years that had nothing to do with Blizzard. Your 7 million number is not realistic. Most are going to quit during the leveling process and you might see resurgances when retail is between patches during a lull, but you will not get the old numbers when wow was the standard for this genre.
---
Yeah look up cmstorm quickfire rapid (brown key). I highly recommend their keyboards.
---

---
I feel that Grom'Gul works better than Brill for that function since it's more central
---
Do what I just decided: Roll one as your main, and the other as your alt. Over time you'll see which you prefer, and they'll balance each other out pretty well in terms of gameplay.
---
Priests are in higher demand, and while Shadow isn't all that viable for Raiding, i've heard people like to get at least one. In PvP however they're beasts, and you'll have plenty fun.
---
As for rogue, don't worry about it being common. In fact being able to stealth might be a heaven-send the first year on a PvP server, It'll help you get around, and the class is excellent when you just wanna sit back and relax.
---
I don't think you need to worry about rogues being the most played class. I think that'll be warriors pretty healthily
---
What game is that it looks like shit
---
Kargath or GG
---
Oh my gosh, this sounds amazing. I’m even willing to change from alliance to horde to be a part of this.
---
Is that a thing, can you level one up, drop it then learn the other side? You can't do that with leather working or smithing
---
The Toxicity of your ignorance is appalling! So, you would be completely fine if a bigger stronger group with LESS of a life then you(Which I am assuming is minimal) camped you for the first 5 days and you were able to accomplish nothing, which in doing so made it so you are forever behind, and will never recover to be able to compete. Which we all know makes you Ego bags quit because you realize you are not the best....  
---
THAT is what you are looking forward to? God I hope the top pvp zerg camps you until you quit playing.
---
Sounds like you enjoy being a bully. I truly hope you get bullied into quitting. Would server you right. Sounds like you are a pile of crap human. You are looking FORWARD to ruining another persons gaming experience? Hell, I would ban you instantly if I was a GM and saw you openly admit that.  
---
I truly hope the best pvpers ruin your life.
---
It depends.  Activision could screw something up that the majority of the classic fanbase leaves the game for.
---
There's plenty more than that.
---
From the specificity of that comment I sense it's from experience. May we all stay strong through trying times.
---
some random horde troll rogue
---
The End of Dreams is BiS for Ele. https://classicdb.ch/?item=22988
---
Rsham, rdudu and 3 fwars. Best run i ever had.
---
Scarlet clerics/priests and battle mages in strat human side. Battle mages dish out massive aoe dmg.
---
Anything up to spiders in lbrs can be tanked as priest (with off healer) via mc (did it myself) - any mele mobs will do.
---
Twilight casters in brd give +35 spell dmg buff.
---
Dark iron medics in brd for aoe heals.
---
Blue ogres in dire maul - bloodlust on your mele.
---
Krix in bwl - can teach smelt elementium to miners.
---
Mele black orc in ubrs before the beast, just watch out with their charge, can knock mobs into other packs if not careful.
---
Troll hexers in lbrs for extra cc (hex).
---
That's all i can remember now.
---
Left that part out. I'll be dropping Enchanting for Skinning and just keeping Tailoring.
---
IMO, I don't think it's worth the time to level enchanting for the Greater wand since Smoldering Wand is purchasable at 15.
---
Leaning that way actually..
---
I know I feel like a failure. I just got so drunk on my shadow power. I forgot I could dominate minds! It's the most Shadowey power damnit!! Honestly I'm a fraud of a shadow priest any way. When I say I got drunk on shadow power. What I really mean is that I mashed dispel magic like it was the only thing holding the sun in it's orbit. I don't know why but I basically get the same satisfaction dispeling a CC that an edge lord rogue gets ganking someone from 2% health.
---
This is something Im excited about. See if there are new routes, skips etc for doing dungeons. I would love to see some videos on guys figuring out new routes.
---
Hunters can use there pet and himself to pull a big part of the dungeon, let the pet die and faint death in a smart location. Just like tribute runs but designed for full party's. 
---
Running fast enough skipping big parts and than having the shaman ankh and ress everybody up sounds like a solid plan. Can also be done with a warlocks soulstone.
---
Now you mention this subject I would love to theorize about efficient routes and group setups.
---
My name is Gamora and died to fall damage
---
Welp, that's enough r/classicwow for one day.
---
20 mans reset timer was 3 days. On 4th you had new set of bosses to kill.
---
I'm wondering the same things, friend. I love face melting gameplay but concerned about getting gear to pvp with, and the usefulness of spreist in organized bgs. 
---
Any veteran players out there have insights into this?
---
See, I do not think of it as 300 to 400% of Current numbers. Current numbers are tiny compare to what they once were and I know entire guilds that moved on to more challenging games when WoW went easy mode. I think it will bring back the base population of 5mil. Hard to say for sure as many have grown up and have children and families of their own now, but I know every person I knew that played WoW originally and has not touched it in YEARS is planning to play it now.
---
I was planning on going RP (or RP PVP if they change their mind) but this is such a perfect schedule for me, I'm tempted. Please hmu when you have a discord!
---
Undead Rogues are good against Warlocks and Priests due to WOTF.
---
But don't you have a Theramore tele?
---
Cool! What class do you wanna play??
---
Might rent it out!
---
That is absurd! I would bet you 100 bucks it is well over 3 mil without even batting an eyelash.
---
Only 750k. Hah. You must think people enjoy the easy games these days. Everyone I know hates them. Too easy.
---
Bwl also had trash respawns tied to bosses. Same for all raids 30 mins soft reset (nobody with raid id in raid) or own reset timer in some cases (suppression room trauma triggered).
---
I’m looking at either priest or warlock...mayyybe a mage. I’m leaning toward priest though.
---
I still used my winterspring mount until the very end in retail. Stopped playing with legion.
---
Orc stealth anim is so fucking badass
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_mind_controllable_mobs
---
as a Mage I would try to get my Priest friends to MC the mob in LBRS and cast this on a mob for me:
---
&gt; Firebrand Evoker - Mark of Flames (+1,000 fire damage, debuff)
---
You still have plenty of other player agency. Wander 50 yards to the left, kill mobs for exp while it respawns. Do a quick lap around the area, grab that herb node. Fiddle with your tradeskills while you wait.
---
It took me a bit longer but it was doable. Also sold him my Ele Earth for a gold a piece ;)
---
Don’t ever ask anything on reddit because google exists. Nice meme
---
How is that even possible unless you played on Spanish server
---
It might be tough to spot based on their race/class choices. Instead you’ll spot them in dungeons rolling need on everything.
---
vanishing after sap, if no other players are in combat with the mob, will cause the pack to reset and the sap to be removed.
---
The only good way to make Black Lotus "fair" is to make it a random drop (very low drop rate) from any high level herb node. Much like Arcane Crystal is a rare drop from Rich Thorium Ore nodes.
---
Like make it a 1% drop rate from Icecap and Plaguebloom, a 0.5% from Mountain Silversage and Gromsblood, and maybe even a 0.1% drop rate from Dreamfoil and some others.
---
But you know.... #nochanges
---
Valid points but if you’re having fun and commit to a Ret Paladin you will be sad when it comes to raiding
---
But being in PvP with that ugly teal cloth robe is certainly not a good idea. Too much cloth in their PvE gear so overlap is not too high.
---
You could be waiting a long time
---
Timber, the wolf from Dun Morogh. Tamed him in Vanilla on my Night Elf Hunter and named him Ironheart. When Wrath dropped, I started maining DK, but he was my primary pet whenever I played hunter, up until I quit in WoD.
---
Yeah, it's still a fresh trauma. 😭
---
Why, what’s going on?
---
That would make sense considering that classic is using the legion engine
---
On a PVE realm, if you /PVP you can attack any other opposing faction player, anywhere, who is also /PVP.
---
Spam live Strath. Sell your righteous orbs on the auction house.
---
Not as many youngsters will be playing classic as in Vanilla. I guess most of us were teenagers, with some around 10-12, and I’d expect it’s mostly the same players playing the game again. Some might try it as a new experience, but there wont be much kids playing for sure.
---
Black lotus used to be cheaper in vanilla and it only accounts for one dps consumable used by casters out of 5+ and it's not used at all by melee.
---
Also "world buffS" don't work differently, one world buff out of five total will work differently.
---
If guilds are anything like they are on private serves. Almost full BiS will be required for a raid spot
---
You want to spread the information that you've violated blizzards property when you aim to play on official servers
---
Sounds like a prime example of shooting onself in the foot
---
they do tend to explode from time to time though ;)
---
Druids pwns warrior... not vice versa
---
not msn messenger on your monitor. FAKE
---
There won't be 40 people at level 60 within the second week lol.
---
More die hard classic fans. But Blizzard doesn't excpect the casuals to stay anyway. So why not listen to the core audience?
---
Also RpPvP is voted above Rp and casuals probably don't care about Rp. So if they had to decide between RpPvP and Rp the choice should logically fall on RpPvP.
---
It will work the same as it did for the majority of the game. You can be attacked by the opposing faction if you are flagged for PvP. You get flagged by either typing /pvp, or entering an enemy faction's zone. The only difference on PvP servers is that you get automatically flagged when entering contested zones as well as enemy zones.
---
Wow thanks for invite. Yeah, I played back in the vanilla as an Alliance Warrior. Somehow I miraculously convinced my wife to play,  and then she convinced me to play Horde. I'm rolling Warrior and she's going Shaman. Its kinda funny because at she first was "open to trying it out" and now she is listening to podcasts watching videos, posting on reddit and  so on... I've created a monster. Now, I am more excited to play Horde than I would be I was going Alliance.
---
fast 60 without gold is the most stupid thing someone can make. 
---
i farm while leveling and have a speedboost in midgame because i have all the gold and dont need farm every day
---
It will be the Arcanum set. Blue post said 1.12 versions of the pvp gear so these sets will be stacked.
---
&gt; most people know there’s no reason to go prot for raids
---
I don't understand this at all. Can you explain?
---
I hope they just make the flight path guys aggro onto anyone who hits another player within a range. And by hit I mean shitkick them for 10000000 damage and cost them a rank. That camping flight stuff is NOT pvp. There should be actual FIGHTING in pvp, not just insta gibbing people. Why does everyone enjoy just insta ganking people? Go play an FPS if you enjoy that so damn much. Same thing.
---
If classic team keeps their word it will be 1.12 models. Probably same with mounts /sadunarmoredepicmount
---
Hardiness sucks and is stupid and I hate you 
---
This comment brought to you by the Paladin gang
---
For PVE? Mana regent is crap and a 40m raid will only take one
---
I used to have a lot of fun with a steady group of warrior, rogue, mage, and 2x priest. I was the shadow priest.
---
Thanks!  Yea I think I may enjoy a PvE server this time around.
---
As if they arent good ENOUGH against locks and priests
---
Literally most redditors suggest using search functions before making a post. Are you trying to argue that?
---
My favorite when from phase 6 to phase 2 overnight.
---
Lol no one killed Rag with the majority of their raid in greens and dungeon blues.
---
Nothing wrong with playing a new class for a fresh experience. However sitching factions is a treason punishable by death. ^^^/s
---
Nope
---
team up and farm eye of shadow in winterspring
---
Implying I'm going to roll anything other than warrior. Begone, peasant.
---
I too never MC'd anyone off a cliff, and I played a NE priest from day 1 of Vanilla, however I did MC a lvl 30 orc warrior that was chasing me.   Got him just as he stopped near the bridge, and ran him up to the guards in Astranaar before releasing him to his inevitable death.   So I consider that a fair alternative.
---
Man.. my dad just gave me the exact same desk you started with which is the desk i started gaming on back in 95'. Was your desk passed down aswell?
---
Without Mangle from TBC, I would never go back to feral druid.
---
I don’t know anything more about pre-raid farming for AQ-40 now as compared to when we had it on farm in Classic. I’ll do the same thing.
---
1. If you're ahead of the curve, there's very few people who can meaningfully slow your progress. And if they waste time on doing so, they'll just fall behind you.
---
2. Grinding is only somewhat slower then questing. If some NEET makes it his life's mission to camp &lt;some named mob&gt; for 2 hours, so that &lt;some streamer&gt; can't tag it, the solution to that problem is to... Literally go anywhere else. Kill non-quest mobs for exp.
---
not til TBC
---
Even if you dps or heal you still need to last enough in PvP. PvE gearing usually only cares about dps/hps, not survivability unless boss mechanics require it (Sapph, Viscidus...). For PvP a reasonable amount of stamina is needed. PvE gear may not have it or simply not enough.
---
Wow, good job! I’m gonna bookmark this.
---
As far as I know, the current meta on private servers does not use shadow priests in premades. Healing priests provide dispell and heals. If you find the right group I bet they would be willing to take you, might just be harder than other specs. Other classes fit damage roles better. Mages are better at controlling the enemy, warlocks are better at nuking, etc..
---
Probably not. For some reason I see Warlock as being kind of the "noob class" now. Not sure why. I think they have a good amount of 'do-everything'-ness to them and have been hyped up a bit, and generally aren't considered particularly hard. I see a lot of people in the comments sections of youtube videos and similar saying "Never played Vanilla, can't wait to start a warlock!" more than anything.
---
Question, is there any benefit in getting portal services attention if a person offers the portal rune with the tip? I've certainly been in situations where mages seem completely uninterested, or seem insistent on their macro prices. If you were busy on the ah or your bank and someone said LF portal, my mats plus tip, would that be enough for you to change your mind over say, the other dozen people asking for portals in chat?
---
Depending on hord or alliance 
---
Alliance you got EK well covered
---
And if your an engi then you got gadgestan port.  
---
This would free up a slot and then winter spring or epl would be good.  
---
For hord I would put it in khargath.
---
Hunters will be the noob class on PVE servers. As they have the highest minimum requirement of skill to make work in pvp. I don't see noobs enjoying them on a PVP server. On a pvp server the noob classes will be, Rogue and Mage. As they are both extremely good. Yet very easy to play to a passable standard. Rogue for obvious reason but, for mage it's the fact they gave your back up plans back up plans. No ranged class is more forgiving of being a fuck up then a mage.
---
Orc stealth is then dead-staring you in the eyes and saying, "You don't see me," and you agree because you're just scared shitless.
---
I think the meme here is that the warrior + Druid combo is GG.
---
Having done these specs for extended periods, I strongly recommend just making a farming alt. Mage, hunter, rogue, or warlock works best. Yes there are ways to farm as prot war or holy priest, but they are not as efficient and convenient as just having a farming alt that is actually good at farming. In the long run the alt is better.
---
Shaman, Warrior, Warrrior, Warrior, (Warrior / Rogue)

They can even intimidate the wood to help be like a boat.
---
My friend and I are leveling on a pserver and I can tell you, barrens chat has been fucking golden.
---
Lol you make a known leveling bottleneck out to be a good thing. You just scored an Own Goal. Point, Alliance for zone choices
---
What's a downtime?
---
Why are all the warriors chain pulling and capped at full rage?
---
&gt;20 minutes later

Wanna do another Baron run?
---
No ret.

wat
---
If your serious in to raiding spend a night leveling the entire guild warlocks to summoning ritual level then spread them out at all the raids. That what we did.
---
You did a great job on this!
---
I think the best approach is to narrow down what you want.  First, Horde or Alliance?  Second, tank/DPS/or heals? Third, does race play a part in your decision?
---
I personally found my Enh / Ele shaman the funnest in pvp. I could pretty much solo anyone in world pvp and with all the utility a shaman has they are great in BG's too. Ghost Wolf allows them to be almost as good as a druid flag carrier in Warsong Gulch. 
---
Druids and Paladins are similar but with less burst dps.
---
I’m definitely excited but those female night elf’s haven’t really done it for me since I was 12.
---
Back in the day yes, classic wow at its release took a lot of time. It was new and there was not a lot of info out. Fast forward 15 years, and you drop a game that people know backwards and forwards. Yes it will be slower and more grindy, but those leveling in classic will be much more efficient than in the past. You will be able to use your time more wisely. Whatever you do don’t rush it.
---
Unless it's Alliance to Horde, then, Godspeed.
---
This is very pixelated, I can’t even read the text
---
No, I think a lot of people do. It's tough, because the journey is so much longer. In retail-WoW, it's kind of secondary. You probably have a few maxed level characters, and since the game isn't as much of an "Adventure" your role is less defined by your class. In Classic, the difference of being a rogue and being a paladin is pretty huge.
---
Intuitive &amp; easier to use than all these Excel list. Thanks you :)
---
Do yourself a favor and what this druid pvp video:
---
https://youtu.be/vCvb8MwvsD4
---
You won’t be that efficient to be honest. You’ll want an epic mount to attempt wintersabers as there is a LOT of running - even with the alternative village-kill-return route.
---
Guide here if you’re interested:
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=894
---
Yeah, I saw a hardcore guild recruiting the other day require all raiders to have a lvl 20 lock alt
---
For Hunters, wouldn't Truestrike shoulders be BiS pre-raid? Also I don't think HoJ would be our best option for Trinket.
---
Thank you for this.
---
Well considering there are 27 actual "subclasses" that all need different gear / weapons I'd say its not unexpected.
---
Im roling a nelf Hunter, couldn't care less what some think. Gonna kite them to death
---
Amen brother.
---
I'd say Night Elf for pvp because of Shadow Meld. A hunter with it can guard flags, positions, or just hide until the danger passes. Pair it with a stealthed pet and you have a ganking starter pack. When going Alliance Hunter on a pvp server I'd say Shadowmeld is too good to pass on.
---
Cool site!  Your stage 6 Prot warrior shield has mp5 and +heal on it. That seems unlikely to be the best option.
---
At the start your gear won't make much of a difference between holy and shadow for healing dungeons and initial MC attempts or become friends with a mage.  
---
Though, at some point you will need to have a farming alt.
---
Don’t do it! Too boring.
---
Ok, enjoy your dead 1k pop servers. I'll be back to this thread in 6months.
---
Looks great, will be recommending to guild.
---
I only ever raided in vanilla and never did Naxx, was just never that invested and will most likely be in the same boat again.  Honestly if I can raid once a week that would be great but we shall how things end up rolling.
---
I will be playing as a straight up holy priest for funs (16 Disc / 35 Holy) so hoping that will carry me there haha. That said I would be happy just running MC, BWL, Onyxia, and maybe ZG. In fact my end game “goal” would just to have an entire tier 1 or 2 set. Yeah not BiS but that don’t matter for me honestly.
---
Not sure if I am going alliance or horde yet, I was an Undead Priest back then so thinking of maybe running an dwarf priest this time but waiting for friends to decide what they are doing.
---
Hope we all find something that works for us all!!
---
My same thought applies. I Hope they just make the flight masters unkillable and aggro onto anyone who hits someone within a certain range. Give them a bow and let it hit for 1 mil+ damage. Just insta kill people camping the flight paths. THAT was so stupid. Let people land and at least prep for a few seconds to actually do some player VERSUS player. not player vs load time vs 19 abilities insta killing them.  
---
Did you guys REALLY enjoy doing that to people? Am I the only one that really enjoyed a battle that lasted a few seconds at the least up to a minute+? Or an encounter where 2 groups of 3 started going after each other and waged a little war?  
---
Rank farming on insta kill points is just stupid IMO. BUT, I understand those neckbeard players that want the rank found a way to do it, so they just exploit it.  
---
I Cannot wait for AB. That was my favorite. Good coordination and reacting could keep you in almost any AB match. It wasn't just "My stick is bigger then your stick, get rekt".
---
Watching is nice, but ultimately I gotta play.
---
For a game like classic wow, that is so beautiful and honestly peaceful if you choose to be (play a PvE server) it's absolutely great just as a time killer with a glass of whisky.
---
I think it will depend on demographics but not in the way you think. Players who don't have much time to play will most likely chose a hunter. I have always seen hunters as the solo players. Other roles require co op and thus more time. Well at least that would be the reason why I'd chose a hunter.
---
Keep track of the value a mob drops and farm the ones with high value. If you do this for 30 hours  while leveling. You can afford your mount when you ding 60.
---
IDK, from what I was just told by several people in another thread, Druids are the undisputed PVP gods of Vanilla and can beat everyone 1v1.
---
I could not stand leveling as prot mobs take sometimes 1 minute to kill
---
31 shadow 20 holy got enough umpf to heal and easily dps the downside is if shit hit fan then you go oom in instances.   As you don’t got the Regen from disc.
---
My only experience with this was in BC. A buddy and myself grinded our this rep for our wintersabers before the release of Wrath when we leveled new characters. We went from 54-62/3 to get to exalted. I’m sure it can be done in classic, but without any xp nerf, I would start about 56-57 imo.
---
Classic or not. Anytime I see a night elf hunter, I assume you just started playing wow.
---
Commit!!
---
No Enh either. Useless website. lol.
---
It was in the garage of a house I'm renting, so yes technically!
---
I’m feeling bad that there’s still no release date
---
as a future orc rogue main this makes me happy.
---
No
---
Thank you for clarifying about the weapons. I would definitely hope then that Blizzard addresses them in particular.  Though I feel Blizzard may not be able to. 
---
I had initially slotted the update for Rank 12-14 at Phase 6 with Naxx. But could see an argument for Phase 5. 
---
However, if it's possible for pre-1.12 items to be added, it kind of opens a can of worms for all items to be pre-1.12 until Phase 6. Which would solve a lot of problems, but as mentioned, doesn't seem like something Blizzard is able to or wanting to do.
---
&gt;It was 8 weeks to be exact. And I think dedicating a pvp meta that only existed for 8 weeks to an entire phase is way too much.
---
I looked back, it was actually 7 weeks (April 19-June 7, 2005). That is why I think Blizzard should add a half phase to introduce BGs a month before BWL (P3).
---
Phase 1 should last longer, 4-5 months. As the power level will already be higher with 1.12 talents and the community didn't want Dire Maul to further trivialize that content. So they could ultimately shorten Phase 2 to 1 month. I predict Phase 3 to be released 6 months after release. Especially now with BGs included in that phase.
---
Oof. As a hunter rolling need on Hand of Justice I could see a lot of rage. I haven't been keeping up with private servers etc. so I have no idea how to gear :D
---
Hell yeah, Mate, mates.
---
Begone, peasant!
---
I played on a rppve server for 2 years when the game first came out.  My thinking was I would experience the game like I was playing dnd.  After about 6 months of leveling to 60 I started to raid.  This was great!  I stopped doing any rp events and went all the way on dungeons and raids, but something was missing.  I got too comfortable walking around the opposing faction, and PvP flagging just gave them the jump on you every time.  Eventually at BC I decided to transfer one of my alts (paladin) to a PvP server on a server transfer.  This was the most fun I ever had on a character. I remember farming for plant nodes and seeing horde try to bust up my route, I would hammer down and put he hurt on!  PvP gave me an experience I couldn’t get in PvE, that sense of danger at every corner.  That’s not to say that every horde player would attack me at first sight, sometimes it was funny helping some low level horde out and then just /bow you for not obliterating them on first contact.  Do whatever you feel comfortable, however I think a good deal of the game is hindered when safety is on toggle.

 **Did somebody say \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]?!**
---
I heard Asmongolds blood was actually non-carbonated Dr Pepper
---
What's good teebs It's Kurzogg! 
---
I love this little tale.
---
I’m sorry what?
---
Holy priest with talent in smite will work fine. Not as good as shadow but as long as your not raiding shadow can heal to 90% of a holy priest.  I healed all 5mans as shadow.  And started raiding as 31 shadow 20 holy. But switch to holy because I was going oom.
---
Yeah I remember being excited for it at first and then being disappointed because of the linearity and lack of variation. IIRC every starting zone had the same or very similar quest rewards so character's gear tended to look very similar.
---
Did you try to zoom in grandpa?
---
This ammo - it’s the beat ammo for hunters? And it’s crafted by engi?
---
How hard are the mats to use this ammo? Is it something I can use regularly or only for like raiding cause it’s so expensive to make?
---
If I don’t go engi, how hard is it to obtain otherwise ? Can I buy it at a modest price on the AH or is it generally expensive ?
---
any healer, makes runs much faster if you're using the mobs' mana to keep the tank up
---
Really cool site man! Easy to use
---
You can for sure do this with engineering.
---
I didn't know you couldn't with the other profs.
---
god bless you.
---
I gave hunter the ole college try (literally was in college) and while I was awful at it and spent a lot of time doing dumb shit, it's time to give the shaman class a spin.
---
I think hes just saying you're a dick
---
You could do that in Vanilla as well. You just needed to invite someone and convert to raid then you could /camp and get potted to the entrance.
---
You forgot Ret Pally and Boomkin.
---
Depends on the race. Troll.... yeah gotta be a raptor. Night elf, shadowmelding with my kitty, orc wolf baby.
---
This brought back flashbacks of "HUG THE WALL". Then one person not really paying attention and then vent going off. Loved those days.
---
But the barrens are amazing
---
Hoj is before better trinkets come out.
---
this is a godsend my man, thank you. I've found several sites listing vanilla bis but either they're incomplete or wrong. thank you my dude
---
All of them .
---
&gt; I'm ashamed to admit but I DO love memes, whatever they are
---
I'm also for allowing that content, primarily because there's only _so much_ news for a video game subreddit post-launch - never mind a 15 year-old remake! /r/games is a better place for people who only want news without the memes, since the rare bits of Classic WoW news are sure to pop up there.
---
Black lotus was A LOT cheaper back in vanilla. Nobody was buying that stuff.
---
I disagree. Warrior and casual don’t go together. I played one in Vanilla and switched to rogue for TBC.
---
The different gear sets, the respeccing, the farming of raid materials. It’s just not for playing casually.
---
Naw that seems to be a lot of people. Especially people like myself who started after Vanilla or haven't played vanilla since it was retail. I think it goes back to the difference in philosophy between Retail and Classic. Retail is "bring the player not the class" so pretty much all the classes have similar abilities. I.e. Pretty much all classes have an interrupt, some sort of aoe damage dealer, all the tanks are viable for all PVE content, all the healers are balanced as far as healing output goes, yada yada.. Basically choosing a class is more a matter of flavor than role, whereas in Vanilla every class has distinct strengths and weaknesses with a handful of benefits no other class has. Combined with the significant time investment it requires to get to level cap, I think this is why the decision is so difficult; it is a lot of work to reroll. If it sounds like that is matter of fact it's not meant to be, just my hypothesis.
---
Lol. This is so accurate. I also heard the built in latency in abilities and such could cause some issues as the game was originally designed around that slowness. Now that everything is so damn fast, the game might seem incredibly different,
---
Yes warlock is very gear dependent. Rogue not at all. I’m sure you’ve seen the roguecraft clips where a naked rogue with white daggers is owning everyone.
---
Enjoy! I can assure you there will be world PVP to be had, but you might have to go out of your way to find it :)
---
Exactly.. i want to troll a mage but at the same time i want to gank people and be a rogue, but i also want to be a shaman or maybe a pally buff bot. Its actually driving me insane LOL.
---
There will be so many warriors doing emp runs to farm for IF, that it shouldn't be all that hard to get into a group without a melee that needs HoJ.
---
I'd say Accuria is BiS for Tanks.
---
Why not Thalanaar? It's much closer to DM.
---
“Everyone you know”. 
---
Confirmation bias
---
You get Smoldering Wand two levels later and it does significantly less damage (13.4 vs. 17.5 DPS). 
---
Look, at the end of the day, none of this should matter much. Spending more time in one spot to save more time later, etc. The question is how it all may translate to mid-game and end-game to set up your character best. If in the process of setting yourself to use a Greater Magic wand at level 13, you're also able to set up your long game for professions, it's a win-win.
---
This thread has thus far solely focused onearly game professions, but my hope is that it would alos discuss advantages nad disadvantrages of end game options.
---
You don't need to aggro more than 2 mobs when leveling a hunter, it's a waste of time compared to single target, and if you keep aggroing 2+ every pull you'll go oom very quickly, multi shot + mend pet is going to drain all your mana, meaning downtime. You don't see any speedrunner doing that shit, they always go with cats because they just shred mobs while leveling.
---
&gt;also we're not even sure faster attack speed will help with frenzy procs in classic. Most procs in the game were normalized
---
There's nothing to do with procs, fast attack speed means more chance to crit which gives more frenzy uptime. You have no idea what you're talking about, I'm tired of seeing people advocating for owls just because they read it somewhere from some shitter, then you have people who believes in it and waste their time going all the way to teldrassil just to get a inferior pet, stop doing that.
---
Orc rogue &gt; UD rogue
---
Weird I feel like warlocks should just have an arrow to every single class on here all the way to like 1.9
---
Welcome aboard! I’ll be playing priest myself! I’ll link you to the discord once I make it
---
That's what I was going for. ^
---
/taunt
---
You’re right, it requires a bunch of skill to play Druid in classic!
---
The thought of Alcor’s Sunrazor going in a rogue’s off hand and not a tank’s main hand makes my heart hurt.
---
Suggestion: there are multiple available specs. e.g. as a Warrior, you could go 2h Fury or Dualwield Fury. as Tqnk, you could go deep prot, prot/impale, or fury defiance.
---
maybe a short explanation about caps etc, a way to choose options (e.g. are you orc/human/else, do you have worldbuffs X and Y and Z etc)
---
Oh please remove HoJ or you're about to open the gates of hell...
---
What would be better than HoJ on launch?
---
1. Instances takes longer expect 2h runs
---
2. Leveling is a lot slower 
---
3. Once you get to ~lv30 you end up in a war zone expect to get ganked a lot if on pvp server. 
---
4. Raiding in 40man raids is shit to organize.  
---
5. You need to grind dungeons to get gear to progress in raids. 
---
Expect ~10-12d in game time to hit lv60.  Serious yes the record is ~3d but your not them.  That would mean 24h*10=240-280h of game time before the game /grind even start.  
---
my recommendation to you is to set your expectations on the level you can/want to sustain.  
---
Play for fun. Find like minded. And keep your priorities in order.  Family/work/friends before game.
---
I did. There aren’t any deep talents in protection that increase your mitigation drastically like in other expansions. You get extra armor, one extra block charge, 10 defense and last stand. 
---
The 10+ def is negligible after you get a few raid pieces, last stand and an extra block is obviously good, but none of these talents are deep in the protection tree and none of them should be needed if your raid is competent.
---
Last stand is a panic button, really nice to have if you need it, but you shouldn’t. 
---
The extra armor amounts to not very much mitigation
---
The rest of the talents are basically things that are really good for tanking 5/10 mans. 
---
A guild that forces off tanks to go protection for raids are objectively wasting dps resources.  
---
The upside of running at least fury off tanks if not also MT: higher TPS, allows dps to output considerably more damage. Making fights considerably shorter, lessening the demand for healers to push HPS. You also have up to five warriors in the raid who can actually put out real numbers, higher than any other class, instead of wasting them in a queue behind the MT. 
---
The last arguments: fury warriors have no threat reducing ability, meaning they are usually on the top of the threat meters behind the tank. This gives them a considerable advantage in the case they need to suddenly tank a boss if the MT dies in the middle of a fight. 
---
There is no chance of an off tank in protection spec doing enough tps in blue gear to simply taunt and hold a boss for more than a few seconds before it unleashed and aggros the dps.
---
People can argue as much as they like, this isn’t private server meta, this was well known by the end of vanilla. 
---
There is literally not a good argument to go prot, other than if that’s what you want to play or you feel you need the added benefits you get in 5/10-mans. 
---
That being said, this is also blown out of proportion, you can easily clear anything with all your warriors in prot gear and spec, I’m just doing my part to save warriors from the most boring part of the game - the protection spec
---
Everyone is asked to get to ST for it, either to get a drop from Morphaz (mage, priest, hunter, rogue), from Atal'arion (drood) or just feathers from the trolls (war, pally, shaman, lock).
---
Exactly. That's why I'm not as worried. 
---
But could create a bigger divide in PvP between those who have the Rank 13/14 vs those who have T2.
---
Phase 5 should be out a year after launch. So depends on how many people can get Rank 13/14 before then.
---
Shadow resistance can help a lot againist Shadow Priest and Warlocks. Since Naxx isn't until the end of classic, it's easy to obtain shadow resist gear and use it in PvP when facing Warlocks of SPriest.
---
Rune of the Guard Captain? I guess it’s a horde only
---
there will certainly be a lot more than 40 people at 60 within the second week, perhaps not on all servers, but on certain servers that have the "Extremely hardcore" private server guilds that have been clearing all of vanilla content time and time again over the last 5 years. Those are the type of guilds I'm saying will have rag down by the end of the second week, the type of people that sleep 3-4hrs a night for the first 2 weeks and already know everything from their character traits, name, class, leveling path, secondary leveling path, exactly how many mobs to kill, etc.
---
These people will also have all the warlocks/paladins in their guild giving away their gold so that the other classes can afford their mounts directly at 40, speeding up leveling time. These extremely hardcore guilds will likely be lvl 60 by day 7 or 8, so having rag dead by day 13 or 14 is really not that far fetched when you keep in mind they would have several groups of players running dungeons to gear, allocating drops and resources to exactly the right people who need them. It's not uncommon for many if not all of these players to play for the first 36 hours straight to get ahead of the curve to speed up their leveling.
---
thanks phantoom

WORLD OF WARCRAFT IS A FEELING
---
I just posted something about Hide of the Wild for BiS for Holy Priests vs Archivist Cape:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbdgna/hide\_of\_the\_wild\_for\_holy\_priests/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bbdgna/hide_of_the_wild_for_holy_priests/)
---
Where did you source the info?  What stat weights were used?
---
Here's the thing that always gets me confused about these polls. So say you have warriors at 17% of total players, and shamans at 14% or whatever. Does that mean if you roll a Horde player (assuming the Horde/Allicance split is around 50/50) Shamans will actually make up around 28%\~ of the population? Does that make sense? Since All the other classes are split between the two factions, but the 14% of all players playing Shamans are all obviously horde.
---
On these results, Paladin and Shaman are grouped, which would seem to imply there was just one option for the two of them?
---
I hope that makes sense, but I'd really be curious in knowing.
---
I’ve prepared for classic by buying an old gateway PC and ordering the slowest internet windstream offers.
---
Rune of the Guard Captain? The extra melee hit is almost useless for Hunters
---
But then you are the new mafia...who will then be taken down ;)

I used to main druid way back in 2005 myself. The lifestyle and love runs deep for druids. But I’ve adopted some other loves since in the pserver setting. Shaman is incredible. Resto shamans are dope and ele shamans kick ass in PvP. I love playing a mage. So much control, so many options. And I did finally switch to warrior. It really is an art form to play a warrior well. It feels so right using the tools at your disposal. It feels doubly right using those tools with a healer at your back lol. I think imma roll warrior main and one of the clothies when classic rolls around.
---
Nice webbiste!. But a few items are wrong. Blizzard have pretty much confirmed no progessive itemization for updated items, this means a few items will be bis on launch like Bloodmail boots and Ban'thok Sash
---
I read way back when that the screech spell on owls makes them quite powerful for leveling. Screech does aoe damage and high threat. Can’t find the thread.... maybe someone else can
---
pigs balanced damage and armor. eats all food and is not so big that it not bother.

My undead priest  vanished from sight somewhere in Silverpine Forest 10 years ago; He performed a weird summoning ritual with a fellow warlock and since then, they both vanished. There are rumors in the Brill tavern, that he was spotted in the nearby graveyard at the big crypt a few nights back. He looked a bit deranged and he was speaking in tongues. In the morning near the crypt, folks have found a big dark tome with some pages missing. Probably he was attempting that weird summoning ritual...again.
---
Rumors...
---
I think getting ahead is gonna be the problem. We'll see though. I expect a lot of drama
---
I think it's more of the TBC than Vanilla. Warrior will be much better with Priest or even better with Pally because druid can't do shit about slow/roots on a warrior.
---
I did a light check, seems nice.
---
If you want an improvement suggestion you could add items that are close to as good as the bis one. Would help people not to tunnel vision on that 1 drop (ofc then its no longer bis but its more important to know your class than just have best items). This improvement might require imputting some explanation on what a class wants from gear and how much (+hit, crit, def so on...)
---
Well for context I still felt very helpless when I was very geared vs geared warlocks. I call it runlock and it's hella annoying. The issue with stacking SR is I'd have to significantly downgrade gear further into the game, and I'd be less effective against other classes. 
---
Still..might be worth it.
---
On my warrior at least imp overpower pretty much slaughters rogues.
---
Why is there no [Rosewine Circle](https://classicdb.ch/?item=13178) for Healers as Pre BIS?
---
Is that an Item that got patched in later? Very curious about this.
---
If I recall correctly leveling with someone really slowed down the leveling process, to the point where you would run out of quests
---
ZG bat is my favorite, I think it's the ultimate PvP pet
---
It has the 1.0 attack speed to keep casters desperate, and the size of the wings and the noise it does also messes up everybody it's attacking.
---
The psychological factor of it makes me smile. People actually play worse then they would because of this pet's visuals and sounds.
---
You can get ahead of 99% of the playerbase, even if you play inefficiently, by playing on a no-life schedule. Which those streamers will be.
---
Jokes aside, why no pally tank? 😕
---
I know that pally’s are impractical as main tanks, but they tank trash mobs like no other - surely it would be helpful for those guys to know what to equip too
---
You can train your pet I think. The pet trainer is near your class trainer.
---
It isnt clear if that will be available at the start isnt it?
---
It came in later when more quests were added to the world (Sunken Temple class quests or Searing Gorge aswell)
---
Thanks for the replies
---
But they have to sleep sometime, and by the time you wake up it's very likely they'll be at your heels again if you just wing it. I also think you're underestimating how many people are gonna nolife. I see a lot of people talking about taking a week or two off, etc. It's vanilla, everyone fondly remembers playing through the night when they were younger, and they wanna do it again.
---
Oh good to know. Yeah I doubt they’ll do it but it would be nice if Blizz released a list of what items will be available when.
---
I started playing vanilla as a kid and totally played Nelf Hunter because of LOTR. In Classic, I will continue to play the same race and class, because NE has the best animations, coolest armor, and because the class is just crazy fun to level and pvp.
---
&gt; The weapons are whatever, so few players reach R14 that it's not a serious cause for concern and they're only a big deal for two classes.
---
Except, the updated healing mace is INSANE for healers. Like only 3 1handers are better and they come from Cthun (Final Boss AQ40), Faerlina (Naxx), Kel'Thuzad (Final boss in Naxx). So with this knowledge, we will have classes going for rank 14 that typically didn't.
---
Oh man this is nostalgic. I don’t think I can handle the nostalgia of this sub XD
---
On the concept, I don’t have an issue to have r12/13 players have a more suitable gear for pvp than pve players. It was always the case as a rogue player for example, has way too much hit compared to a pvp player, and far less stamina.
---
But a r13 rogue will be less efficient than a bis MC pve rogue, in pve (not enough it, less ap)
---
He moves all his peripherals to the side of the desk of the factions he’s currently playing.
---
Hehe thanks a lot.
---
The only ones that make a big difference early on are disease/poison cleansing (water) and grounding (air). Both in PvP and PvE. Getting those pesky diseases and poisons gone or avoid the one killer spell from some mob or player is great.
---
And then they realise that Ironfoe procced way too often on private servers and is much worse in Classic WoW :D 
---
(tbf nobody can be sure that this will be the case)
---
You can't train stuff like bite, claw and gore on the trainer. You have to learn it from higher level beasts.
---
You have to tame them and use the skill several times until you learn it and can teach it to other pets.
---
You obviously play Alliance if you rank Shaman and Windfury totem that low...
---
True, it seems like the list he is useing is assuming they will be going with progessive itemization? so a few items are wrong on each class
---
The sun, Kyle. It burns.
---
Ah I knew there was something with it. Thanks.
---
Thank you
---
I've been testing the early wand strategy for undead.
---
Because there are so many humanoid / undead mobs in tirisfal glades and both the tailor and enchanter trainer is in Brill it is a viable strategy. I've done two runs of 1-10. The first I managed to get my wand at level 8, second run I was almost level 10. This is without much grinding but simply just questing.
---
One idea I've had is that on launch is to make a yell macro when I am in Brill where people can trade me 15-20 linen cloth for a wand. Obviously the first people would have to trust me not to scam them because they would need to give me their linen before I could actually make the wand. Them giving me 20 linen cloth would give me skill up both for enchanting and tailoring early on.
---
Yeah, it is. Probably will have those stats on release though since they don't want to change item stats.
---
Yes, PvE servers always had the option to flag for PvP.
---
Not necessarily if you  kill everything that you encounter. But yes, you decide the xp and get a group bonus Xp (marginal)
---
Warlocks are mushrooms
---
It all depends on Blizz and how true they are going to be with adding items at roughly the same time they did originally. Selfishly I hope RotGC is in Phase 1.
---
Yeah this is super annoying on a pserver I'm on, especially because I'm rolling every class to 20 just to get a feel for what I want. This won't be an issue in Classic.
---
Nah point of the mafia was to have people there at all times to control the supply, which brings up another point. There won't be EU players on our servers that will be farming at EU times, only the few vaccinated people will
---
It's more about leveling with him for enjoyment not really worried about hitting 60 quickly. I'll probably have another character that I will solo level when our schedules don't match up.
---
For pure mitigation Warden is the absolute BiS. If more threat is required and mitigation matters less AQ warhammer+OH opens up.
---
You are the MVP my friend! Did not know about this information. 
---
Thx so much
---
I know it's hard to imagine, but some people don't like to PvP.
---
I have several friends that are worrying about this. They are going to be pushing for server firsts and this topic came up. It is a giant loophole which is going to basically force any competitive players to become greifers to advance. We all know the best way to level honor is to camp dungeon entrances and flight paths.  
---
People that want to be competitive but don't want to do this will NOT be able to compete. Plain and simple. This is a rather glaring problem! Ranking up in pvp will be the ONLY way to advance to higher tier gear and without BGs, greifing will hit a breakneck pace.
---
This time around, in place of edgelord teenagers all trying to be Legolas, the true Classic Noobs will be the retail players who never played Vanilla, but will pile in to try Classic and see what all the fuss is about, cause that's what all the cool kids (streamers) are doing. I'm at least partly in that bin since I first played retail in 2015, so I'm even more of a "modern" WoW player than most, having no direct experience of anything before Warlords.
---
So, assume the average player in this segment started in Wrath or later, is not a regular on this sub, never played vanilla, and knows basically nothing about it or how it was different from retail. Now they're staring at the Classic character screen; which combo are they most likely to pick?
---
Looking at the current realmpop for 120s on retail U.S. realms, the number one combo on Alliance side today is Nelf Druid (127k). Following that (counting down only those combos that are available in Classic) the top five includes Human Pally (108k), Nelf Hunter (78k), Human Warrior (56k), and Human Mage (50k).
---
Horde side, of the Classic combos, the top are Tauren Druid (74k), Orc Warrior (61k), Orc Shaman (46k), Orc Hunter (44k), and Undead Warlock (36k).
---
My guess based on that, is that you're going to see the greatest number of retail tourists playing Nelf Druid and Human Pally on Alliance side, and Tauren Druid or Orc Warrior Horde side. So if you're looking to tag Classic Noobs, that's probably what they will be.
---
Let's hear it for Female Orc Warlocks!!!! woooooo!
---
I’d rather be a dick than an asshole.
---
Your missing the spec for disc priest. Or can one assume it is the same for holy?
---
Thx so much for your info mate, really helpful. I agree that it’s extremely boring but for me it’s more of a pause from Devilsaur and other farming spots.
---
It’s true. I used to be one of them. My first character was a human priest on a PVE server.
---
"I'm sure I'm invisible"
---
*flares* "Hi Draxx"
---
Can't you catch the Ogrimmar zeppelin to thunder buff? I don't know if that existed on this patch
---
Definitely keep changing as you go. The lower happiness takes two minutes to fix after you get a new pet, and the only downside is you'll go through pet food faster for some time, but it is 100% worth it.
---
Falling out of stealth you mean
---
*shrug* Maybe it was TBC, I played up till Wrath so I can't remember every little change. Also the criteria for being a good hunter shouldn't be how they react to terribly implemented features. I'll play regardless of if they fix or leave it and if its left I can guarentee at least once I'ma forget to dismiss the little chucklefuck and wipe an instance.
---
Nah, I mained priest for 11 years.
---
During classic I will be playing mage for a number of reasons.
---
1. High DPS low learning curve.
---
2. Solo farming
---
3. Teleports and portals to all major cities.
---
4. Crowd control, escape abilities and general shifty was.
---
5. Great looking tier sets and itemization throughout raids.
---
Hi everyone! I am in dire need of some help. 
---
Druid, or Warlock. 
---
My biggest interest is PvP. I love complex and challenging classes. I really enjoy world PvP and dueling. I want to be useful in raids. I don't think I will have a lot of time to play, so I would enjoy a class that is viable throughout the expansion. 
---
Also, engineering is a default profession I will take. If I were to play Druid or Warlock, what other profession should I choose?   
---
Thanks everyone for your help!
---
ur list is literally 1-9 "they the best"
---
A warrior with blessing of freedom is number one boolshit.
---
Wrath
---
There was no zeppelin to Thunder Bluff in vanilla.
---
keep calm, it's just wednesday.
---
cat, raptor, wind serpent or wolf. Any of them are viable pve, wolves/wind serpent more so on fights where your pet needs to stay ranged, as they can either buff your melees(wolf) or stay at 20 yards and cast lightning breath (wind serpent). Cat or raptor is best on fights where your pet can freely dps.
---
Barrens as soon as you both get there makes the most sense, but it'll be hard to know how congested it is. We know sharding will be in the starting zones which should keep it from being too much slower in the orc/troll area.
---
Thank you for this
---
It looks waaaaaay too cartoony
---
Click on an item to view alternatives would be nice.
---
🍆👌
---
😫
---
So glad I’m not one of those poor souls who has to book their time off soon.
---
Not all Spanish people play on Spanish only servers?
---
Awesome site man! Do you happen to have back ups? Like not getting the engineering head piece
---
It’s okay
---
TheFfrench and Svensken keeping to themselves on a separate realm is a wet dream.
---
It's the definition of winning harder.
---
It's nice and all but all I wanna know is what the hell is the source on this picture?
---
Exactly why Im going hunter and not warrior
---
As a holy priest i grouped up with a mage friend and just wrecked hearthglen of w/e it was called. He spammed Arcane explotion and I spammed heals and shields.
---
Except trash melee mobs - when you pull a large group of mobs, pally tanks can hold threat better than warr or druid thanks to consecrate, blessing of sanctuary, holy shield, and you could even throw ret aura in there. Even better if you have that engineer shield and and a shield spike on it.
---
Herp derp, yeah!
---
Sure they can, until they run out of mana.
---
I get what you are saying and respect your opinion but I don't agree with it. I doubt anyone got to 60 in less than 7 days played time. No one did it when Vanilla was out, even though we know more about the game now, I just don't see it happening at the rate you are saying. 
---
Even if there were 40 people that were 60, it still takes time to get everyone geared enough to down Rag. You can't do it in greens and dungeon blues. Healers would go OOM way to fast and MT would die fast af w/o enough fire resistance.
---
Shadow resistance gear wont make a ton of difference imo. You would have to stack a ton and lose out too much on other stats, then you have don rodrigo's to lower your resistances. More worth it to invest in a shadow reflector. Maybe some of those potions that absorb a shitload of shadow damage, too
---
But why would you want to level tailoring and enchanting on your main from the start? It's making your life deliberately harder by skipping skinning pre-40 for no gain.
---
Easy there turbo, I said "something like 8/22/21". It's an option.
---
Some people enjoy cheaper shapeshifting, like how you enjoy getting angry at nothing.
---
But you seem like a decent guy from your other comments.
---
no back in vanilla i was a one of the strongest hunter with T2 equip. now i try to beat myself with a shadow priest 😊
---
new class = new game for me.
---
You keep your first pet and stable it when going out to acquire more skills for it. The dps increase makes it worthwhile. It isn’t worth it to change pets as loyalty levels give you such a benefit with points and so additional pet talents.
---
It may be necessary to downgrade for the res. While downgrading sucks, you do 0 damage when you're dead.
---
Right now I'm thinking Hunter but it changes by the week lmao.
---
I used to play holy pally in TBC 
---
I find myself extremely jealous of spirit lol.
---
I’m not sure if I’ll get over it lol
---
All I know is it's a wikihow photo. No idea what the context is for though.
---
Yeah, but when you let someone die intentionally it usually takes longer for everyone. Personally I like to put up with it for the minimum amount of time and avoid them altogether in the future.
---
Hearth set? What the hell are you talking about, hearthstone isn't influenced by any items or anything
---
can you tank 5-mans effectively without improved righteous fury?
---
I already went for private servers. Not vanilla ones, of course.
---
It would be far more helpful to make a list like Taladril's that gives relative effectiveness of many pieces of gear:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGBasFY8fFGpBtiD1TAUBB99wxboCSVh5MW_6b_z0oU/pubhtml#
---
I had issues with them on my hunter, too. I feel like they are a hard counter to a lot of classes, and I could only beat a top level warlock with a shadow reflector and maybe even a shadow protection potion.
---
#nochange
---
Hey! I would go warlock because they only get stronger as the expansions continue, and are the best 1v1 class in the game, having mained a Druid I can tell you they are basically just outlasting your opponent, and only fun in WSG BG, the other 2 bgs are very VERY boring for Druid.
---
Alliance doesn't have that many warlocks and priests compared to rogues, hunters and warriors.
---
Thanks, I'll check the link out.
---
The priest is missing a wand for Pre-Bis 1.
---
Otherwise, it looks nice. I'd welcome alternatives for each slot though, even if I see that will be a lot of work.
---
Best option would be: 
---
Choose the pet that fits most of your needs. 
---
If you plan on chainpulling you might want to get a pet that has a higher survivability, since you'll be doing most of the damage anyways. If you expect to get into PvP fights more often than you'd chainpull anything it would be smarter to choose a pet with a fast attackspeed.
---
Regarding abilities: 
---
I'd suggest you stay with your standard pet and just train it new abilities. New abilities are often learned pretty quickly. Especially abilities like Sprint, Dash or family specific ones. (Charge, Furious Howl, Scorpid Poison,...) 
---
Offensive abilities like Claw or Bite might take a while to train. 
---
After you obtained that ability you can run to the next stable master and switch your temprary pet to your usual one and train the new learned ability to your pet. 
---
Keep in mind that you dont have to feed your new pet to learn his abilitys.  Thus you don't have to waste precious food on it. 
---
Usually you learn the new ability after the first 4-10 kills. That should be enough time.
---
That desk can fit so many more monitors...
---
Very nice, even if it's off in a few spots and missing pvp/wboss gear. I'd love to see this customizable where we can set our own items per slot, per stage, and save it as a link, similar to talent calculators.
---
I never actually played Vanilla retail so it may not be valid in Classic. But it's close to Blackrock Mountain and there are always mages there making portals so you can get to any city fast and easy with your hearthstone.
---
I would love to see a crafted/drop variant. Getting a lot of the crafted BiS will be really tough for a lot of folks if the servers are very dense.
---
Hey! Just play with a resto / feral charge / natural shapeshifter spec but if u want to do some farming then put 1 point into omen of clarity, and keep a set of feral gear
---
Exactly right. This intense focus on having one specific collection of gear is something I hate about the pserver crowd.
---
Interesting, thanks. I'll have to do some more reading.
---
Great job! My only suggestion is to add drop locations/mobs on the tooltips.
---
Can you create an option to not have BoE epics included? If I play a mage, the chance of me getting TWO freezing bands is incredibly low.
---
Trolls have the most comical and thus the best stealth animation.
---
That should be enough.
---
Hunter still owns in pvp, throughout all patches, and while ur damage starts to fall off towards the end, u aren’t gonna be topping meters to begin with, you just use tranq and get a shit ton of loot because only 2 per raid
---
Female gnomes have the dirtiest dance 😏
---
Alright for warlocks the list is quite off by a lot for most phases.
---
However, I get that that is the issue of the sheet you used to make your site.
---
Now onto your site, I got a couple of pointers.
---
It would be great to see totals of all equipped gear as well as set bonuses. 
---
It would be great if we could see what affix amount can roll when an item as such is linked.
---
And another great feature would be to see alternatives listed for items that are fairly close.
---
Otherwise a solid site and concept, looking forward to the development of it.
---
A sad day when Shadow Priest has a "bis" list when they don't have any rational spot in a raid. Let's move out of the dogmatic 2006 perspective, Reddit.
---
Yeah, I think we're in for some seriously unexpected gameplay. This is completely unchartered territory--there has never really been a vanilla WoW server that a) is taken super-seriously, b) has the upgraded ranked rewards and c) don't have BGs available right away. I predict completely absurd things to happen, anything from widespread kill-treading to whole segments of the gameworld becoming inaccessible for one faction because you just get ganked every five seconds all day. Depending on server size, the incentive to farm honor will be so powerful that it could become a game that's barely playable if you aren't already 60 by the time Phase 2 begins.
---
Kind of how shadowpanther functioned for rogues? Every piece of gear was laid out on a list from best to worst, so you could see what the best piece was as well as what upgrades were between what you had and BiS.
---
It’s easier for raids not to have to wait for a paladin to drink between pulls and the sacrifice for certain skills needed so they can have intel is just not worth it. Maybe in naxx where things get crazy but I doubt it. Dungeons they would be fine but raids I would say no unless you have a nice group propping you up.
---
Meh, depends on how much trouble theyre causing. Sometimes no help is better than some help. If they keep causing the healer to go oom, messing up pulls and ninjaing ore/plants/drops then they can just take the run back while the group moves on without them.
---
The only thing you need to keep track of is if anyone does the last turn in. You cant really prevent or keep tabs of what phase everyone else is on but you can find out when the gong is rung. Either you're close enough to finish the quest at that point or you're not.
---
I'm saying collab with other guilds so even when they are done they wait to do the turn in. In my line of work we call it trust but verify. Trust they are going to do the right thing but keep an eye on the turn in
---
1k pop? First of all we're talking about the cap of concurrent players, not the population. Secondly that concurrency cap was somewhere close to 3k during vanilla, not 1k.
---
I'd like to add that Star of Mystaria,
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=12103
---
will be a part of the launch, and an important part of caster gear.
---
Is the guy serious?
---
Rule 43. All gear is Hunter gear.
---
I was there early Naxx and we knew about getting frost gear!
---
Can’t remember how, maybe PTR or some other pre release info
---
You lost me at pve
---
This website only covers viable specs. For example there isn't a section for BiS fire mages in Phase 1-2-3 because Fire isn't viable in MC or BWL.
---
amazing website, good job.
---
I'm that guy.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** aj_jerkson! ^(hug)
---
Generally you don't use sap at all. Only ever used if the rogue is 3/3 imp sap and even then ita only 90%
---
Why the hell is one of the shadow preraid BiS trinkets a healing one??
---
Having completed the Tirisfal Glades zone at least 20 times, I gotta say that weed is so easy to find, I wouldn't even waste the silver picking up herbalism. Gloomweed is off the road on the way to Brill and Doom weed is just north of the cemetery.
---
If the pally tank is holding threat better than your warriors on trash mobs, you need to find better warriors.  Lots of warriors couldn’t manage their rage properly to optimize single target threat so perhaps this is why some think that Paladin could do this better?
---
Sounds awesome but that's so late! 
---
I feel old. &gt;&lt;
---
Horde PvE is perfect though. I may just come LFG at some point (resto sham likely).  
---
What's the perspective on missing raid times? The weekend still has responsibilities after all.
---
it looks wayyyyy too sad that people waste their money and time with such trash
---
The ogres in alterac mountains comes to mind for this
---
You're totally right, I remember human Male warlocks were exceptionally rare. Don't know why warlocks weren't more popular on Alliance.
---
Thanks looks awesome. 😊
---
what class will you play in classic?
---
Have you considered what itemization blizzard may start with?
---
&gt; elemental viable
---
His makes alot of sense if you are leveling from 1-60. Especially if you are undead you can easy hearth to brill and go to undercity right away, or take the zep to org. Just skips the zep step for undercity.   
---
At 60 I could see GG being better unless you are in EPL alot
---
Because they're the edgy casters and guess what faction edgy players like to join?
---
Join Org/SW tradechat from anywhere, global defense or world pvp channel. People saying to join simple 'World' are talking about private server functions.
---
Love that dnd story
---
Yea its mandatory unfortunately, and I agree Eastern kingdoms have a charm.
---
I suspect a lot of female undead since; "They're the prettiest Horde race for girls."
---
But little do people realize troll women are actually the superior choice.
---
I think Druid would be better but either is fine. Priest will be wanding and missing killing blows a lot.
---
Also, option to throw out all BoE's.
---
I love how enhance isn't even included.
---
like every korean mmo ever
---
Ive changed my mind at least 4 times since classic was announced. At this point I dont even know what faction I want to be. I'm generally not an indecisive person either, shit is driving me crazy.
---
Studies show huge anime tiddies reflect damage.
---
ja ja ja!
---
But you didn't know about that when WoW launched in 1.0.
---
Once you get one character to 15 or whatever the restriction is...any other characters you make on that account should be able to talk right away.  That's how it is on my characters anyway.
---
I always had ice trap and feign death right beside each other on my bars and would click them in rapid succession. I would avoid combat lock easily enough. No addons, no macro. Always had pet on passive, commanding him manually.
---
Elves in Azshara, oops
---
Hey you're describing me and I don't like it!
---
Looking back I'm kind of surprised warlocks weren't faction locked to be honest
---
That is implying everyone I know is the same mindset? How pathetic is your friend pool?
---
That would require effort that no one has apparently done
---
This is so relatable. My brother and I would share an account back in the day. I was 13, he was 2 years older. 
---
We would be allowed to play an hour each on week nights. I would usually play first (managed to get to 60 in about a year lol) and then just sit on the couch behind my bro to watch him play. On weekends he'd sometimes raid MC and I'd watch for 2-3 hours in awe. Lived his vanilla WoW memories with him. He'd almost never care when I was playing though. 
---
Started playing more towards the end of vanilla and eventually raided AQ20 and ZG myself.
---
That takes a lot of work and research
---
You are
---
This is a fantastic idea! Love it.
---
It does however need a few tweaks to the equipment. I only looked at shaman, and from what I've seen so far there are a few better options for pre-bis for the shaman healing sets.
---
Outstanding work though!
---
Also HoJ doesn't belong on hunter. You got a long way to go before these lists are even semi accurate.
---
No oomkin either! How dare ye
---
Im probably going to miss being a Warlock, but as ive aged ive come to discover that Dwarf is in fact the master race, so lock isnt an option.  Also i dont really feel like being a soul shard bitch.
---
Im kind of looking forward to healing, though.  I dont mind it on retail, and being more desirable for groups will be nice.
---
UD Rogues brah
---
Eko Farm easy.
---
I always asked for 50s + rune or 1g
---
Who hurt you?
---
where is that?
---
Can confirm. Night elves can't even be warlocks, so it's basically a Horde-only class.
---
This will be the equivalent of Gearscore in Wrath. "Awe this guy doesn't have his BIS&lt; lol!" before the person has even learned that the dungeon exists
---
And its horde only.
---
Agreed. I prefer more of a photorealistic art style like classic WoW.
---
True but trading high end epics for SR in PvP is a pretty fight-dependent thing. Like in AV I'm gonna encounter just as many if not more mages/druids/etc.
---
Warlocks for the most part, have more micromanaging. If you don't like healing whatsoever, go warlock.
---
As a mage back in Vanilla on Alliance I used Theramore. It was 15 yars ago, so I don't really recall why, but I do remember at the time feeling anything else was illogical. Then in TBC we got a port for it, but my hearth went to Outlands then anyway.
---
Even if you ARE 60 and had the time to grind, you will likely have friends that did not and trying to help them will require access to those areas, which WILL be camp fests.
---
IDK why people do not understand that the upgraded pvp gear coming out earlier is a horrid idea. It is just going to encourage Zerg camping of common points. Unless they implement SOME form of protection upon getting into a zone, the game will lose the majority, YES CASUALS, of its playerbase before BGs even come out.
---
I do NOT think that is what they intend. But who knows. If this is just a short term cash grab, maybe that is what they intend.
---
I do not want to play on a pve server, but honestly, fight club sounds a lot more fun then trying to deal with getting camped at points. Would it be so horrible for there to be coordinated battles? OR would that be against ToS? Pick an area somewhat neutral without many quests in it and just designate the area as a pvp area. Let the guys grinding go there.... Oh wait that's right, ACTUAL fighting is not what they want. They just want easy honor to get the OP gear.
---
Make an Alt. Hunter or mage
---
All two of us, lol
---
Yeah if you're prepared with additional shit you can beat them, but like who is preparing just for one class? Not me I guess
---
Toss a coin, see if a friend is going a certain faction
---
But y
---
Your work is great and I appreciate the effort! But don't I need +hit gear as warlock to reach my Hitcap? There is not a single +hit-item at stage 2! Can you clear that up for me?
---
Personally always preferred people who just said "LF port to org 1g" or something similar. 
---
The amount of people who begged for free portals even though there was a cost to the mage made you not deal with alot of the requests that pop up without a price attached. Also allows you to get the attention of mages that are in a hurry, although community and chatting to people is a big thing sometimes you just dont have time to work out what they want and if you'll actually get paid.
---
You have the Naxx Holy Pally shield in the Warriors Phase 6 slot.
---
Not sure about Vanilla, but I know that with a little build manipulation Rogues could be very effective tanks in TBC. There was even one that main tanked Black Temple for his guild, which was interesting.
---
If you miss raids, you can be a member and still raid sometimes, but loot will be prioritized to people with good raid attendance.  Consumables aren’t required until aq40, but loot will be prioritized to those who use them.
---
We have a “Less Raids, Better Raids” philosophy.  You don’t have to always come to join because let’s face it, we’re adults now, but the more dedicated you are, the more you’ll get out of it.
---
We don't know for sure yet, but most likely yes, that'll be very capable. You might need to turn down some settings (especially in big raids), but I'm guessing (again, we don't know recommended settings yet) it'll work nicely for your budget.
---
FYI we're removing PC spec posts for now as a new change to our rules, so I'm removing this post. We'll be putting up a link to BFA system requirements soon which is probably our best guess.
---
Build your own, better bang for your buck
---
It’s not a player skill issue, it’s the mechanics of a tank paladin, they have high threat aoe and reflection damage that makes them gain large amount of threat on ALL the melee mobs simultaneously, allowing DPS to aoe down trash mobs without worrying about threat. Yes, paladins cant tank well single target (i.e. boss) but they excel at tanking large groups of melee mobs.
---
...like, this is a known thing, right? I’m not just pulling this out of thin air, the consensus is paladins are the best at tanking large groups of melee mobs (keywords being large and melee)
---
So here's the problem with prot pally in pvp. What do you get in deep prot? Reckoning, Blessing of Sanc, Holy Shield. These are all things that only matter if the other team is actually attacking you. In a group fight, nobody's going after the paladin, since that's just a giant waste of time, since you're tough as nails by default and as soon as they get you close you just bubble and heal up to full. So instead they will try and lock you out of the fight or kill your team faster than you can keep them alive and isolate you. Once isolated sure HS and Reckoning will save you against a few matchups, but if you're outnumbered you'll still lose.
---
By comparison, both deep holy and ret have proactive skills that help you contribute to the team fight and not end up in a situation where you're 1vX.
---
Like you say, Avenger's Shield was a huge part of why prot started to work in PvP since it gave you a tool to actively disrupt the enemy, keeping them away from your team members and forcing them to engage with you since you could close in while they were dazed.

Remember "gank me and I get my main"?
---
One of my servers had a guild called that.
---
Thanks! Ill definitely try that out.
---
So far we don’t have any Hunters!  If you still wanna Huntard by launch, feel free! Play whatever you want!
---
Sweet!
---
Low effort? 😢
---
Me, because Warlocks were my toughest fight as a hunter. I had a frost one, too. Frost mages and warlocks were the hardest matchups for me.
---
Personally I am going orc shaman for many reasons:
---
1) I plan to twink a troll priest, used to be my old main. And possibly have a druid alt, so that's tauren and troll races covered.   
---
2) I would never main an orc as a non-healer class, so now's my chance. I have been reading the chronicles and learning about the past of orcs. I want to be a shaman who wants to redeem our race and their purpose.  
---
3) The orc hairstyle I am choosing is the long braided ponytail which spins around when you are casting! I love it.  
---
4) shamans have enough keybinds as is. If I had to keybind beserk or stomp as well, I'd die from all the keybinds.   
---
Hope that helps
---
Sounds like the behavior of the Brazilians I see on a the NA servers of a lot of other MMO's (thankfully for Retail WoW they have their own servers).
---
Excellent! Thank you very much for putting this together
---
id prob go priest if i was dual boxing 
---
im not actually familiar with what build a druid levels in but a priest is wither wanding or being anpretty similar caster to a warlock so it would be easy to setup binds.
---
Druid's probably better since they can fill more roles, for example they can both tank or heal instance runs for you. Also, they'll have less gear overlap with you. That being said, it's not so much better that I wouldn't play whichever class you prefer rather than going for the "optimal" duo.
---
oh god. this is so true.
---
And it’s mobile-friendly to boot.   Very nice work!
---
Why is it called retail if Classic is being sold by Blizzard? Private server culture?
---
As a holy priest, I'll likely go herbalism to carry me through phase 1.
---
Gotta get your random dig in at the private server players of course

Bigger brain != more intelligent. Think about it like this, let’s say you think about the color Red and the thought travels along a route of neurons. Much like to any destination there is a long route and short route. A well developed brain knows to take the most efficient route where as a Neanderthal’s brain is all over the place and it wouldn’t surprise me if they had trouble completing a single thought outside of warmth, food and sex. I’m not an expert but that’s how it was explained to me when I was much younger.
---
lmfao right. i was stuck between Shaman and Druid.. i wanted warrior but i can't be bothered with the PAINS of levelling him so im going druid or shaman for some fun levelling.  i levelled as alliance also, but now im going horde with my friends! only a few more months i cannot wait.
---
My only gripe with every single of these lists is that there are close to none altarnatives.
---
Now that's fishing for compliments if I've ever seen it.
---
It’s missing Murlocs
---
So does anyone actually want to explain why Adam Savage from Mythbusters is standing around with Hodor or are we just going to ignore the original context?

Shouldn't BRD arena chest be BiS for warriors since we're getting 1.12 version of the items?

Look for Fenn’s alliance guide this summer!

How do you fuck up that bad

Warriors are still strong, but tend to rely on pocket healers. Theres some solid guides on ranking as a warrior on youtube. Can link in 5 hours when I'm off work

I've always leveled my rogues as Sub on PVP servers and used slow mace in MH and fast dagger in OH...but I'm a weirdo

goblins
---
Oh man! I forgot all about that.
---
I deleted my Alliance char and rolled Horde on the same server at some point during vanilla. I did encounter multiple differences like the one you mentioned.
---
One I remember is that the Horde side would religiously announce "g" or "n" before actually rolling on items even on low level instances, when it definitely wasn't a rule on the Ally side. Even when it was discussed (usually for good gear only), Alliances would use different words or full sentences to announce it
---
when it's a low level rogue and you can see through his stealth from 20 yards away
---
All I know is Women are Druids, priests and prot warriors
---
this is awesome
---
I want to do PvE content as that's always been my favorite thing about WoW, but it's also very important to me that I can be self-sufficient and handle myself in PvP/other encounters too. After doing some reading it seems like choosing Rogue or Hunter is going to be my best bet, despite the fact that I've been primarily main-tanking for the past 10 years (I'm no stranger to the Hunter class though, having played mine a lot in TBC and MoP). Given that I am most likely going to be Alliance, any other things I should consider? Are we going to be swamped with Rogue and Hunter players so I'll never find a spot in pug dungeons/raids? I did not play much until TBC so I don't know what the PvE scene looked like in terms of supply/demand of the various classes.

The medics in BRD had really strong heals. I used to MC them to both CC and keep healing my group.

Raid ID gets applied to everyone in the raid when the first boss dies. 
---
If you aren't saved and enter an ID that is already in progress (bosses killed), you will become saved to that ID as you enter.
---
disagree. I was 14 when i hit 60 on my warrior and was a very busy kid, but still had a blast with getting my valor set and unstoppable force
---
For warriors/melee classes, try taking into account weapon specialization racials. E.g. Humans want swords and orcs want axes.
---
Until that 10% chance to unstealth gets you.
---
Sick job mate. The lists can be improved a bit, however its pretty sick!
---
Yeah, that seems to be the most effective way.
---
I'll probably map out potential zones/beasts so I can do it in an effective manner
---
all you had to do, is follow the damn Zeppelin!
---
I'm guessing Warriors will be the new noob class
---
Don't agree with mask of unforgiven being pre bis for rogues if they already have that much hit on. Eye of Rend would be better, would add 1% crit chance and some attackpower. You already have 12% hit chance without it so there is no reason to lose crit and ap to get it to 14. Crit is more important after you've reached 8%
---
Power house is bis warrior tank shaman healer rogue dps warrior and last slot is fury/rogue/hunter
---
I feel like something needs to be done about the constant nostalgia reposts. Things such as "What was your favorite zone?" or "Why did you choose this class." These topics have been discussed into oblivion, and it starts to get annoying when that's all you see on the main page of the subreddit.
---
Haha true, but its better than 100%.  It still can't compete with sheep or trap but
---
On my pally through the years, I always healed and I actually do enjoy it. I was much better at healing that any form of DPS. Of course pally healing was just spamming flash of light...but I enjoyed it.
---
I love to play as warrior. While leveling make friends, join groups to help others, ask others to help you. Talk during play, not just rush through things. 
---
In 2006 when I played I made so many friends during leveling that when I logged on and if I wanted to PvP you can usually get a buddy to roll out with you and spot on heals as needed. 
---
Just take care of them and they will usually take care of you. 
---
I’m hoping this game creates relationships again.
---
In my scenario you're already waiting at the dungeon for a group member to join.
---
it can take 30+ minutes for somebody to reach a dungeon.
---
What are you talking about?
---
Swedish Night Elf culturally enriched ( raped  and murdered ) by some afghan or syrian refugee.
---
The trick is to pick female orc.
---
You'll be able to raid im pretty sure of that. Will a guild funnel gear to you if youre only raiding every other week? nah doubt it.
---
I'm one of those private server players and I'm not trying to randomly dig at anyone. This attitude is cancer and needs to be called out.
---
Hrnnnn... Thighs so thicc they can crush boulders.
---
You dont see progress raids on realmplayers, you see already geared farm raids
---
If you aren't in the first wave to make it to STV, your experience is going to be days or weeks of being corpse camped with 10+ minute respawn timers. 
---
Probably one of the best arguments for rushing early levelling rather than trying to savor it.
---
Sorry, what I meant to say was;
---
It's likely that the new items added in 1.10 won't be there. But what about items that were 'revamped' at 1.10 and on the loot tables. Example would be Lord Roccor in BRD:
---
 [http://itemization.info/?search=source%3A%22Lord%20roccor%22](http://itemization.info/?search=source%3A%22Lord%20roccor%22) 
---
The shield and shoulders dropped from him on launch, but were green. At 1.10 they were massively upgraded and turned blue.  My assumption is (based on the PVP news) that Blizzard has no plans to 'upgrade' itemization, so they will be the blue versions of the items. However, since the other 2 items (mantle and idol) were added in 1.10 , they will probably not be on the loot table. This creates a whole new idea of 'BiS' lists that hasn't been seen on private servers before; a weird hybrid.
---
Human warlocks get weeded out early by Harvest golems in westfall.  I remember lots of people giving up and re-rolling there.

Replace football with basketball and letting me raid with letting me spam battlegrounds and you've got the exact same story as me.

Only downside for me is that my brother's turned into one of those "video games are such a horrible waste of time" etc., so I doubt we would play together at all. Kind of a shame, since it's just one type of entertainment, no different than a book, movie, hobby or anything else. But sometimes you can't change how someone thinks...
---
Anyway, even though OP sounds perfectly content with his situation, I'm sad for him. 29 is still such a young age to have taken up so many responsibilities and not be able to offer yourself more free time and entertainment. Even if he can spare 1-2 hours per day, it would still be awesome if he could play Classic himself.

Warriors are always great! Best in Tank,dps, and Late Game pvp Monster.

I leveled as a Furor and it wasnt that bad like everybody says
---
retail sure is pretty. you can downvote me to oblivion but I still would have liked classic to have a major graphics overhaul by blizzard's obviously awesome artists. 
---
I only ever played the vanilla wow for a year or so back in the day and I feel like classic can't come soon enough. That feeling I have has nothing to do with what graphics it had.
---
You may wanna add guild's region in your post. :)
---
I'm the opposite, that was my favorite period of vanilla wow.
---
And it coincides with the release of dire maul. That is going to be a blood bath

If you have access to a database with the stats on each item you can just assign a value to each stat and sort them by the total of that. no research needed.

Been trying for a while now to find my game to stream on twitch as I'm mediocre at everything. With WoW classic I'll finally have something to play that I can sink ample hours into and try to build My own community. It's something I was relatively good at and had tons of fun with so I'm excited to sink my time and twitch account in this
---
&gt; If you have access to a database with the stats on each item
---
ok, I'll bite. Where is this database?
---
Really the only time armour does anything is against warrior/rogue/hunter, so there's not  much point doing a dedicated build for it - beyond a weapon swap. You can make a specific set for duelling but that's pretty gimmicky. You don't want to have sacrificed anything for armour when the warlock/spriest/ele shamy/mage is attacking you.
---
Most paladins go for hammer of grace from what I've seen.

Well I'm concerned if a photo from an alt realm before the launch of classic is allowed on this subreddit. Funny though!

For months our parents were unplugging their own internet before heading to bed LOL

Oooh 3 day reset on 20mans.  I didnt know that.  Thanks for the info.
---
Blizzard calls it retail as well. They changed the  WoW folder structure, everything is in a folder called "retail" now.
---
&gt; Because there will be players out there that simply don't have time to farm consumes before raid or get every single world buff possible out there.
---
For consumables ok, it's understandable. But world buffs? You could make that part of the raid. Of the raid starts at 8PM, maybe it means you'll enter MC on 8:30PM, but the raid already started, wich means world buffs are now being gathered.

I run a swamp jaguar on my hunter rn, Twinkle basically does everything that heavily camped cats do except it took me 45 seconds to get her.

I cant take it much more I need a release date, Something to count down towards I'm going crazy with anticipation. I've watched several leveling videos, messed with talent calculators and read up on which ones to get first and when to respec. I check this sub when I wake up, while I'm at work and before I go to bed, I've bought several big name video games hoping looter shooters would slake my thirst, they cant hold my attention and are poor substitutes.

oof, we'll see : )

Please add some alternative options, at least one for each slot. Sometimes it's impossible or at least very difficult/time consuming to acquire the exact pieces listed.

Goblins would like to have a word with you
---
Na rogues aren't fury warriors my friend you still want hit after yellow cap.
---
What was your PvP experience as a somewhat undergeared warrior on pservers? 
---
I didn't think it was THAT bad in Vanilla, even though it was an alt (so my gear was especially shit as a new 60 in late Vanilla). I still have screenshots of me topping the BG charts with my Ice Barbed Spear :P  But I certainly got my ass kicked as well, and I recognize players have gotten much better since 2006.
---
i used to have a keyboard very similar, AND i had that exact same mouse!
---
Check the BiS list for all druid specs you want to do. Then, go on dungeons to farm said items.
---
Just make sure you have large bags.
---
I said "if" you have access. 
---
Someone's gotta have one somewhere... Maybe the guys who run db.vanillagaming would share.

it’s allowed...

Before level 10, all you have to do is stand completely still.

Questionable effectiveness.
---
&gt;"oh haven't got the spell yet, too expensive atm" 
---
I'm gonna try this at 60 and see what kind of lovely responses I get. I'll add a cherry on top and blame it on my "expensive" mount cost.
---
raiding as a warrior is expensive, getting prebis too. not the most casual friendly class.
---
&gt;comes to mind for this

No no no Boris, in Soviet Russia, ogre mind comes to *YOU*!
---
Loved this show so much. Good ol Canadian content.

Yes they will.

Only cause it's the one thing in the game that makes me salty. Grrrr
---
Yeah that’s my point. TUF on 10 hours/week would take over a month of nothing but AV. 
---
No such thing as a very busy 14 year old.
---
I did this once during cata, disenchanted my gear, dumped my gold in the guild bank, jumped off a cliff and died, logged out. Deleted my toon and swore I'd never play WoW ever again.               
---
              
---
3 months later I called Blizzard and said I must have been hacked, I dont know how all my shit wound up gone, I was near tears when they guy reversed everything... I'm so weak.
---
Haha, great idea! :)
---
You got me there.
---
That is one problem I see with this, BiS is great in theory, but when it show 3 or 4 items that cost 1k gold each that really doesn't work for most people. Unless gold will be easier to come by in classic than it was in real vanilla I don't see most people being able to complete these pre raid sets. Showing the next best dungeon alternative would be great.
---
Gadgetzan, probably. Mages can get anywhere else pretty quickly with portals.
---
Looking for a Semi-Hardcore raiding guild, Alliance PvP in NA. 
---
Will likely main Hunter, with rogue and druid as possibilities, all of which were leveled to 60 in vanilla. 
---
I played from release through Wrath when I was a kid and have taken years off. Back in vanilla I did some Ony and MC raiding but couldn't commit to a schedule because of school, so I'd say I'm an inexperienced raider but looking to learn more and have fun! I'd love to work through all vanilla content at a relaxed but steady pace, and I'm looking to do some theory crafting without going hardcore min/max. Now I'm out of school with a family and 9-5 job that sometimes has me traveling. If I'm not traveling, which is sporadic and somewhat unpredictable, I am usually available all nights except every other Thursday.  Outside of raiding, I'd love to work with guildies to get pre-bis, attunements, and have some fun wPvP. 
---
I'd highly prefer a loot system that doesn't penalize players for less than perfect attendance, since my schedule will keep me from attending 100% of raids. I can be patient with gearing up but I'm afraid that some loot systems really disadvantage casual players. 
---
Send me a PM here to connect - I'd love to start fresh with a guild and work together from the beginning!
---
this is a weird take.
---
Guilds need 40 people to show up and be able to play for a couple of hours for most raids. Honestly, the most valuable thing you can bring to a raid is consistency. Show up on time ready to play consistently and don't be brain dead and you'll have a spot in almost any guild.
---
Came here to comment this exact thing.
---
Your post made me think about why I enjoy watching streams and I think it’s because my best friend always had the gaming system and I would mostly watch him play the one player games.   Very similar situation to you and your brother.  Never really thought about it before, very interesting!
---
Do we know anything about the gear that's going to be available, or are we just assuming that there will be a like for like gear list from vanilla?
---
Its crazy to think, but GTA San Andreas released in 2004 too.  Both games hold a special place in my heart, I'm surprised to see so many San Andreas memes honestly.
---
Because at any given time &gt;40% of the opposing faction can just ignore your fear
---
Not very much, since swimming or taking the boat can take ages.
---
I ran through Stranglethorn and took the boat to Ratchet, jumped off and swam to the Echo Isles just to have a Durotar tiger on my level 10 Dwarf Hunter. You aren't gonna get another shot at the tiger skin to Stanglethorn-nam and the 1.3 attack speed is the best you can get besides The Rake.

Do you think a picture showing how each piece of gear looks at each phase would be possible? Just use a generic human even. Would be cool to see
---
Just higher time commitment - slow levelers, lots of expensive BoE gear, high loot competition, high repair costs, mediocre gold farmers. 
---
It's not the end of the world though, I'd still roll a warrior if that's what you want to play.
---
If you get ganked, and camped, that's a good time to start an alt.
---
ah thanks for the info, had no idea!
---
I do miss playing games but I'm really happy with my life! I hope that video games are something I can revisit once my son is a little older, and possibly becomes a hobby that we can enjoy together. In the meantime yes, we have some amazing Twitchers! So please, all of you content creators, keep it up! You're doing the Lord's work.
---
Be careful.  I get downvoted to hell and back for trying to call out the elitist attitude.
---
6 months later, "i have 49 characters and never made it past lvl 30"
---
relevant username says otherwise.
---
That's funny, because BM hunters were pretty much my bane for my warlock.  Not being able to fear the pet away really, really sucks.
---
wat? its not about the pvp set, who told you that? its not bc or wotlk, there is not resilence, gear is universal.
---
the most impactful thing is weapons. you need a big dick raid weapon. thats a necessary condition for a viable warrior gameplay. not a pvp set.
---
Cringe af. P server players are not the enemy, they created this need and want that has pushed Blizzard into creating classic. You should be thanking them not creating pre-conceived and generalized assumptions on their attitudes.
---
Other fun things: Water Walk someone jumping to water. Warlock summon off of a cliff. Unfortunately, this only affects allies. Still hilarious. Sometimes the Warlock summon is a lesson that needs to be taught to the late people.
---
I don't know about pservers, but my experience from vanilla, TBC, WOTKK, MoP, Cata, blah blah blah has always been a shortage of Tanks.
---
I rebooted Skyrim to do a “True Son of Skyrim” roleplay. Never done the stormcloak quest line but it totally scratches the itch for me.
---
It’s something that I have to do... I feel like pwning noobs.
---
ah ty for this. What would you recommend as a decent solo/ gold farmer that can also do pretty well in raids?
---
top 3 i'd say is a good target. then go forward with adding some filters. BoP vs BoE. if its craftable vs quest vs drop. etc
---
Can I ask a serious question? How are weekend raiding guilds preferable to weekday? I don’t have kids, but my weekends are for hanging out with my girlfriend. I’d prefer to raid Tues/Wed, like 6:00-9:00.
---
not enough items exist for a warlock to get hit capped until later raids release. sad but true
---
The r13 set is really good for warriors, but if you raid as fury you can get gear that's pretty close with only a tiny percentage of the time required.
---
Lol.  Well I like to think if I'm getting camped, the offending player(s) waste their time waiting for me to res, or come back.  All the while I've immediately logged off and I'm knee deep in the corpses of plainstriders in Mulgore.
---
No, I'm pretty sure he's just really proud of those over edited nades.
---
I will take great joy out of counter-ganking these undead rogues by stalking people from my own faction or the quest givers.
---
I always went at level 10 and got The Rake as well.  1.2 attack speed...I didn't care about that .2 compared to Brokentooth, plus getting him at level 10 meant he would be fully loyal by level 16 or so and I wouldn't have to worry about him much anymore (feeding wise).
---
I always named mine Razor Mane
---
&gt; Personally I cannot relate, I really don’t enjoy watching other people play games.
---
This times 1 million, I mean honestly it's a giant successful platform that rakes in more money than I'll ever see so i'm happy people have this but I cant for the life of me watch other people play. I fucking hate Youtube videos that talk about stuff I'm trying to hear about but are playing a game because I cant really focus on what theyre saying, I have to minimize it or I find myself yelling at the screen "Why the fuck would you grenade there!?"              
---
                 
---
I love playing too much, i'm not great by any means, I've never completely cleared Heroic raids or stepped foot into a Mythic raid ever. I could usually can clear up to +10-11 Mythic dungeons keys back in October when I still played but it's nothing to brag about so I've never once considered streaming my stupid ass playing but more than that I sure fuck have never considered watching someone else play when I could.
---
Did you read the comment you replied to? I am one of the pserver players. That doesn't mean I have to like everything about them. The laser-like focus on BiS lists of one of the things I don't like about them.
---
Haha same for me man. When I was in college one of my roommates was a Madden freak. And so I would watch him play through seasons for hours, and then he would always let me decide where to spend the development points (that was my favorite part, seeing the players improve). It's funny how stuff we did as kids kind of carries over to later in life.
---
&gt; Then another streamer comes along with a video about how Streamer A is bad because they're hogging all the resources and not giving anyone else a chance. And Street Brooklyn now has a comparable force.
---
This is classic bro. Unless they're on the same server, that's just gonna be a no-go.
---
how resi on players work is well documented
---
Why are Rogues more difficult to gear than Hunters and Warlocks?
---
People think there's gonna be like one person per month getting to R13. It's like they have it in their heads that getting high-ranked is just not something anyone goes for, like it might have been back in the day on their retail server. Reality is that every populated server will have numerous crews of hardcore rankers who rotate and maximize rank progress every week, pushing as many players through the ranks as the system has capacity for. After two months, several players per week will be getting a full set of basically T2.5 gear. It doesn't take very long before that becomes a constant presence in the PvP scene.
---
5 mans is always tanks. The good tanks get groups and gear so fast that they quickly get everything they need which leads to... even less tanks.
---
Caveat to this /u/Davichiz, your gear can be 98% effective if you use Dungeon loot over BoP world drops. Consumables, however, are still a drag, which is why I’m leveling an alt for fishing and herbalism (and gold farming).
---
If you would prio hit even after reaching yellow hitcap at 8% that would mean you never get any upgrades from raids unless it has hit on it. You even see for MC gear the list gets down from 14% hit to 11%. It's just made wrong.
---
Make a version for pvp as well if you can, but I guess people will have to help you with info.
---
Let me tell you man, as a warrior, it's really cringey to see a hunter roll on it... they get so little value from it. But it is bis for them at that point so /shrug
---
Lol where did you get the idea that the pvp set is good? Better than greens sure... but if you just find an average raiding guild and do 3 nights a week raiding you'll get better gear with literally 10% of the time played.
---
It's been done for warlock: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aKD1SXeQWfoZKHO7zZUnQk3iixzfYF_BqkzQ-V_Pj6U/edit?usp=sharing
---
More than half the "BiS" items you list arent BiS, stop purposefully spreading wrong information.
---
On my pserver, majority of Russians play undead
---
Definitely, do your 5/6 level on your own (3h of time max) and play together starting in the barrens. That’s the common zone for both of you.
---
Solid point. I thought of that shortly after posting it but wasn't at my PC to correct my comment.
---
The more I think about it, the more I'm convinced the only real solution to this is to either remove DHKs altogether on PvP servers (which has my vote) or simply make civilians unkillable *and* changing their AI so they simply don't interact with combat at all. Which is a really ugly and inelegant solution, but it's the best I can think of so long as DHKs remain a factor.
---
At most I’ve seen people say it was “pretty okay with an awful final raid boss.”
---
I pretty much despised the talent tree rework and will never like it. 
---
I did like a few of the zones. The underwater one specifically was really fun and unique. The underground one was cool. The others were bland and forgettable. Arathi something-another. 
---
MoP was bad and people who disagree should feel bad.  
---
WoD at least tonally felt like a Warcraft game, but all the mechanics introduced were really anti-fun. Legion continued a lot of the anti-fun mechanics and I’m not sure why legion gets a pass when WoD doesn’t. Better class design?
---
Well BFa shot that in the head.
---
Wow so original.
---
Usually cat for endgame pve and Pvp. Hopefully broken tooth since we know lupos won't do shadow damage
---
That is true. We dont actually know how the game will behave when players log off in Classic. There might be other methods to get out of an instance, there might not. Worst case you can die and corpserun back and still save a good hour.
---
Wow, this is exactly what I am looking for. I am in it for the long haul, just want to find a guild willing to commit to the long term goal with a slower pace. Please let me know what I need to do to get involved.
---
As alliance, I'd say Theramore is the superior option. You have teleports to all the major cities, and then Theramore is in a central location on Kalimdor.
---
tank
---
Wrong sub dude. *Laughs in stealthed troll*
---
Well when was it added to the game?
---
Totally agree about race. As a human sword rogue, I believe there's better OH options than maladath.
---
&gt; I know it's hard to imagine, but some people don't like ~~to PvP~~ getting ganked.
---
The only difference between a PvP server and a normal server, is one group can choose if they’re ganked.
---
thats a whole warrior
---
&gt; Rune of the Guard Captain
---
It is horde only anyways, so would still need to list a different trinket for alliance.
---
And then you read the comments on Thottbot / Allakhazam and see so many people talking about a 2% proc rate. Dunno, it might even be BETTER than recent private servers. I for one hope so!
---
"Big if true"...perhaps they were circling out and away in order to reset the duration timers? It just subjectively felt as though being sap-harassed was frustrating as hell, but perhaps I was simply impatient as a child. I was only 20 at the time, and I'm a lot less irritable now.
---
not so sure. it depends a lot on how weapon skill works, but reducing the glancing blow dmg reduction is a really nice dmg boost. also you get even more hit. from what I've heard, Weapon skill should be improving linearly from 301 to 315. but yeah it depends 100% on how weapon skill will work in classic
---
Meh priest and lock can always use spirit as the tie breaker
---
You use the quest shield from Crimson Courier for ele pvp, not the Mara shield.
---
I wouldn't get your hopes up :(.
---
DM me and we can get you on the list and start chatting.
---
You are all op and I hate you, even if I seem calm and friendly.
---
This comment brought to you by the only druid on your server.
---
Tank itemization isn't all about defense and whatever item gives you the highest defense.  You have a stage 4 "BiS" list with literally 0 hit on the tank set. You are going to cause ppl to opt for the trinket from Onyxia over the neck, which is a poor choice.
---
Then find a guild that raids then! Gl hf!!
---
The world is your battleground.
---
Would be cool to have a tab on the side that shows how much stats, hit, crit, spellpower, attackpower etc your character would have in each of the stages with the gear that's shown in that tab and even have the possibility to include all the world buffs, consumables and buffs as a checkbox. Not really a necessary feature but cool nonetheless.
---
This too is incomplete abd/or wrong
---
I remember a brief period where pugs on my server would actually ask if a rogue was "sap spec". They preferred a sub rogue that could sap to a combat rogue that had better dps. Back then it would still break stealth 10% of the time even with talents.
---
After a while people stopped asking. I guess the need for CC diminished as their gear or skill improved.
---
there won't be muxh PVP in phase 1 I'd assume.. I rolled on a pve server back in 2004 and we really didn't do much while leveling..
---
with no bgs in phase 2 it'll mostly be cities raids and defending cities. or just pinging certain cities like tm or ss and starting something up for impromptu but you won't be running down a road and find someone to fight.. some people do /PVP but really depends on the server and people if you will find any or not.
---
Not sure how stat weights are done, but pre-raid hpaladin seems to overvalue crit.  When you have really low +healing crit isn't much of a HPS increase.  
---
For example it lists inventor's focal sword at 1% crit over something like hammer of grace's +31healing.
---
Perhaps the talent that left Activision will actually make a good alternative to WoW. I think the anticipation for classic wow (a product that has not even been advertised) is positive proof that players know what they want, and it isn’t what Blizzard is offering in Retail. 
---
But unfortunately I think the environment that allowed Vanilla to be made can’t exist anymore. Namely due to micro transactions, P2W, pay to wait, and “make everything accessible” mentality we live in.
---
Tanks, always tanks.
---
Nahh...he's over camped and too long to respawn.  WAY easier to get The Rake and at level 10 too!  and 1.2 attack speed....I could care less about the .2 attack speed difference lmao.
---
Are you feeling horny baby?
---
Yeah.  Even if there wasn't one going on at that moment, it was pretty f'n easy to stir the pot into a frenzy.
---
IS THAT A JOJO'S REFERENCE?!?!
---
And what do you see to the left of the warrior?
---
No sir. That is definitely a Night Elf Druid.
---
Rounding up or down, I saw a survey of 11,000+ Redditors looking to do Classic, and 61% said they'd be doing damage, 26% said they'd be healing, and 13% said they'd be tanking. With a 5-man group being 60/20/20 damage/heal/tank, that leaves more heals than necessary and fewer tanks than necessary.
---
Legit the best items for PVP are not even epic weapons and stuff.  Its engineer grenades, and FAP potions.
---
Just a bit of extra info: this is only true for activated abilities (yellow hits). If there is an extra attack generated from a trinket, wind fury, weapon procs(thrash blade) or sword spec, those are all based on weapon speed.
---
Also also, IIRC the normalization of weapon types are: dagger 1.6, other 1h 2.6, 2h 3.8
---
That is why sinister strike and hemorrhage with daggers is garbage compared to swords, maces and fist weapons.
---
About 95% of a Shaman I'd say. Little bit got cut off there.
---
During classic i played on a pve server for a while, and i remember that there was allmost no world pvp before lvl 60. And even at 60, only very few people did turn pvp on and it was just people with good gear or small groups who would fight each other.
---
I decided to reroll on a pvp server shortly after i hit 60, because i wanted to experience real world pvp.
---
I got it on my 5th in 2005 :p I was damn lucky. Didn't realise how rare it was until like tbc.
---
This helps me decide on which class I wanna roll.
---
Feral Druid.
---
Prot Warrior.
---
Both cows.
---
I swear I read "i'm not one of those".. must have been a long day at work, I apologize!
---
And yes, I’m referring to the one on the left and not the warrior. This wasn’t even taken by me but by an old friend of mine. Keep those screenies safe folks.
---
Then no title for anyone. #NoChanges
---
No! You must die for your opinion INTERLOPER! 
---
\*SKREEEEEEEEE\*
---
\*\*\*Flies away back into the basement\*\*\*
---
I see Wind Serpents and Boars.
---
I too am a little brother and what little time I spent watching it be played I did use the Bradygames guide to dictate to my brothere where he'd find certain monsters and mobs. It was amazing. Soon after I began my own game and loved it. WoW was the first game that I didn't "just watch" and I'll be damned if I ever just watch it again. There's Elves to burn and Harbors to take.
---
I played on the same server as Athene in tbc. He had lvl 70 followers every step he took.
---
I don’t disagree I was just talking in direct reference to speed leveling. Like the guy is trying to claim grinding gold in the level 40s is more worth it than rushing to 60 and then specifically trying to grind gold. It’s not like he’d hit 60 and have more gold than the other guy who’s been 60 and is grinding gold at like 4x the rate he was. 
---
With gathering and trying to level as fast as possible I always found myself outleveling my professions and eventually being too low to skill up. I usually had to make a point to go search around a little to see if the gold dot pops up on my map.
---
I did the same with my first hunter, though she didn't last through all of Vanilla, let alone "several expansions." Hiked back to Shadowglen at level 10 to tame one of the young nightsabers there because I liked the idea of her pet going 1-60 just like her. He remained her constant companion up through ~lvl55.
---
I plan to do the same with one of my hunters in Classic, though it'll be more interesting making it to Shadowglen this time, on account of I'll be playing Horde. It'll make for a better story, anyway.
---
Seek out the Classic Priest Discord.
---
I am not going to roll a mage. Even if I do it would be be my 2nd alt behind my first alt.
---
I will play Ally, I will like set it to Gadgetzan. This allows me to Teleport to any of the "4 Corners" of the world. It gives great coverage to go anywhere int he world. The farthest place would be EPL, as I would have to fly from IF, which is centered in Eastern kingdoms. 
---
If I was horde. I would say Grom Gal or Stonard.
---
Thats good for what i want..i kinda like either organised raids for PVP in big cities, or BG PvP. Imo world pvp can get really frustrating at some point.
---
I guess thats good for me since i a cant spend more than 3 hours per day
---
no skill no no endgame. raids making gear and skill check. as Main Tank you need a lot of time no time no raid spot.
---
Because launch is an event for a lot of people. Kind of like a super bowl of classic wow.
---
That was what I was thinking when I wrote it. Lol
---
Been leveling a feral cow on a private server. So far I love tanking in bear form.
---
One group I got to DPS as a cat and that was a lot of fun. i actually had to give the warrior time to get aggro before spamming Claw otherwise I'd pull aggro off the tank.
---
Fun as heck.
---
Shadowpanther is back for classic, fyi.
---
Pserver =/= actual vanilla
---
Tank is hardest followed by heals 
---
Always been always will be
---
Are you on drugs, friendo?
---
I wont be first wave, but I will be leveling with a group of 4, so we'll at least put up a fight for any solo gankers.
---
 Mr.Wiggles&lt;3
---
Axe men? They did the first speed run if I remember right, they cleared MC in 90 mins.
---
&gt;	Yeah, I figured it would, but with the way companies are making games “Easier” for kids these days... As long as the game is challenging, the entire younger generation will fizzle out after dying to 1 or 2 mobs a few times.... Games these days you pull 20-50 mobs and there is virtually no risk of dying. It is so lame. I have not seen any official notes other then it will be as the game was in 1.12 but on the new engine. Cannot wait. I will have the most gamers I know in one location for the first time ever. Should be insane.
---
Are you replying to your own thread in a conversational way? Did you forget to change accounts?
---
Can't wait to farm Orbs like this.
---
Unfortunately there's no other (second) trinket that increases ranged physical DPS before phase 2. A lot of hunters are going to get yelled at for trying to fill out their BiS lists...
---
Zeppelin your way into Stranglethorn, run for your life until you get to BlackRock.
---
I went to one of their episode premieres in Toronto, good times
---
That was a genuine question. Why weekends and not weeknights?
---
yeah.. only time I ever really wanted wpvp back then was someone was being stupid and griefing in other ways like tagging mobs and trailing them to you or other stupid and you just wanted to duke it out to get them out of the area.
---
otherwise yeah it's pretty chill.
---
That would be insane :D
---
Rolling a human warrior, just in case...
---
All horde raiders just set their hs to Kargath now.
---
my dudes.
---
if that's how you think of it, then you're looking at it a little wrong - you don't prio hit after the cap, but you do still consider it as a strong stat. swapping for mask for eye is gonna give you a net of -2hit, +1crit, +13AP. that isn't really clearly better in any way.
---
i even put the info in a spreadsheet just to eyeball it and with that set of prebis it weights your stats as 1hit = .725 crit or 19.159 AP. That clearly shows that you are right in thinking crit is more important in a vacuum, but that this particular case shows the mask is still better since the strength on the eye isn't enough to make up for the difference between 2hit and 1 crit.
---
I'd start Barrens together as soon as possible, even level 8 or 9.
---
"They come in twos? I'm getting one." "You have a whole half already!"
---
I'm not subbed right now but I'd like to join you guys so I can log in with any level &lt;20 character to afk in orgrimmar
---
aka my Bis is more important than your Bis.
---
Haha sadly I did not think of it, but if my level 29 hunter twink makes an appearance with his armored boar that will be his name.
---
Yeah I'm in for this, any way you can go Horde PvP 😏😏
---
The reason I was interested in feedback from pserver people is because memories of vanilla are over a decade old. The community has changed a lot. I remember tanking being almost an esoteric pursuit. These days there are a lot more resources available, and with the game having been out for so long almost everybody has at least tried tanking at some point. I was curious if that has carried over into private servers.
---
You can see whatever you like - although they did nuke all the site content a while back so it only has the past year or two and not the early servers anymore but it should have all the fresh raids from North - D*le. If you are willing to wait for load times you can see whatever youd like and compare accordingly.
---
Except it is. It's either that or Shard of Afrasa (5 mp5) until the DM class trinket.
---
On the RP server I played on there were a lot of guilds who would permaflag, both PvP dedicated and just simply wanting to look for fights. Some of them would then one day do a ceremony where they would finally "Retire these old bones from the battlefield" and de-flag and just use them as an alt for herbing. It was a pretty regular thing for some guilds to make it part of their ethos to permaflag - and have the opposite factions guilds following suit in solidarity. There would be a post on the forums made to challenge the other faction and it would stoke things pretty well
---
Its cute you don't think someone is going to make a GS addon for classic.
---
I think it was there from the start, just that it was useless in the beginning (+16 spirit, +7 agility: [http://web.archive.org/web/20050217230403/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=13178](http://web.archive.org/web/20050217230403/http://wow.allakhazam.com/item.html?witem=13178)).
---
It was changed in 1.10.
---
although it is nothing like classic, I still thought 60, 70 and 80 twink guilds were way more fun than legion and bfa's endgame
---
[This video](https://youtu.be/u_azvBdVgz0) does a pretty good job explaining it. The “meta” is fury/prot tanks now since they create considerably more threat allowing your dps to go harder shortening the duration of the fight making it even easier on your healers even if the tank takes a bit more damage. He even toggles between using a shield and dual wielding during boss fights.
---
I feel special. Human lock was my very first character and I definitely remember hitting that brick wall. No idea how I got over it, though. I was probably so much of a scrub that I didn't even notice anything was different, just kinda spammed sbolt or immolate or something.
---
Are you doing a lore questing guide?
---
And its perfectly ok for them to disagree...
---
The art department is the only thing retail has going for it.
---
Warrior is super inaccurate as usual and doesn't take into account race / faction as usual.
---
There is always the Defias Storyline, which goes through all Human zones I believe. Spans multiple zones and "ends" in the Deadmines, but there is more after that as it all connects to Onyxia eventually. So do that if you haven't yet.
---
Obviously this requires starting in either Elwynn or Westfall.
---
If you click preraid 2 its there. Since thats when when DM is actually available so that the cape can be crafted.
---
There is a cost to skinning. It will slow you down; even if you're assuming the perfect leather is always falling at your feet and it doesn't affect your bag space. Getting to 60 sooner and grinding will be more efficient. Here is some additional discussion on the topic.
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on\_skinning\_for\_gold\_while\_leveling/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/a1vrt6/on_skinning_for_gold_while_leveling/)
---
Larry David: *Why don't you give him the gold?*
---
Damn, this is seriously impressive.
---
Where should one set their hearthstone while leveling?
---
Orgrimmar -&gt; Zeppelin to Grom'gol -&gt; Flight path to Kargath  
---
It's absolutely more inconvenient than just flying from SW or IF, but it is what it is. We get to just fly from Org to Dustwallow and later on Feralas and Silithus, so it all evens out in the end.
---
Also one of those pserver players, and I agree with you.   You have people that go on and on and on about how MC can be done in lvling greens with lvl 58s in the group, etc, etc.  Then you have the same people refusing to take anyone in less full pre-raid BIS to MC.

NA Horde Hunter seeking Weekend Raiding Guild; server type irrelevant
---
I am a long-time (12 years) WoW player with retail raiding experience with LK (11/12 HC ICC 25 + Glory ICC 25) and early Cata, and private server raiding experience in most of BC, all of LK (again) and all of N Cata. My only vanilla experience thus far has been leveling a warlock to 55 on my first private server so all endgame will be new to me and I am very eager to learn. I fully intend to play Hunter and have Hunter experience from the LK private server. I also have experience as a guild officer from the LK and Cata servers where I also served on my guild's loot council. 
---
Unfortunately my work schedule allows me to only really commit to weekend play which I know is uncommon but not unheard of. The times on the weekends do not matter as I can attend at any hour. 
---
I would love to find a guild that's in it for the long run and is committed to eventually clearing all content within a semi-hardcore environment, and where efficiency and skill are valued alongside having a good time. 
---
If you think I may be a good fit for your guild, feel free to send me a PM or reply with your contact details. Thank you!
---

Ew that seems so annoying
---
yuck!!
---
The Warrior can just Battle Shout while standing with his group as the Rogue completes his Sap and all the un-CCd mobs will automatically run for him (as long as the healer isn't using HoTs).
---
That's how I did all LoS pulls and got aggro without touching the mobs on my Warrior, anyways.
---
I'm sure a good old Crossroads raid isn't entirely off the books. I remember those being popular for some reason (I was on a PvE server), no idea what patch it was on, though.
---
You and me both. Retired my PVE priest and made a PVP warrior.
---
yeah I remember cross roads too.. really any major hub was up for grabs for both factions
---
Engy/mining, its just awesome to rezz the healer after a wipe. Plus the repair bot or bombs or opening doors without keys ;)
---
Given some blues overpower some epics, I hope the community rejects it.
---
Fucking pathetic, nothing like having an army of sycophants around you AND you have to play on pve server so nobody can touch you lmao
---
Imagine being one of those sad sacks of shit that actually wants to be a streamer's bitch
---
Nah we’re going to go PvE server
---
this guy knows whats up
---
Because that’s when me and my friends, the core of the guild, can raid.
---
They don't help those on dead servers on retail now, doubt they will help dead classic servers if they are a thing.

I just want to piss around in dungeon blues and kill people in the world. Maybe join the odd raid and get the odd epic if I find a good guild. I want to make many friends while levelling and be known as a useful player, despite gear or class. I’d like to eventually have an epic mount, something I wasn’t able to do in vanilla. When AV and then AB arrives i’ll probably farm them cos I freaking love those BGs. I will get good at whatever class I pick. 
---
What does this sound like to you?
---
Sorry bro, rules are rules :(
---
Someone made a TBC one and it ended up dominating pservers so I wouldn't hold your breath
---
Where did you like mining thorium? Happy cake day btw!
---
I’ll be getting one made for myself, for sure!
---
That’s just how it be c;
---
this fucking sub makes me laugh with the stupidest posts.
---
Not a mage  main. But also having so many attack spells and using them its a great fucking feeling. i used to just spam everything when i rolled an alt back in vanilla. Was kinda noob but i remember lvling with a mage was very enjoyable
---
Not inconvenient at all. There will pretty much always be some mages waiting in Kargath to make portals for a tip. Set your hs to Kargath, easy. Otherwise, zep to GG, fly to Kargath.
---
Well im going Enhancement shaman
---
The amount of screenshots I didn't take is amazing! :(
---
Word.  [https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL](https://imgur.com/gallery/P1peL)
---
Thing is pservers could be 10k+ people at a time wich messes everything 
---
A more blizzlike would top that at 2.5-3.5k
---
Fewer!
---
My tin foil hat theory is that if they plan to release on 16th of July, as some speculate, then they'll give us launch date next Tuesday, as it's also on 16th and exactly 3 months before.
---
fooking Knights in steel plate.
---
Is the hunter pre bis good? Are there any alternatives or more reasonable options ( heard that dal rend is very hard to get)
---
It's not really an opinion when I'm basing it on facts. It literally has been done before several times on private servers. Also in vanilla the record time for 1-60 was 4days 20 hours by Joana, so saying nobody did it under 7 days when vanilla was out is completely wrong. Rag will be dead by the end of the 2nd week
---
Ever met an SP?
---
Just dropped my valor helm, how could I roll a six...?
---
I loved these, thank you.
---
"The first time I faught two mobs and didn't die" rofl
---
I'm sure Dwarf Priests will be taking their place.
---
So holy paladins get their BIS helmet, even during Naxx, during stage 3. Nice.
---
Looking at BiS naxx gear for holy paladins is juicy as fuck.
---
It has a lot of iconic moments that lead to some really funny memes spawning lol
---
I can’t say if you’re serious with this? Comparing a scientific computing environment like matlab with a Druid while excel corresponds to warrior made me cough up my Dr Pepper. I’d say, if matlab is the tank warrior, excel is a rogue tanking with evasion.
---
With sharding being very likely but unconfirmed, all we can do is speculate. Presuming sharding is true, start testing your leveling routes now (barrens.chat is a great website and has a 15 page post dedicated to speed leveling and personal runs) and know that leveling solo 1-10 is going to be fastest aside from the few quests with kill X / loot Y's Z.
---
You both will naturally meet in xroads, with perfect runs, around the 2 hr mark.
---
Fury warrior is missing +weapon skill gloves also should go 2h per bwl.
---
Eastern plaguelands if you know the route that the chinese farmers used it was better than most other zones and at least on my server not many people there.
---
Mages are great as solo gold farmer and are also great in raids especially in AQ/Naxx.
---
Rogues are worse at solo farming (still decent) but really really good throughout all raid content.
---
Hunter Bis:
---
* Pre-raid Stage 1: 7% hit instead of 9%. Either go for 6%+3% from talents with a 2/31/18 build and replace the wrists with T0 hunter/rogue bracers or go for 9% from gear with Truestrike.
---
* Pre-raid Stage 2: 8% hit instead of 9%. Replace the UBRS ring with another DM hit ring.
---
Then for all the raid stages, it is absolute theoretical BiS, which is realistically never going to be obtained before the next stage, with the exception of Naxxramas if it is farmed for long enough, but I guess that's the issue of BiS lists in general rather than an issue with this one.
---
Some more issues:
---
* Stage 4, the AV ring/QSR should be replaced by the ZG set rings.
---
* Stage 5, the AV ring should be replaced by the Brood rep ring.
---
The point is not to fix the realms, the point is to get the players on those realms to ones with a healthy population.
---
I've said this in other comments, but there are ways to do it. I do not condone it in any way shape or form, but it's doable. You would take a characters perfect rotation with optimal talents/gear/racials for each patch. You would then apply the stats of their bis gear to that rotation, and get an output number. Then you can use the relation between that number and the output from a character with no talents/gear/racials. Then you would translate the dps output differences into a digestible "score". You would then create separate "scores" based off fight length in order to calculate resource regen. I'm not saying it would be perfect, but you could get pretty damn close, especially if you invested some serious though into the math behind it, and not just a few minute thought experiment. I'm not saying it's easy, but if I was seriously devoted to it I could come up with something far more accurate than people think.
---
Yeah, I’ve seen the discussion. I can’t speak to a pure min-max speed leveling approach, but I can speak from what I know about my leveling experiences, which are never optimized and calibrated by actions per second. Skinning is a net gain in terms of gold pre-40 for most WoW players.
---
I’d also add, as a priest, gathering is your prime-money maker pre-DM. The race to 60 is so you can herb and AH them. And that’s not even all that relevant since what we are really talking about is the pre-40 grind for a mount, which undeniable speeds up 40-60. So when you’re grinding mobs for gold between 35-40, you are better off skinning them for additional profit.
---
This was not my experience on a retail Vanilla PvE server. We had numerous raids on Xroads and SS vs TM fights once the PVP honor system came out.
---
Extremely easy. You can buy green mail items with the "of Nature's Wrath" affix for like 2-5 gold apiece. Add a Briarwood Reed (UBRS), Eye of Orgrimmar (quest reward), Hand of Edward the Odd (BoE epic), Deep Woodlands Cloak (quest reward), and Scarlet Protector (quest reward) in your other slots. Wildthorn Mail (crafted) is also an option if you can't find a chestpiece with "Nature's Wrath". 
---
Once DM comes out, you can also pick up a Barbed Thorn Necklace (+17 nature damage) and the Shaman class trinket (+23 spell damage). Comes out to \~300-350 spell damage depending on whether or not you can afford to enchant your weapon.
---
You can also wear blue dungeon items with stats instead of spellpower. Or just wear healing gear. You will play more like a support/off-heal machine with this setup instead of a walking nuclear missile, but it's still effective.
---
Could we get an option for PvP aswell?
---
My favorite would also be using my frostwolf trinket to go back to defend Drek in AV.... get in and either fear or MC alliance who were trying to prep and wait for towers to finish capping. Just make their characters go against their will and aggro the captains and boss
---
I remember doing an Uldaman run with friends so my buddy could tame one of those cool red and black scorpions. He even had a rad name picked out, "Scorpinox." 
---
So we do the run with only a couple of wipes on trash and he manages to tame one while we are fighting the others in the pack. He's so excited that he names it right away and joins the fight. 
---
We survive and as we are healing up we just hear the hunter exclaim "Well F**K" on Ventrillo.  Just as we go to ask what's wrong we look at his new pet, "Scropinox." He was so excited he typo'd the name. 
---
I now always keep one of these as a pet with the same name.
---
This comment made me go from warrior to rogue or hunter :P
---
It can however be pretty lucrative being an overgeared tank doing 5 mans. You can sell your services for gold or first righteous orb drop in a strat run.
---
Actually I said nothing even close to that lol you obviously don't want to prio hit over everything and anything you still need to weigh the stats.
---
Your shaman is safe with me, Yenko &lt;3
---
Because the boys will be the ones with enough playtime to wipe the men
---
I will be perfectly happy wearing T2 and looking TOTALLY SICK until T2.5.
---
&gt; you could get pretty damn close, especially if you invested some serious though into the math behind it
---
Yeah god damn, what you're talking about also requires full knowledge of every class and spec as well as every item in the game for that stage, for their BiS list, and next best in slot, and next after that etc. It would take a lot of time I imagine.
---
I used to spec Imp Sap for a while before I started raiding. I bound Sap to a macro that would add "/p Imp Sap breaks stealth 10% of the time - DO NOT ENGAGE. LET ME DIE AND/OR VANISH" because if stealth broke and the pull was bad we'd wipe way too often (because it was 2005 and we all sucked at WoW). Rather just die and be rezzed.
---
I can smell a 10 minute vid
---
I'm very interested!
---
A) Some guys here are loners irl and use wow to socialize instead (not judging, same meself sometimes), so our weekends are not that occupied
---
B) Late raid nights, no sleep, getting up for 8-5 work, etc.. Again, weekends are better for raids in that case
---
Stinky’s coming back with Classic, rejoice!
---
I had a folder of hundreds of vanilla and BC screenshots that survived three different computers until the laptop I had them on died without warning. It still hurts even looking at other people's screenshots from that time. 
---
Quite a few of them are permanently engraved in my memory, it's a shame I can't plug something into my head to extract them out.
---
Well this sounds interesting!
---
Ya that is true, but it still doesn't mean this should not be here.
---
There was a mob in BWL that could be mind controlled to teach a profession skill
---
Exactly my point. We are talking some seriously in depth algorithms. It would require some serious grunt work to do, but it's possible. Plus the calculations we need to be run on each individual client side as talent points of other characters are inaccessible. You would then need to create a way to make it impossible to manipulate on the user end. A lot of work and not really worth it, lol.
---
Lmao, same.
---
I don't think the ganking will be that bad though people just want to level, there is no reward for killing the opposite faction in phase 1. Sure some people will kill others because it's fun but it wont be groups patrolling around corpse camping single players over and over
---
Not so much of a challenge from Ironforge :) I had forgotten about that whole Defias thread. Thanks!
---
You wanna go full scum on your lock. Go into the cave in AV. by the bg portal. Offer people summons to Vander or Storm Pike. Then summon them to the bg portal and hit them with a snow ball from the Christmas event. It push them through the portal kicking them from the bg.
---
I'm just glad stats are gonna affect PvP again :)
---
... Which is BiS.
---
I run one on my hunter on a certain sever that shall not be named by rides with Porthmale.
---
1.2 attack speed is fine, grabbed it as soon as I hit what, 38?
---
The OP specifically states hitting 60 "early", and if you think good Rogues aren't capable of being ahead of the curve then you're just ignorant and will be in for a surprise.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGWiTvYZR_w
---
No Ret? Cmon Bruh.
---
During original vanilla the quest was avaible yet untill later patches. And that was true for most of the Hinterland quests. So HoJ is BiS pre raid for hunters untill that quest becomes aviable.
---
/moo
---
Dude Pure Pwnage was my childhood, that show was the shit.
---
sometimes you just wanna log on and farm some mats or bang out a few quests in an hour or two
---
not spend 20 mins corpse running and another 10-15 mins organizing some help to just get these ?? undead rogues to leave you the fuck alone
---
 he doesn't mean set of gear, he means where you make your hearthstone take you, or where you "set" your inn to go to.
---
Well this is interesting.
---
dude.. I watched a few seasons of the guild too, nostalgia overload.
---
I feel the same damn way, man.
---
Druid
---
Check out the funny rogue spec I played around with today, kinda fits your rogue's description:
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEyQ88xATD8DxE](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/AQwEyQ88xATD8DxE) 
---
I made it with WPvP and 5 men dungeons in mind.
---
I played in a very competitive guild for the last few years on a private server. We had 2 port warriors, a bear Druid and a port paladin. We had naxx on farm for about 9 months before we stopped playing. Prot is viable with extremely good gear. I’d recommend farming the lightning helm from gnomergan and taking engineering.
---
Tanks&gt;Heals&gt;DPS
---
You want instant invite to all groups? Play a Prot warrior.
---
You have either had no paladin tank who knew how to do it or you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
Black ashenvale bear? What bear bro?
---
I played up to WoD and pets didn't jump. I'm back now but haven't played a hunter, will do and see what happens.
---
&gt; if its left I can guarentee at least once I'ma forget to dismiss the little chucklefuck and wipe an instance
---
Mistakes happen, it's when they become a habit that's something may be not too right :)
---
I’ve been on private servers for a while and a popular guide to follow is Legacy’s. A simple google search will find it for ya.
---
Is the guide solid in saying where to go and when to do it? Absolutely.
---
The issues however were too much for me. 
---
1) it claims to be a Vanilla guide when it isn’t. Sure the quests you’re doing are from Vanilla but he’s running on a 30m Hearth CD and some of the quests have the wrong names due to updates after Vanilla.
---
2) he confuses his coordinates and directions quite often
---
3) its attuned to leveling a hunter
---
4) He tells you to do several quests in random zones without bothering to tell you you gotta pick up the starting part from a capital city.
---
So, I’ve been leveling two mages. One followed his guide exactly and the other followed my notes and corrections. At level 25, my second mage was 5 hours ahead. I since stopped doing both mages because it was starting to hurt my head but I’ve continued to spot the errors and fix them accordingly. 
---
I hope to finish, polish and publish this new and improved guide before Classic comes out and save people the profanity the Legacy guide causes me to expel. It will, as I said up top, be called Fenn’s Alliance Leveling Guide. 
---
&gt; ll doesn't mean this should not be here.
---
In your opinion it should. In their opinion it shouldn't.
---
shadow priest in the group helps a whole lot but most paladin tanks will be chugging mana pots like its gatorade
---
Kargath is the answer once 60.
---
AHHHHHHHHH
---
Orc racials are better.
---
Ah what noobs we were. Fire resist gear for Onyxia...pfff
---
Sacred protector is so legit.
---
Used that for half of vanilla.
---
I'm glad hunter is near the bottom so that I don't have to compete with others for gear...
---
Doing the lords work bud.
---
Common line at the end of a successful dungeon run:
---
"Good group. I added you guys."
---
I'm still glad they actually started communicating, no need to get greedy. We're lucky that Blizzard haven't fired classic CMs, i wasn't expecting this much generosity from Blizzard.
---
I played less than that man. Took me a few months. And yeah if you got school and 2 sports every day how would you not consider that a busy 14 year old? lol
---
That would make sense!
---
It’s onky a 2 DPS upgrade over your blue main hand. It’s a huge threat upgrade for a rage capped tank. It’s good for a Rogue, it’s amazing for a Prot Warrior.
---
For the Horde!... Maybe
---
It makes sense because in retail you can have a max level character for $50 or something. A max level character in classic is a harder choice because it's purchased with a resource that many people find worth more than cash: their time.
---
Please note that the Barrens were available in the original World of Warcraft, and Durotar could be visible in the background from distance.
---
If your main goal is minmaxing the launch experience, find some friends to spread the professions across instead of an alt. Being an officer in a raiding guild, this seems much more optimal in the short and long term.
---
For enchanting in particular, if you aren't the guild designated enchanter its not worth it.
---
Engineering is non-negotiable if you PvP, if you are pure PvE you could argue either way whether the fringe benefits exceed the more cumbersome gold making.
---
what is hearth set?
---
I’ve had two sixty warlocks (humans) both retail vanilla and a certain private server.
---
They’re immune to fear but not voidwalker taunt.
---
Send pet, coa, corruption, wand, repeat. What’s hard?
---
I love the concept of your website. However, it's missing oomkin data, so contact me via PM if you need the spreadsheets.
---
Can't play Shaman on Alliance so I have no choice. Druid it is.
---
You're absolutely right about it carrying over. I have never found a woefully incompetent tank throughout my entire pserver experience, and whenever a tank has had trouble the group members have always been knowledgeable enough to give some advice on how to improve. They probably aren't all ready to MT in a guild or something, but it seems like most players at least know the main ideas.
---
I love playing alliance but this comment is making me reconsider now that I know you'll be on my faction...
---
Long fights it’s a problem and they will lose threat - also they get crushed and don’t have a high hp armor set like druids. It’s just a waste.
---
&gt; If the pally tank is holding threat better than your warriors on trash mobs, you need to find better warriors.
---
This is wrong. Completely and totally.
---
That laptop hard drive could have been plugged into another computer.
---
I think it will be easier to get gold because we've got a decade and a half of knowledge of how to farm gold, how to use the AH, and how to gear up correctly.
---
also ret and tankadin
---
As Alliance I think i’ll put it in the chapel in Eastern Plaguelands. I’ll have Engineering trinket for the Gadgetzan teleport and in this way i can reach fast north zones of Eastern Kingdoms.
---
For Horde Kargath ofc.
---
Real pros had their hearth in UC (if they werent mages), they could just fly south. (just as easy to get to Kalimdor as EK is from Org, TB is irrelevant and doing laps in UC is 5000 IQ play)
---
If stuck in Org, ideally you catch the Grom Gol Zep and fly north, but really if its raid time--take the first available. If your raid calls agro in Searing Gorge, you relog--so the flight spits you out in Burning Steppes and run in that way (as there is rarely PVP on the southside). 
---
Late in a server, you could fly to Thorium Point, but often there'd still be a camper here.
---
Sorry Stannis. :(
---
[My only picture of my R13 NE female hunter "SugaBee" ...yes, Iam a Dude..](https://www.bilder-upload.eu/bild-15ba9b-1554931082.jpg.html)
---
Yes! We had 2... they were HELLA emo all the time....
---
So does everyone else so inflation may be a thing
---
I love how warlocks are sandwiched between rogues. I've always felt that rogues were both easy to manage and impossible to fend off. Totally depends on who is behind the keyboard.
---
Homie are you telling me july 16th is only 3 months away
---
holy fuck
---
This is great and all but aren't these guides more for pservers? We still have no clue about itemization in classic.
---
Someone else mentioned it too, but since kargath is the default, there will probably always be a mage there selling ports. You can be anywhere and always have a quick way to get to any capital.
---
Tanking is no longer a mystery, it's not especially difficult or hard to understand. People just 1. like dps meters, 2. don't play games to have responsibility. As a tank you have to lead the group, know where to go, decide what to pull, how to do the bosses etc. It's just not 'fun' for a lot of people. They just want to see big crits and kill things.
---
Mage or Druid
---
Setting your hearth to Kargath is a real private server thing.
---
There will not be a server wide world chat.
---
You will have to camp in cities to form pug groups. You can’t be out in the world farming profession mats/pvping and monitoring world chat. It’s one or the other.
---
Expect a lot of downtime in Orgrimmar or ironforge because the /1 and /2 will be most active for those particular zones. 
---
Mages might set their personal hearth to kargath but I don’t recall anyone other than raiding core setting hearths to kargath and we only did that raid night.
---
My hearth moved around a lot depending on what I was doing.
---
It was a question of distinction, not of which is better. And your point is invalid because there's never any bottleneck at all, except on private servers with massive server pop caps. Leveling through the barrens can be one of the most impactful and memorable experiences in game, the same way STV is later on. You start to recognize other players here more than almost anywhere else in game. You could be grouped with the same people for hours, and then you know them forever. The alliance doesn't have that experience anywhere.
---
They always end up a few levels higher than the (the harvest watchers at least) when I'm doing those quests.  Back on retail I don't remember having a wand at that level and VW taunt was resisted often.  They'd always aggro me and of course they're immune to drain life.
---
I made it past back in the day but I know others who gave up.  When suddenly your pet can't tank and you're too squishy to tank its understandable that people think "maybe this class isn't worth it".  It's early enough in the experience that people aren't super attached and can re-roll.
---
always tanks. Tanks never have competition for any of their gear, so they gear out quickly. Also their shit costs more to repair. So if geared and farming dungeons for gold, wiping really clears out their profit. 
---
Further, a given raid team only needs 2-4 fulltime main spec tanks. A given raid team is typically 50 (+/- 10) people. That means relative to every other role a team needs less tanks (In a 5 man team the tank is 20% of the squad, in a raid the tanks are 5-10% (I think 4 horsemen requires 8 tanks so that one is 20%) of the team).
---
Correct. There is no timeline, I think they want to see how "fast" people consume it all.
---
People who never played classic are going to be in for a real shock how relatively slow the progression is.
---
And I am really looking forward to it to be honest.
---
Well the deeper meaning is there is gear in DM which kind of would trivialize the first MC push, but as previous commenter said, historically DM did come out after MC.
---
Large groups of melee mobs are not that big of an issue in raids and if they are warriors or druids are completely viable to handle the aggro - paladin tank is a memeadin which is fine but you won’t be a min max and it will probably be harder to get into raids
---
You go to the flightmaster and fly to Burning Steppes cave or Searing George. Have a piss, grab a beer or Coke, and maybe make a sandwich.
---
RIP my BE pally.
---
Everybody excited for P2 PvP will be in for a rude awakening when they discover the joys of being farmed for honor.
---
I'm a bit torn to be honest, I loved structured PVP, but I also lost days doing SS vs TM. Seriously doing 20+ hours of SS vs TM, wake up 4 hours later, the battle is STILL going on, friend pinging me on MSN messenger with the rallying cry for help.
---
Good times.
---
With that said, I loved running WSG premades. I played a druid and I was known as "THAT FURRY BASTARD WHO WON'T DIE".
---
Gank you and then get aomewhere safe. Stay mobile so the 60 mains can't find you. Kind of like don't gank where you eat.
---
My suggestion is just to get them when they're available, my friend. Not everyone deserves a trophy.
---
Won’t be able to unless they give us a new way in :/ The new client has anti wall hack.
---
I remember going in here every couple weeks/months to explore and see if I missed anything
---
It's for extinguishing these runes in MC, which allows for the killing Majordomo, and following that, challenge Ragnaros himself.
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Aqual_Quintessence
---
I'll put my hat in for joining you if you go Horde on a PvP server. Would like a casual raiding guild, and the guild name is hilarious. I'm planning on Orc Warrior and plan on leveling with a friend who will be an UD shadow priest.
---
Looks interesting, but something on your site is causing it to be flagged as malware and it's being blocked by my web filter.
---
TL;DR: the juice is not worth the squeeze!
---
Druids are fun to level and great battle healers.
---
90% of your time will be running away from players, 9% you will be killed trying to disengage and 1% you'll be able to 1v1 through protracted survivability while slowly wearing on the opponent. 
---
Survivability is their forte but have hardly any decent offense outside of rare gear or gimmick items. 
---
It's a long hard road, one I do not wish to revisit, this time round I will enjoy a pure class and excel at that rather than excel at a hybrid and be average compared to others.
---
Things that will trigger you as a druid:
---
Wild animals can block.
---
You have no ooc res.
---
You can never use proc enchants.
---
You can't potion while in form.
---
Wolfs head helm - A 40(?) Level helm is feral BiS
---
Manual crowd pummeller - 30(?) Level weapon which requires farming is feral BIS.
---
Bag space reserved for alt specs.
---
As a NE, tauren druid warstomp.
---
Things you will enjoy as a druid:
---
Fast leveling as feral.
---
Great profession gatherers.
---
Survivability and being a pest.
---
Healing a 5 man with no deaths.
---
No competition and prio on leather heal gear.
---
Various animal forms and dances.
---
There were some relics added in (I don't have a list I am sorry), and tier 0.5 quests as far as I remember: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dungeon_Set_2
---
I have enough trouble trying to explain why the Dal'Rend set is worth it for Hunters, I'm just going to use that green trinket with 20 AP and 1% hit you get from the Hinterlands.
---
Gold becoming easier to get will not make BoE's more attractive since BoE's will rise in price due to buyers being willing to spend more gold on them.
---
Less dependent 
---
Hunter Druid locks rogues and to a lesser extend mages 
---
The others are dependent 
---
Warrior is THE most gear dependent class
---
Just walk over to Mulgore at Level 1.
---
I get what you're saying. Rolled a new class in Valley of Trials last night with my buddy and I am just completely done with that place. Deathknell is much easier and Mulgore is just much more welcoming despite it's size. This works even better if your class trainer is there.
---
Have fun leveling and crafting multiple sets of gear to fill the most boring role in the game so you can spend countless hours raiding to get enough dkp to roll on offspec dps gear

I suggest you to play other faction and other class, so not to spoil things for yourself, also you won't be as attached to that character. I did that, I wanted to play Alliance Warrior or Paladin, but I played Horde Shaman and it was very nice. I don't really care about him, but I like to have some preliminary classic taste.
---
100% positive on this, but my retail Vanilla guild set our hearths to Kargath when MC and BWL were our main raids. For AQ, we mainly swapped to Silithus, and then to Org or UC (can't write remember) for Naxx. It was a low to medium pop server so we didn't always have a Mage sitting in Kargath, unfortunately.
---
Guild Mages just laughed at us.
---
But that's something you can use to your advantage if you have more knowledge than your guildmates, in a DKP guild.
---
Either Zeppelin to STV and then fly, takes about 8-10 minutes. Or set your HS to Kargarth and walk, takes 2 minutes. Downside is that you can never HS back to Orgrimmar when you’re out in the world and you always have to find a Mage to port you. 
---
Alliance have it a lot easier. From IF to Blackrock is a 45 second flight. And from SW it’s 2 minutes. It’s a lot more convenient.
---
Few of the rewards are pretty good to be honest:

---
(DISCLAIMER: This is a private server, stats may be off from the actual live game, but it gives you a decent idea)
---
Sigh.. fs, classic isn’t going to feel anywhere near vanilla if we don’t have the small memorable glitches, the biggest one being moonwalking was so iconic.. I feel like a lot of charm is going to be lost with the way they are mishandling this project
---
I'm honestly in the same boat. It feel like waiting for Christmas but Santa hasn't said what day hea actually coming yet lol
---
In world pvp, maybe. But in organized pvp where people expect you, no.
---
Unknown at this time. We will see in the next 2+ years when we actually get there.
---
July 16.
---
3 months and 5 days.
---
What's with all the memes lately, this sub is turning into /r/wow
---
Why not just wait until the fight is over and not just assume that no one else but you wants the vein?
---
Unfortunately I lost all my pre-WotLK screenshots. I tried to recover them from a few forums I posted on long ago, but unfortunately they were long gone.
---
yeah but i finding a group for that quest can be hard.
---
At one point did you decide to buy gold?
---
Wow, so 3:0 speaking up for the Horde, so far. I'll let my home crew know where the heat is.
---
Yeah I was mostly being snarky. Someone posted asking what the best class for PVP was, one guy was saying Druid, I said nah, Druids are bad in vanilla PVP, get downvoted with many angry nerds telling me that Druids beat everyone 1v1, and win all the BG's because Bear form... or something.
---
(Not sure why you got downvoted), to throw a dart at a dartboard, I would think the higher end might be the more realistic answer.
---
Since probably a huge amount of people, are going to be brand new to classic (never seen it or played it) and will be experiencing it for the first time might want to prolong the lifespan of it.
---
But again speculation. Phase 1-2 might be shorter, as phase 2 has a TON of things to it (such as BG's which will be a huge pull for people) and the other tiers being mostly raids.
---
And I am not sure about the AQ opening, if they do war effort, might be shorter or longer.
---
I think the real benchmark, is going to be the tanks on rag, with fire resist.
---
Tanks get MELTED even with 300+ fire resist.
---
Ofc there can be griefing but it's not the same thing at all.
---
Of course :D
---
Sit macros don't work in classic and duelwield is awful.
---
You never got this level of reward at any point for getting r14 in vanilla. This itemization is NOT vanilla.
---
Realistically: no.
---
PVP rank gives you a huge amount of rewards just by playing. Especially AV gives you some pretty awesome rewards.
---
If you are playing early phase 2 when bg's first pop, most people are going to be in dungeon gear, and even full geared raiders can be outplayed by someone in lesser gear.
---
There are some "toys" depending on your class, you might want from raids to give you an easier time (mainly: weapons as the majority of classes don't even get a half decent weapon at rank 14)
---
I had the same problem. Roll one dps class and one support class. Take your time lvling both and if you see one sticks out more for you than the other, you now have peace of mind knowing you tried both playstyles
---
I could be the guild enchanter if I want to, but not sure I want to bother. And I won’t be doing any PvP, so Engineering would just be for the benefits in raiding, though my gut seems to be telling me it’s not worth the effort and extra farming I’ll need to do.
---
I guess I could just settle into herb/Alch and call it s day at end game, after starting skinning/Tailoring.
---
Hahaha, STV. Had to be constantly checking your surroundings, learned never went down the main roads unless you wanted to die, and once you hit max lvl you went out there for some epic world PvP fun.
---
Warlocks are very gear dependent. That’s why they’re so weak early on. 
---
Mages are not gear dependent at all and shine in early pvp.
---
thanks, at least someone, cant wait for BfA kids in Classic cryin how hard it is
---
Watch them pull some shit and push it to November-December
---
&gt; the earliest someone can have it is after having cleared 7 bosses.
---
It might be possible then to get quintessence that first raid (theoretically). From memory Majordomo was boss 9, and if you only need rep from 7, you can get it before you need it.
---
Watch them pull some shit and push the date back to “holiday 2019”
---
Explain to me how a shield with +Healing and Passive MP5 with +10 INT +10 STAM and 90 Block is BiS for a Prot Warrior.
---
While The Face of Death has +12 Block rating +21 Block Value +21 STAM and 87 Block.
---
It wasn't some seamless you jump and your pet jumps it was more like you jump and start falling a good 3 meter drop and your pet would do this weird teleport fall with you.
---
the bat handlers in scholo, you can use their aoe to kill the little dragons.

---
Yeah, I agree. It won’t feel the same. I would literally spend 2 hours trying to wall jump a mountain. In the scheme of things I would rather lose out on these small things compared to the big changes. But only release will tell how well/poorly they take it
---
I don't know if one is optimal. With priest, you'll both be rolling cloth, though spirit gear goes to you. And youre less likely to get the killing blow so Spirit Tap is less important to your build. With Druid you can still heal and there's no gear overlap at all. 
---
Warlock pet can tank with heals from either class. Car Druid has some AOE and so does Holy Nova build for priest. 
---
They're pretty similar. Just pick whichever one appeals to you more.
---
For the warriors Battle shout to do anything a target who is in combat with the NPCs needs to be within 20y of the warrior - with the aggro range in classic that's easier said than done.
---
You can battle shout all day long if you don't reach a target that is in combat it doesn't do anything.
---
Not to mention that it means the warriors needs enough rage to do so - in other words a fast setup for each pull - as it's highly unlikely that a warrior will burn his/her bloodrage cd just for the rogue sap
---
Thank you, people say Druid a lot but I played a Druid hard core in vanilla and feral was very gear dependent and feral gear was very sparse in vanilla.
---
So this website doesn't have BiS for stage 1 and 2, only the pre-raid BiS?
---
Some of us see clearly.
---
You can, my point was that in response to the person I was responding to that nobody would already have the Quintessence when you start the raid. There's nothing stopping anyone from completing the quest chain during the first raid and going back and dousing all the runes.
---
*laughs in druid*
---
&gt; Looking back I'm kind of surprised warlocks weren't faction locked to be honest.
---
I mean, if anyone hated Warlocks with a passion it'd be Thrall.
---
I feel his pain not gonna lie.
---
Depends on a server. I started playing on a PvE server at the beginning of WotLK, so my memories might be irrelevant. But we had numerous city raids, SS-TM and Crossroads battles. I personally spent some time in Menethil and in SW-IF metro, picking up a fight with Alliance. Also I remember a few alliance players, trying to initiate PvP by killing escort Horde NPCs; I was often asked to help. If a server population is high enough, it's inevitable both factions will clash (I guess so).
---
Northshire, home, least it was before I fucked everything up.
---
it is.
---
Back in the day in my guild all of the hunters were paying a hunter from the best raiding guild to do the quest for them. I said fuck it and did it myself. It was one of the most rewarding things I did in WoW
---
Also for ones where BIS is some epic crafted item that costs 500 gold in mats.
---
I'll be a rich little paladin!

---
Sorry yes I missed that part, also I updated my comment with a quest that is *required* for the quintessence, and I think it might actually require honored. Not sure if your calculations took that into account (7 bosses seems a bit few to get honored). So I guess time will tell!
---
Agreed. Art and Music is overall pretty great in all expansions, but the rest is ass. I've never been as bored with anything and I was with BfA after 1 month of playing.
---
Check the difference in armor. The mitigation calculations are simple, and every single prot BiS list has the KT shield as the best in the game.
---
Especially compared to vanilla, tbc and even wrath.
---
I'm sure i'm only one in the sea of many who chose to alt a tank to run dungeons because you got tired of shitty slow tanks.

Once you go druid, you will never go back. Just warning you.
---
*cries in alliance*
---
Very nice. Ty.
---
Played on a PvE server in early vanilla. There were frequent town raids in Darkshore and Crossroads. When the honor system was released there was constant fighting in Hillsbrad until WSG and AV released, and even then there was fighting there while people sat in queue for AV.
---
You can get Honored before you enter Molten Core. Just requires killing 1800 elementals in Silithus.
---
Both factions are always flooded with Rogues and Hunters. (Moreso on horde for UD Rogues)
---
As for never getting a pug spot, if you are a DPS it will be much more competition, with that being said rogues are VERY important in raids especially come BWL for the *DE*pression room.  Tanks are always in very high demand, along with healers. With that said as for a tossup between hunter and rogue, good of either is always going to be taken. Horde side might favor melee more, due to windfury totems being avilable with shamans. And with paladins on alliance hunters can be slightly favored.
---
Rip stinky
---
mage - the most gear independent, just need a raw stats gear (stam+int) some engi grenades and you are gtg. shatter crits always hurt, mage relies on kiting and control, sheeping or с or aoe slows are always find its use and greatly affecting some situations, got enough nuking, survivability (block, blinks, shields) and explosive power by just the nature of the class even without a gear. watch vurtne. enough said. the most gear independed class imo (tested myself). obviously gear helps, but you can pwn ppl without it.
---
druid flag carry in wsg - don't need much to be fucntionable, you can run for flags just cos you are a druid. obviously gear helps with survivability, but you are functional and useful without it.
---
priest - and healers in general, healing is always useful. you have your fat heals even without a gear. just stick to some geared guy and heal him, and you are already super useful and impactful, even without much gear. obviously you oom fast and shit, cos not enough gear, but you can make the impact and get involved and be meaningful. 
---
so paladins and shaman in the same category, though paladin needs more gear from my experience, so they can spam flash of light and it'd be effective and heal for more. (druid pvp healing is bad by the design of the class, cos of no fast heal, so not reccomended, without the gear its even worse).
---
enh shaman - played it aton myself, with just 5man gear, i was able to do thing and kill way higher geared players, and be impactful and dangerous, even like r14 ppl with 6k hp, using just stratholme staff (later i got av mace and became a full on beast, never really raided) like r14 ppl even, decently gear independed in terms of high level gear, but you need a wise balance of stats, so you ened a right proportion of a difference thing, and carefully chosen gear pieces. a ton of impactful utility spell, like purge shocks, aoe slow totem, grounding etc and ton of magic damage. and wf burst is wf burst even with a shittier weapon and gear. though you need to gear wisely still. enhs are gear depended but not that much compared to some other classes. though its very skillbased, a normal enh shamans are usually very pepega with a wrong gear stats.
---
hunter - ok now we come to the borderline territory, in term of utility and being annoying and stuff you don't really need much gear, but to do fat damage and crit ppl, they really rather gear depended, and there arent really good wepons in 5mans. with 5man gear you wont do much in terms of doing a good damage.
---
rogue - gear depended. more depended than not. need a good weapons first and foremost. you need to be able to kill ppl in a stunlock or you are not a functionable rogue really. though 5man and craftable gear is quite good. but you wont have much hp. and die like a fly. 
---
all this shit with wrold of roguecraft killing ppl naked, you cant waste all cds on every fight and reset 3 times with a blind. thats not how it works in a normal pvp enviroment like bgs, you need to be functionable all the time. and you don't have like 30 second to dance around one person with no interruption most of the time.
---
warlock - very gear depended your dots need to hurt and eat ppl alive,  or your shadowbolts need to crit hard. you need spd. without a gear they are a potato really (i tried). thats why warlock become much stronger and start really owning from aq onwards. with basic gear they arent great.
---
warrior - need gear, and big dick weapon or you are quite a pepega. just working as a hamstring slowing machine. warrior need really to hurt like so charge+ms+autottack took away like at least half of the hp of the opponent, otherwise warriors are real a bummer, 2h autoattacks are really slow, you dont have rage and its just pathetic really withou a really good gear.
---
~
---
 no some hybrids:
---
elem shams - rather gear depended, without gear you dont really pwn and burst ppl. cos elems rely on hard burst and nuking without it the class is kinda meh really. you can still play utility, offhealer and such, but its not fully that turret oneshoting elem as it needs to be, and the mean of the spec.
---
shadowpriests - i honestly wouldn't say for sure, cos thats one of the only classes i didnt play in pvp.
---
moonkin - need top spd gear so your stuff would hurt, dots needs to hurt, starfire crtis needs to oneshot almost or gtfo. without gear it feels really meh. same situation as a walrock. 
---
ret paladin - really need gear, even with gear it is questionable, to say the least. not recomended.
---
i think thats about all the classes ppl play in pvp.
---
Still, I don't agree with the "Ctrl V" reason for deleting everything.
---
If you play horde and obtain Ironfoe (rare drop from last boss in BRD) the proc effect on the weapon allows you to speak Dwarvish for 10 sec. So you can speak to dwarfs however you still wont be able to understand what they say. Just a fun fact for those who didn't know.

If you never played classic wow, that's understandable. There are realities you will face with each class that go beyond just being melee or ranged, damage dealer or support. You will level differently, you will have armor sets that look better than others, you will have competition for raid spots, you will have dead talent trees and sometimes be forced to play specs you don't want. I suggest you go with what you find the most fun. For me that was rogue; fun to level, fun to pvp, and great endgame dps. Eligible for thunderfury, very few keybinds because of your stealth bar, and just a very flavourful class to play with lockpicking and sneaking and ganks.

There's people on private servers literally for months on end 24/7 camping lvl 20s in redridge and then post about it on reddit. It's so strange

Well if the level difference is  &gt;10 then you will do virtually 0 damage to anybody due to this miss/parry calculations.

You should really roll a healer with a real ress.

This comment brought to you by the 2nd guy to die in the dungeon
---
Shouldn't the MT be well past the crushing blow cap without the extra 442 armor from the KT shield?
---
It is also tough to find a definitive stat value on both of these shields. Every site I have looked at has them listed all of the place stat wise. Not really sure if the stats ps use can really be trusted either
---
Gadgetzan, unless I decide to get engineering, then, WHEREVER THE HELL I WANT!! (Prob winterspring)
---
hehe, I was doing quite good - but I was overshadowed by the absurd damage of our bear druid. Such is the life of the early rogue.
---
I'm still weighting my options comes Classic, but as far as I'm concerned I don't have specific plans on a server to roll on - as long as it's PVP.
---
Never gank on the way into your questing area.
---
Always gank on the way out.
---
Invent in a monitor and toss your current one in a river. Buy two.. you wont regret it.
---
Agreed. At least top 3 for each stage would be nice, so we can get something to fill in while hunting some of the impossible pieces.
---
Whatever town you’re in, to save walking back there, cuz teleports at 20
---
I wish I could get HKs while leveling :(
---
Go druid, never look back.
---
As for professions, you can never go wrong with engineering + alchemy. Not many professions in classic have specific BOP things, beyond engineering only things. And with alchemy you might be able to squeeze out some profit here and there making potions.
---
For WSG druids are the flag carrier. Full stop nobody does it as well as a druid to get the flag and book it across the field. If you in a premade as a druid with toys (and noggenfloggers and FAP potions) you will be gone before anyone even notices.
---
As for AB heal bot, or stealth cap squad. And in AV, stealth cap squad, or zerg healer. 
---
Hit rank 13 with my druid in classic. Had a blast doing it. I stopped ranking at that point, as the rank 14 rewards for druid were trash in comparison to my raid weapons, and wasn't worth investing the next month of 20 hours a day to get. (Naxx raider)
---
----
---
With all that being said, I also played a warlock in classic, and I had so much fun being able to 1vX my opponents. Not that the class was totally overpowered, you just had a lot of control at your disposal with fear and pet. And even with that you could pull off some decent burst at times.
---
As for PVE it's 1 button mashing (shadowbolt) I didn't raid on that character. I made it up to rank 10 (iirc - blood guard), with my warlock had a blast too. Nothing says entertainment like having the enemy faction send 4 people diving past your team just to gank you (just to die a moment later to your friends). I was amazing at vaporizing healers. (I played Destro, thank drakedog for that one)
---
Overall, personally I have a bias towards druid, you have so much flexibility and complexity to the class, you are also a healer which is a HUGE plus in engagements. You can outlast people so well (even as a healer you can 1v1!)
---
If you're wanting to do more solo focus, can't go wrong with warlock though.
---
My recommendation: look up old pvp videos and see what type of playstyle it looks like and if it is enjoyable to you.
---
Recommendations (personal):
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EekNxwQ7izg - Druid
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZIg4OZlA-4&amp;t=421s - Warlock
---
There's a ton of others floating around out there, but those are my personal recommendation!
---
*Every class needs gear*
---
Even more so in PvP.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong but all items will be in their 1.12 stats and available based on patch progression. So like savage gladiator chest piece will be straight dps with no defense but items like relics, librams, totems, tier .5 and summon ables,  and gear such as Diana pearl necklace won't be available off the cuff.
---
If that's the case, bloodmail boots will be better than battle chasers and technically available at launch. For fury warrior that is.

---
if you are looking for an image, it was probably deleted
---
To be fair, I was a raid tank in naxx 40.... (RETAIL, not classic server)
---
I was the reason we actually got patch down. The hateful was CRUSHING our warriors as we had terrible RNG with getting warrior gear.
---
I was a furry meatsponge. That was all I needed to be.
---
So that's why everyone says the Horde is better at PvP..
---
Played on an RP server at launch (all PvE originally).  Before the patch there was occasional fighting in the usual spots but only fairly sporadic. 
---
Despite being on a PvE server and part of a guild who role-played as pacifists as far as Horde v Alliance goes, the second that honour system went live, Tarren Mill/Southshore became an absolute mess of 24 hour rolling world PvP.  
---
Before then I had secretly engaged in PvP for fear of the guild finding out and booting me. The day after the patch I ran into the guild leader in the Hillsbrad killing fields, flagged for PvP, and drenched head to toe in the blood of her enemies. Figuratively speaking.
---
Make an alt. That is the answer.
---
How are orc rogues lore wise?
---
[Hmmmm](http://pm1.narvii.com/6610/eece9f826fa7f5d593fe74879cb4d461e4e95851_00.jpg)
---
Not a streamer/YouTube video maker...but it would be a great video that breaks down the major mobs and what skills they have.
---
Blizzard is handling classic incredibly well. It’s insane that you’re upset that they won’t add wall climbing glitches back in.
---
If that’s your attitude you’re never going to be pleased. For the new client Blizzard is going above and beyond to make sure things are as close as possible.
---
klip's brother?
---
Did you even play Vanilla?  Paladin tanking wasn't viable, period.
---
That hyjal? Looks like it kind of but I also have no clue
---
^^ This. I had the full eight characters, 3/8 of which were 60s stuck in pre-B.i.S. or next-best clown suits, where 5/8 were B.i.S. battleground bracket twinks.
---
Pservers don't tune the bosses correctly anyhow, so that should not be your concern.
---
they are trash tanks lol
---
Druid.
---
Them: "Oh what does your class do"
---
You: "EVERYTHING."
---
Jokes aside, melee is pretty rough for hybrids in BG's, as most hybrids in BG's are going to get STEAMROLLED by warriors and rogues, and range is much safer.
---
So I would give the range favor over to ele shaman to be honest. There's a huge amount of burst and utility the ele shaman brings to the table.
---
Boomturkey (moonkin druid), is good in VERY VERY select situations. (And in raid only basically)
---
It is! It was never an official zone though, it required wall jumping to get inside the zone, a lot of organised PvP happened there
---
wouldn't that be considered better than Hand of justice due to the 1% hit chance?
---
???
---
Dual wielding hunters with a swap to T3  over T2
---
Hoj, quick strike and drake fang on a hunter because they obviously can't just use a scope to get the hit they need
---
I don't want to sound toxic, but this is amusing me to no end. If people follow these guides then all the casual guilds are going to tear each other apart in no time
---
ENEMY STAND-O: SAP AND GOUGE-U
---
For just about every Hunter you'll meet, yeah. I hear there's some Raptor Strikes to duck in and do between auto shots when possible but I've never looked into it.
---
I know, I don't get it either.
---
I am going to echo with what Crazy said, I was a tank in Naxx 40, I was the backbone of patchwork prog, as hatefuls was smashing our warriors into the dirt.
---
Early raid tier (T1) not the druid's best place to be, as many of the non-class specific leather isn't stellar (and not much of it exists) so you are best looking towards T2 and beyond for serious druid tanking. There was a TON of BWL gear that wasn't rogue only and it was all pretty amazing for druid.
---
Not sure how Blizzard will do with upgrading items per patch, but if they do then Clutch of Andros doesn't have +hit until AQ or Naxx.
---
Most believable one. Retail players who started after late Wrath or Cata that expect the same experience. Same users here who are crying about the pvp rank grind or getting farmed for honor points. I'd even include users here that are already asking for BC servers soon after.
---
In order from least to most.
---
Hunter: You can get a really strong weapon in LBRS that will last for a while and if you're willing to join a casual guild (1-2 day a week guild) that does MC you can get a bow which will last you a long time. Aside from a slight dependence on weapons they're really great early on with next to nothing.
---
Paladin: Slap on a shield and you're an amazing healer, though if you plan to play ret or shockadin you're gonna need a little bit of gear.
---
Druid: A lot more player skill dependent than gear dependent, having some gear to FC the flag in WSG isn't required but helps a lot.
---
Rogue: USED to be really good without gear, but keep in mind that classic will be on 1.12 patch where they're slightly nerfed, so you will need a little bit of gear to get going.
---
Mage: Middle of the pack, needs some stamina gear to survive rogues but not completely dependent on it. And a good PvE trinket really boosts your power.
---
Priest: Don't actually need that much gear but not very enjoyable until you have a good amount of stamina.
---
Warrior: Scales very well with gear and is very reliant on getting a good weapon from raiding.
---
Speical: Warlock - Warlocks can be amazing with no gear but if you're new to the class you're gonna have a really bad time. On top of that they do scale very well with gear and become absolute beasts with naxx gear.
---
Special2: Shamans are very similar to warlocks, they're really strong without gear and if you ever get into AQ gear you become an unstoppable machine.
---
Thanks for that, I doubt that's going to really happen, if MC is open day 1, I am pretty sure people are going to zerg the hell out of things -&gt; hit 60 and walk into MC and get the gear faster and kill rag first reset. But that's just me throwing a dart at a dartboard!
---
Cheers!
---
Maybe it's about ret paladin not getting in any raids?
---
Single server communities that allow reputations to build = 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
---
ty ty!
---
Ya I didn't think that was hard to grasp. Different strokes I guess.
---
How difficult is it for paladins to get stuff like mageblade, choker of the firelord, robes of volatile power. Do guilds give mages/locks prio.
---
yah I can see that being a dps increase but that would depend on the speed of ranged weapon ofcourse, but If you're using the BiS weapons displayed on the site then there should be no issue getting in 1 raptor strike between auto shoots.
---
They’re fine in 5 mans.
---
You’re gonna largely get anecdotal examples with this question but I think there’s always going to be a demand for both at all levels. It’s only when you start looking at more hardcore communities that you  notice imbalances. Personally, I think healers are always in demand since they’re required in greater numbers and their role attracts a more niche audience. People are also less likely to be critical if you’re a healer whereas tanks are always expected to perform at a certain level.

If you don’t mind me asking, why would you delete your character?
---
I normally just leave my characters where they were and never delete anything in case I do come back.
---
Take it with a grain of salt though. I laughed when he said gear doesn’t matter for flag carriers and that warlocks are gear dependent. 
---
You can literally rock people’s faces as a warlock with a bunch of green stamina gear.
---
Why did I read that as "Shamanless LFM"?
---
DM ME!!
---
I agree that a feature which turns BoE's off &amp; on would be welcome for the pre-raid options.
---
For lower level content, they can be pretty powerful for running a group, I’d imagine.  (If they’re selling their services)
---
I’ve got a group of 3-4 buddies I’ll be leveling with so I might be able to get help from them!
---
Warriors are the only class that can consistently kill warlocks, especially if they get a charge off.  But then they will still die from the DoTs.
---
Please sub and let me know in the comments what is your favorite mob to MC!
---
Nice view.
---
I cannot wait to burst out of the shadows on my orc rogue and not be slowed LOL.
---
im sorry not to be mean or rude, but this is by far the stupidest question ever asked regarding what will be in classic wow lol. seriously no offense!!
---
Orc is actually one of the worse options for pve.
---
I don't think it would have the desired effect. There really is a charm to the older art and graphics style and its not just nostalgia (although that is part of it). The older graphics with the art and zones (and definitely music) create a much more atmospheric experience than anything I've experienced in retail (played actively through every expansion). 
---
Messing with that would really fuck with the atmospheric feel and charm that exists with vanilla. Not to say one is better than the other, but Vanilla works for a reason so I don't think changing it would help. Likewise, a lot of retail players enjoy the updated art and zones so it works for retail in the new environment.
---
You're gonna have to explain this one, chief.
---
My friend was a troll hunter who rolled need on everything just in case someday hunter might need a intellect gear set or might use mace
---
Why is the priest
---
Yup. I iwsh so much that I had my old screenshots :(
---
Lost them all years ago
---
Well warlocks and hunters have less competition for tier gear than rogues. You’ll normally have 5 or 6 rogues to compete against for your tier gear, and only half as many if you’re a warlock or hunter.
---
I'm British myself but one of the things I enjoyed the most about my original guild was just how many nationalities there was in it. Our core raid team had pretty much every european nationality in it, Scandinavans, Dutch, Italians, French, Czech, Bulgarian, Slovakian, Georgian.. many more I forget I'm sure.. It was really cool getting to know these people and about their cultures etc.. I mean I spent 5-6 hours a day with them every day so it was bound to get personal at times. Our guild even did an irl meet up where about 30 to 40 people gathered at the GM's house in the Czech Republic!
---
tl;dr: mixed nationality servers are great imo! I understand some communities would like particular main language realms (RU, Ger etc,) that's fine with me too but I would hate for there to be a long list of language specific realms.
---
So I say, "that takes a lot of research" and you reply, "no it doesn't as long as you first do this thing that takes a lot of research"
---
Warlock master race
---
Why is it when I click "Druid -&gt; Boomkin spec" it just laughs at me?
---
That is a place of much serenity for me. When Nost was going down I stood on that overlook with several others, regardless of faction, and we awaited the doom of our beloved home.
---
Sure, it does happen occasionally,  but the number of times I had to switch characters to avoid campers while leveling back in vanilla I could count on one hand.
---
Throw us a link love
---
It is nice having the ability to speed up the process. If you're proactive it gets everyone there as fast as you can get there. No waiting for the most part. Waiting for a summon or waiting for people to show up is the worst part.
---
Well that cant be it because ret paladin dps is absolutely fine in vanilla...
---
"It was that or underwater breathing... and I hate drowning".
---
Looks like ret paladin has no gear and is bubble hearthing while holy is fully geared.
---
Only video I ever saw of hyjal required someone to open like 40 tabs of anything on his computer, disconnect his internet, and then run while he’s disconnecting from the game. Only then and hyjal was in view. That was the only video I ever saw.
---
I’m going NE hunter to but lacking with my wife as NE priest gonna be a blast! Can’t wait for classic!!!!!!!!!
---
An actual PvE guild on a PvE server?  A dream come true.  Those times could even work for my GF and me (depending on circumstance with life).
---
I’ve hardly ever raided and only did casual late stuff with raiding in Wrath, so I’m stoked to try out classic!
---
My main was a Prot Warrior, and I'm going to roll an assassination rogue to mix it up a little bit.
---
I do feel a little bad that I'll be missing out on the best class
---
So the guild is called &lt;Shameless&gt; then?  
---
^^^^^/s
---
The ony logical choice: ANAL \[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]
---
Hmm someone else planning a mount farming group ey? :)
---
It’s a cool zone, Archimonde chilling in the background
---
Where would you take 3 points from?
---
Evis is just something that you do as a filler between 4/5 point SnDs.
---
3 points into ruthlessness or imp poisons is generally considered to give higher dps than imp evis
---
I think I got to level 112 or 113 before I quit. I tried but I just couldn’t man, such a disorganized, buggy snooze fest
---
It actually takes a really long time to reach rank 6 (best friend) with your pet. At least 4-5 levels.
---
You know what, I do think someone said ""[Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]!**
---
Guild name is still up in the air &lt; Comprehensibility &gt; so far, joke on the ''1 word'' guild name : )
---
fantastic post
---
I really like the layout, but there are a lot of things wrong on here, stat wise, just looking at prot warrior. Savage Glad is NOT the best prot chest piece with the 1.9+ stats shown (0 defense vs 20 defense). Waistband of Wrath (3% block) is worse than Belt of Might (1% dodge). Royal Qiraji Belt is better than T3, and there is no bonus for 9/9 T3. Thunderfury is not even mentioned...
---
Also really prot needs to be split into threat (what you use in 90% of encounters) and prot (what you have shown here, used in the other 10%).
---
Leather (most important part) with stamina and intellect is all you need to play Heart of the Wild + NS in PvP. Anything else is just extra. You win fights with defense, not offense.
---
Also, I prefer to skip Nature's Grasp and max out Heart of the Wild. That 1 point Nature's Grasp is extremely weak and unreliable - not what you want in a class that's meant to be reliable.
---
As for the build: it depends on you and what you want to do. My goal is to PvP and also have the flexibility to either tank or heal in PvE, so I like this spec: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxMscRdxVxsofo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxxMscRdxVxsofo)
---
You can take more of the cat talents instead of the bear talents if you don't plan on tanking. Or drop Improved Rejuvenation to max out Tranquil Spirit if you mostly heal in raids. It's pretty hard to make a bad spec as long as you take Heart of the Wild and Nature's Swiftness.
---
I played 14/32/5 for a bit. This spec performs better when you're undergeared, you don't have much intellect, and you absolutely need Natural Shapeshifter to support shifting. Your heals are garbage with this build, which is unfortunate in both PvP and PvE, but you won't be doing much healing regardless without intellect gear.
---
What a great response - Thank you! I would love to hear more about your experience as a druid, what you found to be effective and fun - it sounds like you know quite a lot!
---
Not in 5mans my dude.
---
Maybe less tanks means fewer taurens and more gnomes?
---
Guess l’ll be rolling a goblin rogue when Classic launches then!
---
Yeah I have nothing against other nationalities at all. For me it's just a case of being able to recruit people to your raid team that speak the same language in order to make communication easier. 
---
Most of us understand english perfectly but there may be a slight "lag" when speaking it due to having to translate in your head. For some it comes more naturally than to others. It's easier for me to focus on the game when I don't have to also think about what I'm going to say :)
---
No worries! My goblin jumper cabl... never mind - failed.
---
This comment brought to you by the rogue with goblin engineering.
---
If I pick a class and after some hours at 60 I decide that its not for me, its a big deal leveling a new main??
---
I know the feels. I completely forgot about classic until I was browsing reddit the other day and saw something that reminded me of it. Ever since I saw that I’ve probably watched 20 20-60min videos about classes, levelling, gear and professions. And I am so fucking excited. 
---
I started playing very late into classic, probably 1-2 months before TBC came out, so I didn’t really have any real experiences in classic and I always feel sad I missed out on it. And the time I did play, I was 12 and my English wasn’t that good (I’m from Europe), so I didn’t really even understand what was going on the first few months. 
---
I’m just so excited and hyped to experience WoW again!  Hopefully I’ll be able to find a guild pretty quickly and quest together and do dungeons, cause I really miss that. Even tho I did play all the latest expansions in WoW (I quit BFA after a month of the expansion being out) and I was in a guild with friends, it just didn’t feel like we *HAD* to play together. Because of that I feel like more and more people started playing solo, unless they are doing dungeons or raids, but even when doing dungeons I feel like people would always go their own way and do it with PuGs. 
---
I just miss being a part of a community, seeing an active world, reliving the fantasy aspect (hunters having arrows, feeding your pet, portals costing materials); I feel like all these little things made everything more meaningful and more impactful. 
---
I don’t know if all of this sounds lame or nostalgic, but I can wait to make a character, join a guild with a weird/silly name and just make new friends and help each other while playing.
---
Wrong sub
---
Fuck off with this. So many angry weebs, mad at Blizzard for not inventing a god damn time machine.
---
Umm I was pretty upset with Cataclysm, I was in the Navy when I started playing Vanilla WoW and I got Shore Duty, so all through Vanilla WoW and The Burning Crusade I was living it up but had to go to school and then back to Sea Duty 2 weeks before Wraith of the Lich King dropped.           
---
           
---
So I missed a massive amount of WOTLK, I didnt get to play it until Ice Crown dropped and by then I was rushing to catch up and then I eneded up out to sea for 6 months, got out and then had a massive amount of time for WoW.               
---
So when Cataclysm turned out to be so dreadful I was crushed, pretty sure thats when the Talent system became the 6 tier pick 3 bullshit that it is and most my friends had stopped playing and I wound up in some bullshit guild where 25+ members joined and left every day but you never knew them anyways. I call them "Wal-mart Guilds" and so I deleted my Main in a temper tantrum.
---
This isn't conspiracy, it's the natural evolution of any institution, corporate or otherwise... doing it right brings success, success brings prestige and money, prestige and money bring leeches, who will suck on the host until it's a dead husk before moving on to the next.

My favorite was Anal [searing pain]

Killing tigers, Panthers, gorillas and troll while growing eyeballs in the back of your head...classic Stranglethorn Vietnam

&gt; There will not be a server wide world chat.

Except there was in Vanilla, it was called LookingForGroup and was global for the last few patches.
---
Doesn't matter how much runecloth you donate... Jimmy ain't ever comin' back
---
Feral Druid my dude!
---
Stealth runs were a staple in vanilla.
---
I did a few LBRS runs as a resto druid with a feral druid tank and a mix of rogues / cat druids. 
---
It was a blast to skip to bosses and sometimes have someone get seen and have to recover from surprise pulls.
---
this guy just repeats what he reads, clueless wow bot.
---
Not to be confused with half warriors
---
These kind of posts belong in the weekly Monday threads
---
Hi, /u/1234typ
---
I can definitely see how changing the overall aesthetic wow had, giving it a different art direction would not have a positive effect but that's not what I meant. 
---
Artists are able to improve on that feel and charm, respecting the old art and style, all while not be limited by the old technology.
---
Paladins become just as uncrushable as warriors.
---
And long fights are not relevant to the topic at hand, its specifically about packs of aoe mobs.
---
For one spec, yeah. Playing as a hybrid all you really need it INT and STAM then get good at switching forms regularly and knowing which of your tools to use against others when. You should survive people to death with your control, mobility and heals.
---
I tanked as a paladin from 1.9 through retail. If you could not make it work, you were bad.
---
Should have had the shaman flying a kite
---
Very cool man
---
If they keep 1.12 itemization for pvp items, should put r10 shoulder / head combo as prebis for warlocks and mages
---
You will know well before 60 if a class isn't for you. Most people say around 25-35 is when you will know if you like a class or not.
---
I guess so, but anything that'd make for a smooth start is very welcome.
---
You can always downvote and posts like these will dissapear eventually :&gt;
---
&gt; I think you just have very little experience in starting full blown wars in PvP.
---
So there's no possible way you could ever start something by attacking a level sixty in a level sixty(ish) zone? That sounds wildly implausible. People are always farming high level herbs and ore, killing monsters for gold, doing their thing. You're telling me you can't find any of them to fight?
---
It still sounds like this is just an excuse to bully levellers and pretend that your goal is PvP against equals. If you really wanted PvP against equals you could just PvP against equals.
---
&gt; And if that person chose a PvP server, they've signed up for the potential of getting ganked.
---
I can see that argument, if everyone on a PvP server is a jerk who wants to gank lowbies, then ganking them as lowbies is a sort of justice. But that just drags everyone else down to your level. It doesn't drag you up to the level of not-an-asshole.
---
Someone should tell him....
---
I can see that.  Totally get it.  Cata was complete garbage to me.  Ended up doing just PvP because I found all the PvE so dreadful.
---
The Diablo 3 talent system was the final nail for me seeing the game as WoW.  At that point, it just felt like it was becoming homogenized with all the other Blizzard IPs.
---
*Over on bizarro world.*
---
you dropped this: !
---
I wlnt be first but i wont be that far back.  Speed levelers will be trying to hit 60 still, I feel like.
---
Be the farmer not the crop
---
Then you summon him again and everything is fine.
---
They also have fewer training points at low levels of loyalty, so you cant train things like extra armor and stamina if you keep changing.
---
I assume "go go go go" is an anime reference?
---
This is the meta. Don't listen to anyone else. They're just trying to dissuade from the truth.
---
This is the reason, PVE servers were born. There only so much pain one can take.
---
Awesome, looks great and looks much better than a Google doc
---
running up zeppelin towers.. thats about it lmao
---
...In a good way?
---
Imo it’s more that it’s easier to make an immersive open world, when the style is consistent. The modern game’s open world is consistently beautiful, but I think there are advancements they have made that don’t feel right. It’s easier to suspend disbelief when I know I’m strapping myself in for a cartoon.
---
Maybe someday Blizzard will make an expansion or offshoot that caters to the Classic crowd, with all the great leaps and bounds they’ve made, and without all of the community and gameplay destroying elements.
---
But Holy's not wearing a dress.
---
0/10 meme would not repeat.

Female Orc thighs save lives....
---
...but Orc blood fury back stabs are my demise.
---
Just hunters in general. In an age where every little kid has gotten their hands on SOME first person shooter, I truly expect any kids that run across this game to be rolling hunter simply because "oh hey they have gun, gun strong, gun good" or something like that. But seriously, that being said, I do without a doubt think that Nelf Hunter will be a "noob class" again among kids because Nelves are the "prettiest" race that can roll Hunter. Same issue, different reasoning.
---
Rak'shiri, the blue sabre-toothed tiger from Wintersprings.   
---
I named it "Sky" and found months later that it was a legit word in english (I didn't talk english back then).   
---
If I do a hunter I'll probably tame it again.
---
TIL that apparently Orc fury warriors with that weapon skill and blood fury to boost their damage is the worst.
---
Never change reddit.

Gogogogo?

Yeah I don't get it.

YOU DO NOT SEE GROG

isn't the phase 1 bis caster cloak that green one with only + spellpower?

Garona is the most famous rogue in the game, being an Orc female assasin.

Don't know much really about lore but I know about her.

I need a new desk. Thats awesome setup!
---
That and the nelf starting area is fantastic
---
Between lvl 24 and 28 you went up by &gt;450 gold? How'd you manage that?
---
Well but what if my feral druid is super fun at those levels but at 60 Im forced to be a heal 99% of the time in order to find groups??
---
"I die constantly and feel alive, I run at a snails pace but feel like i'm going somewhere." 
---
Damn.
---
The casters in brs, fire resist buff
---
Warlocks are kind of dumb 1v1 because they beat healers and the classes that beat them (Warriors and Hunters) can't heal. Warriors and Hunters still die after they kill the Warlock because DoTs.
---
They're a lot less threatening in group situations.
---
Relics for Shaman/Paladin/Druid added in P5 (only added in P6 in this)
---
Egan's Blaster available for all of them in P1!
---
Theres going to be a lot of debate of what should be included as "pre-raid" ie. Teebu's is your best 1h Sword, but you cant really expect someone to get it, thats the most extreme example, but its a sliding scale. 
---
Otherwise, nice little program!
---
So my hunter's 'auto shot if far away, auto attack if too close' macro won't work in classic?

---
Just piggybacking off the top comment to post this list that has all classes/specs pre raid lists. Shows quite a few options and stats laid out so you can make your own decisions on alt pieces to go for.
---
I don't want to naysay this idea too much, but I think it might go against the community feel you're looking for. Part of the magic of early versions of the game was that all types of players could be found interacting with each other, from the very causal to the extremely dedicated. It exposes players to different styles and attitudes towards the game, and incentivizes them to participate in content they might not normally do. Then again, it's not like everyone on Reddit is playing with the same goals in mind anyway, so the sub-community kind of becomes redundant. Just my 2 cents.
---
&lt;Jaina’s Addiction&gt; popped into my head sometime after BfA was announced and it still makes me laugh.
---
&gt; If everyone can just teleport everywhere instantly with menus, nobody is out in the world to interact with.
---
This is what killed my enthusiasm for pretty well every other MMO I've tried since quitting WoW back in '08. A lot of them were solid games, too; I still really like the style of GW2. And the charr. The charr are absolutely badass and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.
---
The "problem" was I insisted on traveling through the world to get anywhere because I really like that extra level of immersion. Which was fine at first, but my friends started getting frustrated with it before long and kept bugging me to just teleport. So I did - and a week or two later I stopped playing because I wasn't having much fun anymore. Sure, it was convenient, but it completely defeated the purpose of ANet giving us this great big sandbox of a world to play around in in the first place.
---
As you said, it seems like such a little thing, and to a lot of people it even feels like an inconvenience or even a negative, but to me it really adds to the experience of playing the game. I'll never play another MMO that has unlimited instant/fast travel.
---
Mind Blast, Fear, Mind Control, SWP on the fall. 
---
Most satisfying HK popup when they splat.
---
You're speaking of loyalty. Happiness is only affected by food and changes the pet's damage (75%, 100%, 125%). Going from red to green happiness can be achieved by simply feeding two whole current max level foodbits.
---
Regarding loyalty the important factor is time. To go from loyalty rank 1 to 6 it only takes 25% XP of a single level of your pet but a total 225 minutes having it by your side.
---
I am not fluent in the original addon scripts, I only ever used basic ones. Because I didn't main hunter, I didn't use that macro but it does seem simplistic enough, it's likely that would work.
---
Come to thing of it, that's the largest issue still standing unanswered. The "We are running Classic servers on The Legion client; Classic API allowed more than intended, and must be addressed."
---
Just what they decide to allow is in the air.
---
The main sufferers are addonaholics and raiders because many rotations - and I mean *entire* rotations, could be macro'd. One button. Pressed once? 5 times? Infinite? Idk, but they were widely used. 
---
I'm ok if we don't have *that* again
---
Ahh yeah my bad. But a pet with low loyalty loses happiness really fast and requires constant feeding
---
Honestly didn't know there was a dedicated one, since nothing is mentioned in rules or / quick info.
---
Thanks for keeping it clean
---
Pala tank, pala dps, Druid dps, mage dps, priest heals. 
---
Pala because undead aoe is insane
---
Druid because of innervate, hurricane, and tranquility. 
---
Mage cause AoE
---
Priest because, well priest.
---
Oh wow, duh. I don’t know why I didn’t realize that. Since Mages, Rogues, and Warrior are the largest portions of a raid, I’ll probably avoid those three classes lol
---
I feel the same way but I also play wotlk private servers so I may have pesudo-burnt myself out on classic that way
---
Feel the same way
---
I’ll find out closer to a release date, but I’ll keep an eye out on the guild recruitment threads.  I plan on Warrior Tank.  Probably ultimately aiming for OT and low priority DPS since there’s a dime a dozen warriors out there and that’s not my main focus.
---
A watched pot never boils.
---
Sorry for the wall of text, there's a lot of complexity in classic which makes me really excited!
---
I bounced between feral and resto most of the time, depending on the day of the week... literally.... 2 days a week I was feral/resto, or straight up feral and 4-5 days a week straight resto for PVE encounters. 
---
When I was feral/resto or straight up feral, it was mostly for pvp purposes. I went straight up feral once my guild was deep in BWL and beyond. I never really topped the damage charts as feral but I held my own (did better once we were deep AQ40 and the gear was ACTUALLY AVAILABLE).
---
Even tanking 5-mans was pretty decent as a bear, huge health pool, armor pools and mashing swipe did decent to hold AOE threat. (private server has issues with one talent for druid that increases threat but doesn't seem to function on those servers)
---
I started Wow by playing a warlock when the game first launched, it wasn't until BWL was about to hit that I rolled a druid (for guild, and mostly because I wanted a challenge), and even running around strangleGANK (stranglethorn vale) on a pvp server wasn't as painful as most people make it out to be. As a druid you have stealth, +30% movement speed (if you are feral) eventually you get travel form (+40% movement speed), Aquatic form (+50% in water and underwater breathing!)
---
I won't lie the biggest learning curve, is learning to maximize forms. Caster, bear and cat are all tools at your disposal, most of your time is going to be going between bear and caster. And if you're feral, cat/bear/caster.
---
If things stay true to classic, when you use your keybind for shapeshifting, you will need to press your keybind to shift to/out of form, or some addons help with that. (I am hoping Druidbar comes back!)
---
On the topic of "Druidbar" (addon) is one of the few addons I will say are basically *REQUIRED* as a druid, it shows your mana bar, no matter what form you are in. This is really important as you don't want to try and shift out form to try and heal, and find out you don't have enough mana. As well it had easy shift functionality, where it could press a button and it would cancel any form you are in.
---
Battle rez can save raids for sure. Tank goes down? Druids got you covered. (Huge cooldown)
---
Stealth runs were a blast too. Dire maul North, having druid tank, druid healer, 3 rogues sneak past EVERYTHING. 
---
My time as a healer was fun, you are using healing touch rank 4 a ton of the time (hots are CRAZY expensive on mana until later), but having the flexibility in a 5-man to focus on the tank, while splash healing your DPS with hots that don't suck (too bad) is great. Innervate as well is a massive help. As your gear gets better, your regen from innervate goes up.
---
Druids are really mana efficient even when raid healing. Not as powerful as a priest or a paladin when doing big heals, but are more about the smaller, but more spammy heals across the raid.
---
As for feral times, that's where the animal took over (bad pun intended). On retail it was around mid way through BWL patch that I really started making the switch to feral, I had a decent set of gear, I was able to step up and claim a place as a feral druid in raid as we were able to drop a healer in favor of a DPS, except for Nef where still needed the extra healer.
---
I tanked from time to time in raid when a tank fell, or typically on trash so we could let the tanks take a few moments away from getting their face bashed in.
---
AQ40 was where there was a lot of gauntlets, and we were lacking thunderfuries (we were only lucky enough to get 1 by that point), so I was able to get pummeled by trash effectively enough. Keeping me alive on the other hand, was a bit more of an issue as I would rip threat so hard and feral tank gear didn't really exist that well.
---
Into Naxx 40, on patchwerk specifically is where the bear really took over. Having bad RNG for the warriors, I was able to get my face bashed in over and over again by the hatefuls and the priests and paladins were able to handle it without too much of an issue. The big meat sponge that was patchwerk fell over not long after rotating me in and swapping some things up in the healers (mostly they had to customize their gear for me, to have more longevity, rather than straight up heal power as my damage taken was much more stable but they needed to just keep smashing a heal button for a long time)
---
All and all, druid is a really fun class to play, even played a lazerturkey for a month in retail at the tail end of BWL (while we were waiting for the war effort to get done), just to let our casters flex a bit more on our melee. Swapped out of that real fast come AQ though, it wasn't strong enough to keep it up, but Feral was still going strong.
---
But word of caution, feral DPS rotation is a clusterfuck. Kinda like this: http://azeroth.metblogs.com/files/2009/10/catdps.jpg (no mangle or savage roar of course! But you had to powershift.... a lot.... my hands still hurt)
---
I've tried to avoid burnout by not leveling all the way to 60 because I want to save that for retail servers when they come out but I think I've burnt myself out anyways because of the long wait with no end in sight
---
That is a good point, increased drop rates of BoEs may have been a better way to phrase that.
---
Yea same man best thing you can do imo is like me and just forget about it. Stop hyping over it so much and let time pass by. 
---
Once you do that you’ll find the months pass faster it’ll be here in no time. Really they shouldn’t have announced it until it was finished and just release it imo would have been far less painful.
---
You're excited and frustrated. Calm down. Don't visit the subreddit and don't follow the news for 1 or 2 weeks. It will help a lot.
---
No. Just stop. The classic team is obviously working on the game and listening to the community. They're not insulting anyone. If you don't want to play anymore, then don't. Or - here's a crazy thought - go play something else.
---
Hunter and druid. Raids tend to have 1-3. Not uncommon to get 3+ pieces of tier 1 in your first MC run
---
In the cookie cutter 19/32/0 combat swords build, you can drop Murder for 2/3 Improved Eviscerate for Naxx progression because most of the mobs in Naxx are Undead. Until then however, Murder is just superior (it's a flat out 2% damage boost on every single swing of your sword, from both hands, white and yellow).
---
Also in vanilla, if you switch targets you lose your combo points, so in fights where you're switching alot, you can burn a 1 or 2 combo point SnD and carry that attack speed onto the next mob.
---
That's not to say you won't ever use Eviscerate, you will, but the extra damage to your situational Eviscerates is just inferior to maintaining swing speed at all times.
---
Going mage as well. Friend group I'm rolling with needs DPS and I like how supportive mages can be to a guild with ports/gold farming/conjuring. Plus I really enjoy 5 man dungeons, and sheep makes most of them go more smoothly.
---
I’m currently planning to run a guild with some long time WoW players I know, but was planning to wait until we have a release date and server list before I started recruiting further. I wouldn’t worry too much yet. Still a few months away from getting into the game.
---
Start in gnome starting area and do all these quests:

Played an UD Rogue in Vanilla when I was a no-lifer raiding infrequently and pvping the majority of the time.  My keybinds sucked and still managed to do pretty well.  Now with a family/job, I won't really be able to raid much if at all.  I'm torn between rogue again and trying out UD mage.  What kind of learning curve is there for mage in PVP?  Having a ton of instant cast options seems fun but difficult to master.  I also feel like I could have been a lot better at rogue and that challenge is tempting.
---
Hi, /u/gwent_king
---
As someone with many MC'd creatures under my belt I would suggest having a focus-target single-button macro setup to re-mind control the creature you are mind controlling because it does have a tendency to break and the creatures do have a tendency to run straight towards you and smack you in the face.
---
Sell wow tokens.
---
Just forget about it and let time pass only way. Other wise it’s like watching the clock at work just miserable and time will not go by
---
Would you recommend joining a non-LC guild simply because not showing up for raids means you probably won't get loot when you do? What other Loot systems do guilds plan on using other than the classic DKP system that everyone used back then?
---
Yes. Very much yes.
---
Druids are all terrain characters, you have a form for.... everything. Tank - Bear, MDPS - Cat, RDPS - Doomturkey (moonkin) [not as effective in classic but still exists!], Healer - "Caster form", Humping dead dps - Cat or Bear depending on the class.
---
You are literally a Swiss army knife of classes. People ask me what my class does and my response is "EVERYTHING".
---
The class is complex, interesting, and provides a challenge unlike any other class.
---
I found myself often /dancing with other druids in the open world, even on pvp servers. It was just like an unspoken rule of druids, when one druid is dancing, YOU MUST ALSO DANCE.
---
Oh and teleport: nowhere is amazing. (Teleport: moonglade) It does have a flightpath and gives you quick access to that side of the world. When I was horde, I set my hearth to the badlands, and just teleported: nowhere, whenever I had to go to lagromar (orgrimmar) for things.
---
You have stealth for sneaking past mobs and getting to places you shouldn't, aquatic form for leaving people behind who are annoying you (especially friends), and if you play on a pvp server nothing makes mages cry more than a good druid. (I had one guy try to polymorph me 5 times followed by them trying to run away.... yeah good luck with that you can't root or snare a druid)
---
I very much like the story and questlines of leveling alternativing between dwarf/gnome and human zones. So loch modan and westfall, redridge, then alternate between wetlands and duskwood. There's some amazing questlines for doing that along with doing DM and stockades.
---
Worst place in the world: Nesingwary's Expedition, Undead Rogue country. I ain't represented the alliance since Wrath, but the Forsaken won't give a shit.
---
I think you are mostly right, and it depends on how sharding works,  but it's safe to say they will be contested a good amount of total uptime.
---
When you see [Orcish] in /yell while leveling in a contested zone.
---
Recently started on a private server, can not confirm this. My experience has been a bunch of insecure tanks that get upset the moment you tell them that they are doing something wrong. 
---
For some reason some people playing a tank assume that it's their way or the highway, and when they get called out they just leave.
---
I don't mind the long post at all! Thank you for telling me about your experience playing druid. It was really interesting to get a deeper insight into how druids heal in raids - it seems druids are also really usesful as off tanks. 
---
1 last question considering you played feral so much - How do you think feral compares to rogues or other melee DPS?
---
Orgrimmar/Ironforge will always be for duels, Stranglegank and Ganksbad (Stranglethorn and Hillsbrad) will always be gank havens.
---
Blasted lands once raiding scene kicks of will always have double door campers.
---
To be honest, it's part of the experience for me. While I don't actively gank people who are half my level, quite often I would "POLICE" nessingwary's basecamp. If you gank greys, prepared to get killed. If there were equal level people ganking I just sat by and watched, didn't interfere in any way as it was part of the game. (Yes I got bitched at quite often for it but that's how you get a 40-man raid of 60's camping nessingwary's for one faction camping it for 6 hours)
---
I am sure that 75% of the playerbase, has never played classic. As such we will be dealing with a ton of people who have no idea how to play their class, so should be a good time.
---
I mean, Druid couldn't dispel slows in TBC either. They just have excellent synergy. Druids don't need any support from teammates but have weak offensive pressure, while Warriors have the best offensive pressure but offer essentially zero support. It's a match made in heaven.
---
I don’t get it. Am I dumb?
---
&gt;They have dragged their feet on this as hard as possible and the fact that they still won't commit to a release date is downright insulting to this community.
---
Bruh. Calm down.

&gt;For WoW Classic, we’re moving spell casts to a low-priority loop that will cause them to be processed at the frequency that best fits how the game actually played in version 1.12. 
---
Popping in after a long time away. Something tells me there is no way this will be 100% identical to retail 1.12, but will be the best approximation possible instead.
---
Dishonorable kills lowered your % to the next honor rank. It was only coming into play against civilian npc's such as quest givers to 
---
 stop players from camping quest hubs forever: https://wow.gamepedia.com/Honor_system_(pre-2.0)
---
Yes, Rick and Morty memes do cause existence to be pain
---
From memory, after 3rd time killing the same person, you get 0 honor from killing them.
---
As for the high ranks as you mentioned, it's just a TON of time to grind up that most ratings boosters won't want to put into the character to sell.
---
So time will tell.
---
Good things take time.
---
How is there no end in sight?  They said it will be out this summer.  You've waited 13 or so years already if you played original Vanilla, what''s another few months ?
---
Were all a little dumber for trying
---
Most of my pvp in classic, was fighting over instance and raid chokepoints.
---
Path leading to BWL, doors entering Blackrock Mountain.
---
They were amazing chokepoints to fight people, and get swarms of hk's in moments.
---
If we are to be on 1.12, we should have "honorless target" debuff when you land from a flightpath. Meaning you are worth 0 honor for quite some time after you land.
---
As such not worthwhile to camp.
---
Yeah that’s what I was thinking. Atiesh had armor as well didn’t it? I remember dreaming of it back in the day.
---
That’s why I refuse to play on a private server. You burnt yourself out and ruined all that nostalgia and hype
---
Watching my brother raid Kara is what peaked my interest in WoW. At this point he had his own apartment and went to stay the night and hang. I just watched him tank all night and when I finally got my own account I rolled Warrior so I could be a bad ass taking hits from the boss nobody else could. 
---
I much prefer healing now since the rotation is less defined. I find it more engaging. But yeah, watching big brother play is what got me into it. 
---
Also I always forced to play as Luigi growing up so he’s my default choice when playing Mario related games. It just doesn’t feel right otherwise.
---
Jojo's bizarre adventure
---
Demons are immortal, when you kill them they just reform in the twisting nether, so really you're not "sacrificing" it so much as sending it home. The truly cruel thing is ripping it from its dimensional plane in the first place.
---
*picks bone furiously*
---
Tanking wasn't a mystery back in Vanilla either nor was it hard to undertand, you hit the things with the buttons that say "generate additional aggro" and use your taunt button liberally when things stop hitting you and start hitting things that aren't you. Sure we have a better understand now, but we had a pretty decent understand back then too.
---
simply apply for welfare and play every class like a true gamer would
---
White wolf from AV!  I can't believe nobody else has posted it yet.  When it first went live it had some insanely fast run speed, and sprint or dash or whatever stacked with it...  i think it was like 400% run speed.  Eyes of the beast on my old buddy Ubu was something amazing.  I used to pull baron geddon into garr's room with my turbopup.  That was fun.  I remember farming elemental fires at the circle of west binding...  I'd set ubu in the middle of the circle, on aggresive.  as soon as an elemental would spawn he'd be on it.  nobody else could farm that spot while i was there.  pve server, so nothing anybody could do lol.
---
Cenarion Hold is my default.  It's vital for the Black Lotus world lap and will be the hub of activity when AQ is the current raid.
---
I hate downvoting. I did consider reporting the thread, but didn't as you say below me, it's not against the rules so I didn't. I figured mods would notice soon enough
---
He’s not wrong tho. Does it really take two years to release a game that’s already made? I get that they have updates and whatnot to do and the developers that are on it are working hard but I’m guessing it’s a small team and not a priority to blizz as a company
---
Guild characters are capped at 24. Keep that in mind, some of these are longer
---
Then don't heal. Be a feral tank and cat dps. Tanks are always needed in 5 mans. And ferals make great off tanks in raids. Cat dps is also good in 5 mans, and if powershifting is decent in raids too
---
some ideas: add an option to remove BOEs, add option to remove if drop chance is less than x%, add alternate view screen that functions like a shopping list (sort by dungeon, then by boss) so I can see which dungeon has the most bang for my buck,add option to shop for multiple sets at once (ex I want to see tank and fury war bis all at once, by dungeon, by boss), add option to show 2nd/3rd best items ( in addition to bis).
---
Deicide
---
We all set our HS to kargath, as normally did ony 1st then HS.
---
Then once AQ, opened, I personally set to Booty bay. As then could just fly to slithus, or pop on boat then fly up from stv to do mc or bwl. 
---
Once naxx came came I think we all had it set to EPL Inn, I think, as mc /bwl/ ony was on optional Sunday lunch raid, and aq 40 we did Sunday night, then the other 4 nights we raided was in there.... Wiping alot. 
---
I was also druid and engineer, so had moon glade teleport and everlook transporter to get close to org.
---
Might as well wait for AskMrRobot to update for classic. It'll happen for sure.
---
&lt;I Wish I Was Horde&gt;
---
I like tournaments and all but doing at at phase7 means it will just be a bunch of naxx geared players and pvp at that phase is terrible. There's a reason these tournaments do it around mc/bwl gear.
---
why not?
---
I remember my friend telling me I had to tell him "ding!" when I gained a level.
---
I asked him why, but he said "just do it, everyone does it."
---
Still don't know why
---
Fun math.
---
If you level 58 - 60 entirely while doing this rep grind.
---
- Level 58, you'll only have Frostsaber Provisions available. This asks you to get 5 bear meat and 5 chimera meat. If there's a 50% drop rate, and you grind the bears and chimeras near the quest giver, you'll kill 10 bears and 10 chimeras. At 335xp each (58 killing 58 mob) you'll get 50 rep and 6,700xp per circuit.
---
- Level 58 needs 202,300xp to level, so 30.19 turnins to get you there, which also gives the 1,500 rep needed to unlock the second quest.
---
- Level 59, you'll keep grinding the 10 bears and 10 chimeras, but at 320xp per now that you've dinged. You'll also run a bit south and kill 5 Winterfall Shaman and 5 Winterfall Ursas at ~290xp per.
---
- You'll now get 9,300xp and 100 rep per circuit.
---
- With 209,800xp needed to level, it'll take 22.6 circuits to level, during which  time you'll get 2300xp.
---
So grinding these 2 quests (sadly no xp for quest turn in) you'll gain 3,800 rep on your way to 60.
---
You're now 800 rep into Friendly, 9% of the way there. Only 38,800 rep to go.
---
If you have a primary goal to farm the cat... it's not a bad way to go, if you're that far ahead of the pack, and can't group to farm BIS... 58-60 for a poopsock leveler might take 8 hours. If you do it in double that, but you're now 10% done? Ain't a bad way to go.
---
&gt; how druids heal in raids - it seems druids are also really usesful as off tanks.
---
Mostly healing touch spamming, specifically rank 4. Reason behind this is it is most mana efficient and healing coefficient effective. (There's a lot of math behind it but that's pretty much what happens)
---
Rejuvenation and Regrowth are used sparingly as they are so much mana to cast, generally downranking is advised slightly depending on the fight. In 5-mans using HT4 and max rank regrowth/rejuve is fine. If you really need to crank out a big heal continuously, and don't care about mana, regrowth spam. There's a talent which increases the crit chance, so spamming it will be your emergency go-to.
---
As mentioned, you are a raid healer. You may be called to help out on tank healing, (such as on the rag fight) but generally you are focused on everyone around you.
---
As for the offtank question, absolutely. Druids are victims of crushing blows, which increases the damage taken for druids, which makes them less viable as main tanks (as bosses hit REALLY REALLY hard), and it can drain healers having to deal with crushing blows consistently. But as an offtank, not needing to worry about it  as much. I have tanked quite a few bosses in Classic, quite often in ZG I was thrown in with just one prot warrior to speed things along more.
---
As for the DPS question feral vs rogue, feral is a complex animal. Due to the fact you have to manage your mana for power shifting, as well as managing your mana, trying to keep your bleeds up (rake / rip), and faerie fire. But with that said, can be rewarding as well.
---
I didn't play rogue that much, but from my rogue buddies they mostly tried to keep up rupture and slice and dice buff up.
---
Glad you are interested in the druid class, feel free to ask anything you want. There's tons of information out there, as well as many videos from back in the day.
---
And the druid secret gold making trick: moonglade vendor has the Arcanite Rod recipe and +70 armor enchant for enchanters. You can teleport and grab it and toss it on the AH for good profit! (I think I was making 15-20g easily every time per recipe. Costs me 4g for the rod, and 2g for the cloak enchant. Great time.
---
Good to know, forgot about it being capped.
---
I spend a tonne of time herbing and pvping in EPL so generally can find groups for it.
---
Yes, in my opinion the Tournaments can come much earlier! I really like competition. But I thought when I say phase 3 or 4 alot player would be angry because of nochanges
---
Thank you OP!
---
Well I was playing on a server that had been running AQ for months before I hit 60, so I was greatly undergeared by comparison. My vanilla memory is hazy, but I didnt pvp much on those warriors as I ended up playing a shaman which i ranked up with. I guess my main concern with playing a warrior is the lack of solo play when undergeared. I could definitely hold my own, but as soon as someone had better gear I fell flat. This is all quite subjective though, as I'm not the greatest player :p
---
Prebis dungeon gear is pretty strong on shaman honestly. As for raiding you pick up good ele gear especially if you ask specifically for it. But you can do fairly well without raid gear too.
---
&gt; Does it really take two years to release a game that’s already made?
---
you mean to port a game that has limited original data left onto a new infrastructure? Yes.

I'm going to level my gnome mage in the night elf zones to get a saber mount, so I'll be hearthing to Ironforge for a while to train skills periodically. After 20 it'll be to wherever I'm questing. Then I'll probably put it in Feralas at 60 when DM finally opens up for some farming. I'll also go the gnomish-&gt;goblin engineering path, so having a South Central mulgore point in Feralas will cover both continents pretty well.
---
To be honest I don’t think there is a difference, but since you asked I was born here in the states. My parents still endured great hardship while being in Cuba and we still have family members struggling to have a life over there.
---
Just don't play feral. Simply put it takes much more time investment. HOTW/swiftmend spec allows you to heal raids and perform in BGs.
---
That's TBC armor value that pservers are running and not all have fixed it. In vanilla/Classic, it will be 3425, not 3936.
---
And well if you want pvp a rogue can literally be naked and use a level 1 dagger and kill someone 1-1
---
I agree with the coordination. One for each type. Just so we know it will be populated.

The opinion of someone without impulse control and very little patience reflects the viewpoint of such a person but not of the average person. You'll find a few peers with your mentality but more normal people are content (though eager) to wait for a finished, optimal product.

If ever I've read a post from someone who I think needs mindfulness meditation more than you do I do not remember it.

What about the original data is limited? Obviously it’s not because there are fully functioning private servers...

Joanna never had to deal with mob tagging, multiple people competing with quests, and didn't do 4 days 20 hours straight. Look at the server runs, its barren.

P.S. test runs are useless because they have the wrong xp values for quests above level 30.

I mean I will probably hit lvl 60 by day 6 but I do know it will be longer than any of my speed runs in PS.

Been looking for something like this for weeks! Thanks op
